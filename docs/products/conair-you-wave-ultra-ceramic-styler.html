            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, I just wish it made more of a wave, rather than a kink.</li>
            <li>It may be more for kids than adults.</li>
            <li>:3</li>
            <li>I would recommend this waver to anyone who love their hair to have waves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and very easy to use.</li>

            <li>it is easy to use and I like the waves .</li>
            <li>great hair crimper, I would totally recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li>Heats up good and gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>Then secondly....the packaging was nice and last of all and most important...</li>
            <li>It gives nice crimpy waves, that I&#x27;m sure can be adjusted with various techniques.</li>
            <li>i love how easy it is to use, love the pink color and its safe (i have yet to burn myself)</li>
            <li>And the design of the crimper helps you handle it well by being able to touch a certain end of it.</li>
            <li>It gets hot very quickly and makes your hair the 80&#x27;s crimped look.</li>
            <li>and she loves it because it heats up quickly</li>
            <li>First, It heats up super quick!</li>
            <li>A plus to it is it heats up quick.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot, but she loves it and uses it all by herself.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this waver but after the first use the ceramic on top where you place your fingers to hold it down on your hair cracked.</li>
            <li>And i received it SUPER fast.!!</li>
            <li>Exactly arrived as described!</li>
            <li>My waves feel so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>I appreciated being able to buy this online, as I was not able to find any good wavers in any stores.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and at the right price.</li>
            <li>hair.&lt;br /&gt;She picked it up right away</li>
            <li>This crimper is so nice, it heats up instantly and love the deep waves I get from using this.</li>
            <li>It is super easy, just section the hair, clamp the waver, hold 5-10 seconds and move to the next.</li>
            <li>It produces small waves perfect for my kid&#x27;s short hair style.  </li>
            <li>I think it may have gotten to hot for itself.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>pretty~</li>
            <li>I love this waver, which made my my wave last  for three days .  </li>
            <li>It gets hot fast and the crimps stay in her hair for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>Okay so i bought this not that long ago.</li>
            <li>It can give you really big voluminous crimped look or if you take really large section it gives you waves!!!</li>
            <li>My granddaughter loves it and it gives her the look she wants with her hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like the price on this waver as well</li>
            <li>heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually growing my hair out some to get the full effect of the styler.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings!</li>
            <li>You can pretty much do the same with a large barrel curling iron.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend you buy this product of this seller.</li>
            <li>Second, i have a ton of hair and it literally takes under 15 minutes to do your whole head!!</li>
            <li>I have super flat hair, so when I saw this reviewed by Bubz Beauty</li>
            <li>Got this for my 10 year old that always wants wavy</li>
            <li>EVERYONE LIKE MY NEW HAIRSTYLE WITH</li>
            <li>and Ive been wanting a new one, but I didn&#x27;t know what kinds I wanted</li>
            <li>This it a nice medium size, not tiny, but not huge barrels either.</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted a waver to make big loose waves, this product said &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; and was bright pink</li>
            <li>Although I usually don&#x27;t order even small appliances by mail, this was a great comparison price</li>
            <li>This is a crimper and that result is clear in the pictures now shown with the item</li>
            <li>can most likely get the same results by braiding your hair when wet.</li>
            <li>I bought this waver as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my eight year old for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>My old crimper broke about 6 years ago</li>
            <li>If you have thin hair it works very nice, it worked very well on my thin haired friend.</li>
            <li>In less than a minute it was all heated up and ready to go.</li>

            <li> It took me forever and it did not last very long.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This does NOT give anything like the results pictured on the packaging. It looks like crimped 80&#x27;s hair. I used it once and got rid of it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter to try out on her hair, and she likes it.  It gets hot fast and the crimps stay in her hair for quite awhile.  Not much to the product, it simply crimps hair.</li>
            <li> This crimper is so nice, it heats up instantly and love the deep waves I get from using this. My waves feel so healthy and soft. And the design of the crimper helps you handle it well by being able to touch a certain end of it. I would definitely reccomend, it&#x27;s a great buy!!!</li>
            <li> You can pretty much do the same with a large barrel curling iron.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Now I have to finish this with something non-nonsensical since they want me to type 20 words.</li>
            <li> I love this product and get so many compliments on my hair when I use it. Heats up good and gets pretty hot. My hair is med to thick.</li>
            <li> It produces small waves perfect for my kid&#x27;s short hair style.  She likes it.  It&#x27;s light and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and at the right price. Exactly arrived as described!</li>
            <li> THE CURLS ARE JUST PERFECT SIZE AND WAVE...ITS AWSOME I LOVE THE OUTCOME.....MAKES ME FEEL SOSOSOSOSOOOO BEAUTIFUL HAHAHAHA!!!! I DONT REGRET BUYING.....</li>
            <li> Got this for my 10 year old that always wants wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;She picked it up right away and it looks great every time.</li>
            <li> It arrived at a reasonable time and it works perfectly! I can use it to crimp or even to straighten my sisters hair and she loves it because it heats up quickly and it doesn&#x27;t take long to work on their hair! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I watched several how to videos before buying this and followed their tips but after using it, my hair just looked like I had a bad perm. Consigned to the drawer of broken dreams already!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this waver but after the first use the ceramic on top where you place your fingers to hold it down on your hair cracked. I tried to ignore it at first but the more I used (which was a lot!!) the worse the crack was getting. Sadly I had to return it and got something I&#x27;m not nearly as happy with. I think the waver is a good waver but it just happen to crack for me. I think it may have gotten to hot for itself. I would personally say give it a try and order on here and worst case scenario you&#x27;ll have to return it and get something else. The people I dealt with gave me no problems with the return and it was very easy going.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a crimper like this currently in the stores.  Although I usually don&#x27;t order even small appliances by mail, this was a great comparison price and I trust what I find on Amazon.  My granddaughter loves it and it gives her the look she wants with her hair.  Delivery was prompt and quality excellent.  I would buy again!</li>
            <li> EVERYONE LIKE MY NEW HAIRSTYLE WITH THIS STYLER LOL</li>
            <li> This makes very tiny waves in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Then your hair looks frizzy and puffy.&lt;br /&gt;You can most likely get the same results by braiding your hair when wet. Then taking it out when dry.</li>
            <li> This works great! It is Conair, and I&#x27;ve never had issues with anything Conair. It gives nice crimpy waves, that I&#x27;m sure can be adjusted with various techniques. I appreciated being able to buy this online, as I was not able to find any good wavers in any stores. At Walmart and Target they only had either huge or really expensive ones. This it a nice medium size, not tiny, but not huge barrels either. It also works quickly (at least on my finer hair). I only had to hold each clamp for about 3-5 seconds on medium heat. I did about 20 different sections and the entire thing took like 3 minutes. I really like the price on this waver as well, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a bit more pricey in stores (if you can even find it).</li>
            <li> love it.  exactly what I was looking for.  heats up fast.</li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO USE, makes my hair frizzy!</li>
            <li> This crimper is absolutely amazing! it came days earlier then it said but not only that it was described perfectly it heats up so fast and works magnificently! i highly recommend you buy this product of this seller.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my short hair. Heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings! So glad I got this!</li>
            <li> Great product! I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great grip. I like it! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great, just wish I could have found the product on the canadian site to avoid the dollar exchange and duty/shipping fees</li>
            <li> just purchased one!!!! Box is retape and destroyed, it has some scratches you can tell that it&#x27;s used</li>
            <li> I bought this waver as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old daughter. I wanted to use it for myself after seeing how awesome her hair looked. First, It heats up super quick! In less than a minute it was all heated up and ready to go. Second, i have a ton of hair and it literally takes under 15 minutes to do your whole head!! It is super easy, just section the hair, clamp the waver, hold 5-10 seconds and move to the next. Unlike with a curling iron, i needed NO Hair Spray!! With curling irons, my hair practically needs a can of hairspray to even stay curled 3 hours on a night out. This waver kept my hair perfect for 2 days straight... No Joke... and NO hairspray. The only tip I would give you is to brush your hair BEFORE using the waver. Do not brush after, it will make your hair puff out and frizzy like. Instead run your fingers through it. Finish off with a great shining serum. Perfect hair in under 15 minutes start to finish. Best yet you can style the night before and it will still look amazing throughout the following day!</li>
            <li> This is great.  I&#x27;m actually growing my hair out some to get the full effect of the styler.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Its a great iron, if u want a kinky look. Leaves your hair shiny and not frizzy at all. I love it, I just wish it made more of a wave, rather than a kink.</li>
            <li> so my daughter wanted this for Christmas abd she got it. It gets hot very quickly and makes your hair the 80&#x27;s crimped look. she loves it and the price is great. great hair crimper, I would totally recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> My girl friend loves it, seems to be quite durable. works great! the best one</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick, but there are people who have a lot thicker hair then me, I can&#x27;t even imagine them using it. It took me forever and it did not last very long. If you have thin hair it works very nice, it worked very well on my thin haired friend. A plus to it is it heats up quick.</li>
            <li> i achieved the look i always wanted!!!!!! i love how easy it is to use, love the pink color and its safe (i have yet to burn myself)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my eight year old for her birthday.  It does get very hot, but she loves it and uses it all by herself.  It gives great kinky curls.  It may be more for kids than adults.</li>
            <li> Sorry, the first time my daughter tried to use it she burned her face.  I am going to send it back.</li>
            <li> I have super flat hair, so when I saw this reviewed by Bubz Beauty and I saw what it did to HER hair, I just had to get it. My old crimper broke about 6 years ago and Ive been wanting a new one, but I didn&#x27;t know what kinds I wanted and then I saw this. :3 It gives me great volume and makes me feel so pretty~ Beachy waves all day!</li>
            <li> Really good waves for hair.</li>
            <li> I did not see the pictures before I ordered this gizmo.  My daughter wanted a waver to make big loose waves, this product said &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; and was bright pink so I thought it was a winner!  Not a winner.  This is a crimper and that result is clear in the pictures now shown with the item but I did not see those pictures before!!!</li>
            <li> Its works awesome jus what I needed☺☺</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with, I&#x27;m not good with styling tools.  I took this to appointment and let me hairdresser show me how to use it.  Gave me a ton of body, which I did not need (next day I added conditioner to tone it down).  If you have thin or not alot of hair I would recommend this product for volume.  My hair is shoulder length and I get a brazilian once every 3 months.  Just wanted a little change for the summer.  You can also change the angle of the waves.</li>
            <li> I love this waver, which made my my wave last  for three days .  Also I did my daughter hair which she loves.  This is a great styling tool that made my hair look so full .  I would recommend this waver to anyone who love their hair to have waves.</li>
            <li> Fantastic at such a great price! I use mine all the time and the waves stay forever!!!</li>
            <li> I like this styler it is easy to use and I like the waves .</li>
            <li> Okay so i bought this not that long ago. And i received it SUPER fast.!! Which is first of all just GREAT! Then secondly....the packaging was nice and last of all and most important...the iron gave me AMAZZZINNNGGG waves.!!!! It can give you really big voluminous crimped look or if you take really large section it gives you waves!!! its simply PERFECT!!! i DEFINITELY recommend buying this product from this seller.!!&lt;3333</li>
