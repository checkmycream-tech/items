            <li>nice brush</li>
            <li>I liked everything else about it</li>
            <li>BUT....I am adding this item to my growing list of really good products, like my favorite bra, that have been discontinued</li>
            <li>This medium-brown color is perfect and the brush really helps fight clumping.</li>
            <li>I have very fine lashes and this mascara does not make my eyelashes fall out.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love how it goes on without clumping.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Since it is waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t run all over my face like so many mascaras on the market.  </li>
            <li>probably even more.  </li>
            <li>, I guess because the companies decided they had to be innovative or creative, or whatever</li>
            <li>I have not been able to locate the correct color ANYWHERE</li>
            <li>and I was pleased to find it here.</li>
            <li>This is the best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve used (one of MANY I&#x27;ve tried, especially since not being able to find this in stores any more), can&#x27;t imagine people not buying it, but why else discontinue it?  </li>
            <li>I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Because this is my favorite brand and style of mascara.  </li>
            <li>so I was extremely glad to be able to locate product at Amazon.</li>
            <li>The mascara is okay, it does smudge.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love the fat brush</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m grateful to be able to order it online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays on most of the day.</li>
            <li>Most mascara makes my eyes itch</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for many years.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;waterproof-ness\\&quot; will get you through a rainstorm or a wedding or a sweaty summer day but in my experience it will not hold up to more than an hour in the pool, so</li>
            <li>perhaps \\&quot;water-resistant\\&quot; might be a better description.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I am still able to get &amp;</li>
            <li>Absolutely NO cons!&lt;br /&gt;Too perfect to criticize!</li>
            <li>&quot; even more, but this product makes them look more like I&#x27;ve been blessed with good natural lashes.</li>
            <li>It also smells slightly more chemical than the original non-waterproof.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to remove at night --</li>
            <li>It is waterproof but comes off easily with Paula&#x27;s choice cleanser.</li>
            <li>With all the good reviews, I was hoping I had found the best mascara, alas it was not the case.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>Great for red hair light skin complexions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly light and well textured.</li>
            <li>And free shipping?</li>
            <li>This mascara is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I hope it will continue to be available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful mascara that doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes stiff and brittle and fake-looking.  </li>
            <li>I read that this Maybelline Full n Soft was good about not smudging and decided to try&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and looks nice and natural all day.  </li>
            <li>First my favorite Maybelline brow liner is discontinued,</li>
            <li>Keep them in a separate bag between uses to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>Maybelline Full &#x27;</li>
            <li>Have used this for many years - it is really waterproof - does not run -</li>
            <li>bought this mascara at a local drugstore quite some time ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Maybelline Full</li>
            <li>I will caveat that by saying I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;super-long-lasting\\&quot; foundations - although it did remove that lip-stain stuff, and \\&quot;stain\\&quot; is a really good word for it because it definitely did not want to come off - or primer+concealer+foundation+powder, so your mileage may vary.)</li>
            <li>The color, brownish black, is beautiful.</li>
            <li>mascara does not clump, is not too heavy, and stays on good throughout the day!</li>
            <li>I am so happy to finally have my reliable Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara again.</li>
            <li>Excellent for people who don&#x27;t wear much makeup because it is a pretty subtle enhancement, but you don&#x27;t need to have naturally-fabulous lashes for a good result - mine are a bit scant and not very long, and I wear glasses</li>
            <li>The brownish black is perfect - most mascaras are black and too bold.  </li>
            <li>I have eyes that do not like most make up, but this one i had no trouble with.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Great to find brown black!</li>
            <li>Ya never know where they come from, right?</li>
            <li>It was the right color and consistancy for me and the brush applied just the right amount of mascara to my lashes.  </li>
            <li>rather cheapish mainstream/drugstore product seems to be all right when the fancy-schmancy stuff didn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m not going to complain, saving money does not break my heart.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>so I got extra tubes from this vendor, which he sent very quickly!</li>
            <li>Glad to have been able to find it via Amazon.com (and a little worried about</li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t go on to thick, looks fairly natural, and the brownish-black color is perfect!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find brown, natural-looking mascara in stores, so this product was a great find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am also able to find it at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any smudges - even in this hot humid weather.  </li>
            <li>The mascara does not seem to be waterproof and that is what I was really interested in.</li>
            <li>last long time, great tone and shade</li>
            <li>B006TFWQE8 MAC 204 Lash Brush]] which will last for many years if well cared for - or a bag of disposables - and not using the one on the cap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Full &#x27;N Soft mascara for years!</li>
            <li>When Maybelline discontinued the Brownish Black color, I tried many other mascaras, but none were as good as Full &#x27;N Soft.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with Maybelline Full &#x27;n Soft mascara.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof and doesn&#x27;t dry the lashes like so many waterproof mascaras.  </li>
            <li>but it is very light and not very build-able.</li>
            <li>so it might not hold an eyelash curl very well, but I don&#x27;t use an eyelash curler because I don&#x27;t like how curled lashes look on me, so I don&#x27;t know for certain.</li>
            <li>This product makes your own lashes look a little bit fuller, and darkens them if they&#x27;re lighter than the mascara color, and it stops there.</li>
            <li>It really brings out my eyes.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I really started taking note of the mascaras I used.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li>I think that gentle treatment of the lashes contributes to keeping them looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so much, when it was empty</li>
            <li>, I think it looks a bit more natural than the shiny look, but different strokes and all that.</li>
            <li>Over the years I sometimes try other \\&quot;magical</li>
            <li>None of the other mascaras worked for me and I was thankful that I was able to purchase this product through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve finally found a brand that doesn&#x27;t smudge, or flake, or doing anything besides stay on the eyelashes with a clean look.</li>
            <li>This mascara arrived quickly, in the original manufacturer&#x27;s packaging and cost fifty cents less than I used to pay at the store.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-eyelash are soft with first layer</li>
            <li>I have been using Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara for many years and as usual it did not dissappoint this time either.  </li>
            <li>I hope this seller keeps it in stock as this is my new go-to for mascara!</li>
            <li>It works better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I read reviews on this particular brand and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea why this particular</li>
            <li>Sometimes it makes my eyelashes too straight (my eyelashes are naturally curled), so I have to reach for an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Most mascaras make my eyes red and itchy and did so long before I got the ocular rosacea,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always too worried about spending money on more expensive brands when this works fine for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand the print ads out for the new mascaras.</li>
            <li>I took its brush and put it in my new mascara.</li>
            <li>It does not flake or smudge and is very soft on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy this exact mascara brand, brush type and shade all of the time at my local store.</li>
            <li>One brush for each eye, no double-dipping or \\&quot;pumping\\&quot; the brush in the tube (twirl it instead), and wash with hot water and soap or a commercial brush cleaner after every use.</li>
            <li>It easily separates all my lashes and keeps them looking fluffy.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily, yet stays on without smudging or smearing through a 15 hour day of heavy work.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy without the mess, even in doing my bottom eye lashes no mess.  </li>
            <li>NOT hard to find these days, apparently the natural look is O-U-T!</li>
            <li>The mascara does not clump up - the lashes stay soft and not stiff.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>N Soft Waterproof Mascara will not leave you at the end of the day with raccoon eyes either.</li>
            <li>&#x27;N Soft.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was old and yellowed.</li>
            <li>Leaves my lashes soft, no clumps, and no flakes.</li>
            <li>and it looks natural</li>
            <li>Overall really like the color and the look of my lashes so</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t wear mascara very often, you can drastically increase its usable lifespan by spending some extra money on two good-quality mascara brushes like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I like Full &#x27;N Soft because it is not gloppy and heavy but leaves your lashes looking natural.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned red-head, so dark eye makeup doesn&#x27;t really work for me...</li>
            <li>Full N&#x27; Soft does not make my eyelashes heavy.</li>
            <li>The Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara goes on smoothly, no clumping.  </li>
            <li>I also love the brownish black color which seems to be getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras, but always come back to Maybelline Full</li>
            <li>It does take about 3 applications to get really thick-looking lashes, but worth the few extra minutes.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find this color in any of the big box stores or drugstores as of late</li>
            <li>this mascara its super easy to use and its a waterproof you can cry as much you can and won&#x27;t make you look ugly</li>
            <li>A still-sealed mascara is good for at least two years after the date on the package, and a few sites I checked said longer.</li>
            <li>If you are interested read the reviews on other brands to see what you find.</li>
            <li>The brownish black color looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li>Full n soft will possibly always be my favorite mascara, I tried at least 12 different mascaras this past year</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, certain it was a gimmick, but it really does take every trace of makeup off my face, including waterproof eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li>black is easy to find, which is too dark for me.</li>
            <li>Though if i&#x27;m going for a more dramatic look I will sometimes put another mascara over it.</li>
            <li>Never dry or clumpy.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to wipe the neck of the tube before tightly screwing the cap on These were instructions from an opthalmologist who agreed with me that it was a ludicrous waste of money to throw out mascara after three or four months, as is often recommended, if you only use it once or twice a month...</li>
            <li>Some people keep their mascara in the fridge so it will last longer, but mascaras with a high wax content, such as many waterproof/water-resistant products and especially \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones, can harden and become unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemed silly to me to write a completely different review for the same product with multiple listings, so no, you&#x27;re not having deja vu all over again.</li>
            <li>The mascara was old and dry.</li>

            <li> With all the good reviews, I was hoping I had found the best mascara, alas it was not the case.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> Great for red hair light skin complexions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly light and well textured.</li>
            <li> And free shipping?</li>
            <li> This mascara is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I hope it will continue to be available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful mascara that doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes stiff and brittle and fake-looking.  </li>
            <li> I read that this Maybelline Full n Soft was good about not smudging and decided to try&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and looks nice and natural all day.  </li>
            <li> First my favorite Maybelline brow liner is discontinued,</li>
            <li> Keep them in a separate bag between uses to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Full &#x27;</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years - it is really waterproof - does not run -</li>
            <li> bought this mascara at a local drugstore quite some time ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Maybelline Full</li>
            <li> I will caveat that by saying I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;super-long-lasting\\&quot; foundations - although it did remove that lip-stain stuff, and \\&quot;stain\\&quot; is a really good word for it because it definitely did not want to come off - or primer+concealer+foundation+powder, so your mileage may vary.)</li>
            <li> The color, brownish black, is beautiful.</li>
            <li> mascara does not clump, is not too heavy, and stays on good throughout the day!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to finally have my reliable Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara again.</li>
            <li> Excellent for people who don&#x27;t wear much makeup because it is a pretty subtle enhancement, but you don&#x27;t need to have naturally-fabulous lashes for a good result - mine are a bit scant and not very long, and I wear glasses</li>
            <li> The brownish black is perfect - most mascaras are black and too bold.  </li>
            <li> I have eyes that do not like most make up, but this one i had no trouble with.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Great to find brown black!</li>
            <li> Ya never know where they come from, right?</li>
            <li> It was the right color and consistancy for me and the brush applied just the right amount of mascara to my lashes.  </li>
            <li> rather cheapish mainstream/drugstore product seems to be all right when the fancy-schmancy stuff didn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m not going to complain, saving money does not break my heart.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> so I got extra tubes from this vendor, which he sent very quickly!</li>
            <li> Glad to have been able to find it via Amazon.com (and a little worried about</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t go on to thick, looks fairly natural, and the brownish-black color is perfect!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find brown, natural-looking mascara in stores, so this product was a great find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am also able to find it at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any smudges - even in this hot humid weather.  </li>
            <li> The mascara does not seem to be waterproof and that is what I was really interested in.</li>
            <li> last long time, great tone and shade</li>
            <li> B006TFWQE8 MAC 204 Lash Brush]] which will last for many years if well cared for - or a bag of disposables - and not using the one on the cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Full &#x27;N Soft mascara for years!</li>
            <li> When Maybelline discontinued the Brownish Black color, I tried many other mascaras, but none were as good as Full &#x27;N Soft.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with Maybelline Full &#x27;n Soft mascara.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof and doesn&#x27;t dry the lashes like so many waterproof mascaras.  </li>
            <li> but it is very light and not very build-able.</li>
            <li> so it might not hold an eyelash curl very well, but I don&#x27;t use an eyelash curler because I don&#x27;t like how curled lashes look on me, so I don&#x27;t know for certain.</li>
            <li> This product makes your own lashes look a little bit fuller, and darkens them if they&#x27;re lighter than the mascara color, and it stops there.</li>
            <li> It really brings out my eyes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I really started taking note of the mascaras I used.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> I think that gentle treatment of the lashes contributes to keeping them looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it so much, when it was empty</li>
            <li> , I think it looks a bit more natural than the shiny look, but different strokes and all that.</li>
            <li> Over the years I sometimes try other \\&quot;magical</li>
            <li> None of the other mascaras worked for me and I was thankful that I was able to purchase this product through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve finally found a brand that doesn&#x27;t smudge, or flake, or doing anything besides stay on the eyelashes with a clean look.</li>
            <li> This mascara arrived quickly, in the original manufacturer&#x27;s packaging and cost fifty cents less than I used to pay at the store.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-eyelash are soft with first layer</li>
            <li> I have been using Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara for many years and as usual it did not dissappoint this time either.  </li>
            <li> I hope this seller keeps it in stock as this is my new go-to for mascara!</li>
            <li> It works better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this particular brand and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea why this particular</li>
            <li> Sometimes it makes my eyelashes too straight (my eyelashes are naturally curled), so I have to reach for an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras make my eyes red and itchy and did so long before I got the ocular rosacea,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always too worried about spending money on more expensive brands when this works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the print ads out for the new mascaras.</li>
            <li> I took its brush and put it in my new mascara.</li>
            <li> It does not flake or smudge and is very soft on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this exact mascara brand, brush type and shade all of the time at my local store.</li>
            <li> One brush for each eye, no double-dipping or \\&quot;pumping\\&quot; the brush in the tube (twirl it instead), and wash with hot water and soap or a commercial brush cleaner after every use.</li>
            <li> It easily separates all my lashes and keeps them looking fluffy.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily, yet stays on without smudging or smearing through a 15 hour day of heavy work.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy without the mess, even in doing my bottom eye lashes no mess.  </li>
            <li> NOT hard to find these days, apparently the natural look is O-U-T!</li>
            <li> The mascara does not clump up - the lashes stay soft and not stiff.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> N Soft Waterproof Mascara will not leave you at the end of the day with raccoon eyes either.</li>
            <li> &#x27;N Soft.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was old and yellowed.</li>
            <li> Leaves my lashes soft, no clumps, and no flakes.</li>
            <li> and it looks natural</li>
            <li> Overall really like the color and the look of my lashes so</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wear mascara very often, you can drastically increase its usable lifespan by spending some extra money on two good-quality mascara brushes like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I like Full &#x27;N Soft because it is not gloppy and heavy but leaves your lashes looking natural.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned red-head, so dark eye makeup doesn&#x27;t really work for me...</li>
            <li> Full N&#x27; Soft does not make my eyelashes heavy.</li>
            <li> The Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara goes on smoothly, no clumping.  </li>
            <li> I also love the brownish black color which seems to be getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras, but always come back to Maybelline Full</li>
            <li> It does take about 3 applications to get really thick-looking lashes, but worth the few extra minutes.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find this color in any of the big box stores or drugstores as of late</li>
            <li> this mascara its super easy to use and its a waterproof you can cry as much you can and won&#x27;t make you look ugly</li>
            <li> A still-sealed mascara is good for at least two years after the date on the package, and a few sites I checked said longer.</li>
            <li> If you are interested read the reviews on other brands to see what you find.</li>
            <li> The brownish black color looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li> Full n soft will possibly always be my favorite mascara, I tried at least 12 different mascaras this past year</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, certain it was a gimmick, but it really does take every trace of makeup off my face, including waterproof eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li> black is easy to find, which is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Though if i&#x27;m going for a more dramatic look I will sometimes put another mascara over it.</li>
            <li> Never dry or clumpy.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to wipe the neck of the tube before tightly screwing the cap on These were instructions from an opthalmologist who agreed with me that it was a ludicrous waste of money to throw out mascara after three or four months, as is often recommended, if you only use it once or twice a month...</li>
            <li> Some people keep their mascara in the fridge so it will last longer, but mascaras with a high wax content, such as many waterproof/water-resistant products and especially \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones, can harden and become unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemed silly to me to write a completely different review for the same product with multiple listings, so no, you&#x27;re not having deja vu all over again.</li>
            <li> The mascara was old and dry.</li>
            <li> &#x27;n Soft isn&#x27;t for everyone because it is not in any way a mascara for people who want HUGE DRAMATIC SUPER-THICK MILE-LONG MEGA-LASHES - there are plenty of other brands for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that only &amp;#34;Very Black&amp;#34; is available in stores now.  </li>
            <li> have ocular rosacea, which causes bloodshot, gritty, alternately-dry-and-watery (for me that is, some people with it have dry eyes all the time), and hypersensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> It does nothing for the length of your lashes, it certainly does not make mine full:(  Overall</li>
            <li> It has been around a long time and it&#x27;s one of those tried and true-type of products.</li>
            <li> It CAN get clumpy if you put on several coats, but if you want that look this really is not the mascara for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried other waterproof mascaras only to have flaking during the day</li>
            <li> The formula is overly dry.</li>
            <li> The whole &#x27;special properties&#x27; idea to me was stupid.</li>
            <li> Water-resistance is important to me because my eyes are often watery from sun, wind, cold air, hay fever or artificial-tears</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time with the colors looking too fake because I am a very light blonde.</li>
            <li> ---it is not a smart move.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently the Brownish Black color has been discontinued (a lot of companies are ditching the browns and only making black, which ticks me off!), so stock up!</li>
            <li> I was not able to use to because it arrived completely dry.</li>
            <li> You have to go waterproof if you expect the black to stay where you put it.</li>
            <li> THERE ARE NO RETAIL STORES THAT SELL BROWNISH BLACK IN THIS TYPE!&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason you can&#x27;t find the Brownish Black color in stores anymore</li>
            <li> When I ran out, I kept looking for it, but all anybody carried was the black, and I couldn&#x27;t find the brownish black that I needed.  </li>
            <li> If my lashes are stiffened with a heavy mascara they come in contact with my eyeglass lenses, which is a lot more annoying than it sounds.</li>
            <li> (by the way, \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; just means \\&quot;_less</li>
            <li> It does have a slightly matte finish, rather than the glossy finish some waterproof mascaras have.</li>
            <li> My lashes feel just as stiff as with other mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, you don&#x27;t need makeup remover or scrubbing to get it off, plain soap/cleanser and water will do it, or those cleansing towelettes, as will the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> After one hour in humid weather it was a mess.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the product might be stale or old and clump but product was perfectly fresh.</li>
            <li> become  in little  grumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few all-natural mascaras that didn&#x27;t make my eyes look like the morning after the night before, but they clumped or smeared or were insufficiently water-resistant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just my usual go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> Wife complained the mascara was dried up.</li>
            <li> So I am not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> After a period of time, I was unable to find the &amp;#34;brownish black&amp;#34; in any local stores.  </li>
            <li> After a few years, my eyelids started feeling heavy and tired.</li>
            <li> Every time I try something different, I hate it and always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I can at least I can find the color I want.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I have used this mascara for at least 10 years...</li>
            <li> How could one mascara make your lashes thick, clumpy, separated, or voluminous?</li>
            <li> so i was forced to buy a darker color.</li>
            <li> Go to mascara for YEARS, even though all my other makeup products are expensive brands.</li>
            <li> After all the rave reviews I was so disappointed to give this a try only to find at the end of the day smudges and flakes under the eyes giving me that worn out, raccoon eyed expression.</li>
            <li> It is just very hard to find the Black-Brown color, which I like --</li>
            <li> Plus, I am usually a bit afraid to buy makeup and personal-type items on the internet.</li>
            <li> Silly.  </li>
            <li> and it is unfortunate they have discontinued it in brownish-black.</li>
            <li> even expensive ones touted as \\&quot;non-allergenic\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> If it smells bad or the texture is off, throw it away.</li>
            <li> , disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very fine lashes and this mascara does not make my eyelashes fall out.  I have tried others but the price, quality and look keep me coming back.  Thank you Mabelline!</li>
            <li> I like Full &#x27;N Soft because it is not gloppy and heavy but leaves your lashes looking natural.  When Maybelline discontinued the Brownish Black color, I tried many other mascaras, but none were as good as Full &#x27;N Soft. I&#x27;m sorry that only &amp;#34;Very Black&amp;#34; is available in stores now.  Fortunately, I am still able to get &amp;#34;Brownish Black&amp;#34; through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-very nice brush&lt;br /&gt;-eyelash are soft with first layer&lt;br /&gt;-does not clump&lt;br /&gt;-good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-eyelashes get crunchier with each added layer&lt;br /&gt;-waterproof formula still smudges&lt;br /&gt;-not that impressive with lengthening or volumizing&lt;br /&gt;-would not repurchase</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It has been around a long time and it&#x27;s one of those tried and true-type of products. \\&quot;Full and Soft\\&quot; is the perfect description. Doesn&#x27;t clump and leave your lashes looking all spikey. I can&#x27;t stand the print ads out for the new mascaras. Who would want lashes that look like that anyway?</li>
            <li> When you pull the wand out and it&#x27;s all goopy - this isn&#x27;t what your using.  Goes on easy without the mess, even in doing my bottom eye lashes no mess.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is probably one of my favorite mascaras ever! The brush is incredible! It easily separates all my lashes and keeps them looking fluffy. The color, brownish black, is beautiful. It really brings out my eyes. *bats eyelashes* So anyway that brush, wow. I love it so much, when it was empty I took its brush and put it in my new mascara. Absolutely NO cons!&lt;br /&gt;Too perfect to criticize!</li>
            <li> Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara will not leave you at the end of the day with raccoon eyes either. You have to go waterproof if you expect the black to stay where you put it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras, but always come back to Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft.  Love how it goes on without clumping.</li>
            <li> I wish this color was not discontinued by Maybelline. It is the best one I have ever used and love the fact that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> The mascara does not clump up - the lashes stay soft and not stiff.  The brownish black is perfect - most mascaras are black and too bold.  Have used this for many years - it is really waterproof - does not run - but it still can be removed at nighttime with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I can at least I can find the color I want.  I don&#x27;t understand why stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it goes on without clumping, and stays on no matter what! The brownish black color looks pretty natural. I usually have a hard time with the colors looking too fake because I am a very light blonde. Over the years I sometimes try other \\&quot;magical mascaras\\&quot;, but ALWAYS come back to this one. My local department store stopped stocking the color I like so I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to order it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I tried to cancel this because it is way overpriced.</li>
            <li> This mascara was not waterproof at all! After one hour in humid weather it was a mess. I liked everything else about it but if its not waterproof there is no point in wearing it.</li>
            <li> The packaging was old and yellowed. The mascara was old and dry. It came out in clumps. I threw it away</li>
            <li> No smudges!  No clumps! Nice! Great for red hair light skin complexions.</li>
            <li> Great to find brown black!</li>
            <li> When I started using mascara, I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between mascaras. The whole &#x27;special properties&#x27; idea to me was stupid. How could one mascara make your lashes thick, clumpy, separated, or voluminous? After a few years, my eyelids started feeling heavy and tired. That&#x27;s when I really started taking note of the mascaras I used. Full N&#x27; Soft does not make my eyelashes heavy. It&#x27;s incredibly light and well textured. It separates each of my eyelashes and never clumps. Sometimes it makes my eyelashes too straight (my eyelashes are naturally curled), so I have to reach for an eyelash curler. At times it looks voluminous, then sometimes not. It&#x27;s just my usual go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> Go to mascara for YEARS, even though all my other makeup products are expensive brands. I&#x27;m always too worried about spending money on more expensive brands when this works fine for me. I am also able to find it at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  It is waterproof and doesn&#x27;t dry the lashes like so many waterproof mascaras.  Since it is waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t run all over my face like so many mascaras on the market.  It is also easy to remove at night -- I just use the cleansing cream that I use to cleanse my face at night to remove this mascara.  Please, Maybelline, do not discontinue this marcara or try to improve on it.  It is great the way that it is.  It is just very hard to find the Black-Brown color, which I like -- black is easy to find, which is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Maybelline, what are you thinking?  First my favorite Maybelline brow liner is discontinued, now the best waterproof mascara I have ever used is no longer available.  The Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara goes on smoothly, no clumping.  Washes off easily, yet stays on without smudging or smearing through a 15 hour day of heavy work.  Love this mascara!  Maybelline, please reinstate this product.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest mascara EVER!  I will continue to seek out every last tube until it is gone!  Especially the waterproof!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I have used this mascara for at least 10 years...probably even more.  It is THE best waterproof mascara that I&#x27;ve ever found, and I&#x27;ve tried many.....even the newest types.  This mascara doesn&#x27;t go on to thick, looks fairly natural, and the brownish-black color is perfect!  BUT....I am adding this item to my growing list of really good products, like my favorite bra, that have been discontinued, I guess because the companies decided they had to be innovative or creative, or whatever---it is not a smart move.  Maybelline:  Are you listening? Re-package, change the tube color, etc., but please, please put this stuff back into production.  Meantime, TUVM , Amazon, for connecting me to a supplier that still has it as I don&#x27;t think it can be found in retail stores anymore.  Shame on you, Maybelline!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful mascara that doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes stiff and brittle and fake-looking.  It&#x27;s hard to find brown, natural-looking mascara in stores, so this product was a great find on Amazon.  It does take about 3 applications to get really thick-looking lashes, but worth the few extra minutes.</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely adds length and thickness but I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d describe it as \\&quot;soft\\&quot;. My lashes feel just as stiff as with other mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li> Best price for this product...and I can find the correct color. I have not been able to locate the correct color ANYWHERE and I was pleased to find it here. It works better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Wife complained the mascara was dried up.</li>
            <li> Dunno why they take &#x27;the good stuff&#x27; off the shelves.  This is the best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve used (one of MANY I&#x27;ve tried, especially since not being able to find this in stores any more), can&#x27;t imagine people not buying it, but why else discontinue it?  Silly.  Glad to have been able to find it via Amazon.com (and a little worried about when I can&#x27;t any more…sigh…).</li>
            <li> I AM SO GLAD YOU HAD THIS!  I LOVE IT!! IT IS THE ONLY MASCARA THAT DOESN&#x27;T BURN MY EYES!  THERE ARE NO RETAIL STORES THAT SELL BROWNISH BLACK IN THIS TYPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I think the title says it all. This is the best mascara out there and it is unfortunate they have discontinued it in brownish-black. Get it while it lasts</li>
            <li> I was afraid the product might be stale or old and clump but product was perfectly fresh. Yay!  Because this is my favorite brand and style of mascara.  I have not been able to find this color in any of the big box stores or drugstores as of late so I was extremely glad to be able to locate product at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had been using another Maybelline mascara for years.  It was discontinued.  I read reviews on this particular brand and decided to give it a try.  It does not flake or smudge and is very soft on my eyelashes.  I also love the brownish black color which seems to be getting harder to find.  I would highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> With all the good reviews, I was hoping I had found the best mascara, alas it was not the case.  The mascara is okay, it does smudge.  It does nothing for the length of your lashes, it certainly does not make mine full:(  Overall, disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this exact mascara brand, brush type and shade all of the time at my local store. Then they stopped carrying it so i was forced to buy a darker color. I am very fair-skinned red-head, so dark eye makeup doesn&#x27;t really work for me...I can&#x27;t say I can pull off the &#x27;goth&#x27; look. This medium-brown color is perfect and the brush really helps fight clumping. I hope this seller keeps it in stock as this is my new go-to for mascara! Plus, I am usually a bit afraid to buy makeup and personal-type items on the internet. Ya never know where they come from, right? Wrong! This mascara arrived quickly, in the original manufacturer&#x27;s packaging and cost fifty cents less than I used to pay at the store. And free shipping? Perfect!</li>
            <li> This Mascara is the best waterproof drugstore mascara ever, lengthens, doesn&#x27;t clump, separates,hold a curl, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge. Wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued the Brownish/Black.</li>
            <li> After all the rave reviews I was so disappointed to give this a try only to find at the end of the day smudges and flakes under the eyes giving me that worn out, raccoon eyed expression. Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve finally found a brand that doesn&#x27;t smudge, or flake, or doing anything besides stay on the eyelashes with a clean look. If you are interested read the reviews on other brands to see what you find.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. Leaves my lashes soft, no clumps, and no flakes. Though if i&#x27;m going for a more dramatic look I will sometimes put another mascara over it.</li>
            <li> Its just mascara..and for the price what would you expect. It works okay but it is very light and not very build-able. The formula is overly dry. i would not buy again</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and always get under-eye smudges from mascara.  It frustrates me when they offer&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;water proof\\&quot; and claim it won&#x27;t come off until you take it off  (or something along those lines)&lt;br /&gt;because water and oil are two different things and oily skin will still cause smudges with water proof&lt;br /&gt;products.  I read that this Maybelline Full n Soft was good about not smudging and decided to try&lt;br /&gt;it (I couldn&#x27;t beat the price!)&lt;br /&gt;It works great and I haven&#x27;t had any smudges - even in this hot humid weather.  I love the fat brush&lt;br /&gt;and the way it applies.  Try it if you have oily skin and tend to get smudges.</li>
            <li> I have been using Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara for many years and as usual it did not dissappoint this time either.  I have tried other waterproof mascaras only to have flaking during the day and I despise that.  I could not find this mascara in any store in my area and since my friends rave about Amazon, I took a chance and it paid off wonderfully.  I am so happy to finally have my reliable Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Full &#x27;N Soft mascara for years! Every time I try something different, I hate it and always go back to this one. For some reason you can&#x27;t find the Brownish Black color in stores anymore so I&#x27;m grateful to be able to order it online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara does not clump, is not too heavy, and stays on good throughout the day!</li>
            <li> this mascara its super easy to use and its a waterproof you can cry as much you can and won&#x27;t make you look ugly etc i totally recommended</li>
            <li> The mascara does not seem to be waterproof and that is what I was really interested in.So I am not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money. I was not able to use to because it arrived completely dry.</li>
            <li> The best one for me. It last along the day  with out  become  in little  grumes.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and liked it very much.  It was the right color and consistancy for me and the brush applied just the right amount of mascara to my lashes.  After a period of time, I was unable to find the &amp;#34;brownish black&amp;#34; in any local stores.  None of the other mascaras worked for me and I was thankful that I was able to purchase this product through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone who asks for my opinion.</li>
            <li> I actually like this mascara.  It stays on most of the day. It is waterproof but comes off easily with Paula&#x27;s choice cleanser. Not as good as the L&#x27;Oreal Lashout which was the perfect mascara but has been discontinued (why do company&#x27;s discontinue perfect products that everyone loves!?!?!?).</li>
            <li> This is the perfect mascara for me, but have a terrible time finding the color I need..... I found it here and for a fair price</li>
            <li> Great mascara.  Never dry or clumpy.  Goes on nice and it lasts all day long.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local stores so I got extra tubes from this vendor, which he sent very quickly!</li>
            <li> Most mascara makes my eyes itch but this doesn&#x27;t and it looks natural so I don&#x27;t need to wear a ton of make up every time</li>
            <li> Full n soft will possibly always be my favorite mascara, I tried at least 12 different mascaras this past year and this is the only one I have repurchased. However, this is not entirely smudgeproof, AKA it will smudge if you take a nap or something. Wish this didn&#x27;t happen because I don&#x27;t even have oily lids or skin. It also smells slightly more chemical than the original non-waterproof. Overall really like the color and the look of my lashes so will keep buying.</li>
            <li> (David&#x27;s wife - David doesn&#x27;t wear mascara ;&gt;))&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mascara at a local drugstore quite some time ago and loved it.  When I ran out, I kept looking for it, but all anybody carried was the black, and I couldn&#x27;t find the brownish black that I needed.  This mascara is fantastic.  It goes on easily, and looks nice and natural all day.  This is a great color for blondes.  I hope it will continue to be available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have eyes that do not like most make up, but this one i had no trouble with.&lt;br /&gt;They last long time, great tone and shade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for many years. Every so often I&#x27;d try something else but I always came back to this one (although I do miss Almay&#x27;s long-gone lash tint). Maybelline Full &#x27;n Soft isn&#x27;t for everyone because it is not in any way a mascara for people who want HUGE DRAMATIC SUPER-THICK MILE-LONG MEGA-LASHES - there are plenty of other brands for that. NOT hard to find these days, apparently the natural look is O-U-T! This product makes your own lashes look a little bit fuller, and darkens them if they&#x27;re lighter than the mascara color, and it stops there. Excellent for people who don&#x27;t wear much makeup because it is a pretty subtle enhancement, but you don&#x27;t need to have naturally-fabulous lashes for a good result - mine are a bit scant and not very long, and I wear glasses so my lashes \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; even more, but this product makes them look more like I&#x27;ve been blessed with good natural lashes. (The thickening-lengthening-volumizing type mascaras look ludicrous on me.) It also doesn&#x27;t stiffen the lashes - that&#x27;s why they call it \\&quot;Soft\\&quot;, I suppose - so it might not hold an eyelash curl very well, but I don&#x27;t use an eyelash curler because I don&#x27;t like how curled lashes look on me, so I don&#x27;t know for certain. If my lashes are stiffened with a heavy mascara they come in contact with my eyeglass lenses, which is a lot more annoying than it sounds. It CAN get clumpy if you put on several coats, but if you want that look this really is not the mascara for you. One coat gets the job done and two is plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;waterproof-ness\\&quot; will get you through a rainstorm or a wedding or a sweaty summer day but in my experience it will not hold up to more than an hour in the pool, so perhaps \\&quot;water-resistant\\&quot; might be a better description. On the other hand, you don&#x27;t need makeup remover or scrubbing to get it off, plain soap/cleanser and water will do it, or those cleansing towelettes, as will the [[ASIN:B000FGS0RO Wonder Cloth Make-Up Remover]]. (Yes, that thingreally does work! I was skeptical at first, certain it was a gimmick, but it really does take every trace of makeup off my face, including waterproof eyeliner and mascara. I will caveat that by saying I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;super-long-lasting\\&quot; foundations - although it did remove that lip-stain stuff, and \\&quot;stain\\&quot; is a really good word for it because it definitely did not want to come off - or primer+concealer+foundation+powder, so your mileage may vary.) I think that gentle treatment of the lashes contributes to keeping them looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ocular rosacea, which causes bloodshot, gritty, alternately-dry-and-watery (for me that is, some people with it have dry eyes all the time), and hypersensitive eyes. Most mascaras make my eyes red and itchy and did so long before I got the ocular rosacea, even expensive ones touted as \\&quot;non-allergenic\\&quot; (by the way, \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; just means \\&quot;_less likely_ to cause allergic reactions\\&quot;, not \\&quot;will not\\&quot;), but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with Maybelline Full &#x27;n Soft mascara. I have no idea why this particular rather cheapish mainstream/drugstore product seems to be all right when the fancy-schmancy stuff didn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m not going to complain, saving money does not break my heart. I&#x27;ve tried a few all-natural mascaras that didn&#x27;t make my eyes look like the morning after the night before, but they clumped or smeared or were insufficiently water-resistant. Water-resistance is important to me because my eyes are often watery from sun, wind, cold air, hay fever or artificial-tears eyedrops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a problem with flaking, \\&quot;mascara dust\\&quot; below the eye, transfer (I&#x27;ve even fallen asleep with it on - whoops! - and had no mascara smudges on my pillow in the morning) or fading. It does have a slightly matte finish, rather than the glossy finish some waterproof mascaras have. I happen to like that, I think it looks a bit more natural than the shiny look, but different strokes and all that. That&#x27;s not to say thatthose things didn&#x27;t happen to the reviewers who mentioned them, I&#x27;m just adding my experience. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the Brownish Black color has been discontinued (a lot of companies are ditching the browns and only making black, which ticks me off!), so stock up! A still-sealed mascara is good for at least two years after the date on the package, and a few sites I checked said longer. If it smells bad or the texture is off, throw it away. If you don&#x27;t wear mascara very often, you can drastically increase its usable lifespan by spending some extra money on two good-quality mascara brushes like [[ASIN:B006TFWQE8 MAC 204 Lash Brush]] which will last for many years if well cared for - or a bag of disposables - and not using the one on the cap. One brush for each eye, no double-dipping or \\&quot;pumping\\&quot; the brush in the tube (twirl it instead), and wash with hot water and soap or a commercial brush cleaner after every use. Keep them in a separate bag between uses to keep them clean. Make sure to wipe the neck of the tube before tightly screwing the cap on These were instructions from an opthalmologist who agreed with me that it was a ludicrous waste of money to throw out mascara after three or four months, as is often recommended, if you only use it once or twice a month... especially since he was recommending a mascara than cost something like $25 a tube! Some people keep their mascara in the fridge so it will last longer, but mascaras with a high wax content, such as many waterproof/water-resistant products and especially \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones, can harden and become unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemed silly to me to write a completely different review for the same product with multiple listings, so no, you&#x27;re not having deja vu all over again.</li>
