    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It is excellent and used in this family for three generations.</li>
            <li>Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Best brush I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been marvelous.</li>
            <li>Great purchase!</li>
            <li>This got great reviews and is a wonderful brush which does not pull my hair out.</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>
            <li>Nothing is as good as Isinis.  </li>
            <li>and honestly people have been asking what I&#x27;m doing differently because my hair looks great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a combination boar bristle/nylon hairbrush for years that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>Because of this I ordered this brush as the description says it is 100% boar bristles which would be better for her.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad I was able to find it online.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT ,IVE &#x27; USED ONE FOR OVER 20 YEARS</li>
            <li>Love the travel size, too.</li>
            <li>And, I love the way it feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li>It is a great brush for someone with my kind of long, fine, silky, easily-broken hair.</li>
            <li>But once detangled, this brush will give the hair bounce and shine and remove oil from greasy spots and help it smooth the unruly spots.  </li>
            <li>It is a great smoothing brush, though, and we all use it after using the wooden pin brush first.</li>
            <li>They are fantastic and very durable !</li>
            <li>okay, expected more</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare, but to me, it has been worth the money.</li>
            <li>I get less breakage, it feels good</li>
            <li>Exc. quality and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I wanted a slightly softer brush and I was not about to spend the kind of money Mason-Pearson is asking these days.</li>
            <li>This brush has made a difference in my fragile fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for stiffer bristles,these are much to flexable..</li>
            <li>do you have any much stiffer bristles?</li>
            <li>I have a 25-year old Mason-Pearson brush that has finally begun to show its age by refusing to come clean no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>I also find it more difficult to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>There are clearly nylon bristles in there.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost-especially on coarse, or dry, tangled hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For $50 it is also pretty shoddy quality considering one brush stroke and bristles start falling out.</li>
            <li> The brushes are much stiffer than the usual drugstore &amp;#34;boar hair&amp;#34; brush.  </li>
            <li> First boar bristle brush to go through my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I buy mine in Quebec, canada, and it is way less expensive, but if there would be no other way to buy one cheaper, I would most definitively pay 60$ for one of those.</li>
            <li> We all have thigh-length hair (1 curly, 2 straight) and our hair must be too thick for this type of brush.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately while I have extremely thick hair, my daughter has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I had bought one of these brushes years ago (15 plus years) and now it was done to the last few bristles.  </li>
            <li> It is not a detangler to speak of, and I still use the wet brush line or cricket brush for that.  </li>
            <li> Not PURE boar bristle.</li>
            <li> and it gets down to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I can wash my hair less, because the brush is helping it be less greasy at the scalp level by distributing the oils through the length.</li>
            <li> Less breakage, as well.</li>
            <li> I like the brush I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brush cannot penetrate my hair or my daughters&#x27; hair.  </li>

            <li> I was looking for stiffer bristles,these are much to flexable.. do you have any much stiffer bristles?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a combination boar bristle/nylon hairbrush for years that I absolutely love. Unfortunately while I have extremely thick hair, my daughter has very fine hair.  Because of this I ordered this brush as the description says it is 100% boar bristles which would be better for her.  When the brush arrived we opened the package only to find that there are no boar bristles at all, instead it is entirely synthetic. I&#x27;ll be returning it tomorrow. Save your time and money and don&#x27;t buy this brush.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted. I have a 25-year old Mason-Pearson brush that has finally begun to show its age by refusing to come clean no matter what I do. I wanted a slightly softer brush and I was not about to spend the kind of money Mason-Pearson is asking these days. This got great reviews and is a wonderful brush which does not pull my hair out. It is a great brush for someone with my kind of long, fine, silky, easily-broken hair. If you have thicker, harsher hair, you will want a stiffer brush. For me, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> another brush review? okay, expected more</li>
            <li> I had bought one of these brushes years ago (15 plus years) and now it was done to the last few bristles.  I was so glad I was able to find it online.  It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ,IVE &#x27; USED ONE FOR OVER 20 YEARS</li>
            <li> Great brush. I would never buy anything else again. I buy mine in Quebec, canada, and it is way less expensive, but if there would be no other way to buy one cheaper, I would most definitively pay 60$ for one of those. They are fantastic and very durable !</li>
            <li> Nothing is as good as Isinis.  The product is a 5 ... just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey!</li>
            <li> I like the brush I have thick hair and it gets down to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the same time that I purchased a wooden pin brush and a steel pin brush.  Unfortunately, this brush cannot penetrate my hair or my daughters&#x27; hair.  We all have thigh-length hair (1 curly, 2 straight) and our hair must be too thick for this type of brush.  It is a great smoothing brush, though, and we all use it after using the wooden pin brush first. I also find it more difficult to keep clean.  It is well made, though.</li>
            <li> I can not ever remember not owing this brush and now my granddaughter wanted me to find one for her. It is excellent and used in this family for three generations.</li>
            <li> This brush has made a difference in my fragile fine hair. I get less breakage, it feels good and honestly people have been asking what I&#x27;m doing differently because my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> Exc. quality and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many boar bristle brushes, including the insanely expensive Mason Pearson, but I never found one that could actually reach my scalp through my hair. This one does. It&#x27;s the one to buy.</li>
            <li> First boar bristle brush to go through my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not PURE boar bristle.There are clearly nylon bristles in there. For $50 it is also pretty shoddy quality considering one brush stroke and bristles start falling out.</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever owned! Well worth the cost-especially on coarse, or dry, tangled hair. Love the travel size, too.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended that I get a boar bristle brush, as I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out. It&#x27;s been marvelous. I use the brush before bed every night, and I can say that it is making a difference. I can wash my hair less, because the brush is helping it be less greasy at the scalp level by distributing the oils through the length. Less breakage, as well. And, I love the way it feels on my scalp. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to using this brush.  It is not a detangler to speak of, and I still use the wet brush line or cricket brush for that.  But once detangled, this brush will give the hair bounce and shine and remove oil from greasy spots and help it smooth the unruly spots.  The brushes are much stiffer than the usual drugstore &amp;#34;boar hair&amp;#34; brush.  I haven&#x27;t ever used a MP brush so I can&#x27;t compare, but to me, it has been worth the money.</li>
