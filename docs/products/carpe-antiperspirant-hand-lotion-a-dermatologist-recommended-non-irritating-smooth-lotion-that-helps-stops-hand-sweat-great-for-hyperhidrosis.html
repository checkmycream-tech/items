            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This product was brilliantly done!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Awesome job, I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve witnessed the incredibly thorough work the developers have put into this product.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>Great idea and great execution.</li>
            <li>Purchasing Carpe gave me the closest form of gratification I&#x27;ve experienced since the day I discovered flushable wipes.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Some of our employees at the warehouse tried it out in their day-to-day and reported Carpe to be very effective</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>, but for my golf friends out there, this is about as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li>I play golf and tennis around the campus and have loved using the lotion when I go out to play.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>My grip was slippery on the range by the end of the warm up, but no issues on the course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>After using this stuff a couple times, I was able to nix my cleaning cloth that I used to use to wipe the sweat away.  </li>
            <li>I need a couple more rounds with it (and maybe try one without it to compare), but it&#x27;s not a home run.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done the math on cost per use vs Arid, but it seems comparable on performance and better on convenience.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: follow the instructions!</li>
            <li>BIG win, Carpe!!</li>
            <li>With Carpe&#x27;, I don&#x27;t have to wipe my hands on my pants repeatedly, and I can hold on better and for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Something I noticed about Carpe was that it didn&#x27;t leave any residue on my screens, an uncharacteristic trait for most lotions.</li>
            <li>Thank you again Carpe :)</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing and keeps my hands sweat-free all day.</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Also love that it fits under the 3.4 ounce TSA limit (I usually only bring carry ons when I fly).</li>
            <li>Nothing is going to completely stop sweat in that heat (would that even be safe, biologically?), but for my golf friends out there, this is about as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li>I play a fair amount of golf and I live in North Carolina, so sweaty hands are a problem during the summer.  </li>
            <li>Keeping my hand aired out seems to be a good solution.  </li>
            <li>A lot of my friends will find this very useful.</li>
            <li>lotion goes on easily and works quickly.  </li>
            <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;s1NDUDFa_-E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also applied the lotion before I go out to the bars and love that I never worry about wiping my hands on my pants before meeting people on a sweaty, spicy, and hot Latin Night.</li>
            <li>I love Carpe; I have pretty sweaty hands and have never found a hand lotion that is truly antiperspirant like this.</li>
            <li>I tried Carpe on my feet (because if it helps with sweaty hands it has to help with sweaty feet too, right?!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been working in a very hot workshop, painting the ceiling, and have given Carpe a true torture test.</li>
            <li>One quick tip</li>
            <li>he felt that he had a better grip on his clubs and was able to play using only one glove</li>
            <li>second goaround with Carpe went much better!</li>
            <li>It is only effective for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  another range session yesterday at 95 degrees, and I noticed that while my gloved hand was still sweating, my right hand was not.  </li>
            <li>The lotion has a pleasant but not overwhelming smell, and I could tell right away that it was working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check back after more testing--</li>
            <li>I overdid things the first time and had to wash some</li>
            <li>first use for Carpe was the tennis court.</li>
            <li>I wear heels most days for work and find that my feet sweet and start slipping in my shoes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!!</li>
            <li>Everything else works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a student at UNC where Carpe first came out</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to rub it only on your palms and between your fingers --</li>
            <li>If you apply too much and/or don&#x27;t rub in right away, the lotion can get a bit tacky in your hands.</li>
            <li>Best part about this product in my humble opinion is not only the lack of grease that the product itself leaves behind (none), but the amount of grease the product eliminates (substantial).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great buy.</li>
            <li>Hands are left a little tacky after application, so not greasy at all (good!).  </li>
            <li>first time I messed up by applying a bit too much and not rubbing Carpe in.</li>
            <li>So first thing&#x27;s first, I would not consider myself a particularly sweaty person.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;&#x27;ve used it for my exercise class, Pure Barre.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t really have very sweaty hands, read on.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a quality product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin splotchy and in rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After multiple uses, I have confirmed that this product isn&#x27;t working at all.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and also seems to make my hands softer also.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much to the creators that made it.</li>
            <li>I never thought my ass truly needed a good cleaning with a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; wipe, until I actually listened to a friend and discovered how they completely eliminated the existence of future dingleberries.</li>
            <li>I made sure to use a small, pea-sized amount and rub in quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of other solutions, and this one works better than all of them.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a sweater, I suggest you check out some of the other reviews, which may be more relevant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a good, but subtle smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try even if you never thought you have chronic hand-sweat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>That being said, wish it came in different scents (citrus preferred), especially considering the advertising/packaging doesn&#x27;t send the message that it smells primarily like eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>Like I said before, I don&#x27;t sweat too much so for me Carpe &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t so much about getting rid of sweaty hands, but actually upgrading me to what we&#x27;ll call &amp;#34;supergrip&amp;#34; status.</li>
            <li>I actually use Arid spray on really hot days, and that helps.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>(sequence:  sunblock, wash hands, dry, dry some more, then Carpe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feel free to comment if you want me to test out any other applications of this product!</li>
            <li>Love the stuff and would definitely advise people who like to stay active to give Carpe a try!</li>
            <li>So far I have used Carpe once.</li>
            <li>My husband (who has suffered from sweaty hands since always) has been using this daily since we received it (about 2 weeks ago), and has really seen results.  </li>
            <li>What I am surprised about is how having un-sweaty hands changes my workout.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean but a little medicinal for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting that the tube was a bit smaller than I expected, but I also needed to use less than expected (more on that later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Similarly, I never thought hand perspiration was a serious issue for me and that it needed to be alleviated.</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed a difference, and it meant I could spend less energy maintaining my grip and more time focusing on other aspects of my game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(normally he has to switch out a few times because he sweats through them) on Saturday for the first time in recent memory.  </li>
            <li>That said, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since there are a few activities I figured it would be useful for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The overall experience is good--there&#x27;s a little bit of a chemical smell when applying, but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>My experience on the toilet has enhanced since I&#x27;ve stopped using normal toilet paper, and I no longer feel any discomfort while spending time in the restroom following my daily half-gallon milk challenges #gainz.    </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s very little to say here: it works exactly as advertised.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not surprised that Carpe&#x27; works.</li>
            <li> On the range I felt like I didn&#x27;t have any sweat protection at all, but after drying off my hand and putting on a new glove, I felt like my hands got dry again, as opposed to the usual lingering sweaty feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be coming back here to give updates on other uses.</li>
            <li> Keeps it dry for about 10 mins</li>
            <li> if applied to the tops of your hands, it will really dry them out.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> Even though the rest of me is sweating and clearly working hard, the fact that my hands are *not* sweating seems to be some sort of cue that I need to work HARDER.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get sweaty hands, so I was skeptical that I would actually find this product valuable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had the chance to use it in a few different settings.  </li>
            <li> Wet hands and paintbrushes don&#x27;t work well together.</li>
            <li> Sweaty hands can be awkward in some social situations, and I&#x27;ll never have to worry about that again thanks to Carpe!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never noticed my racket slipping, but with Carpe it was like my racket was stuck to my hand!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t slipping out of my shoes!</li>

            <li> Love it.  I&#x27;ve now had the chance to use it in a few different settings.  I&#x27;m at my computer (a Macbook) a lot and my hands tend to get sweaty, causing my keyboard and trackpad to get greasy.  After using this stuff a couple times, I was able to nix my cleaning cloth that I used to use to wipe the sweat away.  I&#x27;ve also tried it in the gym where, again, it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a little bit of a tacky feeling immediately after application, but that goes away within minutes.  Best part about this product in my humble opinion is not only the lack of grease that the product itself leaves behind (none), but the amount of grease the product eliminates (substantial).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great buy.</li>
            <li> I play a fair amount of golf and I live in North Carolina, so sweaty hands are a problem during the summer.  I actually use Arid spray on really hot days, and that helps.  I bought Carpe thinking this might be a step up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall experience is good--there&#x27;s a little bit of a chemical smell when applying, but it goes away quickly.  Hands are left a little tacky after application, so not greasy at all (good!).  I found that after a few minutes I couldn&#x27;t really tell I had put anything on.  One quick tip--it takes some planning to put sunblock on with this unless you want antiperspirant all over your face (sequence:  sunblock, wash hands, dry, dry some more, then Carpe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance-wise, it&#x27;s not a cure-all (maybe I was too hopeful to think it would be)--after a 20 minute session at the driving range (90 degrees out), my glove was soaked.  I dried my hands and switched gloves prior to teeing off and then switched gloves between shots, allowing my hand to air out during the round (what I normally do); that seemed to work pretty well.  My grip was slippery on the range by the end of the warm up, but no issues on the course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I need a couple more rounds with it (and maybe try one without it to compare), but it&#x27;s not a home run.  On the range I felt like I didn&#x27;t have any sweat protection at all, but after drying off my hand and putting on a new glove, I felt like my hands got dry again, as opposed to the usual lingering sweaty feeling.  I haven&#x27;t done the math on cost per use vs Arid, but it seems comparable on performance and better on convenience.  I&#x27;ll check back after more testing--the world (or at least the Southern golf world) needs a product like this that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  another range session yesterday at 95 degrees, and I noticed that while my gloved hand was still sweating, my right hand was not.  Keeping my hand aired out seems to be a good solution.  Nothing is going to completely stop sweat in that heat (would that even be safe, biologically?), but for my golf friends out there, this is about as good as it gets.  Great product!lly?), but for my golf friends out there, this is about as good as it gets.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Some of our employees at the warehouse tried it out in their day-to-day and reported Carpe to be very effective</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. As a civil engineer, having sweaty palms sucks. But this stuff works. Seriously works. I just wish I could buy a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Great idea and great execution. A lot of my friends will find this very useful. That being said, wish it came in different scents (citrus preferred), especially considering the advertising/packaging doesn&#x27;t send the message that it smells primarily like eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> trash. Keeps it dry for about 10 mins</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried a number of other solutions, and this one works better than all of them. Sweaty hands can be awkward in some social situations, and I&#x27;ll never have to worry about that again thanks to Carpe! It also has a good, but subtle smell.</li>
            <li> It is only effective for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> So first thing&#x27;s first, I would not consider myself a particularly sweaty person. I don&#x27;t really get sweaty hands, so I was skeptical that I would actually find this product valuable. That said, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since there are a few activities I figured it would be useful for. If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t really have very sweaty hands, read on. If you&#x27;re a sweater, I suggest you check out some of the other reviews, which may be more relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;Carpe came in the neat packaging shown in the picture. It&#x27;s worth noting that the tube was a bit smaller than I expected, but I also needed to use less than expected (more on that later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Try:&lt;br /&gt;My first time I messed up by applying a bit too much and not rubbing Carpe in. IMPORTANT: follow the instructions! If you apply too much and/or don&#x27;t rub in right away, the lotion can get a bit tacky in your hands. I overdid things the first time and had to wash some off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Try and Beyond:&lt;br /&gt;My second goaround with Carpe went much better! I made sure to use a small, pea-sized amount and rub in quickly. The lotion has a pleasant but not overwhelming smell, and I could tell right away that it was working. Like I said before, I don&#x27;t sweat too much so for me Carpe &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t so much about getting rid of sweaty hands, but actually upgrading me to what we&#x27;ll call &amp;#34;supergrip&amp;#34; status. It was now time to try Carpe in the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses for a &amp;#34;non-sweater&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;My first use for Carpe was the tennis court. I got the idea from the cheesy video they made here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;s1NDUDFa_-E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed. I&#x27;ve never noticed my racket slipping, but with Carpe it was like my racket was stuck to my hand! I definitely noticed a difference, and it meant I could spend less energy maintaining my grip and more time focusing on other aspects of my game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be coming back here to give updates on other uses. Feel free to comment if you want me to test out any other applications of this product!</li>
            <li> Purchasing Carpe gave me the closest form of gratification I&#x27;ve experienced since the day I discovered flushable wipes. I never thought my ass truly needed a good cleaning with a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; wipe, until I actually listened to a friend and discovered how they completely eliminated the existence of future dingleberries. My experience on the toilet has enhanced since I&#x27;ve stopped using normal toilet paper, and I no longer feel any discomfort while spending time in the restroom following my daily half-gallon milk challenges #gainz.    Similarly, I never thought hand perspiration was a serious issue for me and that it needed to be alleviated. Only until I gave Carpe a try, did I realize how helpful it&#x27;s application was to various facets of my life. As the local pastor of my apartment complex gym, my grip doesn&#x27;t slip as often while I&#x27;m preaching the wrath of my calves and traps. I&#x27;ve also applied the lotion before I go out to the bars and love that I never worry about wiping my hands on my pants before meeting people on a sweaty, spicy, and hot Latin Night. Basically, this s*** works and I highly recommend giving it a try even if you never thought you have chronic hand-sweat.</li>
            <li> This product was brilliantly done! It seriously improved my confidence, and I do not feel insecure about something that I can&#x27;t control because now, thanks for carpe I can control it! Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this! I tend to have sweaty hands and sweaty feet. I wear heels most days for work and find that my feet sweet and start slipping in my shoes. I tried Carpe on my feet (because if it helps with sweaty hands it has to help with sweaty feet too, right?!) I was pleasantly surprised! I found that after a day in heels I wasn&#x27;t slipping out of my shoes! BIG win, Carpe!! Thanks for making a quality product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin splotchy and in rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have and will continue to recommend this product to peers and friends. I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> So far I have used Carpe once. It didn&#x27;t seem to work as it advertised. After I had put on the product, it seems to help stop the sweating for a little bit but then the sweating continue again; which is equivalent to me washing my hands to stop the sweating. For $14 with 1.35 ounce of product, it is not worth the money. Personally do not recommend this product.  Edited: After multiple uses, I have confirmed that this product isn&#x27;t working at all. Please do not buy and I hope Carpe would refund my money!</li>
            <li> My husband (who has suffered from sweaty hands since always) has been using this daily since we received it (about 2 weeks ago), and has really seen results.  It has even improved his golf game - he felt that he had a better grip on his clubs and was able to play using only one glove (normally he has to switch out a few times because he sweats through them) on Saturday for the first time in recent memory.  Highly recommended product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I tried some yesterday at RTX in Austin and had to buy some the next day. This stuff really works and also seems to make my hands softer also. I highly recommend this and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> (This is actually Vicki writing this review.) I like Carpe&#x27; a lot. I&#x27;&#x27;ve used it for my exercise class, Pure Barre.  It turns out that it&#x27;s easier to do the barre exercises without sweaty hands. With Carpe&#x27;, I don&#x27;t have to wipe my hands on my pants repeatedly, and I can hold on better and for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not surprised that Carpe&#x27; works. I&#x27;ve witnessed the incredibly thorough work the developers have put into this product. What I am surprised about is how having un-sweaty hands changes my workout. Even though the rest of me is sweating and clearly working hard, the fact that my hands are *not* sweating seems to be some sort of cue that I need to work HARDER. I did not expect this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion goes on easily and works quickly.  You only need a little bit. The scent is clean but a little medicinal for me.  But Carpe&#x27; works! Definitely try it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Something I noticed about Carpe was that it didn&#x27;t leave any residue on my screens, an uncharacteristic trait for most lotions. Also love that it fits under the 3.4 ounce TSA limit (I usually only bring carry ons when I fly). Everything else works exactly as advertised. Awesome job, I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a student at UNC where Carpe first came out and I&#x27;ve actually gotten to use the stuff for a while now. I play golf and tennis around the campus and have loved using the lotion when I go out to play. Love the stuff and would definitely advise people who like to stay active to give Carpe a try!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s very little to say here: it works exactly as advertised. I&#x27;ve been working in a very hot workshop, painting the ceiling, and have given Carpe a true torture test. Wet hands and paintbrushes don&#x27;t work well together. Carpe just works. Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  Be sure to rub it only on your palms and between your fingers -- if applied to the tops of your hands, it will really dry them out.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Thank you so much to the creators that made it. Unfortuently I have had sweaty palms and soles of my feet, my entire life. I received the Carpe lotion in the mail yesterday and after just one application on my palms and soles of my feet, my palms and sole have not sweat once today. Big deal for me! Thank you again Carpe :)</li>
            <li> I love Carpe; I have pretty sweaty hands and have never found a hand lotion that is truly antiperspirant like this. I use it before interviews and whenever I play cello. It feels refreshing and keeps my hands sweat-free all day. It also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Have not had a chance use it for a prolonged time.</li>
