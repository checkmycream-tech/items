    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These brushes are excellent.</li>
            <li>not the best.</li>
            <li>Contrary to what some commenters wrote, my husband founds these brush heads to be perfect.  </li>
            <li>Fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Really good!</li>
            <li>fits perfectly and works just as good as the originals that came with my brush.</li>
            <li>great price, good brushes!</li>
            <li>Yes, I have had this brush for a while, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Great value and seams</li>
            <li>üëçüëç great product</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly and works great for 1/3 the price of Oral B replacements.</li>
            <li>The item items arrive on the day that they said they would and they fit my unit almost perfect</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase, and would recommend for purchase for any one who has and uses the dual head toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made</li>
            <li>I love them and I&#x27;m saving a ton of money on these brushes.</li>
            <li>I love my bresh heads</li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s as good as the higher priced versions.</li>
            <li>Fit as well as originals.</li>
            <li>I took a chance with these Generic replacement heads and they are great.</li>
            <li>these fit</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Works just like the original factory brand.</li>
            <li>OK for an economy solution or a get by situation---but not anywhere near the original quality or fit.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are definitely a real bargain compared to the price of the original Oral B heads.  </li>
            <li>if you use it with soft hands you should be fine.</li>
            <li>The first replacement head lasted 45 days.</li>
            <li>Bristles could be a little softer but overall, a good buy!</li>
            <li>The bristles are much stiffer than the original and the fit of the head to the handle is pretty sloppy.  </li>
            <li>They were highly rated and that is why I purchased them to try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, and possibly because it&#x27;s not the right fit, the toothbrush is now REALLY loud with this generic head.</li>
            <li>One brush head only lasts me about 2 weeks before it breaks partially and the top part stops rotating,.</li>
            <li>They came directly from China!</li>
            <li>The brushes are very firm, more so than the Oral-B I think.</li>
            <li>Would rather have medium than soft bristle</li>
            <li>I have the Oral B Vitality and have been having a lot of trouble finding original replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Somewhat stiff at first so do not apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>a little hard on gums but good for the price.</li>
            <li>Not great but not terrible.</li>
            <li>so tightly (I had to really shove it on to get it to go on all the way), I can&#x27;t get it off without using pliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These work well and seem to hold up well.  They were highly rated and that is why I purchased them to try.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very firm, more so than the Oral-B I think.</li>
            <li> One brush head only lasts me about 2 weeks before it breaks partially and the top part stops rotating,. Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent. The first replacement head lasted 45 days. Somewhat stiff at first so do not apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Does not fit all the brands listed. Very cheaply made</li>
            <li> fits perfectly and works just as good as the originals that came with my brush. ill probably order more.,</li>
            <li> The mouth feel was very rough</li>
            <li> Fit as well as originals.</li>
            <li> not the best. a little hard on gums but good for the price. if you use it with soft hands you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I have been through two of them already and they only last about 3-4 weeks.  The heads stop spinning. Won&#x27;t buy these again!</li>
            <li> I have the Oral B Vitality and have been having a lot of trouble finding original replacement heads. Yes, I have had this brush for a while, but it works great. I took a chance with these Generic replacement heads and they are great. It fit perfectly and works great for 1/3 the price of Oral B replacements. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love them and I&#x27;m saving a ton of money on these brushes.</li>
            <li> Brush would not stay clipped to my handle and came off in my mouth while using it several times. Bristles could be a little softer but overall, a good buy!</li>
            <li> Contrary to what some commenters wrote, my husband founds these brush heads to be perfect.  Really good!</li>
            <li> The item items arrive on the day that they said they would and they fit my unit almost perfect I am very pleased with my purchase, and would recommend for purchase for any one who has and uses the dual head toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this! Works just like the original factory brand.</li>
            <li> these fit and that&#x27;s about all these have going for them. The bristles are unbelievably hard! I like stiff bristles but this is insane! its like brushing with a wire brush. Do not buy these unless you like extremely stiff brushes.</li>
            <li> Since the Oral B brand toothbrush heads are really expensive (3 for $20, when the original toothbrush is less than $12), I decided to buy generic replacement heads. These were a big mistake. Not only do they not fit well, the bristles are so hard they made my gums bleed. I tried to remove the head so I could soak it in water to soften the bristles, but it&#x27;s on there so tightly (I had to really shove it on to get it to go on all the way), I can&#x27;t get it off without using pliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, and possibly because it&#x27;s not the right fit, the toothbrush is now REALLY loud with this generic head. It also drips water out of the head after you&#x27;re done, leaving your toothbrush sitting in a sticky puddle. The Oral B head didn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to suck it up and order the expensive Oral B replacement heads, but this really is a case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34; I will only buy the brand from now on!</li>
            <li> I found the brush very hard. would preferred a softer brush head.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Slightly longer delivery but it came from China which I didn&#x27;t expect.  Great value and seams like it&#x27;s as good as the higher priced versions. Recommended. Thx</li>
            <li> Worked well but I did have a few lose bristles, nothing that would make me not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Would rather have medium than soft bristle</li>
            <li> While there was nothing wrong with these, I had to return them because I ordered the wrong size. They came directly from China!</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> great price, good brushes!</li>
            <li> I will be order this again. I love my bresh heads üëçüëç great product</li>
            <li> These brush heads are definitely a real bargain compared to the price of the original Oral B heads.  However, you do pay a price for this economy.  The bristles are much stiffer than the original and the fit of the head to the handle is pretty sloppy.  This leads to premature failure of the brush head in just a few short weeks.  OK for an economy solution or a get by situation---but not anywhere near the original quality or fit.</li>
            <li> They are definitely generic. Not great but not terrible.</li>
