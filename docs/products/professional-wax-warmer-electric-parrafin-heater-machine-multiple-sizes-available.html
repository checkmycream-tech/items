            <li>Heats up the wax quickly and keeps it warm.  </li>
            <li>Great professional wax warmer</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I use Cirepil and Satin Smooth and both cans fit fine.  </li>
            <li>You need to use the baskets for a snug fit and even heating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few months and the machine still works great!</li>
            <li>but I will be purchasing something else asap just to get rid of the sound.</li>
            <li>Works good for the do it yourself at home  but not for a professional.</li>
            <li>and it works good so far.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Had a full day booked going to lose over $600.</li>
            <li>It heats up my product quickly and evenly, no problems there,  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I like the compact and easy to clean design though, and I really like how well they hold the temperature of the waxes consistently.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t fit the 14oz very well</li>
            <li>And if you just insert the cans into the wells themselves, without using the handled baskets, they kind of float around in there, the wells are too big diameter-wise.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I would like.</li>
            <li>gets wax hot enough, and has safety measure to automatically shutdown temp when exceeds safe zone.</li>
            <li>It heats the wax evenly and I love the temp controls ans double chambers.</li>
            <li>The right side gets warm and can melt wax after an hour, the left side really doesn&#x27;t heat up at all.- OLD REVIEW  </li>
            <li>It is a huge distraction in a facial</li>
            <li>delivered very quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>THE WHOLE TIME.  </li>
            <li>If the heating red light is lit, you can guarantee it is clicking.  </li>
            <li>works perfectly to warm two different types of wax at the same time</li>
            <li>The pots don&#x27;t fit flat so the heat is not even in the pots.</li>
            <li>It takes about 45 minutes to an hour to heat up my wax and keeps the temperature steady.</li>
            <li>I returned this to the vendor and they fixed it and quickly returned it back to me!</li>
            <li>This pot came quickly and warms my both soft and hard wax quickly!</li>
            <li>Still waiting to move into new studio.</li>
            <li>I finally used this for the first time with my Lycon Lycojet hybrid wax.</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with the wax not getting hot enough as others have posted.</li>
            <li>It will be used frequently!</li>
            <li>When it needs to heat to keep the temp even, it clicks really loudly.</li>
            <li>Heats up both my hard wax and soft (strip) wax equally well and very quickly...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, both waxes are pretty thick even at the highest temperature.  </li>
            <li>I tried it anyway &amp; one side of the warmer got hot enough to melt the wax, but not the other, so I am going to have to return it.</li>
            <li>however, I believe this unit is actually made for paraffin wax, because when I inserted the cans of Cirepil, they sunk down into the baskets, which makes it kind of hard to scrape the wax spatula.</li>
            <li>I will update if anything happens good or bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank for the order. Packed perfectly and product was as described.</li>
            <li> I finally used this for the first time with my Lycon Lycojet hybrid wax. It heated to the PERFECT temperature, did not over heat as some warmers do, and heated evenly!  Great for the esthie or cosmetologist on budget!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase another in the future!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this wax pot. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour to heat up my wax and keeps the temperature steady. Some pots I&#x27;ve had got hotter and hotter the longer I had them on. Would definitely recommend for personal and business use.</li>
            <li> very bad experience with this warmer . agent was not gud . i don&#x27;t like that warmer.waste of money</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t fit the 14oz very well and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I would like. Works good for the do it yourself at home  but not for a professional.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer is great.  Heats up the wax quickly and keeps it warm.  I would recommend this warmer to anyone that is looking for a double warmer.</li>
            <li> This wax warmer heating is comparable to the price.  It is not very much.  I couldn&#x27;t use this warmer with my soft waxes and barely with the hard waxes.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, both waxes are pretty thick even at the highest temperature.  With that being said it takes twice as long for my waxes to heat than my single wax warmers.  It is suppose to get up to 176 degrees Fahrenheit.  I am pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t.  It looks like this will be a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They contacted me to find out if I was satisfied with the product.  I told them the situation and they gave me acceptable options to resolve the issue.  Their customer service is definitely 5 star quality!</li>
            <li> gets wax hot enough, and has safety measure to automatically shutdown temp when exceeds safe zone. delivered very quickly&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with product and will recommend to my fellow aestetists that work at home</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. Still waiting to move into new studio. Will comment when can plug in and start waxing.</li>
            <li> I got this wax warmer for facial &amp; body waxing, but when I received the warmer, the instructions seemed to be for paraffin wax - I tried it anyway &amp; one side of the warmer got hot enough to melt the wax, but not the other, so I am going to have to return it.</li>
            <li> Product is great! Exactly as described! Great quality! Great price! Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item almost last month. I did not open until I opened last week. I ordered that item for my business. So, when I was going to warm it on. it did not work at all. The seller did not response my email / feedback as well.</li>
            <li> Had this pot for less than two months. Come into work today to start my day wax pot is dead. Had a full day booked going to lose over $600. Don&#x27;t buy this piece of crap!!!! SO PISSED</li>
            <li> This wax heater doesn&#x27;t heat properly. The pots don&#x27;t fit flat so the heat is not even in the pots.</li>
            <li> Heats up both my hard wax and soft (strip) wax equally well and very quickly... however, I believe this unit is actually made for paraffin wax, because when I inserted the cans of Cirepil, they sunk down into the baskets, which makes it kind of hard to scrape the wax spatula. And if you just insert the cans into the wells themselves, without using the handled baskets, they kind of float around in there, the wells are too big diameter-wise. You need to use the baskets for a snug fit and even heating. I like the compact and easy to clean design though, and I really like how well they hold the temperature of the waxes consistently.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase. Heats qucikly and maintains the temperature of the wax perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this item at a great price. They do not heat my wax correctly. The right side gets warm and can melt wax after an hour, the left side really doesn&#x27;t heat up at all.- OLD REVIEW  I returned this to the vendor and they fixed it and quickly returned it back to me! It&#x27;s been a few months and the machine still works great! Thank you! 2 stars went to 4 stars!</li>
            <li> Great professional wax warmer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> One chamber only work for 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a week and it works good so far. I&#x27;m using it for soft wax and hard wax and I&#x27;ve had no problems. There were no directions for use for the hair removing wax just paraffin. I ended up not using the buckets provided. I&#x27;m guessing they are for the paraffin wax anyhow. I have not had any problems with the wax not getting hot enough as others have posted. I will update if anything happens good or bad.</li>
            <li> This pot came quickly and warms my both soft and hard wax quickly! I like that it gives you the option for different temps. I would purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted. The price was right and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Heats up wax well. The &amp;#34;ticking noise&amp;#34; that a previous buyer was complaining about you can barely hear. Im glad I didn&#x27;t let that comment effect my decision in buying this warmer. I works well.</li>
            <li> Works great heats up fast</li>
            <li> Great product! It will be used frequently!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this wax pot for 2 years.  It heats up my product quickly and evenly, no problems there,  I use Cirepil and Satin Smooth and both cans fit fine.  My issue is with the heating mechanism.  When it needs to heat to keep the temp even, it clicks really loudly. THE WHOLE TIME.  If the heating red light is lit, you can guarantee it is clicking.  It is a huge distraction in a facial and I&#x27;ve had several clients comment on it.  Either they ask what that noise is or say they didn&#x27;t know I had an alarm clock in my room! Still works great but I will be purchasing something else asap just to get rid of the sound.</li>
            <li> works perfectly to warm two different types of wax at the same time</li>
            <li> So Far, so Good! It heats the wax evenly and I love the temp controls ans double chambers. Quality product and Shipping was prompt. What a wonderful buy!</li>
