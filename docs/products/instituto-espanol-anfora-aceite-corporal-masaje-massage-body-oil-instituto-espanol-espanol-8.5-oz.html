            <li>This product is very good.</li>
            <li>Always a great purchase.</li>
            <li>scented oil is very nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so smells so good</li>
            <li>when I saw it here, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I had a bathtub, I would love to soak in a tub of it with a glass of wine!</li>
            <li>Always lovely!  </li>
            <li>I love rose oil!</li>
            <li>loving it.</li>
            <li>As a part-time massage therapist I use this on clients who prefer a scented oil over lotions with &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; rose scents.</li>
            <li>smelling like a rose bouquet after my shower</li>
            <li>This is a really nice oil.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing with a very pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>I switched to this product because of the light rose scent and EVERYONE asks me what perfume I am wearing!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of many of the ones on the market, but this rose</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am planning on using this oil on my baby instead of baby oil (too many chemicals in baby oil)&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I love this oil...</li>
            <li>:) I have been using this oil for about three months now</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>Some people smell the rose and look for the flowers, others say there is just a clean, refreshing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>But most of the time I don&#x27;t smell it.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy it, tho.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way I love the scent of this oil &amp; how light it is.</li>
            <li>An added benefit is that it has a nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>A beautiful light rose smell and silky lubricant to rub on skin or a few drops in your bath.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs quite well.</li>
            <li>I smooth this fragrant oil on my skin leaving me sliky smooth and smelling like roses.</li>
            <li>Then, depending on my time, letting it dry on it&#x27;s own, or very lightly patting it dry.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes during the day I wonder where the roses are that I&#x27;m smelling, and I realize it&#x27;s me!  </li>
            <li>But really works great on your skin leaving it so soft and lightly fragrant.</li>
            <li>i loved it right off the back.</li>
            <li>(fresh out of the shower without drying off, just apply all over the body--it absorbs quick) and helps tremendously with the itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Not only does this body oil really smell like roses which by the way its so lovely!</li>
            <li>Found this in the Spanish section of local wally-martinez ( walmart to all you who don&#x27;t know) and this stuff its great.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well and even helped reduce redness from some shaving bumps i got from passing the razor to quickly.  </li>
            <li>(makes them really soft and smooth).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice body oil to use after shower while my skin is still wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally found something I like!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s exactly what i want to smell like for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>Smells mildly Rose but doesn&#x27;t clash with other perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I buy as many of these as I can because it is not a product that is stocked very well at my local CVS.</li>
            <li>A real luxury, certainly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it every day for about a month now and have noticed my very dry skin is getting better.</li>
            <li>I say that because I am on guaifenesin protocol which has very strict limitations on what you can put on and in your body.  </li>
            <li>work very well for relieving the pain.  </li>
            <li>and it is very moist.</li>
            <li>Online is fast.</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this product and its from Spain!</li>
            <li>right after I shower and it leaves my skin sooooooooo soft and the smell relaxes me for some reason</li>
            <li>great soft and subtle fragrance..highly recommend to anyone ..</li>
            <li>I have used regular baby oil after taking a bath for the past 35 years and people tell how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>scent is amazing and reminds me of some of my aunts and other female elders in my family when i used to go and smell their perfumes on their vanities.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil through most of my pregnancy &amp; have noticed softer, smoother skin without a heavy oily feeling or buildup.</li>
            <li>Other essential oils (which I absolutely love) block the guaifenesin.</li>
            <li>The scent is light too, not heavy or overpowering &amp; lingers slightly on the skin for a time after applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Professional massages  </li>
            <li>So far they have removed this product from their stores.</li>
            <li>So, i was forced to use a different brand that is more famous but is not effective.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed no redness in my stretch marks so far, possibly from the oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re considering trying this oil out check locally first, because the price here is a little over what I pay at a local store.</li>
            <li>out)&lt;br /&gt;For other pregnant women out there who are experiencing the normal itching in delicate places</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product because it works well with the fibromyalgia medication I am using.  I say that because I am on guaifenesin protocol which has very strict limitations on what you can put on and in your body.  Other essential oils (which I absolutely love) block the guaifenesin. Professional massages  work very well for relieving the pain.  I take this with me to get my massages, and this works perfectly. An added benefit is that it has a nice fresh smell.  Win-Win all around.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  I put it on after showering and towel drying, then putting it all over my body lightly, especially on my feet (makes them really soft and smooth).  Then, depending on my time, letting it dry on it&#x27;s own, or very lightly patting it dry.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes during the day I wonder where the roses are that I&#x27;m smelling, and I realize it&#x27;s me!  But most of the time I don&#x27;t smell it.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy it, tho.  A real luxury, certainly.  A bottle lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;If I had a bathtub, I would love to soak in a tub of it with a glass of wine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice body oil to use after shower while my skin is still wet.

I&#x27;ve used it every day for about a month now and have noticed my very dry skin is getting better. I&#x27;m glad I finally found something I like!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this body oil at albertsons but they dont have it anymore.So, i was forced to use a different brand that is more famous but is not effective. This product is very good. Doesnt make my body itch and it is very moist. loving it. I was actually purchased 2 of this and will keep buying this while we are in a cold season.</li>
            <li> I found this product at a CVS when I went to purchase night cream.  I have used regular baby oil after taking a bath for the past 35 years and people tell how great my skin looks.  I switched to this product because of the light rose scent and EVERYONE asks me what perfume I am wearing!  Some people smell the rose and look for the flowers, others say there is just a clean, refreshing fragrance.

            <li> I came across this product by chance in So California. It is difficult to find so when I saw it here, I was very pleased. A beautiful light rose smell and silky lubricant to rub on skin or a few drops in your bath. A must for skin care.</li>
            <li> Always lovely!  Husband and I both use after showering</li>
            <li> I Use this after every shower before towel drying..helps with dry skin...great soft and subtle fragrance..highly recommend to anyone ..</li>
            <li> Perfect for after shower.  Smells mildly Rose but doesn&#x27;t clash with other perfumes.  Works well to moisturize.  My daughter swears by it, too!  Hard o find in drug stores.  Online is fast.</li>
            <li> Found this in the Spanish section of local wally-martinez ( walmart to all you who don&#x27;t know) and this stuff its great. i looked up the ingredients and the last one is even a natural bug repellent so that is a plus smell like a flower and not get stung or bitten by other bugs oh yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing and reminds me of some of my aunts and other female elders in my family when i used to go and smell their perfumes on their vanities. It moisturizes very well and even helped reduce redness from some shaving bumps i got from passing the razor to quickly.  That was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s exactly what i want to smell like for the rest of my life.  so stocking up on this.</li>
            <li> I love this oil...I found this bottle at a local CVS store in Camarillo,Ca. So far they have removed this product from their stores. So I googled the name and there it ws on Amazon.com. As a part-time massage therapist I use this on clients who prefer a scented oil over lotions with &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; rose scents. I must also admit...this is the best roses scented oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love rose oil! I use it daily right after I shower and it leaves my skin sooooooooo soft and the smell relaxes me for some reason :) I have been using this oil for about three months now and I&#x27;m hooked. I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> smelling like a rose bouquet after my shower I smooth this fragrant oil on my skin leaving me sliky smooth and smelling like roses.</li>
            <li> Love the smell it&#x27;s so smells so good</li>
            <li> This is a really nice oil.  We were introduced to it by our therapist.  It is very soothing with a very pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> muy buen producto y el vendedor hace un trabajo perfecto un envio rapido y eficaz si quieren comprar algo no lo piensen dos veses aqui es un lugar perfecto para comprar le doy 5 estrellas</li>
            <li> Not only does this body oil really smell like roses which by the way its so lovely! But really works great on your skin leaving it so soft and lightly fragrant. I highly highly recommend this product and its from Spain!</li>
            <li> I found this product by chance at my local Target and smelled it. ooh my god.. i loved it right off the back. i went and did a search for it and found it online at Walmart. now i know they have it i will defiantly keep a stock of it... NO more over priced perfume for me....</li>
            <li> Always a great purchase.</li>
