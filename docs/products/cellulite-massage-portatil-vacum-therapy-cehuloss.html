            <li>:D</li>
            <li>I ordered one about a year ago that worked great!  </li>
            <li>Celluless is wonderful; I saw results in just weeks.</li>
            <li>Wonderful!</li>
            <li>i liked it !!!!!!</li>
            <li>VERY good size, color chosen.</li>
            <li>The suction method is very good to help with cellulite</li>
            <li>all good, excellent product.</li>
            <li>But I have to say when it works, it works great</li>
            <li>but with the oil, the machine itself had great suction and worked for about 9 months before the suction died.  </li>
            <li>this product is damage, when i recived has a great expectative, but when i used..... didin&#x27;t worked&lt;br /&gt;bad</li>
            <li>This product, cellules, is excellent for a relaxing experience at home, you can use it on your own, and with your husband, and both can have a nice moment together...</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>I feel cheated, because I had to ensure the good condition of this equipment</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and best all in the convenience of your own home.</li>
            <li>its the best item, ten minutes every day for two weeks, in each part of my body, and i look awesome</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and it is relaxing, enjoyable!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but in 3 weeks, amazing some of those that I thought was cyst were 50 percent  </li>
            <li>I liked the product</li>
            <li>Trust me, you don&#x27;t want to pull on and loosen your skin if you&#x27;re trying to look better...</li>
            <li>It still would not work more than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more smooth</li>
            <li>I bought this product and was very pleased at first.</li>
            <li>but it does have good suction on high mode.  </li>
            <li>If you want the amazing results it gives you have to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for everything i am in love with the product!</li>
            <li>The material is cheap, the cup doesn´t fit well</li>
            <li>looks cheap feels cheap.</li>
            <li>very useful</li>
            <li>AND THEY DELIVER SOMETHING GENERIC OR CLOSE TO WHAT I ORIGINALLY PURCHASED!!!</li>
            <li>but if, it is worth it, I recommend using the orange oil or something hot with it for better result</li>
            <li>Despite all this I do think that this is a cool gadget.  </li>
            <li>Good vacuum system, but</li>
            <li>I am lucky I did not get a blood cloth from all those bruises.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m glad that I can use it at home rather than going to a salon and paying hundreds of dollars for the same procedure.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product recently and I love it!  </li>
            <li>It was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I did not want to commit to an entire bottle to see if I still liked it.</li>
            <li>it feels like the plastic is kind of fragile.</li>
            <li>according to the proper use, recomendado al 100% for other persons, besides excellent</li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks, the vacuum suction became very light.</li>
            <li>You will see your cellulite diminish with the first use, but that result is not permanent.</li>
            <li>I never had this problem with the first one i had a year ago.  </li>
            <li>I bought my celluless around when they first were advertised.</li>
            <li>I took the screw out of the bottom but the top part will not open for me to try and fix it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think the celluless is worth buying.</li>
            <li>This item worked the first two times of use, and then lost all suction.  </li>
            <li>but after I took the screws from the top and bottom, it would not open.</li>
            <li>HOW logically, is sucking/pulling aka STRETCHING your skin going to tighten it and remove cellulite exactly??</li>
            <li>the top part constantly comes off.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly the one I bought and not realizing that it will be shipped from HongKong.</li>
            <li>first I thought I have a cyst</li>
            <li>and you loose the suction very easily.</li>
            <li>Machine does not suction strong enough to feel it in your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is important to notice that you are not going to reduce cellulite by only making some massage, you need to change your lifestyle, because without changing your diet and making exercise, no matter how much you spend in anti cellulite products, the cellulite aren&#x27;t going to disappear .</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of times with diet and exercise and I really note the difference after just a couple of uses it.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much difference that this device is supposed to create.  </li>
            <li>VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it was either too much sucktion or not at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I tried another one since I considered it cheap and the same thing, it stop in a month.</li>
            <li>, I really tried to like it.</li>
            <li>After very first use, I had huge black bruises all over my legs.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m new with it, so i can&#x27;t tell if i had reduced my body...</li>
            <li>However, in order to avoid any injury to your skin, you have to use the vacuum with the roll-on that it brought or just an oily cream that allow the vacuum  to run smooth in your skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the clear cup that it came with</li>
            <li>do not waste your money buying this.</li>
            <li>On the 3rd time after letting charge for a whole day.</li>
            <li>An increase in blood flow near the surface.  </li>
            <li>it is not working anymore, do not recommend to no one, do not waste our money</li>
            <li>I was surprised of the effectivity of this product in reducing my unwanted cellulites.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I get something that is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, the only thing is the charge of the batterie works at least for an hour, I think is not much because the celluless recomend working in the same place of the body for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I used it almost everyday for the first year and have seen minimum results.</li>
            <li>The cup seems a little bit big for certain parts of the body</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The battery doesn´t last very long, you have to charge it for hours and If you finish with some battery remaining, the next time you use it will be discharge.</li>
            <li> I am on the look for something that will  last a long time and a history of quality.</li>
            <li> I have not had it that long so only time will tell how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> The other modes seem fairly useless, medium is not strong enough imo while high can be a bit too strong.  </li>
            <li> Only time will tell if I experience the same battery problems as other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Once the swelling goes back down, so does the short illusion.  </li>
            <li> This product is not only waste of money, but a health hazard.</li>
            <li> Was not what i expected.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used it one time and it was enough waste of time.</li>
            <li> It is quite loud making a quite annoying sound.  </li>
            <li> This machine is definitely not worth 50 bucks.  </li>
            <li> The suction if hard enough, could cause slight swelling beneath the skin, which would puff up to fill in the \\&quot;dips\\&quot; to give the illusion of reduced cellulite.</li>
            <li> The Product is a completly failure, it works for a few weeks (8-9) and then it simply stops working.</li>
            <li> This little machine is not a miracle one time use product.</li>
            <li> At the beginning it took me a little to learn how to use it.  </li>
            <li> This product is just waste of money..</li>
            <li> me just point out a few things and let you put it together yourself...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to do it myself</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I bought what I saw on the description, item that I already had in the past.   </li>
            <li> is painful if you use it in HIGH.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller requesting a refund, but I never received a response from the seller although I complained 4 times.</li>
            <li> I am outraged not because I wasted money on this, but because the seller did not even responded to my serious complaint.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I have not taken photos of those bruises and sued the seller.</li>
            <li> like it...I am sorry</li>
            <li> I must say that this product was really disappointing - it didn&#x27;t maintain sucktion evenly</li>
            <li> it is not easy to use and also terrible quality I am using for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> They were very painful and did not heal for at least 3 weeks, that is how bad they were.</li>
            <li> I found it impossible to use the device.</li>
            <li> I bough this product besides the bad reviews...</li>
            <li> The product is a bad copy of Celluless.</li>
            <li> bad bad</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I feel so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The worst is: THE PRODUCT IS NOT MEANT FOR CELLULITE,BUT FOR BREAST MASSAGE.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This machine is definitely not worth 50 bucks.  I have no idea whether it works on cellulite but it does have good suction on high mode.  The other modes seem fairly useless, medium is not strong enough imo while high can be a bit too strong.  It is quite loud making a quite annoying sound.  Only time will tell if I experience the same battery problems as other reviewers have mentioned.  Despite all this I do think that this is a cool gadget.  I don&#x27;t use it for cellulite treatment, instead I use it to improve circulation and as an alternative healing device for myself.  I have not had it that long so only time will tell how long it lasts.  I would recommend it as a massage type device but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing it for over $30.00.</li>
            <li> Machine does not suction strong enough to feel it in your skin.  It&#x27;s a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> The Product is a completly failure, it works for a few weeks (8-9) and then it simply stops working. El Producto es un fracaso, trabaja por unas semanas y de proNto deja de funcionar DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... NO COMPRES ESTE PRODUCTO ES REGALAR TU DINERO!!! Now i WILL SEE IF I CAN GET A REFUND.. AHORA VERE SI PUEDO OBTENERR REEMBOLSO     Comprado en Agosto/2008 recibido en Septiembre/2008 me duro como 8 semanas     ALBERTO ASSAD</li>
            <li> I bough this product besides the bad reviews... I have tried a couple of times with diet and exercise and I really note the difference after just a couple of uses it. My skin looks more smooth that before, reducing the look of orange skin. However, in order to avoid any injury to your skin, you have to use the vacuum with the roll-on that it brought or just an oily cream that allow the vacuum  to run smooth in your skin. It is important to notice that you are not going to reduce cellulite by only making some massage, you need to change your lifestyle, because without changing your diet and making exercise, no matter how much you spend in anti cellulite products, the cellulite aren&#x27;t going to disappear .</li>
            <li> The battery doesn´t last very long, you have to charge it for hours and If you finish with some battery remaining, the next time you use it will be discharge. You can´t use it while charging. The material is cheap, the cup doesn´t fit well and you loose the suction very easily. But I have to say when it works, it works great and you feel that is doing its job.</li>
            <li> This item is a piece of garbage. After very first use, I had huge black bruises all over my legs. They were very painful and did not heal for at least 3 weeks, that is how bad they were.I contacted the seller requesting a refund, but I never received a response from the seller although I complained 4 times. The seller only provided me with a policy saying item cannot be returned if it has been used. This product is not only waste of money, but a health hazard. I am lucky I did not get a blood cloth from all those bruises. I am sorry I have not taken photos of those bruises and sued the seller. I am outraged not because I wasted money on this, but because the seller did not even responded to my serious complaint.</li>
            <li> This little machine is not a miracle one time use product. You will see your cellulite diminish with the first use, but that result is not permanent. If you want the amazing results it gives you have to use it consistently.  If you use it often you&#x27;re results will last longer, and they will not go away.  Your body will always look flawless. I love this product and I&#x27;m glad that I can use it at home rather than going to a salon and paying hundreds of dollars for the same procedure.  I have no cellulite anymore because of this miracle machine.  :D It was worth the money. I love it!</li>
            <li> Has anyone had problems with the suction for this product?  I ordered one about a year ago that worked great!  I didn&#x27;t use the clear cup that it came with but with the oil, the machine itself had great suction and worked for about 9 months before the suction died.  I liked the product so I ordered another one - no suction.  I thought it was defective and had it replaced only to find that the second one that was sent to me had no suction either.  I never had this problem with the first one i had a year ago.  Has anyone else had this problem? I don&#x27;t want to exchange it again but neither of these have worked at all!</li>
            <li> I bought my celluless around when they first were advertised. I used it almost everyday for the first year and have seen minimum results. It lost its sucksion about 3 months ago. I took the screw out of the bottom but the top part will not open for me to try and fix it. I don&#x27;t know what else to do. I really don&#x27;t think the celluless is worth buying.</li>
            <li> all good, excellent product. recommended. very useful</li>
            <li> I bought the cellules a year ago and paid over one hundred dollars. I really think that I waste my money. this stuff not work at all. do not waste your money buying this.</li>
            <li> Celluless is wonderful; I saw results in just weeks. It&#x27;s easy to use and best all in the convenience of your own home.</li>
            <li> It requires dicipline but if, it is worth it, I recommend using the orange oil or something hot with it for better result</li>
            <li> I bought what I saw on the description, item that I already had in the past.   But as I opened the package, the box said\\&quot;cehuloss\\&quot; and not \\&quot;celuless!!\\&quot;  You  will be abuse you, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I need someone to give me the massage. It&#x27;s a little hard to do it myself</li>
            <li> This product is just waste of money.. The battery holds the charge for only 2 minutes even when I left it charging for eight hours</li>
            <li> I started using the cellulite massage used it for 2 times.  On the 3rd time after letting charge for a whole day. The next day it was not working.  The machine had no power at all. :-( I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much difference that this device is supposed to create.  I would say, save your money...doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I loved it i liked it !!!!!! Thanks for everything i am in love with the product! Thank u!!</li>
            <li> Did not like.  Left a sore on my skin.  Was not what i expected.  Did not see any difference on my thighs.</li>
            <li> I bought Celluless, but instead I got some asian brand- that they call Cehuloss. The worst is: THE PRODUCT IS NOT MEANT FOR CELLULITE,BUT FOR BREAST MASSAGE. THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS, VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I ORDER SOMETHING FROM AMAZON AND THEY DELIVER SOMETHING GENERIC OR CLOSE TO WHAT I ORIGINALLY PURCHASED!!!</li>
            <li> Smelled like I rememberd it. I did not want to commit to an entire bottle to see if I still liked it.</li>
            <li> This thing don&#x27;t work at all it doesn&#x27;t even vacuum I want back my money</li>
            <li> This item worked the first two times of use, and then lost all suction.  It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> No es malo, pero no es tan bueno como pensaba...se siente un poco endeble (fragil). Adicionalmente, se requiere mucha disciplina para lograr el efecto deseado y mucho tiempo disponible si se desea modificar varias partes del cuerpo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, the only thing is the charge of the batterie works at least for an hour, I think is not much because the celluless recomend working in the same place of the body for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend to purchase this product. I paid for Celluless and I got Cehuloss. I feel so disappointed. This is the first time I get something that is not what I expected. The product is a bad copy of Celluless. I used it one time and it was enough waste of time. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> its the best item, ten minutes every day for two weeks, in each part of my body, and i look awesome,  you have to be patiente.</li>
            <li> Bought to my wife, and it is working well until now. Good vacuum system, but it feels like the plastic is kind of fragile.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was very pleased at first. It reminded me of an in house therapy I once paid $99 per session. After about 3 weeks, the vacuum suction became very light. I thought it needed batteries but after I took the screws from the top and bottom, it would not open. I put it on the charger and it just does not work anymore.</li>
            <li> VERY good size, color chosen. Adjustable exceed expectations. according to the proper use, recomendado al 100% for other persons, besides excellent</li>
            <li> Want to know the TRUTH about this product?&lt;br /&gt;Let me just point out a few things and let you put it together yourself...&lt;br /&gt;1.  HOW logically, is sucking/pulling aka STRETCHING your skin going to tighten it and remove cellulite exactly?? (this is the last thing youd want to do if you want to tighten your skin).  Trust me, you don&#x27;t want to pull on and loosen your skin if you&#x27;re trying to look better...&lt;br /&gt;2.  The ONLY way that you could even see any result, would be a temporary result.  The suction if hard enough, could cause slight swelling beneath the skin, which would puff up to fill in the \\&quot;dips\\&quot; to give the illusion of reduced cellulite. Once the swelling goes back down, so does the short illusion.  You could get the same effect from pinching yourself all over that area a bunch every morning.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The only actual benefit hypothetically that this MIGHT have? An increase in blood flow near the surface.  This will NOT reduce cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, save your money for something else.</li>
            <li> No instruction on how to use the Cellulite Massage Vacum Therapy, comes with a cd that is in another laungue not in english.</li>
            <li> The equipment was damaged, lit it, but it worked. I paid $ 28 dollars U.S. tax and customs forms, plus I had to get the technical sheet in Spanish to obtain permits and was damaged, if I return it I pay the shipping back to the U.S.. I feel cheated, because I had to ensure the good condition of this equipment</li>
            <li> The suction method is very good to help with cellulite but Cellulless it is not easy to use and also terrible quality I am using for 3 weeks it is not working anymore, do not recommend to no one, do not waste our money&lt;br /&gt;I just gave 2 stars because the system it is great.[[ASIN:B001DYRTH4 Cellulite Massage - Portatil Vacum Therapy - Cehuloss]]</li>
            <li> peace of junk and didnt even come from united states.</li>
            <li> I bought this product recently and I love it!  It massages and tightens the skin.  At the beginning it took me a little to learn how to use it.  The cup seems a little bit big for certain parts of the body but you just position yourself differently and it is then a matter of technique.  I use it while watching tv and it is relaxing, enjoyable! I love it!</li>
            <li> This product, cellules, is excellent for a relaxing experience at home, you can use it on your own, and with your husband, and both can have a nice moment together... i&#x27;m new with it, so i can&#x27;t tell if i had reduced my body... but i hope by a month, i have done something...</li>
            <li> After only three uses, the battery would no longer keep a charge. I found it impossible to use the device. I used the equipment as directed, charging the vacuum for the recommended eight hours. It still would not work more than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I must say that this product was really disappointing - it didn&#x27;t maintain sucktion evenly so it was either too much sucktion or not at all. I going to throw mine away - it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> do not like. the top part constantly comes off. would not recommend to anyone. looks cheap feels cheap. it&#x27;s another piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly the one I bought and not realizing that it will be shipped from HongKong. I was surprised of the effectivity of this product in reducing my unwanted cellulites. first I thought I have a cyst but in 3 weeks, amazing some of those that I thought was cyst were 50 percent  gone and some shrank, but here comes the problem it stop working after close to a month. I tried another one since I considered it cheap and the same thing, it stop in a month. Even the charger is plug in to avoid draining the battery while using, it is the same thing battery won&#x27;t accept anymore juice. I am on the look for something that will  last a long time and a history of quality.</li>
            <li> Muy bueno para ayudarme a recorrer la grasa hacia el sistema linfatico. Menos doloroso para el paciente. Si lo recomiendo.</li>
            <li> It work for three days and had too Re charge with no time,after three day stop working and I only use it like 3 times</li>
            <li> Is not good...doesn´t work.&lt;br /&gt;And is painful if you use it in HIGH. Dind´t like it...I am sorry, I really tried to like it.</li>
            <li> producto bueno, lo recomendaria, seria excelente si viniera con el aceite masajeador. definitivamente me gusto, varias amigas lo compraran, las hice probarlo.</li>
            <li> this product is damage, when i recived has a great expectative, but when i used..... didin&#x27;t worked&lt;br /&gt;bad bad bad</li>
