            <li>The best there is.  </li>
            <li>The perfect Hair gel.</li>
            <li>Best product ever!</li>
            <li>Good stuff!  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>This was a great item while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair this is the best product I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>it worked so good</li>
            <li>This order got \\&quot;lost\\&quot; in KY, fair enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best all-around men&#x27;s hair styling product I&#x27;ve ever used and, believe me, I&#x27;ve used a lot (I was in a hair-band in the 80&#x27;s!!!).  </li>
            <li>Will make your hair kind of crunchy unless you mix the superglue with another hair product (e.g. Pomade or forming wax)</li>
            <li>and I really liked that stuff.  </li>
            <li>While I liked both of those products my hair tended to never stay in place.  </li>
            <li>I really liked thise  product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>Stop drying it when it just does hold the hair on its own.  </li>
            <li>Best gel on the market for keeping hair in place and looking natural.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair gel products on the market and thus far, this works the best for my hair.</li>
            <li>Good product...came quickly.</li>
            <li>This product also gives your hair a volume boost, which is nice since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>They love it too.</li>
            <li>I bought some more</li>
            <li>Been using this gel for almost 2 years now, simply the best out there.</li>
            <li>Most gels are flaky and watery, and don&#x27;t work well with my hair type.</li>
            <li>It was wonderful not to have hairspray all over the floor for a short time.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works on my hair like magic.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake and in my experience, it holds and looks better.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use the comb again at this point, if I feel like having a part or more shine that day -</li>
            <li>It seems that the \\&quot;Superglue\\&quot; at first has great staying power but soon becomes an easily dislodged flaky material.</li>
            <li>If you want the best bond to your hair, you need it free of oils (I use American Crew 3 in 1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with wave and curl on top that has a mind of</li>
            <li>This step is the most important.</li>
            <li>THIS STEP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.</li>
            <li>The best way to describe this product is that it&#x27;s a more concentrated version of their Firm Hold gel.</li>
            <li>my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Crew makes several great men&#x27;s hair care products.  </li>
            <li>I have used pomade for a while now with some success, though I tried this product thinking it would have more staying power.    </li>
            <li>This gel drys clean and doesn&#x27;t get greasy and is easy to wash out of your hair with water.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for years and enjoy the product.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>product is still great, so I won&#x27;t deduct stars for the recent problems I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It should be holding with just the right amount of shine that says this is healthy hair, but without the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave it another chance after screwing it up the first time.  </li>
            <li>Get your hair clean.</li>
            <li>It was about even with the pomade for staying power and keeping my bangs off to the side--needing readjustments about every hour to move the bangs back into a good position.</li>
            <li>It is super sticky -</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>and this is the only kind that want sweet out</li>
            <li>ALWAYS start by washing it clean with AC&#x27;s style remover shampoo or equivalent and rinsing it out with hot water.  </li>
            <li>More of a natural, matte look.</li>
            <li>That is false advertising at its best.</li>
            <li>Have not found any other gel that smells good, holds and forms my hair as well as this.</li>
            <li>mixing the right amount of water with it on your fingertips, and 3) applying it to hair that is just the right amount damp-dry.  </li>
            <li>Turn on the hot water to let it get warm while you are applying about a gardenpea-size amount of this product to each finger tip on your left hand</li>
            <li>It will feel slimey at first, due to the product/water mixture, but when you feel the product start becoming sticky on your fingers, this is the magic moment</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t look like my grandmother, and this works the best of any product I&#x27;ve tried in the last few years.  </li>
            <li>It washes out really easy in the shower, and leaves your hair feeling really soft and conditioned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It washes out really easy in the shower, and leaves your hair feeling really soft and conditioned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it last the same all day love it!!</li>
            <li>Works very very well and will hold your hair in place in storm force winds.</li>
            <li>a guy with a full head of pretty fine hair that needs some serious holding power in order to keep any kind of shape during the day.</li>
            <li>Though one tube leaked, overall the product is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Who wants that?!</li>
            <li>But the first time I used this I really messed up!  </li>
            <li>It gives a very dry, matte finish and the hold is very strong.</li>
            <li>Works great on short hair and keeps everything in place without looking too wet.  </li>
            <li>but when using a reasonable amount I don&#x27;t notice any problems.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking or a real GEL with hold, look to Joico&#x27;s ICE Gel.</li>
            <li>That my friends is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too much water will dilute the product and reduce it&#x27;s holding power.</li>
            <li>USE A PEA SIZE AMOUNT FOR YOUR WHOLE HEAD</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes and conditions your hair during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>

            <li>When you are ready to begin, re-wet it if you have to and comb it again directing/setting it to almost the way you will want it to look when you&#x27;re done styling.  </li>

            <li>Crew Super Glue dries completely invisible, and is flake free and long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>This is my new gel for a long time, unless a better one is produced.</li>
            <li>I usually do the steps that I just outlined, and then use a TINY bit more to add more volume to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually do the steps that I just outlined, and then use a TINY bit more to add more volume to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a few years of experimentation with various waxes, pomades, creams, and gels, I recently gave this Crew Superglue Gel a shot in my quest to find the ideal dome concoction (in my pursuit of perpetual dude status).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The last step is to be quick when styling your hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice just to make sure the flakes weren&#x27;t caused because my hair was a bit more wet the first time, but the second time it was still a flaky mess.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and works well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it it.</li>
            <li>Particularly effective for thinning hair and hard to manage</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now that your hair is clean, you need to towel dry it.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s how I get straight, natural and healthy-looking hair with this superglue.  </li>
            <li>Just something to consider if you are trying to save few bucks :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never liked the feel of pastes and waxes in my hair, no matter how popular they are.</li>
            <li>(apply it to the right hand fingertips if you are left handed).  </li>
            <li>I use my hands, and shape my hair quickly before the product begins to dry.</li>
            <li>Close the tube top and, with the other hand, wet the ends of your fingers under the hot (not scalding) water.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of different gels and when I got my haircut not to long ago I asked my barber what is really strong and want sweat out</li>
            <li>But be warned, if you do this, you will have a sticky/flakey mess, and will most likely need to wash your hair again!  </li>
            <li>What follows may sound a little &amp;#34;specific&amp;#34;, but I just want to be clear on each step</li>
            <li>Only problem is it can flake and look like dandruff if you use too much.</li>
            <li>For Super Glue, you need your hair to have some moisture left in it but be on the dry side.</li>
            <li>I usually rub the towel on my head for a few seconds and call it good.</li>
            <li>When used correctly, your hair will have shine and plenty of all-day holding power, but will look natural - not wet and &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>How wet or dry your hair is will play a huge part in how well product works with your hair.</li>
            <li>I used a tiny bit to move my hair in a better direction, the recipient used it to plaster his hair in place without a secondary spraying.</li>
            <li>I use a little water to spread it around in my hair since it is pretty concentrated stuff!</li>
            <li>This arrived as expected but I don&#x27;t care for it much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised to say, I would actually recommend &amp;#34;Axe Spiking Glue&amp;#34; over this product.</li>
            <li>When you get out of the shower, comb your hair and then KEEP IT WET until you are standing there in front of the mirror ready to start styling it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, medium to long length, and this has a decent hold (not great).</li>
            <li>Then either let it dry naturally, or use a diffuser on the dryer and apply heat without the &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; from the dryer.)  </li>
            <li>to thick, imafine trying to style your hair with actual super glue...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked the feel of pastes and waxes in my hair, no matter how popular they are.</li>
            <li> (apply it to the right hand fingertips if you are left handed).  </li>
            <li> I use my hands, and shape my hair quickly before the product begins to dry.</li>
            <li> Close the tube top and, with the other hand, wet the ends of your fingers under the hot (not scalding) water.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of different gels and when I got my haircut not to long ago I asked my barber what is really strong and want sweat out</li>
            <li> But be warned, if you do this, you will have a sticky/flakey mess, and will most likely need to wash your hair again!  </li>
            <li> What follows may sound a little &amp;#34;specific&amp;#34;, but I just want to be clear on each step</li>
            <li> Only problem is it can flake and look like dandruff if you use too much.</li>
            <li> For Super Glue, you need your hair to have some moisture left in it but be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I usually rub the towel on my head for a few seconds and call it good.</li>
            <li> When used correctly, your hair will have shine and plenty of all-day holding power, but will look natural - not wet and &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> How wet or dry your hair is will play a huge part in how well product works with your hair.</li>
            <li> I used a tiny bit to move my hair in a better direction, the recipient used it to plaster his hair in place without a secondary spraying.</li>
            <li> I use a little water to spread it around in my hair since it is pretty concentrated stuff!</li>
            <li> This arrived as expected but I don&#x27;t care for it much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised to say, I would actually recommend &amp;#34;Axe Spiking Glue&amp;#34; over this product.</li>
            <li> When you get out of the shower, comb your hair and then KEEP IT WET until you are standing there in front of the mirror ready to start styling it.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, medium to long length, and this has a decent hold (not great).</li>
            <li> Then either let it dry naturally, or use a diffuser on the dryer and apply heat without the &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; from the dryer.)  </li>
            <li> to thick, imafine trying to style your hair with actual super glue...</li>
            <li> The best use I can think for this is if you have a really bad cow lick in the back that you need to tame.</li>
            <li> It is a little high on  price</li>
            <li> If you use too much of the product you may indeed see small white flakes</li>
            <li> gel lets you do whatever you want with your hair, no matter how small the detail or large the task.</li>
            <li> I use this every day (long or short hair) and a single tube lasts me 6-8 months at a time.</li>
            <li> I use this every day (long or short hair) and a single tube lasts me 6-8 months at a time.</li>
            <li> It requires only a minimal amount of this gel to provide me maximum style and hold.</li>
            <li> When you comb it through, it accumulates towards the tips while leaving the roots unkempt, making my hair curl and lay in strange ways.</li>
            <li> It took a couple tries for me to get it  to work properly, but now it stays in place all day.  </li>
            <li> (Of course, if you WANT the wet look like dapper Don, apply the product with your fingers as before, but use only the comb to give it direction - not the fingers.  </li>
            <li> Turn off the water and bring the finger tips of both hands together and rub the product onto all 8 finger tips (we&#x27;re not including the thumbs here) and all around your fingers coating them with the product from about the second joints down to the tips, taking care not to get the product on the palms of your hands because you are only going to use the fingers to style with!  </li>
            <li> Unlike pomade or gel it manages to dry completely differently than when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let your hair air dry and then apply this product.</li>
            <li> Do not over dry it</li>
            <li> But I hardly even got that far with Crew&#x27;s Superglue, as after about one hour, the gel became visibly flaky in my hair (not to mention it felt weird), and I could easily shake it out--leaving the air around me with little white flakes.    </li>
            <li> Now use your fingers like a comb to apply the product to your damp hair, starting down at the roots of your hair working all the way out to the ends.  </li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t let it dry while you are putting clothes on!)  </li>
            <li> THEN YOUR HAIR IS EITHER TOO WET OR TOO DRY.</li>
            <li> If you see a section that needs a little extra attention, you can re-wet your finger tips on the hand</li>
            <li> but it goes a long way since you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> From now on I&#x27;ll only use it if I&#x27;m going to slick my hair back greaser-style for some reason down the road.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount last all day.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT spend a lot of time doing this or your hair will dry!!!  </li>
            <li> I wet my hair, put just a little dot of superglue in my hair, then use a hairdryer and comb it where I want it to go.  </li>
            <li> ill admit that this stuff really holds and lasts all day in your hair..</li>
            <li> They can be difficult to wash out of your hair, and an absolute nightmare if it starts to rain or somebody messes your hair</li>
            <li> I am a male in my twenties with somewhat thick hair.</li>

            <li> By now it will be a little dryer - no longer dripping.  </li>
            <li> Every day, I put just a small small dot of this on my hand, rub both hands together, and put all my loose ends or what have you where they ought to be.</li>
            <li> Since I discovered the secret of correctly using this product, I am now terrified that American Crew may someday discontinue it!!!  </li>
            <li> Use it a few times like this before you decide how you like it.  </li>
            <li> but when I do use the comb, I avoid combing it slick down to my scalp like Don Draper!  </li>
            <li> I wear my bangs about 3/4 of the way down my forehead (though my bangs do get pieced/textured at the salon so they&#x27;re not as thick as the rest of my hair).    </li>
            <li> I have used their Pomade and Fiber in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry it is no longer made by American Crew.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this product now or in the past so have no idea</li>
            <li> If you need to reactivate the product, a small bit of water on your hands will do the trick.</li>

            <li> hard look.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item with high expectations, but I was thoroughly disappointed by it.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Forget the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> After putting this in, if anything touches or moves my hair, this stuff both loses it&#x27;s hold and flakes</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and unmanageable, it always has been.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything, and I mean EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> You should be squeezing the hair between your fingers while pulling through it to the ends, leaving the product behind.  </li>
            <li> This is very weak and does not hold.</li>
            <li> I like it spiky and randomly scrunched</li>
            <li> Got the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not.</li>
            <li> After applying the gel I had to wash my hands 3-4 separate times and they were still uncomfortably sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li> IF YOU&#x27;RE GETTING BAD RESULTS WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Women can run their hands through your hair and not get crap all over their fingers, and your hair keeps</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me and I&#x27;m sold!  I am a woman with short silver hair.  I like it spiky and randomly scrunched so I don&#x27;t look like my grandmother, and this works the best of any product I&#x27;ve tried in the last few years.  Who care that it&#x27;s marketed for men?</li>
            <li> The best there is.  It gives a very dry, matte finish and the hold is very strong.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Works very very well and will hold your hair in place in storm force winds. Will make your hair kind of crunchy unless you mix the superglue with another hair product (e.g. Pomade or forming wax)</li>
            <li> Have not found any other gel that smells good, holds and forms my hair as well as this. Finally found this after years of searching and will never buy anything else. The perfect Hair gel. Im a male in my 20&#x27;s with short crew cut style hair.</li>
            <li> Came in timely manner! Love, love, love the stuff! I use it on my boys hair to keep it their crew cuts spiked. They love it too. Lasts all day. Sender got it to me just in time!</li>
            <li> I like to keep my hair short and aero-dynamic which ultimately leaves me only 2 styling options: dude or dork. Thus, I need precision results. After a few years of experimentation with various waxes, pomades, creams, and gels, I recently gave this Crew Superglue Gel a shot in my quest to find the ideal dome concoction (in my pursuit of perpetual dude status). It requires only a minimal amount of this gel to provide me maximum style and hold. This is the supreme Doo-Glue.</li>
            <li> ill admit that this stuff really holds and lasts all day in your hair.. for me though it it way to thick, imafine trying to style your hair with actual super glue...</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of different gels and when I got my haircut not to long ago I asked my barber what is really strong and want sweat out and she put some of this in my hair it worked so good I bought some more and I have gym class 1st period and run a mile in gym every day and I and I sweat a lot and this is the only kind that want sweet out it last the same all day love it!!</li>
            <li> Been using this gel for almost 2 years now, simply the best out there. I found it to be way cheaper on Amazon than my barber shop. If you order 3 of them at the same time you won&#x27;t have to pay shipping. Just something to consider if you are trying to save few bucks :-)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t touch your hair after you use it! It will start flaking!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair this is the best product I have ever found.  Only problem is it can flake and look like dandruff if you use too much. Benefit outweighs cons</li>
            <li> This arrived as expected but I don&#x27;t care for it much.  It is super sticky - I feel like it is on my hands all day when I use it.  It also gives my scalp a sticky feeling.  Even after washing my hands multiple times, I still feel like there is a sticky residue on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend had gotten me GYM mega hold a while back as a gift and I really liked that stuff.  It is no longer made.</li>
            <li> Got the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Crew makes several great men&#x27;s hair care products.  I have used their Pomade and Fiber in the past.  While I liked both of those products my hair tended to never stay in place.  Crew Superglue lives up to its name.  Just a small amount last all day.  Works great on short hair and keeps everything in place without looking too wet.  If you use too much of the product you may indeed see small white flakes but when using a reasonable amount I don&#x27;t notice any problems.  Highly recommended and works well.</li>
            <li> Though one tube leaked, overall the product is my favorite.  I am sorry it is no longer made by American Crew.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair gel products on the market and thus far, this works the best for my hair. This is my new gel for a long time, unless a better one is produced.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with high expectations, but I was thoroughly disappointed by it.    Background info: I am a male in my twenties with somewhat thick hair. I wear my bangs about 3/4 of the way down my forehead (though my bangs do get pieced/textured at the salon so they&#x27;re not as thick as the rest of my hair).    I part my bangs to the side of my head so it forms a slope with part of my forehead exposed--product is necessary to make this happen. I have used pomade for a while now with some success, though I tried this product thinking it would have more staying power.    Unfortunately it did not. It was about even with the pomade for staying power and keeping my bangs off to the side--needing readjustments about every hour to move the bangs back into a good position. But I hardly even got that far with Crew&#x27;s Superglue, as after about one hour, the gel became visibly flaky in my hair (not to mention it felt weird), and I could easily shake it out--leaving the air around me with little white flakes.    It seems that the \\&quot;Superglue\\&quot; at first has great staying power but soon becomes an easily dislodged flaky material. I tried it twice just to make sure the flakes weren&#x27;t caused because my hair was a bit more wet the first time, but the second time it was still a flaky mess. Thankfully, both times I tried this product at home on a Sunday afternoon so no one else had to get my hair product flakes on them--or breathe them in for that matter.    Finally, this product is so sticky in its initial form that if you do actually decide to buy it, I suggest literally wearing latex gloves. After applying the gel I had to wash my hands 3-4 separate times and they were still uncomfortably sticky afterwards. Yuck! If only it would stick to my hair as well as it stuck to my hands!</li>
            <li> Superglue? You have to be kidding me. That is false advertising at its best. This is very weak and does not hold. They need to rename this Not So SuperGlue ....If you&#x27;re looking or a real GEL with hold, look to Joico&#x27;s ICE Gel. That my friends is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel also leaves white flakes! Who wants that?! It was very annoying as it looked like dandruff.</li>
            <li> Good product...came quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year.  I just use about a pea size amount for my hair and it stays spiked up all day.  This gel drys clean and doesn&#x27;t get greasy and is easy to wash out of your hair with water.  I use a little water to spread it around in my hair since it is pretty concentrated stuff!</li>
            <li> Every day, I put just a small small dot of this on my hand, rub both hands together, and put all my loose ends or what have you where they ought to be. And by God, they will STAY there for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel lets you do whatever you want with your hair, no matter how small the detail or large the task. Hooray!</li>
            <li> I have not tried this product now or in the past so have no idea but I have never had any complaints about crew products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy with a full head of pretty fine hair that needs some serious holding power in order to keep any kind of shape during the day. I have tried everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. I&#x27;ve never liked the feel of pastes and waxes in my hair, no matter how popular they are. Most gels are flaky and watery, and don&#x27;t work well with my hair type. They can be difficult to wash out of your hair, and an absolute nightmare if it starts to rain or somebody messes your hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget the negative reviews. This stuff isn&#x27;t nightmarishly sticky or anything...you just have to use it correctly, which I&#x27;ll explain. The best way to describe this product is that it&#x27;s a more concentrated version of their Firm Hold gel. It&#x27;s clear and has a pleasant smell. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, shower. Get your hair clean. If you want the best bond to your hair, you need it free of oils (I use American Crew 3 in 1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that your hair is clean, you need to towel dry it. This step is the most important. THIS STEP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. How wet or dry your hair is will play a huge part in how well product works with your hair. IF YOU&#x27;RE GETTING BAD RESULTS WITH THIS PRODUCT THEN YOUR HAIR IS EITHER TOO WET OR TOO DRY. For Super Glue, you need your hair to have some moisture left in it but be on the dry side. I usually rub the towel on my head for a few seconds and call it good. The moisture helps spread the product evenly through your hair. Too much water will dilute the product and reduce it&#x27;s holding power. Don&#x27;t let your hair air dry and then apply this product. It will probably be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last step is to be quick when styling your hair. I use my hands, and shape my hair quickly before the product begins to dry. (Again, a little moisture in your hair will buy you some drying time and improve shine). I start from the back and move to the front. This product also gives your hair a volume boost, which is nice since my hair is fine. I usually do the steps that I just outlined, and then use a TINY bit more to add more volume to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Crew Super Glue dries completely invisible, and is flake free and long as you don&#x27;t use too much. If you need to reactivate the product, a small bit of water on your hands will do the trick. It washes out really easy in the shower, and leaves your hair feeling really soft and conditioned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A little goes a really long way. I use this every day (long or short hair) and a single tube lasts me 6-8 months at a time. USE A PEA SIZE AMOUNT FOR YOUR WHOLE HEAD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.

            <li> This stuff is the worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. Unlike pomade or gel it manages to dry completely differently than when it&#x27;s wet. When you comb it through, it accumulates towards the tips while leaving the roots unkempt, making my hair curl and lay in strange ways. It also leaves visible white flakes if anything touches your hair after it dries. Terrible! The best use I can think for this is if you have a really bad cow lick in the back that you need to tame.</li>
            <li> This was a great item while it lasted.  It was wonderful not to have hairspray all over the floor for a short time.  It was not necessary while this was in use.  I used a tiny bit to move my hair in a better direction, the recipient used it to plaster his hair in place without a secondary spraying.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  It holds very well, and lasts all day.  I find it doesn&#x27;t work as well when my hair is longer, but it&#x27;s my goto otherwise.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and unmanageable, it always has been.  This stuff works on my hair like magic.  It took a couple tries for me to get it  to work properly, but now it stays in place all day.  I wet my hair, put just a little dot of superglue in my hair, then use a hairdryer and comb it where I want it to go.  Best product ever!</li>
            <li> After putting this in, if anything touches or moves my hair, this stuff both loses it&#x27;s hold and flakes so you look like you have a ton of dandruff. From now on I&#x27;ll only use it if I&#x27;m going to slick my hair back greaser-style for some reason down the road.</li>
            <li> Will definitely keep your hair spiked in the front the way a lot of men are wearing their hair these days.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and enjoy the product.&lt;br /&gt;Just recently found it was for sale here, which is quite a bit cheaper then anywhere locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;The product is still great, so I won&#x27;t deduct stars for the recent problems I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the product again (4.23 oz), but received 3.3 oz bottle instead. The sticker attached to the product shows 4.23 oz however, so someone labeled the item wrong.&lt;br /&gt;No problem, I returned the item and ordered again. This order got \\&quot;lost\\&quot; in KY, fair enough.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it a 3rd time and once again received 3.3oz vs 4.23 oz. And again there was a sticker attached to the product stating it was 4.23oz. This occurred with 2 different sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talked to Amazon (helpful each time) and they once again issued a refund and had me order the item again. I&#x27;m hopeful that this time it will be the correct size.</li>
            <li> I really liked thise  product. It is a little high on  price but it goes a long way since you only need a small amount.I highly recommend it it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, medium to long length, and this has a decent hold (not great). My hair needs a lot of product to stay in place, and this stuff flakes....bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised to say, I would actually recommend &amp;#34;Axe Spiking Glue&amp;#34; over this product. It doesn&#x27;t flake and in my experience, it holds and looks better. More of a natural, matte look. http://www.amazon.com/Spiking-Glue-Spiked-Look-Ounce/dp/B00AE07BDU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1409803435&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;axe+hair+paste</li>
            <li> Best gel on the market for keeping hair in place and looking natural. Particularly effective for thinning hair and hard to manage&lt;br /&gt;hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best all-around men&#x27;s hair styling product I&#x27;ve ever used and, believe me, I&#x27;ve used a lot (I was in a hair-band in the 80&#x27;s!!!).  But the first time I used this I really messed up!  The label says use &amp;#34;a generous amount&amp;#34;.  But be warned, if you do this, you will have a sticky/flakey mess, and will most likely need to wash your hair again!  I have fine hair with wave and curl on top that has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  But in order to keep from looking like Mike, Greg, or Peter Brady, I absolutely must use a styling gel and heat to straighten and style it.  Since I discovered the secret of correctly using this product, I am now terrified that American Crew may someday discontinue it!!!  Here&#x27;s how I get straight, natural and healthy-looking hair with this superglue.  What follows may sound a little &amp;#34;specific&amp;#34;, but I just want to be clear on each step and, hopefully, someone may appreciate the details.  ALWAYS start by washing it clean with AC&#x27;s style remover shampoo or equivalent and rinsing it out with hot water.  When you get out of the shower, comb your hair and then KEEP IT WET until you are standing there in front of the mirror ready to start styling it.  (Don&#x27;t let it dry while you are putting clothes on!)  When you are ready to begin, re-wet it if you have to and comb it again directing/setting it to almost the way you will want it to look when you&#x27;re done styling.  By now it will be a little dryer - no longer dripping.  Turn on the hot water to let it get warm while you are applying about a gardenpea-size amount of this product to each finger tip on your left hand (apply it to the right hand fingertips if you are left handed).  Close the tube top and, with the other hand, wet the ends of your fingers under the hot (not scalding) water.  Turn off the water and bring the finger tips of both hands together and rub the product onto all 8 finger tips (we&#x27;re not including the thumbs here) and all around your fingers coating them with the product from about the second joints down to the tips, taking care not to get the product on the palms of your hands because you are only going to use the fingers to style with!  It will feel slimey at first, due to the product/water mixture, but when you feel the product start becoming sticky on your fingers, this is the magic moment and it is time to apply it to your hair!  Now use your fingers like a comb to apply the product to your damp hair, starting down at the roots of your hair working all the way out to the ends.  NOTE- DO NOT spend a lot of time doing this or your hair will dry!!!  You should be squeezing the hair between your fingers while pulling through it to the ends, leaving the product behind.  (You may not need to apply it to the sides if it&#x27;s really short like a &amp;#34;high and tight&amp;#34; cut.  In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t.)  I sometimes use the comb again at this point, if I feel like having a part or more shine that day - but when I do use the comb, I avoid combing it slick down to my scalp like Don Draper!  Now grab that hair dryer and apply LOW heat while pulling your hair between your fingers in the direction you want it to set (still using the fingers only!).  Do not over dry it or you&#x27;ll get &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; without shine!  Stop drying it when it just does hold the hair on its own.  It should be holding with just the right amount of shine that says this is healthy hair, but without the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; hard look.  (Of course, if you WANT the wet look like dapper Don, apply the product with your fingers as before, but use only the comb to give it direction - not the fingers.  Then either let it dry naturally, or use a diffuser on the dryer and apply heat without the &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; from the dryer.)  Now look at your hair.  If you see a section that needs a little extra attention, you can re-wet your finger tips on the hand you&#x27;re going to use to do the touch-up and reshape that section.  You may not even need the hair dryer at this point.  When you&#x27;re satisfiedwith the look of your hair, wash the product off your fingers and you&#x27;re done, man!  When used correctly, your hair will have shine and plenty of all-day holding power, but will look natural - not wet and &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34;!  Again, the keys are: 1) not using too much product, 2) mixing the right amount of water with it on your fingertips, and 3) applying it to hair that is just the right amount damp-dry.  Use it a few times like this before you decide how you like it.  I&#x27;m so glad I gave it another chance after screwing it up the first time.  My wife loves the look of my hair now.</li>
