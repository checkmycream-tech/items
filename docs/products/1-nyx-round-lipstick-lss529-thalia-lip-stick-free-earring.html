            <li>They are very similar and are very beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try yet but thank love the color.</li>
            <li>I really love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>LOVE this color &amp;</li>
            <li>One of my top favorite shades.</li>
            <li>I love this lip color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>love this lips</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars though because it has kind of a metallic sheen to it that in my opinion makes it look cheap.</li>
            <li>But with this color, it is a beautiful natural color that compliment my complexion and lips.</li>
            <li>Perfect nude pink shade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice with a complimentary lip liner, but I don&#x27;t like it with a matching one.</li>
            <li>It is always sold out, I am so glad that I am able to order and quickly receive this lipstick as it is now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and makes my lips feel moisturized which is great especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Perfect for brunettes with a little bronzer and a bit of a smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice color one coat goes on sheer and as you add more it becomes more opaque.</li>
            <li>, smooth feel and it lasts.</li>
            <li>so I ordered it and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, the texture is soft, and it goes on nice!</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite shade of lipstick.</li>
            <li>I am real light skin with big lips</li>
            <li>Nice basic neutral lipstick.</li>
            <li>It wears exactly as it looks on Pinterest.</li>
            <li>but this color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>so therefore certain colors do not look right on me.</li>
            <li>Very flattering too!</li>
            <li>i rarely wear brown lip stick and was really dissapointed, i wanted a mauve.</li>
            <li>However, if you apply minimal amounts and then top it off with some lip balm or something it looks more natural and sexy-I think.</li>
            <li>I am a college student with limited funds with a passion for make-up so this dupe is amazing to look fabulous but still not overspend for a lipstick that is very similar and over marketed and hyped up by make-up gurus.</li>
            <li>It shipped to me really fast</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing feel.</li>
            <li>Very purplish and off.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty color, looks just like my lips, only shinier and healthier.</li>
            <li>To make it look a little better you can use a lip liner.</li>
            <li>but it ended up being a light pink that was almost neon.</li>
            <li>The end is a clear plastic piece with a sample of the lipstick color inside it.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>It was a little more on the lilac/purple side than I expected.</li>
            <li>Great to wear when your eye make-up is heavy or dramatic.</li>
            <li>not the color shown, its brown not pink, a sort brown mauve.</li>
            <li>the color shown here as Thalia is one of the other colors, which i got and really like.</li>

            <li> My complaint is that the color does not last long enough!!</li>
            <li> It is a beige with a touch of pink.</li>
            <li> You can compare it to Nicki minaj&#x27;s Pink Friday by MAC</li>

            <li> My only complaint is with the case which was poorly made.</li>
            <li> I am usually all about the gloss</li>

            <li> I kept seeing instagram pictures using this, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s nice with a complimentary lip liner, but I don&#x27;t like it with a matching one.</li>
            <li> When buying online you always take a risk with color accuracy. I saw this on Pinterest and loved it so I ordered it and was not disappointed.I would describe the color as mauve. I just ordered two more tubes because it became my go to lipstick. It&#x27;s a great lipstick for the price. My only complaint is with the case which was poorly made. The end is a clear plastic piece with a sample of the lipstick color inside it. That piece broke off. It didn&#x27;t interfere with the functionality at all but it would have been nice if it had stayed intact.</li>
            <li> Perfect nude pink shade.  Great texture on the lips</li>
            <li> Little earrings were included with the lipstic. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice color one coat goes on sheer and as you add more it becomes more opaque.</li>
            <li> One of my fave lipsticks. Lasts all day &amp; its a great color on.</li>
            <li> Found this lipstick on Pinterest and was surprised to see how little it cost. It wears exactly as it looks on Pinterest. Perfect for brunettes with a little bronzer and a bit of a smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need the earrings, but thank you anyway.</li>
            <li> It was a little more on the lilac/purple side than I expected.</li>
            <li> It is always sold out, I am so glad that I am able to order and quickly receive this lipstick as it is now my go to!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick. I am a frugal shopper and I found it to be a dupe for MAC Brave. They are very similar and are very beautiful colors. NYX Thalia is $7.70 where Mac Brave is $16.00. I am a college student with limited funds with a passion for make-up so this dupe is amazing to look fabulous but still not overspend for a lipstick that is very similar and over marketed and hyped up by make-up gurus. I wear it to work, school, in the evening, to graduations. It is just that amazing. PURCHASE IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT ! It shipped to me really fast and I was so excited to try it that I wore it around my house with no place to go. To make it look a little better you can use a lip liner. I used NYX Expresso, it is about $3.00 at a beauty supply store or $3.50 on  http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/p-117-slim-lip-pencil.aspx</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try yet but thank love the color.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying a stick of lipstick. I am usually all about the gloss but this color is so pretty. It is a beige with a touch of pink. It provides the perfect natural tone for lips. Great to wear when your eye make-up is heavy or dramatic.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color, looks just like my lips, only shinier and healthier. Very moisturizing feel. I really love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color &amp; my store is out of it so it&#x27;s a great purchase for me</li>
            <li> One of my top favorite shades. Great for Olive skin tone!</li>
            <li> Really, love this product the color was wonderful and I found it on You-Tube from&lt;br /&gt;an advertisement while looking for something...wow</li>
            <li> I love this lip color. It&#x27;s pretty, the texture is soft, and it goes on nice! My complaint is that the color does not last long enough!! But that&#x27;s it. It came in quickly on time and in perfect condition. Would buy again from the seller.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. I am real light skin with big lips lol so therefore certain colors do not look right on me. But with this color, it is a beautiful natural color that compliment my complexion and lips. My boyfriend always complained about certain colors I would try, but he likes this one and so do I.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lipstick! Great color, smooth feel and it lasts. Very flattering too! I will definitely by it again</li>
            <li> love this lips stick i am fair skinned blonde to light brown hair and this color look great on me!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite shade of lipstick. I usually wear a lot of eye makeup so I prefer softer shades on my lips. It&#x27;s very smooth and makes my lips feel moisturized which is great especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> not the color shown, its brown not pink, a sort brown mauve. i rarely wear brown lip stick and was really dissapointed, i wanted a mauve. the color shown here as Thalia is one of the other colors, which i got and really like.</li>

            <li> Nice basic neutral lipstick. I gave it three stars though because it has kind of a metallic sheen to it that in my opinion makes it look cheap. However, if you apply minimal amounts and then top it off with some lip balm or something it looks more natural and sexy-I think.</li>
            <li> Perfect lipstick for a neutral and natural look I loveeeee it!</li>
