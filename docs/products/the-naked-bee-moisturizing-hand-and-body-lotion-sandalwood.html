            <li>The sandalwood scent seems to be a bit off and is not that appealing.</li>
            <li>The Naked Bee makes a wonderful lotion but this scent was not sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood Hand &amp; Body Lotion has a very clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>If you like a strong Sandalwood fragrance, then this a product for you.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>soaks into your skin, and leaves it feeling smooth and satiny feeling.  </li>
            <li>While I was hoping for a more masculine scent instead of feminine, I enjoyed using this lotion.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing lotion for dry skin and elbows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sweet smelling, but not overly</li>
            <li>its to strong smell  leaves skin smooth but fragrance is to much</li>
            <li>A little Sandwood smells good so a whole lot of Sandalwood must be even better</li>
            <li>Came right away.</li>
            <li>Scent is strong; the lotion is fast absorbing and leaves your skin silky.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my friend who loves the scent and she can&#x27;t get enough of it, so if you love Sandalwood</li>
            <li>I love all the Naked Bee products.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent just wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>which explains why it costs so much.</li>
            <li>In fact, it felt very drying.  </li>
            <li>The item name is very deceptive and the lotion does not smell like sandalwood.</li>
            <li>SO smooth and really hydrates all day long.</li>
            <li>I love the soft, slightly musky sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>It goes on creamy and then leaves no slick feeling after drying.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little strong for me -</li>
            <li>Thanks, Naked Bee.</li>
            <li>This is why I use it so frequently that I need to replenish the supply, which makes it costly.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly (I ordered it late Sunday night, and it was here Tuesday).</li>
            <li>I plan to get some for myself in the near future.  </li>

            <li> I have constantly uber dry hands, and this lotion moisturizes them WITHOUT being greasy!</li>
            <li> Scent seems like an imitation of sandalwood; sorry I spent what I did on this, but glad it&#x27;s only 2.25 ounces.</li>
            <li> (I have REALLY dry hands).</li>
            <li> I am keeping it because it smells nice but am adding it to a base oil (emu oil) that will give my skin the moisturization it needs.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might not provide as much moisturizing as I wanted .It</li>
            <li> Just because of the girly scent, I would add a few drops of tea tree oil to man it up a bit.</li>
            <li> Very thin and smells like an old lady.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed because it does not smell like Sandalwood at all.</li>
            <li> It helps combat the dryness that cold winters can cause.</li>
            <li> The disappointing thing for me is that I did not find this product to be moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed when it arrived</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is just awful!  </li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t find sandalwood in any store. This scent is very relaxing and great for summer, winter whenever.  Great product.  Hope they keep making it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is delightfully scented but also feels wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel greasy. It absorbs perfectly. The scent lasts &amp; lasts too.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent and quality lotion</li>
            <li> This is  the best real sandlewood</li>
            <li> its to strong smell  leaves skin smooth but fragrance is to much</li>
            <li> I did not like this scent at all. I love sandalwood scent and was looking forward to my delivery. Very disappointed when it arrived and I tried it out. Does not smell like sandalwood at all!</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly (I ordered it late Sunday night, and it was here Tuesday). I love the smell, though it is pronounced (good thing I love Sandalwood). The only thing I am upset about is I thought that it would be a bigger bottle. Granted I didn&#x27;t look at the ounces before purchasing, I guess I just assumed that for $7.99 I would be getting more. I didn&#x27;t know it was organic either, though I do like that it is, which explains why it costs so much. We&#x27;ll see how well it moisturizes, if it&#x27;s really good I will buy more!</li>
            <li> While I was hoping for a more masculine scent instead of feminine, I enjoyed using this lotion. Great moisturizing lotion for dry skin and elbows. Just because of the girly scent, I would add a few drops of tea tree oil to man it up a bit.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing, the sandalwood is great but it&#x27;s a little strong for me - I gave it to my friend who loves the scent and she can&#x27;t get enough of it, so if you love Sandalwood this is for you!</li>
            <li> Husband loves this lotion. Uses after shaving.</li>
            <li> Very thin and smells like an old lady.  I am pretty disappointed because it does not smell like Sandalwood at all.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Naked Bee. I love the soft, slightly musky sandalwood scent. The feel of this lotion has everyone in my office asking to use it (darn it). It goes on creamy and then leaves no slick feeling after drying. Great moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Exactly what I wanted and a reasonable price.  Delivery was on time and packaging good.</li>
            <li> The fragrance last, unlike some lotions and because of that I was afraid it might not provide as much moisturizing as I wanted .It does though. This is an excellent lotion. I ordered two and will order more.</li>
            <li> The product lives up to its description and the Sandalwood aroma is authentic. This is why I use it so frequently that I need to replenish the supply, which makes it costly.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is just awful!  Nothing like sandalwood.  I love the oatmeal and honey and will stick with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell and feel. SO smooth and really hydrates all day long.</li>
            <li> The lotion aspect of this product is really good.  I have used it in my hands and lower legs and it moisturizes the skin quite well.  The problem is the fragrance is too pronounced, people can smell you 10 feet before you get there.  A little Sandwood smells good so a whole lot of Sandalwood must be even better or so their thinking goes.  If you like a strong Sandalwood fragrance, then this a product for you.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood Hand &amp; Body Lotion has a very clean fragrance.  It&#x27;s a bit sweet smelling, but not overly so.&lt;br /&gt;It soaks into your skin, and leaves it feeling smooth and satiny feeling.  It helps combat the dryness that cold winters can cause.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels very nice going on and isn&#x27;t sticky.  It smells delightful also!</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly but very strong. It fades after a while. The disappointing thing for me is that I did not find this product to be moisturizing at all. In fact, it felt very drying.  I am keeping it because it smells nice but am adding it to a base oil (emu oil) that will give my skin the moisturization it needs. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Scent seems like an imitation of sandalwood; sorry I spent what I did on this, but glad it&#x27;s only 2.25 ounces.</li>
            <li> Naked Bee makes a wonderful Hand Cream!!! Product is exceptional!!! Fragrance lovely!!! Makes a wonderful gift also!!!&lt;br /&gt;Try any of their wonderful hand creams and products!!!</li>
            <li> When I smelled this scent, I loved it.  I plan to get some for myself in the near future.  Buy it and you will want more.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> There is no sandalwood in the product.  I was actually looking specifically for just sandalwood, but bought this lotion since I could not find any just sandalwood.  The item name is very deceptive and the lotion does not smell like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Scent is strong; the lotion is fast absorbing and leaves your skin silky. If the scent was milder I would use it all over.</li>
            <li> Great product, great smell.  I love all the Naked Bee products.  Came right away.</li>
            <li> Actually the product is what I wanted. Please fix my name, Its Mary Ann Graboyes&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> LOL, not literally...but it SMELLS yummy and it works great (I have REALLY dry hands). There is a reason I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> The sandalwood scent seems to be a bit off and is not that appealing. The Naked Bee makes a wonderful lotion but this scent was not sandalwood.</li>
            <li> My all-time fave fragrance. Awesome lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the scent just wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I am such a convert to the Naked Bee products!  They are an amazing value and work incredibly well!  I have constantly uber dry hands, and this lotion moisturizes them WITHOUT being greasy! And smells out of this world!!!!</li>
