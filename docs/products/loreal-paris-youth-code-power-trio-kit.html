            <li>My skin feels and looks better.  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy more.</li>
            <li>My math skills may be unreliable but I think that this is a deal, if you want one or more of these products.</li>

            <li>I did not expect miracles but this stuff made my skin more and more refined.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal products always deliver</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells so good.</li>
            <li>im very sensitive to products and this one works great</li>
            <li>Works great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>also use the L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code BB Cream SPF 15 on top during the day, and it also has a light, smooth feel.</li>
            <li>Nice set of smaller sizes which is good since I always end up throwing some away.</li>
            <li>cleanser is smooth and easy to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>For me the Youth Code line has been superior and more beneficial than Clean &amp; Clear and Olay</li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference in my skin since using this</li>
            <li>Will be buying the regular size as this is great for travel.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is light and does not contain SPF.</li>
            <li>Ten bucks for generous sample sizes of three great products.</li>
            <li>Small containers are perfect for travel too.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and soft and I just love it!</li>
            <li>The serum is light and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Was super excited to receive this...only to find out the things in the boxes</li>
            <li>will be buying full size bottles.</li>
            <li>It did not feel like the full size</li>
            <li>Maybe all organic all natural instead of a magic serum in a bottle with strong perfumes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great base for putting on makeup with a flawless finish!</li>
            <li>also.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I swear it looked dewy and GORGEOUS, and even more healthy than usual!!</li>
            <li>a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have normal to oily skin (in the winter my skin is more sensitive though) and have found the Youth Code product line has brought more balance to my skin.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I have super oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t mind so much because it leaves the texture of my skin so smooth that I was willing to put up with it for a day or two.</li>
            <li>thank you very much merry christmas</li>
            <li>The 3 products combined left my skin feeling very smooth and nice, whereas my skin is usually rough, bumpy and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My face is left feeling super fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It definitely gives skin a more nourished look.  </li>
            <li>but I always check. ; )  </li>
            <li>Thanks again, Loreal Paris, and Amazon as always!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth my face feels and look.</li>
            <li>I always run out of the face wash first, then the serum before I run out of the cream.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Power Trio Kit is a great starter kit but be forwarned, these bottles are very small and might not last you more than 2-3 weeks depending on how much you use and how often you use it.</li>
            <li>Make my skin feel so soft and smooth, and they really do help to soften the wrinkles in my 68 yo skin.  </li>
            <li>This starter kit lets you try small sample versions of these skin products at a good price.  </li>
            <li>As a lady of a certain age, this is just what I need.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new skincare regimen, and although I had never tried L&#x27;oreal before, I liked how this was a complete kit with smaller sized cleanser, serum and day/night</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the DAY/NIGHT SERUM covered my whole face with ONE FINGERTIP DROP for each side of my face/neck,  (3.)</li>
            <li>I got it fast and two days after I started using this product</li>
            <li>For example, just a dot of the face wash is all you need to leave your skin feeling fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>The products in the Youth Code line are available in larger full sized bottles, sold separately, and will last you much longer</li>
            <li>And, although the containers are small, a little bit goes along way with these excellent skin care items.  </li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and have ALWAYS WASHED MY FACE WITH MILD SOAP (Ivory Bar SOAP;  just like Mama) and used a light moisturizer on my fairly dry, but VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just very glad to see that I can buy it on Amazon b/c they don&#x27;t sell the kits at Target (at least not at mine anymore) or Walmart.</li>
            <li>The first time using this product my face felt so soft.</li>
            <li>In the future I plan to purchase the full size products.  </li>
            <li>In my next order to Amazon I plan to purchase the full size.</li>
            <li>1 PEA SIZED drop of the CLEANSER washed my whole face in a creamy lather which you then rinse off and pat dry with a clean towel,  (2.)</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you give it</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed how velvety soft my face was!!</li>
            <li>it has lasted more than a few weeks already.</li>
            <li>In a matter of weeks my face looked more hydrated with less visible lines - overall looks much healthier!</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone in between products or deciding on something new.</li>
            <li>chest area are very soft and supple looking and feeling</li>
            <li>i think youth code is a neat facial moisterizer i usually like the Olay one in the bottle around ten the best at walmart that pink one</li>
            <li>No powerful smell, light and no allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>But just happened upon the L&#x27;Oreal website looking for info on a different product and saw that they recommend YouthCode for women in their 30s who are showing their first signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, however, the sizes were so small it only lasted for about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I paid around $8 for this trio kit, since then the price has gone up more than $3, if the price drops back down</li>
            <li>Secondly, I can see a real difference.</li>
            <li>Of all the facial cleanser products I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only line that doesn&#x27;t make me break out right after I use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, but the products are so lightly fragranced that I hardly smell them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This trio seemed off I had L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s  youth code before and loved it.this &amp;#34;Power Trio&amp;#34; was a triple disappointment.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The containers are surprisingly classy looking, all silver, white and black.</li>
            <li> Pores were nearly unnoticeable after about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> I saw an immediate impact on my dry, winter skin.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived with signs this was not a new item.</li>
            <li> All very small, the cream is likely to last you the longest.</li>
            <li> The jar of cream was missing from the box.  </li>
            <li> My mother-in-law likes it and uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Thank got I just purchased this small kit.</li>
            <li> Expensive for the size, it&#x27;s way too small.</li>
            <li> I have problems with my face being oily and broken out from hormonal issues.</li>
            <li> , the DAY/NIGHT MOISTURIZER also used A THIN FINGERTIP AMOUNT on each side of my face/neck.  </li>
            <li> Arrived without the cleanser :(</li>

            <li> My face is left feeling super fresh and clean.  The serum has helped peel away layers of dead skin gently while the cream has sealed in moisture and nutrients.</li>
            <li> Great starter set- it has lasted more than a few weeks already. Would recommend this to anyone in between products or deciding on something new.</li>
            <li> Arrived without the cleanser :(</li>
            <li> I liked the product, however, the sizes were so small it only lasted for about 2 weeks.  The price was not commensurate with the quantity. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was super excited to receive this...only to find out the things in the boxes WEREN&#x27;T what they were supposed to be. None to happy about that.</li>
            <li> These L&#x27;Oreal products are great!  Make my skin feel so soft and smooth, and they really do help to soften the wrinkles in my 68 yo skin.  Small containers are perfect for travel too.  Well worth the price.  As always, Amazon always delivers on whatever I order in warp time and in good condition.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Nice set of smaller sizes which is good since I always end up throwing some away. Wash is really nice and moisterizer work great.</li>
            <li> I like this product. No powerful smell, light and no allergic reactions. Definitely recommend this product. Will be buying the regular size as this is great for travel. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very good skincare trio.  Nice texture and good moisture for neck and face. Quality one expects from L&#x27;Oriel.</li>
            <li> I found this on clearance after Christmas at Target and have been using it for a week now. I love it. First of all, it smells so good. And the scent lingers especially at night when I&#x27;m not covering it up with makeup. Secondly, I can see a real difference. I had been using Mary Kay&#x27;s Timewise system and thought I loved it. But just happened upon the L&#x27;Oreal website looking for info on a different product and saw that they recommend YouthCode for women in their 30s who are showing their first signs of aging. So when I just happened to see it cheaper on the shelf at Target I grabbed it. I&#x27;m just very glad to see that I can buy it on Amazon b/c they don&#x27;t sell the kits at Target (at least not at mine anymore) or Walmart. I did see it at Walgreen&#x27;s tonight but it was $24.99. My skin feels so smooth and soft and I just love it!</li>
            <li> This kit works wonders....my skins feels n looks great</li>
            <li> I have problems with my face being oily and broken out from hormonal issues. This stuff smells amazing and works well. Doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> Love the products face neck  chest area are very soft and supple looking and feeling im very sensitive to products and this one works great</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new skincare regimen, and although I had never tried L&#x27;oreal before, I liked how this was a complete kit with smaller sized cleanser, serum and day/night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The containers are surprisingly classy looking, all silver, white and black. They look really nice in my medicine cabinet or on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, but the products are so lightly fragranced that I hardly smell them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is smooth and easy to rinse off.  The serum is light and dries quickly. The moisturizer is light and does not contain SPF. The 3 products combined left my skin feeling very smooth and nice, whereas my skin is usually rough, bumpy and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code BB Cream SPF 15 on top during the day, and it also has a light, smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and makes your skin nice and smooth. It&#x27;s a great base for putting on makeup with a flawless finish!</li>
            <li> It definitely gives skin a more nourished look.  My skin feels and looks better.  I&#x27;ll order again and continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have always loved ALL  &amp;#34;L&#x27;OREAL PARIS&amp;#34;  make up, skin care, and hair coloring. They also have great shampoos, conditioners, styling products, and much more. I am 48 years old and have ALWAYS WASHED MY FACE WITH MILD SOAP (Ivory Bar SOAP;  just like Mama) and used a light moisturizer on my fairly dry, but VERY sensitive skin. I have good skin, but I&#x27;m no fool-- it&#x27;s going to begin changing eventually.&lt;br /&gt;So I went to &amp;#34;L&#x27;OREAL PARIS AGE STOP/REWIND PRODUCTS&amp;#34;  and found this &amp;#34;TRIO&amp;#34; WHICH HAS THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS &#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY AWESOME PRODUCTS:  (1.)  1 PEA SIZED drop of the CLEANSER washed my whole face in a creamy lather which you then rinse off and pat dry with a clean towel,  (2.) the DAY/NIGHT SERUM covered my whole face with ONE FINGERTIP DROP for each side of my face/neck,  (3.) and the thickest product, the DAY/NIGHT MOISTURIZER also used A THIN FINGERTIP AMOUNT on each side of my face/neck.  I am truly sooo impressed!! Even my husband noticed how velvety soft my face was!! I swear it looked dewy and GORGEOUS, and even more healthy than usual!! I am going to buy more. I cannot find it cheaper than AMAZON. (THIS DOESN&#x27;T SURPRISE ME--but I always check. ; )  Thanks again, Loreal Paris, and Amazon as always!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Is perfect I like it and is very smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time using this product my face felt so soft. I applied all three steps.</li>
            <li> The jar of cream was missing from the box.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> No problems with de purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My math skills may be unreliable but I think that this is a deal, if you want one or more of these products. Ten bucks for generous sample sizes of three great products.</li>
            <li> I saw this trio by chance and decided to buy, under $10? Yes pls...I got it fast and two days after I started using this product I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth my face feels and look. I went back and order four more, this kit will be perfect for when I travel.</li>
            <li> Item arrived with signs this was not a new item. Box had lots of signs of wear, and product looked like it had been used. There was a CVS sticker on the box, looked like someone bought this and didn&#x27;t like it so decided to sell it on Amazon. I would expect this on E-bay, but not Amazon. When I contacted the seller they said too bad, and I would have to pay to return it, even though the defect was theirs! I would not recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Perfect for traveling or as a gift. However, it does cause bumps once in a while. I really didn&#x27;t mind so much because it leaves the texture of my skin so smooth that I was willing to put up with it for a day or two. It also smells nice! I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for her birthday i think youth code is a neat facial moisterizer i usually like the Olay one in the bottle around ten the best at walmart that pink one i also like loreal hair dye some times thank you very much merry christmas</li>
            <li> Great product works well but i didnt realize this was trial size will be buying full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and large pores.  I did not expect miracles but this stuff made my skin more and more refined. Pores were nearly unnoticeable after about a week and a half.  I used it daily.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Expensive for the size, it&#x27;s way too small.</li>
            <li> I am going back to my ususal Loreal products that I&#x27;ve been using for years..thought I would try something different.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great hydration for your skin</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal products always deliver</li>
            <li> Of all the facial cleanser products I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only line that doesn&#x27;t make me break out right after I use it. I love it. Works great for sensitive skin! Moisturizers are very nice also.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Did not work well with my skin</li>
            <li> It worked, it arrived as described.  In the future I plan to purchase the full size products.  In my next order to Amazon I plan to purchase the full size.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because I felt I has pouring alcohol on my face. I honestly didn&#x27;t like it. Though I guess it depends what works for you. My mother-in-law likes it and uses it everyday. Thank got I just purchased this small kit.</li>
            <li> This trio seemed off I had L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s  youth code before and loved it.this &amp;#34;Power Trio&amp;#34; was a triple disappointment.It did not feel like the full size one&#x27;s I purchased before.Maybe they changed their formula?Either way another product in the trash for me.Maybe all organic all natural instead of a magic serum in a bottle with strong perfumes.</li>
            <li> I like this line of skin care but for the price,  these trial size bottles just do not have enough product to see any change.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Power Trio Kit is a great starter kit but be forwarned, these bottles are very small and might not last you more than 2-3 weeks depending on how much you use and how often you use it. The serum is 1.0 fl oz. The face wash is 1.0 fl oz. And the cream is 0.5 fl oz. All very small, the cream is likely to last you the longest. I always run out of the face wash first, then the serum before I run out of the cream. The products in the Youth Code line are available in larger full sized bottles, sold separately, and will last you much longer but this is a great kit for a first timer to try out! I paid around $8 for this trio kit, since then the price has gone up more than $3, if the price drops back down I highly recommend you give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have normal to oily skin (in the winter my skin is more sensitive though) and have found the Youth Code product line has brought more balance to my skin. I can see a huge difference in my skin since using this (I have been using the Youth Code product line for 3 months now). In a matter of weeks my face looked more hydrated with less visible lines - overall looks much healthier! The best part is I don&#x27;t break out using it, and it does not have a strong odor to me at all. For me the Youth Code line has been superior and more beneficial than Clean &amp; Clear and Olay so I will be sticking with Youth Code for many months and years to come!</li>
            <li> This starter kit lets you try small sample versions of these skin products at a good price.  And, although the containers are small, a little bit goes along way with these excellent skin care items.  For example, just a dot of the face wash is all you need to leave your skin feeling fresh and soft.  I saw an immediate impact on my dry, winter skin.  As a lady of a certain age, this is just what I need. I am so pleased.</li>
