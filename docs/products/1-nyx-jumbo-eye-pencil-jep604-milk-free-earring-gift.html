            <li>I LOVE to use this as an eyeshadow primer</li>

            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Got here fast was great</li>
            <li>This eye pencil is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Did not receive any free earring gift but that is okay</li>
            <li>In addition, the free earrings are adorable.</li>
            <li>Also works great in your waterline to look more awake and bigger eyes.</li>
            <li>Also a great primer for light shadow, especially for a cut crease look.</li>
            <li>It goes on your eyelids so smoothly.</li>
            <li>The texture is light and creamy, and it goes on like a dream.</li>
            <li>Most amazing white eyeliner though so creamy and pigmented</li>
            <li>I used this for Special Effect Makeup and it is worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Check out my full review on this product on my instagram @raizyfriedmua</li>
            <li>Perfect for highlighting the brow bone, inner water line, and inner &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; of eye!</li>
            <li>On YouTube, you&#x27;ll find many tutorials on how to use this for many different looks.</li>
            <li>The actual pigmentation is super opaque and the wearability is great; After drying, I pretty much had to use a makeup wipe, as soap and water just wouldnt cut it.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice color, a very smooth application, but a little too creamy for me.</li>
            <li>It amazing how something simple can enhance makeup.  </li>
            <li>It gives a really good base for colors - bright and natural, and has great texture.</li>
            <li>and it is every thing you think and plus got the blue rose earrings too very cute and it sealed pretty good nothing wrong</li>
            <li>So maybe if you know more about makeup than I do or have really dry eyelids, this would be fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not messy at all!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>definitely makes my eye shadows stand out more</li>
            <li>and i stepped on it within the first week...</li>
            <li>It really helps make my eyes POP!</li>
            <li>Just okay, idk the big fuss, but it does work well as a primer.</li>
            <li>Not sure if theres a way to get more out after the top?</li>
            <li>Also good for everyday wear!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made cheap, though, because it has a little &amp;#34;drip&amp;#34; on the edge of both of them, but they&#x27;re free, so who cares?</li>
            <li>came very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Lasts all day and makes your makeup look really pigmented.</li>
            <li>Also the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>The backs on them is just a small piece of plastic that is very quick to slip off, so I will have to get a cheap pair of earrings from somewhere or something with metal backs</li>
            <li>The top cracked, but i think that was my doing in pushing it down too far.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially since its not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>The earrings it came with are pretty big.</li>
            <li>the price was good and and its hard to find at places where they sell NYX product because its usually sold out.</li>
            <li>The pencil really gives a good base for eye shadows.</li>

            <li> this pencil is great for priming the eyelids before the application of shadows. it is also great for the water line to brighten up the eyes. the price was good and and its hard to find at places where they sell NYX product because its usually sold out. i RECOMEND this product. -XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> I just started using this product. I only wear makeup occasionally.  However, the jumbo eye pencil works wonders. It amazing how something simple can enhance makeup.  I will cont&#x27; to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> definitely makes my eye shadows stand out more and i stepped on it within the first week...yeah i need another one</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion and in great condition. The top cracked, but i think that was my doing in pushing it down too far. Love this product. Great to use as a primer before applying eyeshadows. It really helps make my eyes POP!</li>
            <li> Perfect for highlighting the brow bone, inner water line, and inner &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; of eye! Also a great primer for light shadow, especially for a cut crease look. So many uses! Great produst. Check out my full review on this product on my instagram @raizyfriedmua</li>
            <li> came very well packaged.  Item was as described.  This makes a great base to your makeup and helps eye shadow pop and stick on longer.</li>
            <li> I love it. It looks great when I add on eye shadow. I wanted a white eye shadow that wouldn&#x27;t fade away and I can say with this product I&#x27;m satisfy, great eye pencil. want your eye shadow to look brighter and stay on longer then this is the pencil for you.</li>
            <li> Great primer of you want your eyeshadow to pop. Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I read, heard, and saw a ton of reviews on this pencil so I finally just got it. I ordered on the 24th and received on the 26th, with regular ground shipping. The pencil really gives a good base for eye shadows. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using as a substitute, but only in addition to a primer - even concealer if that&#x27;s what you use. It gives a really good base for colors - bright and natural, and has great texture. A definite Recommend. Also, came with the little pink earrings. Just as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Great product but isn&#x27;t it supposed to roll up to get more product? It can&#x27;t be that the tip of the pencil is the only product you get.. Maybe mine is defective. I&#x27;ll probably just buy another from target when this is gone. Most amazing white eyeliner though so creamy and pigmented</li>
            <li> The color is matte and has no shimmering effect at all, but it does go on well. Packaging was terrible because it was wrapped in bubble wrap with a piece of tape. earrings wornt very cute either but my sister would keep them. Regret purchasing big time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE to use this as an eyeshadow primer, it makes the colors stand out! I highly recommend it, especially since its not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> I used this for Special Effect Makeup and it is worth the buy! Easy to use and not messy at all! Also good for everyday wear!</li>
            <li> Did not receive any free earring gift but that is okay (that is why the three stars). I suppose also because I love the milk pencil but I noticed my makeup creases something awful when I do a white look or NYX milk base. I do not have oily skin not that that matters on your lids but, good to know.</li>
            <li> I love this. (: On YouTube, you&#x27;ll find many tutorials on how to use this for many different looks. I can&#x27;t wait to start using it! Only thing. I bought a sharpener for it because so many people said it&#x27;s near impossible to sharpen. I got a jumbo yellow one at Home Depot for like $2 but it broke the pencil. /: How else do I sharpen it without going caveman on it &amp; sharpening it with a knife? Anyway. I&#x27;ll find a way to sharpen it. The earrings it came with are pretty big. They&#x27;re made cheap, though, because it has a little &amp;#34;drip&amp;#34; on the edge of both of them, but they&#x27;re free, so who cares? I just cut it off &amp; wore them. Lol anyway, great product. (:</li>
            <li> Got here fast was great</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best eye primer. Lasts all day and makes your makeup look really pigmented. Stays in place doesn&#x27;t sweat off and because its a pencil it ill last a long time. Going to stock up on these. Also the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great product. Can be used in the waterline, great as an eyeshadow base or eyeshadow. Can even be used as eyeliner to create an ombre look.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice color, a very smooth application, but a little too creamy for me. Maybe I needed to apply powder or something else under or over it, but after about an hour I looked in the mirror and had a white crease line on my eyelids.  So maybe if you know more about makeup than I do or have really dry eyelids, this would be fine.</li>
            <li> I love this I use this on my brow bone as a base every time I wear eye shadow and my inner corner. Also works great in your waterline to look more awake and bigger eyes. Only down fall is its really hard to sharpen. There&#x27;s tips on YouTube but haven&#x27;t tried them out yet.</li>
            <li> Loving it arrived on the quickness</li>
            <li> Just okay, idk the big fuss, but it does work well as a primer. Not sure if theres a way to get more out after the top?</li>
            <li> This eye pencil is phenomenal. The texture is light and creamy, and it goes on like a dream. The actual pigmentation is super opaque and the wearability is great; After drying, I pretty much had to use a makeup wipe, as soap and water just wouldnt cut it. In addition, the free earrings are adorable. I got pink roses in my package. My only complaint about this product as a whole is actually with the earrings. The backs on them is just a small piece of plastic that is very quick to slip off, so I will have to get a cheap pair of earrings from somewhere or something with metal backs so they won&#x27;t fall out of my ears and get lost.</li>
