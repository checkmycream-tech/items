            <li>This is my favorite perfume to date.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and would definitely recommend it to my sister and others!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mom, it&#x27;s her favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love KNOWING</li>
            <li>I love knowing  by estee lauder because I get compliments everywhere</li>
            <li>I have worn this more years than I care to admit, still love the fragrance I love it</li>
            <li>It is my wife&#x27;s favorite, and has been since she was a girl.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li>Its one of her favorite perfume</li>
            <li>Could not find in most stores</li>
            <li>I love it and my husband love it too.</li>
            <li>Complete strangers will come up to me and say: &amp;#34;You smell good!</li>
            <li>but I trusted customer reviews;  I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, is a bit strong</li>
            <li>How elegant and rich the smell.</li>
            <li>Buying on-line thru Amazon was easy and saved a couple bucks.</li>
            <li>and I still receive many compliments - not overpowering or sweet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s still available online, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fragrance that is enduring, pleasing, not too floral or spicy, and very feminine.</li>
            <li>AND THE PERFUME DOES NOT SEEM TO BE GENUINE...</li>
            <li>This was a gift (my mother said she liked this particular perfume), so I&#x27;m not knowledgeable about the product.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and get many questions as to what is that?  </li>
            <li>Better to pay more, get the right product, and keep the wife/girlfriend happy, than to save a few bucks, get an inferior product, and strike out.</li>
            <li>It is still a wonderful feminine scent that is not overwhelming but lingers with you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mesmerizing!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking to get those points with their significant others.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>The reason I love it is because I have a really hard time wearing most scents but with knowing people are always telling me how nice I smell.</li>
            <li>When my mother wears it, the whole house seems like someone brought in a huge boucay of flowers.  </li>
            <li>Nice big size.</li>
            <li>Very fresh fragrance and very sensual.  </li>
            <li>It is a classy scent for a very confident and classy lady.</li>
            <li>Every time I apply this perfume, at least one person comments on how beautiful it smells.</li>
            <li>I held onto my powder so long it just kind of congealed..</li>
            <li>Although my husband isn&#x27;t a fan, and I don&#x27;t normally wear such strong scents, I will always have Knowing in my collection in honor of my precious Grandparents.</li>
            <li>but if I put only a little bit is just perfect</li>
            <li>though I would buy from here and the smell wasn&#x27;t near as strong as Macy&#x27;s and it didn&#x27;t stay with me.</li>
            <li>IT CLEARLY IS AN IMITATION...AND NOT THE GENUINE PERFUME.</li>
            <li>I first used KNOWING in college and the scent stayed in my memory.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of any higher praise one could give the product.</li>
            <li>I like to alternate for a change, but get most compliments from &amp;#34;Knowing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And thanks Amazon.com for stocking it at prices better than the local department stores.</li>
            <li>Have recently returned to wearing KNOWING and love it still as much as I did years ago.  </li>
            <li>this is a verry good value for this product compaired to the higher end stores where you usually have to get the estee lauder products I would like to see a bigger variety in complete gift baskets  and more of this collections</li>
            <li>So much for being &#x27;alluring.&#x27;</li>
            <li>It is always reasonably priced and promptly shipped.</li>
            <li>I received the product as advertised, fast delivery</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to know the name of this frangance.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I am glad to find it online since it is an older fragrance and harder to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>About 7hrs later, I could still smell it and it seemed quite powerful at first but</li>
            <li>It is a classic scent that needs no improvement or modification.  </li>
            <li>Rated it on the high side because it is the perfume my wife Loves to wear.</li>
            <li>I Love the long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>The bottles and packaging seem right, the labels and seals all seem correct and in place, but the quality inside the bottle is not the same.</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS get compliments and have had many people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing over the past 15 years</li>
            <li>Several years ago I was working in the expediting office of a large company.</li>
            <li>All perfumes do not smell the same on all people, it really depends on body chemistry.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised this perfume is not advertised</li>
            <li>I have it for years off and on throughout my adult years.  </li>
            <li>Its soft distinctive aroma exudes class and sophistication.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my mom much cheaper than it would have been for me to have to drive to a larger city where they sell it in store.  </li>
            <li>IT CLEARLY SMELLS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I BUY</li>
            <li>It can be hard to find in department stores, and of course it&#x27;s full price, never discounted.  </li>

            <li> The reason I love it is because I have a really hard time wearing most scents but with knowing people are always telling me how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> When my mother wears it, the whole house seems like someone brought in a huge boucay of flowers.  </li>
            <li> Nice big size.</li>
            <li> Very fresh fragrance and very sensual.  </li>
            <li> It is a classy scent for a very confident and classy lady.</li>
            <li> Every time I apply this perfume, at least one person comments on how beautiful it smells.</li>
            <li> I held onto my powder so long it just kind of congealed..</li>
            <li> Although my husband isn&#x27;t a fan, and I don&#x27;t normally wear such strong scents, I will always have Knowing in my collection in honor of my precious Grandparents.</li>
            <li> but if I put only a little bit is just perfect</li>
            <li> though I would buy from here and the smell wasn&#x27;t near as strong as Macy&#x27;s and it didn&#x27;t stay with me.</li>
            <li> IT CLEARLY IS AN IMITATION...AND NOT THE GENUINE PERFUME.</li>
            <li> I first used KNOWING in college and the scent stayed in my memory.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any higher praise one could give the product.</li>
            <li> I like to alternate for a change, but get most compliments from &amp;#34;Knowing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And thanks Amazon.com for stocking it at prices better than the local department stores.</li>
            <li> Have recently returned to wearing KNOWING and love it still as much as I did years ago.  </li>
            <li> this is a verry good value for this product compaired to the higher end stores where you usually have to get the estee lauder products I would like to see a bigger variety in complete gift baskets  and more of this collections</li>
            <li> So much for being &#x27;alluring.&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is always reasonably priced and promptly shipped.</li>
            <li> I received the product as advertised, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to know the name of this frangance.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I am glad to find it online since it is an older fragrance and harder to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> About 7hrs later, I could still smell it and it seemed quite powerful at first but</li>
            <li> It is a classic scent that needs no improvement or modification.  </li>
            <li> Rated it on the high side because it is the perfume my wife Loves to wear.</li>
            <li> I Love the long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> The bottles and packaging seem right, the labels and seals all seem correct and in place, but the quality inside the bottle is not the same.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS get compliments and have had many people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing over the past 15 years</li>
            <li> Several years ago I was working in the expediting office of a large company.</li>
            <li> All perfumes do not smell the same on all people, it really depends on body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised this perfume is not advertised</li>
            <li> I have it for years off and on throughout my adult years.  </li>
            <li> Its soft distinctive aroma exudes class and sophistication.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom much cheaper than it would have been for me to have to drive to a larger city where they sell it in store.  </li>
            <li> IT CLEARLY SMELLS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I BUY</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find in department stores, and of course it&#x27;s full price, never discounted.  </li>
            <li> My Mom loves this perfume, and buying it this way means I don&#x27;t have to drive half an hour to the mall, walk through a huge department store, and then try to flag down a salesperson who is going to try and sell me other products.</li>
            <li> My wife has worn this fragrance for long, long time.  </li>
            <li> i have used knowing for a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife has always liked it and its beginning to be hard to find and expensive</li>
            <li> Next door was the receving dept where a young man in his late teens worked.</li>
            <li> Long after my Grandfather had lost his sense of smell due to a stroke, he continued buying her Knowing every year for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Started using this perfume from the time Estee Lauder introduced it and have never used any other perfume since.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what the recipient expected!</li>
            <li> It shipped when expected and was packaged well!</li>
            <li> either love this scent or hate it.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE CAME IS SLIGHTLY CRACKED,  THE</li>
            <li> She said that the packaging IS DIFFERENT, and they know that it is not the same product that THEY are selling Sadly, until this gets straightened out, I will no longer buy perfumes online.</li>
            <li> It arrive in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not know this as my wife only opened it two days ago.  </li>
            <li> This (in my humble opinion) is the Cadillac of ladies perfumes, bar none!  </li>
            <li> This item was sent as a gift along with Bvlgari Jasmin Noir and BOTH were described as something you smell on a crowded bus in the late afternoon heat.</li>
            <li> I guess I can say the strangest compliment I ever got was when I walked past a kid a basketball game</li>
            <li> This product was no good.  </li>
            <li> It has soured or is stale and can not be used.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with this perfume</li>
            <li> Sorry it didn&#x27;t, work for me</li>
            <li> Just a whiff of it can bring my spirits up and it can go with dressy or casual.</li>
            <li> My ex-husband hated it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received so many compliments</li>
            <li> Knowing is my signature fragrance. All perfumes do not smell the same on all people, it really depends on body chemistry. Every time I apply this perfume, at least one person comments on how beautiful it smells. I&#x27;ve even had men stop me on the street asking for the manufacturer and name as they wanted to get some for someone in their life. I use the fragrance all hours of the day for any function. I&#x27;m an older person, but this would be excellent for a women of any age. Give Knowing a try, and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll continue to purchase it time and time again.</li>
            <li> Started using this perfume from the time Estee Lauder introduced it and have never used any other perfume since.  But what surprises me the most is the number of women (and men) that comment on how good it smells!!  I have been a walking talking ad for Estee Lauder Knowing for manu years now!  Love the perfume!  Thanks, Estee Lauder for a beautiful, sensuous perfume.  Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue it!    And thanks Amazon.com for stocking it at prices better than the local department stores.</li>
            <li> Very fresh fragrance and very sensual.  I like it very much and get many questions as to what is that?  It is different!</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> this is a verry good value for this product compaired to the higher end stores where you usually have to get the estee lauder products I would like to see a bigger variety in complete gift baskets  and more of this collections</li>
            <li> I got this on Amazon for my mother for cheaper than retail.  She was extremly happy with the parfum and how it smelled.</li>
            <li> Received in excellent condition and scent is perfect</li>
            <li> This is a gift to myself and love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love Este Lauder&#x27;s perfume \\&quot;Knowing\\&quot;.  I have been using it for years and I am&lt;br /&gt;constantly getting compliments.  I always recommend it when people as what perfume I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Knowing was my beloved Grandmother&#x27;s signature sent. Long after my Grandfather had lost his sense of smell due to a stroke, he continued buying her Knowing every year for Christmas. My Grandma passed her love of Knowing on to me. Although my husband isn&#x27;t a fan, and I don&#x27;t normally wear such strong scents, I will always have Knowing in my collection in honor of my precious Grandparents. It is a classy scent for a very confident and classy lady.</li>
            <li> Easier then going to the mall and more affordable.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Knowing 20 or 30 years ago when abroad, and it continues to me one of my and a friend&#x27;s favorite scent.  It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s still available online, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fragrance that is enduring, pleasing, not too floral or spicy, and very feminine.</li>
            <li> This product was no good.  It has soured or is stale and can not be used.  Unfortunately I did not know this as my wife only opened it two days ago.  What do I do to get it replaced as I got rid of the shipping label or can not find it.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE CAME IS SLIGHTLY CRACKED,  THE THE IT IS LEAKING...I HAVE TO LAY IT SIDEWARDS SO IT NOT LEAK.. AND THE PERFUME DOES NOT SEEM TO BE GENUINE...IT CLEARLY SMELLS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I BUY AT MACY&#x27;S.  I SHOWED IT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND HAD THEM SMELL THE DIFFERENCE...IT CLEARLY IS AN IMITATION...AND NOT THE GENUINE PERFUME.</li>
            <li> Excellent my mother loves it</li>
            <li> Great product and price! Delivery service was late but the wait was worth it.</li>
            <li> I first used KNOWING in college and the scent stayed in my memory. It is still a wonderful feminine scent that is not overwhelming but lingers with you. Great as a signature scent!</li>
            <li> People (men) either love this scent or hate it. My ex-husband hated it. I LOVE it!  I ALWAYS get compliments and have had many people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing over the past 15 years I&#x27;ve worn Knowing. I guess I can say the strangest compliment I ever got was when I walked past a kid a basketball game and he said,  &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that perfume? It&#x27;s mesmerizing! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have used the Estee Lauder Knowing for years....Love the scent! Stays all day!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Knowing\\&quot; by Estee Lauder has been my signature perfume for many years. It is sensual without being overbearing and it makes me feel pleasant and alluring. Several years ago I was working in the expediting office of a large company. Next door was the receving dept where a young man in his late teens worked. He made it a habit to stop by to say hello every morning. When I told him how nice it was for him to come by every morning, He said, \\&quot;Oh, that&#x27;s o.k. I like stopping by to see you; you smell just like my grandma.\\&quot; So much for being &#x27;alluring.&#x27; Wouldn&#x27;t you KNOW it...his grandma and I both use Knowing by Estee Lauder.  Knowing is timeless.</li>
            <li> This item was sent as a gift along with Bvlgari Jasmin Noir and BOTH were described as something you smell on a crowded bus in the late afternoon heat. It wasn&#x27;t what the recipient expected! It was an embarrassment to me.</li>
            <li> We buy this about twice a year and it never disappoints. It is always reasonably priced and promptly shipped.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it because its her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.  This was a gift (my mother said she liked this particular perfume), so I&#x27;m not knowledgeable about the product.</li>
            <li> The best product on the market for me.  It is the only fragrance that stays with me all day.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for mothers day for my mom and it is her favorite so of course she loved it!  It shipped when expected and was packaged well!</li>
            <li> Smells yummy as MV tells me.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for years and I just can&#x27;t find anything I like better.  Complete strangers will come up to me and say: &amp;#34;You smell good! What are you wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I give this a 5 star because this is my favorite perfume. I always get compliments when I wear this.This is a perfume most  people have not heard of until I tell them what it is, and then they say they want to go buy some. I am really surprised this perfume is not advertised</li>
            <li> The lady for whom this item was purchased squealed with delight when she opened the package.  I don&#x27;t know of any higher praise one could give the product.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing KNOWING for many years and I still receive many compliments - not overpowering or sweet - I hope it is never discontinued</li>
            <li> My wife has worn this fragrance for long, long time.  It can be hard to find in department stores, and of course it&#x27;s full price, never discounted.  Buying on-line thru Amazon was easy and saved a couple bucks. A win-win.  Arrived on time and undamaged.</li>
            <li> The only perfume my wife likes and this size was great.  Price was also great.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance, I&#x27;ve been looking for it for years and was told it was discontinued.  Thank you for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> Knowing is simply the best perfume I have ever found on the market.</li>
            <li> I keep getting compliments. It smells good to me and I am noticed for smelling good; that is my criteria.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife, she has worn this perfume for many years. Makes her smell dang nice!&lt;br /&gt;If your wife/girlfriend is starting to stink up the place, get her some of this!</li>
            <li> For my great Aunt and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is just the same as what she has bought locally.  I would recomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see the cologne via Amazon.  I have it for years off and on throughout my adult years.  Ester Lauder products as for as I am concerned are great.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> Rated it on the high side because it is the perfume my wife Loves to wear. I Love the long lasting fragrance. I would recommend it to anyone looking to get those points with their significant others.</li>
            <li> Good package and nice smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used Knowing for over 15 years. I always purchased it from Macy&#x27;s. I though I would buy from here and the smell wasn&#x27;t near as strong as Macy&#x27;s and it didn&#x27;t stay with me.</li>
            <li> This (in my humble opinion) is the Cadillac of ladies perfumes, bar none!  I get this perfume for my mother; often giving it to her for her birthday and/or Christmas.  Its soft distinctive aroma exudes class and sophistication.  When my mother wears it, the whole house seems like someone brought in a huge boucay of flowers.  It is simply heaven.  If you want to impress a lady friend; you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better idea!</li>
            <li> In 1990 my husband bought me Knowing for my birthday.  I have worn it every day since.  I get many many compliments when I wear it, day and night.  I keep thinking I should change to another scent, but I just can not make the change.  What will I do if they discontinue Knowing?</li>
            <li> I buy this for my wife for Christmas every year. It&#x27;s a tradition. Love how it smells and amazon has best price.</li>
            <li> My wife has always liked it and its beginning to be hard to find and expensive</li>
            <li> I received the product as advertised, fast delivery</li>
            <li> fast shipping great price</li>
            <li> LOVES IT MY FACTIVE PERFUME EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> great product ,  I love it and it was in excellent shape when I recieved it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;I would deffinaltely order from this company again</li>
            <li> I have used Knowing by Estee Lauder for 30 years. I love it !</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Estee Lauder products for years.  Have recently returned to wearing KNOWING and love it still as much as I did years ago.  Compliments galore.  Please continue carrying these products.</li>
            <li> My Mom loves this perfume, and buying it this way means I don&#x27;t have to drive half an hour to the mall, walk through a huge department store, and then try to flag down a salesperson who is going to try and sell me other products.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, is a bit strong but if I put only a little bit is just perfect</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  I don&#x27;t wear a anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered perfume without knowing the scent but I trusted customer reviews;  I was not disappointed!  It arrived in a timely manner and of course, I applied some to my wrists.  About 7hrs later, I could still smell it and it seemed quite powerful at first but once on, it mellowed to a perfect scent.  I do believe I will keep this as one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume , love love, it</li>
            <li> Love this.....  been wanting to try it for years and finally splurgred.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom much cheaper than it would have been for me to have to drive to a larger city where they sell it in store.  She has worn Knowing for years, it is definitely her signature!</li>
            <li> This is my standing gift.  It has been my favorite fragrance for years.  Husbands, this is a home run.  The scent is memorable...just like your lady.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to fragrance and has been for many years. I like to alternate for a change, but get most compliments from &amp;#34;Knowing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this perfume and intend to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, yes!  My favorite perfume!  Just wish they still made the dusting powder.  I held onto my powder so long it just kind of congealed..</li>
            <li> This fragrance is been around for a while  but the &amp;#34;salt hasn&amp;#34;t lost it&#x27;s savor&amp;#34;. How elegant and rich the smell. It&#x27;s truly a head turner. Everyone wants to know the name of this frangance.</li>
            <li> Worn this fragrance for years and get so many compliments</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, great price!</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  Just a whiff of it can bring my spirits up and it can go with dressy or casual.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have used it for years and plan to for years to come.</li>
            <li> Any perfume by Estee Lauder is a winner.  I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a dear friend of mine.  She and my auntie both enjoyed the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is among my favorites.  Mixes well with my body chemistry.  Get lots and lots of compliments when I wear it!!!</li>
            <li> As soon as my wife put this on, she let me know that it was NOT the same as what we&#x27;ve bought in quality stores. After talking with a couple of friends of mine who work in the perfume department of Carson&#x27;s and Macy&#x27;s, they concurred with my wife, and with others who have left comments about online perfume purchases. The bottles and packaging seem right, the labels and seals all seem correct and in place, but the quality inside the bottle is not the same. One of the women told me that in the mall where she works, people will buy perfume at the discount perfumery, and then bring it to their store for a larger refund. She said that the packaging IS DIFFERENT, and they know that it is not the same product that THEY are selling Sadly, until this gets straightened out, I will no longer buy perfumes online. Better to pay more, get the right product, and keep the wife/girlfriend happy, than to save a few bucks, get an inferior product, and strike out.</li>
            <li> IT WAS PACKED VERY WELL .IT IS A GOOD SMELLING PERFUME I GET A LOT OF COMPLAMENTS WHEN I WEAR IT .</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift requested by someone else. She loves it and has been using it for years.  Nice big size.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume to date.  It smells wonderful and would definitely recommend it to my sister and others!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom, it&#x27;s her favorite fragrance. I shopped all over the internet and this was the best deal.  A great price and quick shipping.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> have always loved the smell and so did a lot of my co workers when I wore it to work</li>
            <li> I love KNOWING but the smell of this knowing is different! I was not happy with this perfume I don&#x27;t  think it&#x27;s the real knowing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love knowing  by estee lauder because I get compliments everywhere I go when I wear it.  It has a very good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It arrive in less than a week. I&#x27;d use this source again.</li>
            <li> The smell of Knowing is so elegant and exquisite. I get compliments all the time. It makes me feel beautiful and sexy.</li>
            <li> I have worn this more years than I care to admit, still love the fragrance I love it and I am glad to find it online since it is an older fragrance and harder to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> It is a classic scent that needs no improvement or modification.  It is my wife&#x27;s favorite, and has been since she was a girl.</li>
            <li> SMELLED LIKE VINEGAR...GAVE ME A HEADACHE INSTANTLY......STICK TO THE PERFUME YOU KNOW!!!!!!!!!!! BUT NOT THIS.....</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product; will buy again.</li>
            <li> I received this product and found it not to be the same as what I am use to. The smell was not the same and it does not stay with me for the entire day like I am use to. I was bummed because it would have been a good deal with the price that is posted. I have used knowing for fifteen years . The reason I love it is because I have a really hard time wearing most scents but with knowing people are always telling me how nice I smell.Sorry it didn&#x27;t, work for me</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loved it. Its one of her favorite perfume and it was arrived on time and it was origional as well, of course!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;t the ONLY  Perfume my wife uses.</li>
            <li> i have used knowing for a long time. Could not find in most stores so i started looking on line and found it. I love it and my husband love it too. I wish it could be put back on stores shelves again. People always ask me what is that your wearing?  it smell so good. I is knowing!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder perfume, and this scent is very nice.  The package came very quickly and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price</li>
