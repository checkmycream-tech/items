            <li>better to be used at night before bed.  </li>
            <li>When I did inform Colonial Dame of the problem, they confirmed the delivery date; however, I had to initiate a request for the tracking information from them in order to conduct my own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is simply the best!</li>
            <li>I have used many vitamin e oil</li>
            <li>and I needed something to help with the wounds but more than that</li>
            <li>and my loyalty to this product when for more than two weeks</li>
            <li>Vitamin E oil has so many uses.</li>
            <li>I use this for my hair remedies and skin it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>So I thought if this oil was so good, the natural vitamin E would be even better!  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t run easily.</li>
            <li>Drugstore is a great seller i would definitely will buy again from them</li>
            <li>People often disregard the purity of this oil and are turned off by the thickness of it, but all pure oils are the same (think about coconut oil) and because of its consistency and great results I buy and use it.</li>
            <li>Our 10,000 IU Vitamin E Skin Oil is 8% vitamin E and also easy to spread, it comes in a large 4.6 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Raymond</li>

            <li>Works great, it is thick</li>
            <li>So I researched and bought one of the top brands of natural E, and was very surprised to find it did not help my skin very much at all.  </li>

            <li>The pure E oil is intended for putting on skin cracks, burns, cuts and wounds, and healing is accelerated.</li>
            <li>MUCH HANDIER WITH THE PUMP FEATURE.  </li>
            <li>Very un-smoothable.  </li>
            <li>very moist.</li>
            <li>It also takes away much of the redness.</li>
            <li>That being said, I experienced a frustrating problem with Colonial Dame.  </li>
            <li>Much thanks for the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>Colonial Dames business model of failing to provide customers with an automated shipping confirmation email complete with tracking information is a disservice and leaves very much to be desired.</li>
            <li>For the most part, other eCommerce businesses typically send a shipping confirmation email, including a tracking number, if available.  </li>
            <li>The dropper did break off inside the concrete...</li>
            <li>It also get rids of dry skin and heal scars quickly.</li>
            <li>wow i love it is very thick, very pure</li>

            <li>After the initial shock (i also thought it was sticky) it did seem to soak into my skin rather quickly, much to my surprise.  </li>
            <li>Also there is a big difference in how much it has once again healed the damaged skin on my knee.</li>
            <li>however, the pump in the bottle barely draws the oil up-</li>
            <li>so I use this when I go to sleep and find my lips are not dry or cracked.</li>
            <li>It will be going in the garbage during my next major cleaning out as I will write it off as a lesson learned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving the other to my older sister...and not telling her about the consistency.  </li>

            <li> This is the real Mccoy for Vitamin E oil if you are looking for the thick sticky one which I was and will not waste my money on ones in the stores that claim they are Vit e oil but have the consistency of water.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Vitamin E Oil IS thick.</li>
            <li> I am  now stuck with that bottle but not for long.</li>
            <li> Oil is very sticky and thick- works well-</li>
            <li> i was looking for another but see you are adding other oil but wondering why my bottle of same size with pump, doesnt reveal this added oil?</li>
            <li> My lips were dry because of the medications I was using and</li>
            <li> It appears that this oil was formulated with a decent grade material because of its thick consistency.  </li>
            <li> use this oil directly on my lips, and usually mix</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through topical steroid withdrawal, so my skin is dry, cracked, and unbelievably itchy.</li>
            <li> but this is the purest and smoother than all other types I have used.</li>
            <li> I mix this with other oils and use it on my scalp and hair, it works</li>
            <li> , my lips healed or the very least, all open cracks on my lips were closed.</li>
            <li> You can apply the oil without making a mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll revise my review after a few weeks to note any skin benefits that have occurred.</li>
            <li> I had surgery on my knee a few months ago</li>
            <li> Due to the merchant&#x27;s failure to provide me with the tracking number, I could have had my order THREE WEEKS</li>
            <li> Maybe a little too thick</li>
            <li> To remedy the problem, I purchased a set of small plastic jars with covers from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> After two weeks using the other product, my lips were back in bad shape.  </li>
            <li> I can put up with all of that though, as the benefits outweigh the negative.  </li>
            <li> When people say it&#x27;s thick, i guess i should have believed them.  </li>
            <li> This oil is thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> For some reason stores like CVS and WalMart do not carry Vitamin E oil that is really thick like this one.</li>
            <li> The cold northeast winters make my lips chapped and dry</li>
            <li> are some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat scars or burns, use on stretch marks, treatment of eczema and psoriasis, use on dry nails and cuticles, treatment of chapped lips and cold sores, use as a skin moisturizer, has anti-aging benefits, treatment of sunburn, treatment of brown spots, under eye treatment and Make-up Remover, stimulates hair growth, repairs split ends.</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick.</li>
            <li> I kept putting the Frontier Vitamin E oil on my lips and they kept getting worse and within two days of using this one that I purchased here at Amazon</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was not my experience with the business owner.  </li>
            <li> My jaw was still numb</li>
            <li> So with all the crazy looks, I did and it did heal without a scar.</li>
            <li> I purchased Frontier Vitamin E oil and to say that I am disappointed is an understatement.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> MUCH HANDIER WITH THE PUMP FEATURE.  I&#x27;VE USED THIS OIL FOR YHEARS AND ALWAYS HAVE IT ON HAND</li>
            <li> When people say it&#x27;s thick, i guess i should have believed them.  This is the consistency of putting a glue trap on your face.  Very un-smoothable.  It stays where you put it.  Not like any oil I&#x27;ve ever used.  After the initial shock (i also thought it was sticky) it did seem to soak into my skin rather quickly, much to my surprise.  You cannot use this under make up...better to be used at night before bed.  And let it soak in or you&#x27;ll be stuck to your pillow...  I can put up with all of that though, as the benefits outweigh the negative.  The dropper did break off inside the concrete...um...bottle though. A q-tip will do the trick just as well though.  Good price for 2 bottles.  I&#x27;m giving the other to my older sister...and not telling her about the consistency.  Can&#x27;t wait to hear her review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll revise my review after a few weeks to note any skin benefits that have occurred.</li>
            <li> good for your lips. very moist.</li>
            <li> wow i love it is very thick, very pure, it feel great on your skin, is not sticky, is a fabulous moisturizer. Drugstore is a great seller i would definitely will buy again from them</li>
            <li> Oil is very sticky and thick- works well- however, the pump in the bottle barely draws the oil up- I ended up pulling nozzle out &amp; lost a lot of the oil in the process</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m going through topical steroid withdrawal, so my skin is dry, cracked, and unbelievably itchy. This provides instant relief that lasts for hours. Yes, it&#x27;s greasy, but given the choice between itchy and greasy, I&#x27;ll choose greasy every time. It even moisturizers my skin well enough that I can sleep through the night. It also takes away much of the redness. I am so glad to have found this product and will order more when my bottles run out!</li>
            <li> Dispenser doesn&#x27;t work that great, but product itself certainly is great!</li>
            <li> Why is this diluted in 50% safflower oil when it says &amp;#34;Pharmaceutical Grade Vitamin E Oil&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Ingredients: Topopheryl Acetate (Pure Vitamin E). i have a bottle of this and my bottle states the above.  i was looking for another but see you are adding other oil but wondering why my bottle of same size with pump, doesnt reveal this added oil?</li>
            <li> It appears that this oil was formulated with a decent grade material because of its thick consistency.  Consequently, the dispenser could not accommodate the thickness, resulting in a challenge.  To remedy the problem, I purchased a set of small plastic jars with covers from the dollar store. I achieved the intended result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product must be accompanied by courteous customer service.  That being said, I experienced a frustrating problem with Colonial Dame.  For the most part, other eCommerce businesses typically send a shipping confirmation email, including a tracking number, if available.  Unfortunately, this was not my experience with the business owner.  Due to the merchant&#x27;s failure to provide me with the tracking number, I could have had my order THREE WEEKS earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was sitting in the property manager&#x27;s office for three weeks. (The property manager has made it clear from day one that they receive packages based on courtesy, and, it is the resident&#x27;s ultimate responsibility to monitor the expected arrival of their merchandise). To add insult to injury, I did not receive a note from FedEx indicating a delivery attempt was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, Amazon&#x27;s system won&#x27;t allow me to request a tracer until the end of the delivery period.  When I did inform Colonial Dame of the problem, they confirmed the delivery date; however, I had to initiate a request for the tracking information from them in order to conduct my own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Colonial Dames business model of failing to provide customers with an automated shipping confirmation email complete with tracking information is a disservice and leaves very much to be desired.</li>
            <li> Works great, it is thick so it doesn&#x27;t run easily. I wear this under my eyes and on my scars. I can already see an improvement.</li>
            <li> This oil is thick and sticky. The dispenser is excellent. You can apply the oil without making a mess. The age spots on the backs of my hands are gone.</li>
            <li> This oil is simply the best! I have been using it for 5 years now and I can say it has improved my skin greatly. People often disregard the purity of this oil and are turned off by the thickness of it, but all pure oils are the same (think about coconut oil) and because of its consistency and great results I buy and use it. The service is also great, the package arrived a week before the estimated delivery date *****</li>
            <li> The best and highest quality vitamin e oil you will ever find. I have used many vitamin e oil but this is the purest and smoother than all other types I have used. I have been using colonial dames since I was a teenager and now I have no wrinkles. It also get rids of dry skin and heal scars quickly. This is my best kept beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Vitamin E oil for years and can only hope they never stop making it. The cold northeast winters make my lips chapped and dry so I use this when I go to sleep and find my lips are not dry or cracked.</li>
            <li> Much thanks for the 5 star reviews. 100% Pure Vitamin E Oil IS thick. This is the way nature made it. The pure E oil is intended for putting on skin cracks, burns, cuts and wounds, and healing is accelerated. We make 17,500 IU Vitamin E oil too, this is a mix of 50% vitamin E and safflower and grape seed oil. This is thinner and easier to spread on larger area&#x27;s of the skin. Our 10,000 IU Vitamin E Skin Oil is 8% vitamin E and also easy to spread, it comes in a large 4.6 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Raymond Schep&lt;br /&gt;Chief Chemist&lt;br /&gt;Colonial Dames Co.</li>
            <li> For some reason stores like CVS and WalMart do not carry Vitamin E oil that is really thick like this one. This is the real Mccoy for Vitamin E oil if you are looking for the thick sticky one which I was and will not waste my money on ones in the stores that claim they are Vit e oil but have the consistency of water.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time and am pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> Just started using this and it&#x27;s just the right consistency and absorbs wonderfully.  Also using it on my scalp and cuticles.  I&#x27;ve noticed results on my cuticles right away.  Best vitamin E oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is excellent vitamin E oil.  My chapped lips literally healed overnight and my face loves it.  So I thought if this oil was so good, the natural vitamin E would be even better!  So I researched and bought one of the top brands of natural E, and was very surprised to find it did not help my skin very much at all.  My lips started to chap again, even though I was using it twice as often as this product and my face didn&#x27;t look quite as good.  After two weeks using the other product, my lips were back in bad shape.  So I tried this product on my lips again, and once again they healed overnight.  So even though conventional wisdom says natural E is better, I had the opposite experience.&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil directly on my lips, and usually mix it was something else (MSM gel) to spread on my face.</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick. Maybe a little too thick but it serves it&#x27;s purpose. Will probably order it again.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair remedies and skin it works pretty good.  I will order it again for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased Frontier Vitamin E oil and to say that I am disappointed is an understatement. My history with Vitamin E began by some advise. I just came from the dentist where I had a filling done. My jaw was still numb but I kept thinking it was itching so I rubbed and rubbed until the skin came off. A co-worker told me to put vitamin E on it. She said no matter how it my look in public, that&#x27;s only temporary, it will heal the wound without a scar. So with all the crazy looks, I did and it did heal without a scar. So when I accidently found a bottle by Fruit of the Earth in Wal-Mart, I decided to try it. I have never regretted it since. I had surgery on my knee a few months ago and I needed something to help with the wounds but more than that, I use Vitamin E on my lips. Nothing and I mean nothing heals my crack, busted lips better than this magic vitamin over night. I proved that and my loyalty to this product when for more than two weeks I kept putting the Frontier Vitamin E oil on my lips and they kept getting worse and within two days of using this one that I purchased here at Amazon, my lips healed or the very least, all open cracks on my lips were closed. My lips were dry because of the medications I was using and this Vitamin E oil is the only thing that has helped. Also there is a big difference in how much it has once again healed the damaged skin on my knee. The Frontier has done nothing with the healing of my skin. I am  now stuck with that bottle but not for long. It will be going in the garbage during my next major cleaning out as I will write it off as a lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I use vitamin e oil on my face, skin, scalp and hair. This is perfect to mix in your favorite lotion or cream - or make your own beauty mix! Vitamin E oil has so many uses.
