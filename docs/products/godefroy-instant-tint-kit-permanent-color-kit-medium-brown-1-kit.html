            <li>in all, it does a good job of tinting the hairs, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it, despite the awkwardness involved.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>this kit is amazing.</li>
            <li>However, this product works and is more cost effective than having it done at the salon.</li>
            <li>I have very light eyebrows and am allergic to many cosmetics...</li>
            <li>Better than the rest</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Much better than Roux.  </li>
            <li>After tinting, I apply oil and use an exfoliating pad to scrub the brow area and remove most of the staining on the skin.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are more than scarce.  </li>
            <li>I think think this product may be better suited for those who have hair--but need/want to darken them.</li>
            <li>Love This.  </li>
            <li>works great on this old lady</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was so easy to use</li>
            <li>It lightens gradually during the week, which is fine.  </li>
            <li>Fine product.  </li>
            <li>Fine delivery</li>
            <li>Saves so much time and money to be able to do it myself!</li>
            <li>I save so much by dying my own eyebrows.</li>
            <li>but once you get passed that it&#x27;s smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li>I also use a clean mascara brush sometimes.</li>
            <li>Apply to clean brows.  </li>
            <li>This does not go on my eyebrows easily and it fades within the first week.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, first timer here.</li>
            <li>I like the product, only package should me more comfortable to keep easy all together.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a new favorite.</li>
            <li>I use the eyebrow tint every three weeks, I really like the product, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, tint lasts several weeks.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and the results are professional!</li>
            <li>I little messing to apply but the color is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone looking for a more youthful look, or to replace daily eyebrow makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once more the next day</li>
            <li>But you should follow the instructions when you first use it and see what works for you.</li>
            <li>and it does last more than 2 month</li>
            <li>Read the instructions first.</li>
            <li>Have &amp;#34;seeable&amp;#34; eyebrows for the first time ever,  </li>
            <li>Mine is pretty much gone in 10-14 days.  </li>
            <li>easy ti apply but does not last 6 wks as posted.</li>
            <li>Though some might NOT want the skin stained, I certainly did.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to find another eyebrow dye coloring product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works very well or lasts for folks with sparse eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>It mixes up too much product for one application and you can&#x27;t reuse it.  </li>
            <li>Mix up the colour, use the wooden tool to spread some of the colour to the clean mascara brush and brush through brows.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that this product not only colored my remaining brows, but also stained the skin, so that my eyebrows look like an actual shape.  </li>
            <li>Tints eyebrows quickly, and has enough mixture if you do decide to make them even darker.</li>
            <li>It does leave a little staining on the skin under the brow, but that wears off pretty easily in 24-48 hours.  </li>
            <li>The bottle of activator isn&#x27;t marked, so you have to guess how much to squeeze into the mixing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years to cover greys and whites that appear in my eyebrows, so it keeps your overall look youthful and fresh.</li>
            <li>(if you have light hair, you may not want to use this dark of a color.</li>
            <li>Had to use &amp;#34;Perfect Brows&amp;#34; first to grow some eyebrows to put it on but both did a terrific job.  </li>
            <li>One reviewer said the capsules are messy and a capsule makes too much dye which is true.  </li>
            <li>About 10 minutes to make sure it is dark enough.</li>
            <li>After a day or two that wears off and the color looks natural.</li>
            <li>Eyebrows show naturally.</li>
            <li>I use an old eyebrow</li>
            <li>Hair grows fast, especially eyebrow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen colors the skin below the brow but not the actual hairs, so they aren&#x27;t useful if your brows are turning grey.  </li>
            <li>For stubborn and coarse grays, use the wooden tool to apply a thicker, more concentrated application to those few hairs.</li>
            <li>When applied correctly, it does a good job of tinting the white hairs in my otherwise dark, thick brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color is dark the first day or two them starts to fade.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Wonderful eyebrow tint.  Tried a different kind and was very disappointed.  Stays tinted around 4 weeks.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Better than the rest but still doesn&#x27;t last longer than 7 days</li>
            <li> easy ti apply but does not last 6 wks as posted.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years to cover greys and whites that appear in my eyebrows, so it keeps your overall look youthful and fresh. It&#x27;s easy to apply. Takes just a few minutes. Non-messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says it lasts for 6 weeks. I just reapply when I start to see a few greys and whites appear. Overall, it probably is about every 6 weeks, but I don&#x27;t do it on any schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone looking for a more youthful look, or to replace daily eyebrow makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medium brown comes out dark, but that&#x27;s because some of it stains the skin underneath. After a day or two that wears off and the color looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now.  I finally figured out I have to leave the color on for about 3 minutes to cover the white hairs. It is easy to use.  One reviewer said the capsules are messy and a capsule makes too much dye which is true.  However, this product works and is more cost effective than having it done at the salon.</li>
            <li> I like the product, only package should me more comfortable to keep easy all together.</li>
            <li> The color capsules are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> This does not go on my eyebrows easily and it fades within the first week. It is supposed to last for 6 weeks. I would really like to find another eyebrow dye coloring product.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this. It was much easier than I expected from reading other reviewer comments. It has lasted a month, now time to apply again again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I LOVE it.  Much better than Roux.  The only thing a bit inconvenient is that it is hard to open the little capsule that the color powder comes in, but it is worth it for the end result. It does leave a little staining on the skin under the brow, but that wears off pretty easily in 24-48 hours.  As long as you apply Vaseline AROUND (but not on) the brows, the staining is negligible. After tinting, I apply oil and use an exfoliating pad to scrub the brow area and remove most of the staining on the skin. Once more the next day and it&#x27;s gone. Then the color lasts for about a month.  Actually, I let the tint stay on longer than the package recommends. About 10 minutes to make sure it is dark enough. But you should follow the instructions when you first use it and see what works for you. Saves so much time and money to be able to do it myself!</li>
            <li> I always buy when I run out. Easy to use and quick. It also last forever!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are more than scarce.  I was pleased that this product not only colored my remaining brows, but also stained the skin, so that my eyebrows look like an actual shape.  Though some might NOT want the skin stained, I certainly did.  It lightens gradually during the week, which is fine.  I re-apply 1 time every week.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, first timer here. Just got to be careful with tinting the skin. Color is perfect. Eyebrows show naturally.</li>
            <li> Delevery no problem&lt;br /&gt;It comes like small capsules which is color with small bottle activator&lt;br /&gt;Apply with Q tips&lt;br /&gt;Great color and it does last more than 2 month&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the instructions enclosed</li>
            <li> I use this product on my husband&#x27;s brows. He uses &amp;#34;Touch of Grey&amp;#34; dark brown on his hair but the eyebrows also need to be done and this product is excellent. Read the instructions first. Do one eyebrow at a time and don&#x27;t leave it on for long. About 1 minute or so and then wipe with a damp paper towel.You can always re-apply if you need to for gray coverage or darker brows but if you leave it on too long you&#x27;ll end up looking like Groucho Marx! You can use the wooden tool supplied for application. I also use a clean mascara brush sometimes. Mix up the colour, use the wooden tool to spread some of the colour to the clean mascara brush and brush through brows. For stubborn and coarse grays, use the wooden tool to apply a thicker, more concentrated application to those few hairs. Again, I usually do this after the initial application.</li>
            <li> Capsules hard to open and a bit difficult to mix so that you know the developing time each application, but with trial and error, it certainly works and covers gray.</li>
            <li> Fine product.  Fine delivery</li>
            <li> the sticks that come with are pretty useless for applying but thr product works very well and I would definately recommend using an angled brush instead of the sticks to apply. (if you have light hair, you may not want to use this dark of a color. it stains the skin aswell!)</li>
            <li> Purchased this looking for an alternative for filling my eyebrows every day. It is a good product but my sister and I find that we need to re-apply every other week. Could be the climate--but we gave up after a few times. My sister had a hard time applying it/perfecting her eyebrows. I ended up getting stiff makeup brushes to apply the dye--this made application much easier for her. Color is dark the first day or two them starts to fade. I don&#x27;t think it works very well or lasts for folks with sparse eyebrow hair. I think think this product may be better suited for those who have hair--but need/want to darken them. For now I will stick with my powder/wax combo. My sister uses it every once in a while just to fill in the bald spots when she has events coming up.</li>
            <li> Love This.  Have &amp;#34;seeable&amp;#34; eyebrows for the first time ever,  Had to use &amp;#34;Perfect Brows&amp;#34; first to grow some eyebrows to put it on but both did a terrific job.  Mine have always been sparse and blond.</li>
            <li> This product  only needs to be applied every 4/6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought this was so easy to use and my eyebrows turned out perfect! You don&#x27;t need to use an entire capsule, so it will last you quite a long time!</li>
            <li> I little messing to apply but the color is good.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and the results are professional! I save so much by dying my own eyebrows. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have mixed feelings about it, enumerated below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It consists of four color capsules filled with the tinting powder, a small bottle of activator, a tiny cup to mix them in, and four small orange sticks. To use it, you open a capsule and dup the powder into the cup.  Add a squirt of activator.  Mix with the orange stick.  Apply to clean brows.  Let set about 3 minutes,.  Rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  When applied correctly, it does a good job of tinting the white hairs in my otherwise dark, thick brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It tints the hair itself, which brow pencils don&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Once mixed, it&#x27;s odor-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Once applied, it stays where it&#x27;s supposed to - it doesn&#x27;t drip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The packaging is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;  A.  It&#x27;s very hard to open those little capsules without getting the tinting powder all over.&lt;br /&gt;  B.  The bottle of activator isn&#x27;t marked, so you have to guess how much to squeeze into the mixing cup.&lt;br /&gt;  C.  The orange sticks are supposed to be used as applicators, but you can&#x27;t control where it goes with a stick.  I use an old eyebrow brush.&lt;br /&gt;  D.  It mixes up too much product for one application and you can&#x27;t reuse it.  One is enough for about three people.  Waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It doesn&#x27;t last anywhere even close to six weeks.  Mine is pretty much gone in 10-14 days.  Hair grows fast, especially eyebrow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every brow pencil I&#x27;ve seen colors the skin below the brow but not the actual hairs, so they aren&#x27;t useful if your brows are turning grey.  Between the time this product is gone and the next time I tint, I use a pencil for the skin and a mascara-like applicator for the actual hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is said to stain the skin, so you&#x27;re warned to wipe it off if it gets on your skin.  I apply it so that it actually does come in contact with the skin out of which my brows grow, so it fills in spaces as well as tinting the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that you use a stiff eyebrow brush for application, or a tiny, stiff painter&#x27;s brush - the orange sticks are useless for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it does a good job of tinting the hairs, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it, despite the awkwardness involved.g the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that you use a stiff eyebrow brush for application, or a tiny, stiff painter&#x27;s brush - the orange sticks are useless for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it does a good job of tinting the hairs, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it, despite the awkwardness involved.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Capsules are kinda hard to open but once you get passed that it&#x27;s smooth sailing. Tints eyebrows quickly, and has enough mixture if you do decide to make them even darker. This is definitely a new favorite.</li>
            <li> I have very light eyebrows and am allergic to many cosmetics...this kit is amazing. Very easy to use, tint lasts several weeks.</li>
            <li> works great on this old lady</li>
            <li> I use the eyebrow tint every three weeks, I really like the product, easy to use.  Thank you</li>
