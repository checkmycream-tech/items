            <li>so I am very happy to find it on amazon, especially at a reduced price.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many retail places and freared I would have to wait until I was in&lt;br /&gt;France</li>
            <li>What better time for a favorite gift.</li>
            <li>You more than likly will not find it at a store.</li>
            <li>my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I get many, many compliments when I wear this scent.  </li>
            <li>This is MY Favorite Fragrance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eau</li>
            <li>Outstanding aroma.</li>
            <li>Love the lemon smell but wish it lasted longer on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is not too much, light, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Citrusy and not over-powering it is a lovely clean summer scent.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is appropriate even for very hot weather.</li>
            <li>Annick Goutal rivals Jean Patou as great French parfumiers.  </li>
            <li>Light Summer parfum</li>
            <li>this is a light scent that stays forever.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>I am a true fan of &amp;#34;Eau D&#x27;hadrien&amp;#34; because it is a unique and clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The bottle, like all Goutal bottles is nothing special.</li>
            <li>and I will most certainly do so again.</li>
            <li>It is a blend of lemon, grapefruit and cypress -- light, airy and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>... tweleve more words required to leave my message, they really should stop that requirement</li>
            <li>It would be a good perfume to layer, I think with the Eau D&#x27;Sud with the latter as the daytime and the Eau D&#x27;Hadrien evening.  </li>
            <li>fresh and slightly sweet, smells clean...</li>
            <li>Overall, I am delighted with this perfume -- it is light, crisp, citrus-y without being too-sweet.</li>
            <li>It is more of a summer fragrance, but I occasionally will layer it with a stronger, more winter fragrance.</li>
            <li>Light, crisp, with lemon tones.  </li>
            <li>Fresh smell, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>People comment on the scent constantly..and they agree that the fresh scent DOES smell like being outdoors when things are blooming.  </li>
            <li>I love the citrus floral top notes, with slightly spicy undertones.</li>
            <li>This is a classic, clean, crisp scent with citrus overtones.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this perfume in Paris.  </li>
            <li>thanks!  SF</li>
            <li>I love the way this scent literally will lift my spirits the second I smell it!  </li>
            <li>The only scent I have that comes close is the women&#x27;s version of Jessica McClintock, but this is a much more layered scent and it doesn&#x27;t fade</li>
            <li>Fast service and exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>It is classic, elegant and lighthearted all at the same time.</li>
            <li>it is very versatile.     </li>
            <li>And for the prize that is much lower that in any stores-what not to love?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>I buy this year or so for my wife and we both really like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh, and is not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Unusual and very energizing.  </li>
            <li>The main note I smell is lemon, and lily of the valley.  </li>
            <li>love is like a blast of citrus that lasts all day if you spray a few times...</li>
            <li>The only thing that discerns one Goutal fragrance from the next is a simple paper tag that hangs from an elegant ribbon in the neck of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It goes on intense, but melds into your skin shortly after.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a common problem with most lemony perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Subtle and memorable</li>
            <li>, I love this and always have such a hard time findding it.</li>
            <li>Lovely delicate fragrance, but it does not last.  </li>
            <li>bottle did not seem like it was fresh so that the perfume smell was off compared to other bottles of same perfume</li>
            <li>The only downside is that even at the parfum level, this fragrance has little staying power (the eau de toilette will fare less potent).  </li>
            <li>But since these fragrances are only sold behind the counter, you are most likely getting an untouched bottle.     </li>
            <li>This is not uncommon among citrusy type fragrances -- most do not last very long.</li>
            <li>zesty notes of the true Sicilian lemon and grapefruit mingle with the refinement of the citron tree and cypress notes to give a universal fragrance, subtle and refined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Overall, I am delighted with this perfume -- it is light, crisp, citrus-y without being too-sweet. It is a perfect summer scent.  My only negative comment would be that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.  Perhaps that&#x27;s the price of subtlety -- you will need to re-apply the scent throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have the EAU DE PARFUM of this fragrance. It is the perfect summer fragrance. It is a blend of lemon, grapefruit and cypress -- light, airy and fresh smelling. It goes on intense, but melds into your skin shortly after. It is more of a summer fragrance, but I occasionally will layer it with a stronger, more winter fragrance. Hadrien layers brilliantly with most fragrances... it is very versatile.     The only downside is that even at the parfum level, this fragrance has little staying power (the eau de toilette will fare less potent).  After a few hours, it vanishes. This is not uncommon among citrusy type fragrances -- most do not last very long. This is why I give this product 4 instead of 5 stars ... no staying power.     The bottle, like all Goutal bottles is nothing special. It does not look like an expensive perfume bottle.  The only thing that discerns one Goutal fragrance from the next is a simple paper tag that hangs from an elegant ribbon in the neck of the bottle. Also, Goutal fragrances do not come in shrink-wrapped boxes. This is the only fragrance house I know of that packages this way. Not a big deal, just sometime you may wonder if anyone has stolen a spritz from your bottle before you bought it. But since these fragrances are only sold behind the counter, you are most likely getting an untouched bottle.     I love this fragrance, and have been wearing it for years.  It is classic, elegant and lighthearted all at the same time.</li>
            <li> I only wear Annick Goutal and this is one of my favorites. Citrusy and not over-powering it is a lovely clean summer scent.</li>
            <li> I first bought this perfume in Paris.  I was happy to find it at a really nice price. It is not too much, light, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and my wife loves the fragrance. Dealing with this seller is a pleasure and I will most certainly do so again.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different perfumes.  This is one of my all time favorites.  Fresh smell, not overpowering.  You will get compliments on this one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice citrusy scent.  It is sold as a &amp;#34;unisex&amp;#34; scent but the men&#x27;s is only the toilette, not the parfum.  This item has become harder to find in retail stores so I am very happy to find it on amazon, especially at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many retail places and freared I would have to wait until I was in&lt;br /&gt;France to by Eau D&#x27;hadrien.  So happy it occurred to me to try Amanzon.&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks!  SF</li>
            <li> My wife prefers this brand, loves it. Period. And for the prize that is much lower that in any stores-what not to love?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I am a true fan of &amp;#34;Eau D&#x27;hadrien&amp;#34; because it is a unique and clean fragrance.  Annick Goutal rivals Jean Patou as great French parfumiers.  Actually, this can be a unisex fragrance.  This fragrance is appropriate even for very hot weather.</li>
            <li> bottle did not seem like it was fresh so that the perfume smell was off compared to other bottles of same perfume</li>
            <li> A very light fragrance - nice all year.</li>
            <li> It is my wife&#x27;s most loved perfume. What better time for a favorite gift. The gift arrivied on time and she was very appreciative of the gift;originally I had purchased it on our honeymoon in Paris.</li>
            <li> Fast service and exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for about ten years now. I love the citrus floral top notes, with slightly spicy undertones. It&#x27;s perfect to wear every day.</li>
            <li> I buy this year or so for my wife and we both really like the fragrance.  The only draw-back is that Amazon doesn&#x27;t appear to offer it in a &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; container.  That would definately improve the satisfaction with the product and service.</li>
            <li> Light Summer parfum, I love this and always have such a hard time findding it. You more than likly will not find it at a store. Only on line.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume. Everyone compliments me when I wear it. And the fragrance lasts a long time. Subtle and memorable</li>
            <li> fresh and slightly sweet, smells clean... citrus.. great... tweleve more words required to leave my message, they really should stop that requirement</li>
            <li> This perfume has a really nice lemon and citrus scent. My wife got a sample on a different order years ago and has been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> this is a light scent that stays forever.  The main note I smell is lemon, and lily of the valley.  It smells fresh, and is not heavy.  I love the way this scent literally will lift my spirits the second I smell it!  People comment on the scent constantly..and they agree that the fresh scent DOES smell like being outdoors when things are blooming.  I get many, many compliments when I wear this scent.  The only scent I have that comes close is the women&#x27;s version of Jessica McClintock, but this is a much more layered scent and it doesn&#x27;t fade</li>
            <li> This is MY Favorite Fragrance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eau D&#x27;hadrien By Annick Goutal For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sellers size &amp; Pricing is THE BeST around! I will definitely use this seller again! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Lovely delicate fragrance, but it does not last.  Light, crisp, with lemon tones.  Ideal for daytime, but I would not purchase again--sorry.</li>
            <li> Unusual and very energizing.  Base notes are citrus but there are more complex notes I cannot quite identify.  It would be a good perfume to layer, I think with the Eau D&#x27;Sud with the latter as the daytime and the Eau D&#x27;Hadrien evening.  I am sold on the Goutal fragrance complexity.</li>
            <li> Outstanding aroma. Have used it for years!! Very fresh smelling. Would recommend it to anyone, male or female. Everyone like the aroma.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance. but I had the idea that the smell evaporates quickly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zesty notes of the true Sicilian lemon and grapefruit mingle with the refinement of the citron tree and cypress notes to give a universal fragrance, subtle and refined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: bergamot, citrus accord, grapefruit, lemon, cédrat, cypress, galbanum, basil, juniper berry, ylang-ylang, woody accord.</li>
            <li> Love the lemon smell but wish it lasted longer on the skin.  Seems to be a common problem with most lemony perfumes.  I will go back to toilet water as the smell is the same and lasts as long as the perfume.</li>
            <li> If you have a pre 2009 bottle, it smells quite different from what is being sold under this name now. The Hadrien I know and love is like a blast of citrus that lasts all day if you spray a few times... this smells like some generic grasses and disappears in an instant.</li>
            <li> This is a classic, clean, crisp scent with citrus overtones.  I always get compliments when I wear it.  Great for summer; very fresh and light.</li>
