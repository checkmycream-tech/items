            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and makes my face soft, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this for cuts, for red/tired eyes, and as a main ingredient for my dray shampoo recipe.</li>
            <li>This is a good product used for as long as I can remember never disappoint as any natural product easy to use no side effects all natural, but for some weird reason it acts real fast on minor skin blemishes on major problems it takes a little longer but still a very good product.</li>

            <li> I have used this for cuts, for red/tired eyes, and as a main ingredient for my dray shampoo recipe. This works great! I have zero complaints, and have been surprised at how effective witch hazel is. I also use it for mosquito bites - it&#x27;s the only thing that makes the itching stop for me. Love this product!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me.  Most witch hazel has alcohol added and this is pure.  It cleanses skin and heals it.</li>
            <li> Works like magic on my skin!</li>
            <li> 100% Witch Hazel! It works. Serves as a great followup face toner! It does not irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this for a few years now and it&#x27;s in a decent size bottle so it lasts awhile. I really like it and use it everyday on my face. It&#x27;s refreshing and makes my face soft, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> no issues. quick ship</li>
            <li> I am not the typical &#x27;stock up on important things&#x27; girl but I buy at least two of these each time because I use it everyday and for many things.  It is my go to for face cleaning.  I use it on every itch rash boo boo and bite.  The second bottle is usually used to sooth any skin problems my dog or cat may encounter.  It&#x27;s not just that it&#x27;s witch hazel it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s THIS witch hazel.  No burning alcohol or stinging just soothing effective actual witch hazel at an actual affordable price.  LOVE this product.</li>

            <li> This is a good product used for as long as I can remember never disappoint as any natural product easy to use no side effects all natural, but for some weird reason it acts real fast on minor skin blemishes on major problems it takes a little longer but still a very good product.</li>

            <li> Nicely bottled, stores well.</li>
            <li> It works good as a toner but does not seem to reduce hemorrhoid</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel found in the stores contain alcohol, which can be beneficial for some uses, without the alcohol the uses seem infinite.  Astringent, toner, mouth wash, hair rinse and can be used in tonics.&lt;br /&gt;About to place another order!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff and fast delivery! I couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li> Excellent and beautiful bottle.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of witch hazel for may things and this is the purest I have used. Love the smell and works great for skin on face, puffy eyes, bruises, bites, hair, and more. It sets the ph of your skin and I also love things I can mufti-task with and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I use it on/for/in EVERYTHING! The best stuff I&#x27;ve found, and so versatile!</li>
            <li> Good product.  I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Good quality witch hazel oil but way too pricey from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Works great, got rid of some bumps that formed on my head from shaving and really made my aftershave process must easier and gentle.</li>
            <li> Good price, good product</li>
            <li> Great product. A must have product if pregnant and postpartum.  Works wonders.</li>
            <li> Fast shiping, good price. excellent product, Thanks</li>
            <li> Great for my skin, fast shipping</li>
            <li> got this and a few other ingredients to make a bug spray for my horses. One of my horses is allergic to fly spray so was trying to get something that wouldn&#x27;t cause her to lose her hair and put welts on her.  This stuff didn&#x27;t do that to her  Seemed to work ok.  Better than fly spray, does have a strong smell.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. Very thin liquid, at first I thought I bought a bottle of stinky water. Not worth what it cost me in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. I&#x27;m not sure if it works better than the witch hazel with rose water, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Okay I switched from deodorant to a mix of witchhazel and rose water.  In addition I have been using it in some sprays for disinfectant, odor reducer and some body sprays</li>
            <li> Shipped as soon as I ordered it. Works great for what I need it for!</li>
            <li> Great stuff...nostalgic smell!&lt;br /&gt;Evoked&lt;br /&gt; images of summers long ago :)</li>
            <li> I used this to make homemade wipes for my baby. It seems good quality and my son&#x27;s bum is happy with it. ;)</li>
            <li> I use this as a base for skin toners, it&#x27;s alcohol free which is a big plus. It is also great for insect bigs and mild skin irritations. It&#x27;s a little pricey though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I use it on my face too. Very soothing. I have an eczema rash that is almost gone in a short period of time.</li>
