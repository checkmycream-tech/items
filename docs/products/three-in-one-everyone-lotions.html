            <li>I was apprehensive at first about the EO lotion because it seemed too good</li>
            <li>BUT, beware that the scent reminds me more of lemon pound cake, instead of lemon coconut; but this shouldn&#x27;t be a huge concern because I&#x27;ve found that it leaves a very light scent on your skin anyway.</li>
            <li>Very good - smells nice and does a better job than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this lotion!</li>

            <li>Great lemon coconut smell very natural.  </li>
            <li>Perfect moisturizer and very light, just I am not very fond of strong, coconut and lime smell.</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling smooth and moisturized and the scent is excellent; lemon/coconut that smells so natural</li>
            <li>A good price for this large bottle, I will be buying again.</li>
            <li>At the cost of 5 dollars for the large bottle it was a good deal</li>
            <li>Amazing product, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild and goes away fairly quickly which is good.  </li>
            <li>Huge bottle that lasts many months.</li>
            <li>, it makes the tone of my face more smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and the light coconut and lemon smell.</li>
            <li>Great natural lotion, and</li>
            <li>Love the thing that it is organic and sulfates free.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a great smell to it, leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t have all the yucky stuff you don&#x27;t want in a lotion.</li>
            <li>Works well and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think it would be great if they removed the un natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I have been searching for a really great lotion that has no harsh chemicals, animal products or one that is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>If you love lemon bread with that light smell of lemon then your going to adore this lotion.</li>
            <li>I also feel better about the lotion not being animal tested, paraben free and non GMO.</li>
            <li>The smell is heavier while going on, but after it dries it fades to be lightly lemony-sweet if you are touching your nose to your skin to smell it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without leaving any residue and the scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li>My adult son got some and put in zinc oxide to make some sunscreen and is happy using it that way also.</li>
            <li>Smells like lemon sherbet when first put on, but quickly becomes a mild pleasant smell even my husband liked.  </li>
            <li>This is great natural lotion.</li>
            <li>Okay if you are looking for a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Those to me are the 2 most important qualitiies in the body products I choose to purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on the thinner side, which is actually good because it spreads really well.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight, absorbs quickly and great smell.</li>
            <li>It is a fairly strong fresh lemon scent that fades away nicely.</li>
            <li>It smells marvelous, and I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts or dryness or blocked pores or greasy feeling as I have with other lotions.</li>
            <li>When I first got this lotion, I love it so much as it&#x27;s got a great scent and does not stick.</li>
            <li>such a good value!</li>
            <li>The sent is refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>Great for dry toddler skin too, they love the smell :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient because of the pump, and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a clean, non-toxic product, much more so than the others always claim.</li>
            <li>Unless you love smelling like a cross between a lemon cupcake and a pina colada, you will not be happy.  </li>
            <li>Phew, this has a really strong (and somewhat chemical-y) scent to it.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious, but at first you definitely smell more of the lemon than coconut, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>(and I am often allergic to too strongly scented lotions), but at that price point I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li>lemon smell is a bit strong</li>
            <li>This should not be too strong as to alienate coworkers.</li>
            <li>it smells delightful, has just the right texture and consistency, and i use it almost every day (as body lotion only).</li>
            <li>Smells great with a pleasant, not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>( the lavender is pretty nice )</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, the texture &amp; consistency are perfect for me- smooth, not too thick or too runny.</li>
            <li>I love that the bottle is huge yet very inexpensive, which is great since I use it on my whole body.  </li>
            <li>Pure with no nasty chemicals makes it easy to over indulge!</li>
            <li>This lotion is light and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be just fine.  </li>
            <li>Tremendous value!</li>
            <li>Product came quick :)</li>
            <li>I put it on my whole family and they love it!</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, goes on lightly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very light and fresh, but not  girly.</li>
            <li>The bottle is quite large and had a handy dispenser pump</li>
            <li>I thought I would love the coconut lemon smell because I love both coconut and lemon, but together in this particular lotion I feel like a pina colada!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also huge.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle.  </li>
            <li>Huge bottle of product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle</li>
            <li>and you get a huge thing of lotion for the price.</li>
            <li>You get a huge bottle for the money.</li>
            <li>And the bottle is huge for the price.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, is light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and can be used anywhere on your body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so well given how light it is.</li>
            <li>Amazing scent, very moisturizing</li>
            <li>This smelled really nice, but wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something with a light scent.</li>
            <li>It is light and non-greasy and has a delectable (but not overpowering) smell.</li>
            <li>began my search for an organic and paraben free lotion.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and makes your skin feel smooth after the shower.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic and light.  </li>
            <li>do not hate the product.</li>
            <li>For those of you with Gluten allergies, this is Gluten free.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I hope this company improves on its formula by removing the cheap filler Glyceryl Stearate (palm oil).</li>
            <li>I do not use it on my face because I have my own moisturizer I use, but I use this lotion on my hands and body and it really leaves my skin feeling moist.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gluten free, paraben free, and so on.</li>
            <li>(Skin Deep is a great place to review ingredients</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light lotion (don&#x27;t expect body butter creaminess) that absorbs well after a shower.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is light, and stays on all day, without getting you greasy.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells like cheap flavored lemon creme.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is gluten free.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable using this every morning after a shower.</li>
            <li>A light lemon scent that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>The lotion is incredibly smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky or tacky.</li>
            <li>Lotion is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>it is light but moisturizes well.</li>

            <li>I used to use St. Ives because it was cheap and readily available</li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a scent I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is like a cheap yoplait brand lemon yogurt or lemon pledge.</li>
            <li>Light lemony scent with just a hint of coconut beneath it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cruelty free.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself provides the perfect amount of moisturization without feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.  </li>

            <li>If you are sensitive to fakey smells, this might be OK if you liked coconut and lemon.</li>
            <li>This makes your skin SO soft and it smells SO good.</li>
            <li>The smell is so good, and it feels soft and smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The smell honestly reminds me of a light Thai curry (lemongrass and coconut, not so much the spices).</li>
            <li>Strong, sweet lemon smell but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell but needs a little help to become a suitable moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just incredible, even when I exercise it doesn&#x27;t become slimy like other lotions.</li>
            <li>It has a very light lemon scent with a hint of coconut and seems pretty gender neutral.</li>
            <li>The smell is clean and light and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to slather on quickly.  </li>
            <li>It starts out strong but fades quickly and does not provoke my allergies as some fragrances do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a new favorite!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my new favorite :)</li>
            <li>Use this everyday , pleasant perfume, not greasy , skin feels nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have tried of theirs and I will be buying more products.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this one, but it&#x27;s just not as emollient as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it&#x27;s not a thick lotion but is still effective.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and works great for kids and adults.</li>
            <li>Palm oil, even the so called RSPO is not ECO or animal friendly.</li>
            <li>i know its maddening but worth educating yourself over!    </li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling and smelling fresh!</li>
            <li>I really like this product and because it&#x27;s a great price for the size, I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>The first lotion I laid eyes on happened to be Everyone Lotion, and it was labeled &#x27;gluten free&#x27;!</li>
            <li>You will love it after the first use.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of fresh baked lemon cookies, yum!</li>
            <li>The size is great and it lasts a long time, spreads smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many natural lotions and this one is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to those who are sensitive to smells as well as anyone who wants a great lotion without feeling like they have grease on them.</li>
            <li>less than ideal.</li>
            <li>The ingredients were OK too - not the most natural of lotions out there, but I gave it a pass.</li>
            <li>I think it will be great in the summer months when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it is in the winter.</li>
            <li>Such a great, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Clean citrus smell.</li>
            <li>The coconut/lemon smells so good and the lotion is light enough to use on your face as well.</li>
            <li>feel like the more natural the product the better for your body.</li>
            <li>Light lotion that goes on quickly and leaves you smelling your hands for quite a while after application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a couple hours and the smell has faded away to almost nothing, but my skin feels very soft and nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to find a natural product that is affordable!  </li>
            <li>If you are worried about DIMETHICONE or anything else, you might want to consider making your own lotions, otherwise this is as close to ALL NATURAL as I believe we are going to get!</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday use right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Not too coconutty and the smell dissipates fairly quickly, but smells lovely when you first apply.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, and it is rich and moisturizing, while still leaving a clear feel to your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is light and smells so fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>Great all natural lotion with w high safety rating from ewg.</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth with this huge bottle of lotion.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Everyone Lotion uses all natural ingredients, has an amazing smell, and can be used anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>WOW this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a light, non greasy, easily absorbed lotion.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite lotion ever.</li>
            <li>Just a nice soft lemon/coconut scent.</li>
            <li>And a quickie hand lotion when I&#x27;m in a hurry is ok, as it rubs in fast.</li>
            <li>It is a good basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Really like it :-)</li>
            <li>I wondered if it would do a good enough job moisturizing my skin, which I would describe as &amp;#34;moderately dry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly picky when it comes to lotion, and especially anything with coconut.</li>
            <li>Big bottle, handy pump, doesn&#x27;t take much product to be effective.</li>
            <li>a deal to be true</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell the coconut at all - it&#x27;s more like a lemon confection, but my mom took one whiff and all she could smell was coconut and no lemon.</li>
            <li>This brand caught my interest and after seeing the price for such a good sized bottle, I impulsively dropped this into my cart</li>
            <li>A lil greasy but not bad.</li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;m satisfied because I believe that this lotion is truly 1 of the highest bang for your bucks for all-natural, value conscious lotions on the market!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice smelling and for someone who doesn&#x27;t have very dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong at first and disappears after a while.</li>
            <li>Whatever we put on our bodies is absorbed into the bloodstream, so it is important to avoid the many chemicals that are standard in most lotions.</li>
            <li>It smells like real lemons which is very clean.  </li>
            <li>Overall looks like great quality product and large quantity for the price.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fine at first</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and fresh, and I would recommend it for men as well.</li>
            <li>Thankfully there is a quick fix for this issue.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I was really amazed at what  a great product this is, especially for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not beat the price.will order more in the future for sure.</li>
            <li>Trying to find more natural and paraben free products, bought this for my fiance.</li>
            <li>but this is name for quick application after showering.</li>
            <li>Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for a great product, but I will be returning this as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>No greasy at all, blends in quickly, and my skin feels</li>
            <li>I used it while pregnant and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>So it will spread very easily and very quickly but it won&#x27;t moisturize deeply.</li>
            <li>soon I will buy more I really highly recomended</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this lotion because the price was right</li>
            <li>Even in the hot summer, this was way too light for my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a billion other lotions and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Since it was very hot here in SoCal, my jar of Coconut oil is now in it&#x27;s liquid form.  </li>
            <li>My young daughter applies this lotion with no coaxing, much due the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>It has a great consistency; is thinner then a body butter but not watered down at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product  mainly because it was such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I have always used EO lotions, but this one is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>It firms my skin, smells good when you apply, and it moisturizes so much better than any lotion I tried in the past.</li>
            <li>best cream ever last a long time</li>
            <li>The smell is light and clean though so overall, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>this is pretty much only good for hands</li>
            <li>I love the scent - very soft, won&#x27;t enter the room before you do.</li>
            <li>Smells yummy, keeps skin very soft, and love the all-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product due to the fact it&#x27;s gluten-free, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Love the lotion but the smell was a little more sweet than i thought!</li>
            <li>and it never fails, adverse side effects abound!  </li>
            <li>I love the way how soft it makes my skin!</li>
            <li>LOVE this lotion for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, does NOT leave any greasy feeling, and I am buying my own big container of it ASAP!</li>
            <li>The smell is clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very lightweight and probably fine for summertime use, but I found it to be less-than-desireable for winter time skin care.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this large bottle because I use our lotions for massaging feet and body and need something really smooth and emollient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SCENT: Right from the pump, the lemon is the most prominent scent here, however, only when first pumped.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s huge, so will last a long time, rubs in easily, and it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is light, fades quickly; it&#x27;s very lemony with coconut undertones.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, but very calming.  </li>
            <li>I have used it only 1 week and see amazing results.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Smooth, gentle lemon scent that fades within minutes.  </li>
            <li>In any case, this lotion is deceivingly light but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday moisturizing needs.</li>
            <li>but this is just amazing and it last all day.</li>
            <li>: Amazing considering this is natural and how much one gets is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But just as an everyday lotion, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Jergens lotion products for a long time and was very satisfied with those products, until Jergens got me detained and searched by homeland security.</li>
            <li>Love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Coconut and Lemon combination smells really fresh and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh, and keeps my body moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice as a basic hand lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh, not chemically.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of hydration, this is an OK light basic lotion.  </li>
            <li>and I love that EO products use [mostly] natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for more natural products and came across this lotion.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and much better than before using it.</li>
            <li>The plus to that is that the scent does fade and once absorbed by the skin,</li>
            <li>The scent and the price are worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I also love that this is made with mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It literally smells like coconut milk that you get in the can to cook with, and literally a fresh sliced lemon.</li>
            <li>love this natural lotion.</li>
            <li>- I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Do you know how rare that is?</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a more natural product</li>
            <li>I tried making my own and figured this was inexpensive enough to have on hand for when my homemade lotions aren&#x27;t working out so well.</li>
            <li>Remember, your skin is a sponge and anything that you put on it is absorbed into your blood stream.</li>
            <li>The scent just makes you smile because it is so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but I don&#x27;t  really like sweet food smells in lotions.</li>
            <li>The actual quality of the lotion itself is nice.  </li>
            <li>I tend to buy mostly organic or synthetic free body products as much as possible.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best lotions I have tired.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent</li>
            <li>Recieved this 2 days early :)</li>
            <li>I like the large amount but did not like the strong lime scent at first.</li>
            <li>and it gets absorbed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I normal have insanely dry skin during all seasons, this lotion is great</li>
            <li>Great, clean fragrance from natural botanical oils, minus the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Please remove the dimethicone and I will be a lifetime user as I love the scent and most other ingredients.</li>
            <li>and it seemed more organic than many of the options out there with parabens and other toxins.  </li>
            <li>Nice, light weight lotion with a lovely subtle coconut-lemon scent.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, very subtle, and great ingredients.</li>
            <li>I will try a different scent but the lotion itself aside from this particular scent was good.</li>
            <li>Love love love and last a long time!</li>
            <li>It is firming, which was right away noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about coconut lotions, if it isn&#x27;t done right</li>
            <li>The smell just didn&#x27;t sit right with me</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all, just melts right into the skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbs right in.  </li>
            <li>Boy, did I make the right decision.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li>no scent of coconut not to thick or watery non greasy absorbes very quick leaves hands feeling very soft great price for this much NATURAL lotion i dont think it can be beat :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely try this if you want a nice lotion, a great price, and less toxins than other brands.</li>
            <li>It felt great for the first 5 minutes, and then my skin felt tight and even dryer than before!</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs really fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, I love that it&#x27;s natural abd that you can use it for your while body!</li>
            <li>It absorbs more than Aveeno, but it does seem to moisturize quite well, even if I maybe use a little more of it</li>
            <li>Large quantity!</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild and natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and my smell is very heightened</li>
            <li>I have used it on the face, and it&#x27;s great, but I do ADD another product since I have all the physical moisture of an actual rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super gentle.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly but really works.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really enjoying this product and it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I like that it is safe for my whole family from baby to adult.</li>
            <li>You get a fair amount for what you pay, while actually taking care of your skin, and improving it naturally.</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs super fast.  </li>
            <li>It is light, easily absorbed into the skin, all natural, not tested on animals and made by a family owned company.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Also this a very large product looks exactly how it does in the picture...</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing, relatively fast drying and absorbing, and you get a lot of product for your money&#x27;s worth (especially for a paraben free, cruelty free lotion).  </li>
            <li>My skin gets a beautiful shine and it doesn&#x27;t get extremely dry by the next day.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have very much moisturizing power though.</li>
            <li>and so far this has been working just fine.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice and seems to be working on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>A little bit thicker consistency would be good.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and fresh and is not full of harmful chemicals. :)</li>
            <li>so I am always looking for natural and cruelty free lotions.  </li>
            <li>I was at first concerned about the scent</li>
            <li>my first shipment exploded all over the protective bags.  </li>
            <li>I have tried SO many different lotions...</li>
            <li>It leaves me silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>at first I found the fragrance off-putting, but I&#x27;ve grown used to it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, however, when it arrived, it was open with lotion all over the inside of the plastic bag containing the lotion bottle.  </li>
            <li>Coconut and Lemon is pretty much smelling like summertime in a bottle!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li>I personally need something more for my body in the winter, but I might keep using this on my hands and face year around.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as soft and smooth as I was hoping...</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It takes two or three minutes to stop being sticky and then my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazingly smooth and natural.  </li>
            <li>Very tropical and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been researching natural body care products that are paraben and chemical free.</li>
            <li>It will probably last a really long time which is great.</li>
            <li>I have decided not to make any more purchase of this lotion after my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>First time I have tried this lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very scented!  </li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon had it as my local health food store was clueless about what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Very summery!  </li>
            <li>I love it and will purchase again as soon as this bottle gets low.</li>
            <li>I love it for daily use.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, but not &#x27;sticky&#x27; or &#x27;tacky&#x27; after you apply it!</li>
            <li>There are no scary ingredients, and it works like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>I use this after the shower and it works pretty well though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see this same scent in a lotion just for the body</li>
            <li>I really do love this lotion and plan on buying several to keep around the house.</li>
            <li>I was concerned the first time I used it because it feels so lightweight</li>
            <li>That was the first thing I noticed</li>
            <li>First lotion you can trust because you know what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li>I will most likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>This lotion was EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>I would consider trying this lotion in another scent, but will stick with a smaller size until I know for sure</li>
            <li>I am excited it can be used as a face lotion as well, since it&#x27;s all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I have a giant bottle of this!</li>
            <li>now know why it&#x27;s cheap for a big bottle full of \\&quot;organic lotion\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Just looked at the ingredients, and the first one listed is?  </li>
            <li>Very affordable!  </li>
            <li>It IS time to stop using poison products and start supporting companies that put together healthful products for us to use.</li>
            <li>I have used most scents of this product and my current infatuation is the Coconut and Lemon.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Overall I like the EO product lines as they are mostly organic and</li>
            <li>I love the soap of the same smell but for some reason the lotion smells like frosting to me.  </li>
            <li>and my skin just drinks it up and feel soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it!</li>
            <li>Bit hesitant of the smell when I first used the product.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Light enough for repeat, daily use (not that you need to apply, and apply, and apply; I just LOVE the light scent) and rich enough for nighttime slathering.</li>
            <li>I like products that are natural and are budget friendly.  </li>
            <li>When I ran out of my facial organic creme last time after forgetting to reorder, I used the everyone lotion on my face to moisturize after showering, and it felt good on my skin</li>
            <li>I was hoping that the scent would be less strong but it&#x27;s fair to say that the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger for too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also male, and while it smells sweet and fruity when I apply, the smell fades quickly and I don&#x27;t worry about others thinking I&#x27;m wearing women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>pretty much cover myself in this lotion every day or two.</li>
            <li>I also love how the ingredients are more natural than other lotions I normally buy.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t linger a long time but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural body lotion: paraben free, chemical perservative free, Sodium Lauryl Sulfrate free (generally a foaming agent, makes my skin itchy and red),</li>
            <li>The lotion has a nice fragrance but it is just an average lotion.</li>
            <li>Good for the price but a little too watery for the high Sierra mountains.</li>
            <li>Fresh lively smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly emollient if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my always-dry skin soft.</li>
            <li>SO, I would not recommend this for extremely dry skin, unless you don&#x27;t mind applying this many times over.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep my dry skin moist for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without researching it too deeply, the ingredients all appear to be pretty innocuous, and it&#x27;s free of lots of things like Parabens,  polysorbate, EDTA, etc.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and somehow decided it must not smell as strong as others said - please don&#x27;t make the same mistake.  </li>
            <li>i only wish they had a scent thats lasts but not too strong Update ...</li>
            <li>I love every single EO product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I do like they are mostly pure ingredients.</li>
            <li>Large size&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>Large container lasts a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Avalon hand and body lotion in lemon scent for now, but will keep an eye out here for new scents that might be better.</li>
            <li>He says that&#x27;s fine, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me, but next time I&#x27;ll be trying the Coconut.</li>
            <li>lotion is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Although I can find several lotions with those criteria, none have been as pleasant odored or creamy soft such as this.</li>
            <li>but luckily it goes right back on and still works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good vegan body lotion for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion, can&#x27;t wait to try other scents...leaves skin very soft and don&#x27;t feel dry by the end of the day like  most lotions...but not greasy at all and soaks right in.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the lotion is perfect -- thin enough to pour easily into other dispensers but thick enough to feel perfect on my skin.</li>
            <li>So clean &amp; my young kids live the smell too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely not suggest anyone buy this huge bottle until they smelled it.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle of lotion that&#x27;s priced fairly low for what it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle so it should last a while.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle &amp; can put it on after shaving.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suffer much from outbreaks to begin with, but this lotion covers all my skin needs and it is now a keeper.  </li>
            <li>Light, yet moisturizing enough for even the drier seasons</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again and again.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing without any greasiness</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first skincare product that&#x27;s given me the delight of feeling like a normal girl.</li>
            <li>The whole family likes it.</li>
            <li>It also really moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not over empowering and you can really distinguish the two scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like they&#x27;ve given their products a bit of a modern facelift.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have the coconut + lemon scented lotion, and the coconut is a bit much for my taste.  </li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t keep the moisture in for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an unusual fragrance, but I quite like it.</li>
            <li>Skin really glows with my monthly purchase of this item.</li>
            <li>My son wants to eat this stuff; it smells like creamy lemon bars.</li>
            <li>Perks: Non GMO, cruelty free, plant-based, and scented with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I realize lotion can&#x27;t really moisturize, but they should keep the moisture in that is there.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>It smells so much like a lemon tart that I wanna grab a spoon and dig in.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>This stuff absolutely crushes every one of those.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell the coconut a whole lot</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>I like the coconut-lemon scent, though I don&#x27;t get much of the lemon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much of it.</li>
            <li>Love the minimal ingredients in this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Safe to use even on my 3 year old and the price is fantastic for such a big bottle with quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cheap and just what you need daily..</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend this lotion!  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted to like it, but it just didn&#x27;t work on me no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li>it reminds me too much like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; ingredient list in my opinion.</li>
            <li>A must have for the whole fam.</li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is awkward at best.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well</li>
            <li>It is even light enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li>Very emollient.</li>
            <li>All in all - really like this lotion and plan to continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>I recently went paraben free and that is why I purchased this lotion.  </li>
            <li>This really do smell like cookies, also i used this on my face</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, almost watery to a degree.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for EVERYONE and EVERYBODY!</li>
            <li>The cheap store brand lotion seems to last longer in both moisturizing and fragrance.</li>
            <li>very hydrating.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My husband loves it for foot rubs as it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;gunk&#x27; up... and with the list of natural ingredients I am not afraid to use it on my kids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a total stickler for 100% products, but this all natural lotion is magic.</li>
            <li>This is the only fragrance I&#x27;ve ordered, but it is such a popular winner, I&#x27;ll stick with the Coconut &amp; Lemon.</li>
            <li>However, one of my favorite parts is that this lotion is natural and made with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a good value, at least where I bought it.</li>
            <li>I normally buy the Alba Botanica Cocoa Butter body lotion in a giant size bottle with fierce loyalty, but since becoming a student again, I could not withstand the $7 price hike.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me any negative reaction so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that overall I&#x27;m mostly satisfied with this lotion, thus far.  </li>
            <li>It is great for skin that&#x27;s not super dry.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little thinner because it spreads better and on hot days</li>
            <li>My husband and I try to massage each others feet and upper back every night, so it&#x27;s important for us to not use lotions full of harmful</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, the ingredients are pure and all natural, but the level of moisture it provides is not very much.</li>
            <li>This is way better than the cow udder oily junk or lanolin stuff I&#x27;ve been relying on for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have this BIG supply of lotion in my home, from which I can easily refill my smaller, decorative dispensers in other rooms.  </li>
            <li>I love how it isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li>Its not thick, but not thin lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love that it does not have a lot of chemicals in it, and it goes on smoothly and actually absorbs into your skin without lots of effort, unlike some of the other natural brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty masculine guy, and I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>The coconut/lemon has a fairly strong natural lemon scent with a more subtle coconut backnote.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite lotion ever (shhh- don&#x27;t tell Burt&#x27;s Bees).</li>
            <li>This is our new lotion!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new, and this looked promising.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is amazing- vaguely tropical but light-</li>
            <li>Now, I actually like it better than my facial creme!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is because I eat mainly plant based foods, so</li>
            <li>I used it mainly for my hands and body</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s mainly why I purchased this lotion AND their body wash (soap).  </li>
            <li>Works great for the whole family and is not that expensive.</li>
            <li>I have used it on stretch marks from being pregnant and it reduces their appearance and is not gross and oily.</li>
            <li>, my weird allergies want to personally thank the makers of this delightful product for your restraint in NOT jumping on the shea butter bandwagon.</li>
            <li>This would be great as a summer body lotion, but if you want something thick and substantial that will deeply moisturize, this may not be the one.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, my kids have ULTRA sensitive, rough skin.</li>
            <li>It feels and works like regular lotion, nothing super fancy.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to find this one.</li>
            <li>In the winter I use the lavender scent, since this one seems particularly summery.</li>
            <li>Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a one-time thing, I tried it after my next shower and had similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product not only satisfies my skins needs for moisture, but unlike many other lotions does NOT leave you feeling greasy or even more dry than</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I think my expectations were too high based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>Feels like a high quality lotion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion for foot massages.</li>
            <li>but with a slight scent and same big bottle n great price</li>
            <li>The lotion texture is a little more...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little bit more viscous than what I&#x27;d like, but all of us can use it, and nobody minds the smell.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t live in a very dry climate, I think this will work fine.</li>
            <li>This is only good for people who want very little moisture.</li>
            <li>I have very sensistive skin and decided I wanted to try out some natural lotion.</li>
            <li>my two year old son thinks it smells like ice cream, haha.  </li>
            <li>I recently started trying to buy more natural products after hearing about potentially harmful chemicals in mainstream products.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li>My skin is fairly normal, so anyone with skin problems would probably look for something to help their skin problems.  </li>
            <li>I applied more and my skin broke out after too heavy an application.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s normal and does its job.</li>
            <li>Good product, but the pump was broken and I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion, not quite as thick as I prefer, but</li>
            <li>The smell is very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any red skin on face due to shaving and especially on my neck and putting it after washing my face in the morning makes it feel good.</li>
            <li>&gt;  pure and natural - gentle enough for the whole family</li>
            <li>BUT, like the other reviewers mentioned this lotion is way too light.</li>
            <li>Its a little thin for your body however great for your face!</li>
            <li>And then again, I got my new lotion with a brand new pump and the bottle</li>
            <li>I live in Florida,</li>
            <li>I live in a winter area</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado</li>
            <li>I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I also live in the northeast -</li>
            <li>EO will be my new brand.</li>
            <li>and I shop for something new.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li>Would love it if they made a lotion with raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>It is safe for use everyday and made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I do have super dry skin and need something thicker so my hands</li>
            <li>and I would not recommend this for super dry or flakey skin.</li>
            <li>Would have given five stars if the top hadn&#x27;t broken so easily from regular use.</li>
            <li>I really dont have much issue with this especially considering out of the 27 ingredients listed its 23rd on the list.</li>
            <li>Bought this because I was look for a large quantity lotion (32oz is hard to find) that was more natural than not and would moisturize well</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scented lotions</li>
            <li>I use it daily and like it very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;  gentle and fragrant with ingredients and essential oils that are pure, natural and organic&lt;br</li>
            <li>just completing my first big bottle and will reorder.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t plan on using it on my face regardless, no scented products allowed there!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh lemon-y coconut-y scent, which doesn&#x27;t linger too long</li>
            <li>I can smell the lotion on my skin hours later, but I don&#x27;t think anyone else has noticed it -- and that&#x27;s exactly what I want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaving me feeling just so soft!</li>
            <li>This lotion doesn&#x27;t sting in the open cracks either like many other lotions do.</li>
            <li>a total first for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and you can use it everywhere - including your face!</li>
            <li>and they felt soft!</li>
            <li>So far I like it!</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve been using it every night after my shower for a solid week (at least) and it has done a fine job keeping my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sickeningly sweet, which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free products that actually work extremely well.</li>
            <li>And, the lotion is pretty weak -- it&#x27;s not straight watery, but it&#x27;s not as creamy as good lotion should be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that I even use it on my face even though I typically avoid greasy lotions for my face.</li>
            <li>and the smell is strong at first but subtle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Smooth texture, applied evenly, and has less chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li>lotion is worth a go- for combination skin, dry skin, or oily skin like my partner.</li>
            <li>I used it on my dry hands and it absorbed well</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and sinks into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>skin deep gives this a 2, which overall is not bad</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how much we dislike it, and we all love both lemons and coconut (my little boys use coconut and lemon scented everything!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and so far this hasn&#x27;t irritated it</li>
            <li>It causes no irritation, it&#x27;s all organic (i.e. not full of toxic chemicals to slather on your skin), it&#x27;s light and non-greasy and it smells like heaven.</li>
            <li>and I like that it is all natural and can be used on my kids sensitive skin as well!</li>
            <li>Its super hot and dry all summer, and winters are blizzard like but still dry.  </li>
            <li>pure essential oils nurture and soothe the skin</li>
            <li>It your skin isn&#x27;t dry or you live in a hot climate this may work.</li>
            <li>A little watery, but light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>That is almost expected as I have to do this with most anyway since my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li>It is so hard to tell with this lotion that they have left out the bad chemicals, because it works good and smells great.</li>
            <li>More of a light lotion (we will see how it does for cold winter).</li>
            <li>Sinks in fast without to much work.</li>
            <li>It leaves me soft &amp; not greasy.</li>
            <li>No petroleum products as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s worked</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can use it on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>Then I applied you and have been transformed from a look-at-me-and-I&#x27;ll-rash-up scale monster to a lush, glistening, lightly-scented lily.</li>
            <li>Our skin is the largest organ and requires natural products.</li>
            <li>therefore your claims of natural are unwarranted.</li>
            <li>We have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s contains no chemicals and is all natural, just wish it was so runny.</li>
            <li>absorbs into skin leaving soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use  this after a shower when my skin is damp, yet shortly thereafter, my skin isn&#x27;t very moist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for my chapped hands, so that&#x27;s why only four stars.</li>
            <li>Purchased this lotion based on the reviews and because it was natural.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it though because of the price, the quantity and the fact its natural.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>I even have used this on my young daughter and it worked well.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for the young men of the house.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve developed a number of areas that look like excema.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have children with sensitive skin as well as myself</li>
            <li>all natural smells.</li>
            <li>I have purchased two so far and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>The lotion keeps my skin soft without being greasy or clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>Yes, there are a lot of perservatives in this, its a bit of an overkill, but theyre natural nontheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mom of 2 young boys-</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I have used about every lotion on the market and love EO Everyday lotion, but wanted something in a larger size.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin naturally soft and smooth without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I should give this lotion 4 stars for its poor moisturizing, but the smell is so divine that it is deserving of 5 stars just for that.</li>
            <li>but I love my moisturizers really thick and luxurious</li>
            <li>I actually get more moisture using plain old coconut oil</li>
            <li>so I had a bit of a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>This lotion is thin, and absorbs quickly, but is not nearly as moisturizing as Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, which is my favorite lotion on the market today.</li>
            <li>and I believe it&#x27;s the best on the market right now because everything else I&#x27;ve tried has been terrible or isn&#x27;t comparable to the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with this lotion because although it has a thin consistency, it coats and hydrates dry skin very well, even dry rough feet.  </li>
            <li>I have spent way more on other brands in order to go natural</li>
            <li>I have to rub it in pretty well to get it all to absorb into my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I might go ahead and add some additional fragrance in it myself to make it less sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>(My skin is normal, its not dry, I just like to keep it mosturized and use it</li>
            <li>I opted for this because it was all natural, and I&#x27;m trying to stay away from various chemicals, and GMO products, not to mention the price point was the main decision maker.</li>
            <li>Disappointed, especially after so many other comments about how great this stuff smells.</li>
            <li>I may try a different scent however as the lotion was, for the price, quite decent.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, so I could probably use something a little stronger, but it works for everyday use, and the smell is great.</li>
            <li>The moisture doesn&#x27;t last a long time and washes right off</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not very heavy.</li>
            <li>To get the free shipping I went ahead and sprang for the lavender lotion and matching body wash along with another small item.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a fabulous moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t use animals or harsh chemicals to produce, this is THE lotion!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t soak in too fast, but doesn&#x27;t take too long either.</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic due to the amount that you get in the bottle and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>In 48 hours, this lotion has completely smoothed over my infant daughter&#x27;s rough, sensitive skin, which no other lotion has accomplished.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, it is subtle yet it lasts a long time, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find lotion without all the harsh chemicals and alcohols that actually DRY your skin out, forcing you to use more and more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as thick as other lotions, but works great for me and my family considering that we&#x27;re not absorbing harmful chemicals into our skin</li>
            <li>it did nothing to help our families dry skin which really is a bummer</li>
            <li>The last one lasted for several month and my skin really appreciates this lotion all around.</li>
            <li>Not the type of fragrance that&#x27;ll turn your colleagues off - just wonderfully fresh, lemony, slightly coconutty scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and fantastic, very natural smell not perfumy and overbearing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated when I first apply this lotion, but I often find that my skin is dry after a couple hours of the initial application.</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes your skin super soft without nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li>The huge con is that its not moisturizing enough because after 5 minutes my newly shaven legs will become tight and dry feeling.</li>
            <li>but because it&#x27;s not very thick - it&#x27;ll last awhile in this size.</li>
            <li>It smells a little different, lemon and coconut, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin right now since winter has dragged on, and have been looking for a nice lotion that isn&#x27;t very expensive and without lots of chemicals.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t it, but I like the scent and will continue to use it for general purposes.</li>
            <li>Generally, I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Body</li>
            <li>/&gt;She wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell at first, although, I love it, but she&#x27;s started to get used to it.</li>
            <li>But my diabetic hands don&#x27;t think this is anywhere near moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrance, this isn&#x27;t likely for you.</li>
            <li>later purchased a bottle of EL in lavender/aloe; don&#x27;t like it nearly as well as</li>
            <li>My hands actually feel soft for hours after using it.</li>
            <li>My kids and I love this lotion but the packaging for shipping was poor.  </li>
            <li>I will say that I felt that the lotion was a bit thin and that is why I gave it four out of five, but I would surely buy it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but my skin still felt a little dry after applying it.</li>
            <li>To me it isn&#x27;t a fake smell -  while the citrus and coconut smells are strong, they smell very much as if you squeezed citrus and cut open a coconut.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness that usually makes my skin uncomfortably itchy during winter.</li>
            <li>This lotion is light but heavy enough that it keeps my skin from drying out during the dry, winter months.</li>
            <li>I noticed it does turn my face red, or parts of my skin red for a few minutes after application, but it quickly wears away.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the scent, which can easily be remedied by purchasing a different one next time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great price for this bottle too--nice to not spend $9.99 on a little tiny bottle of lotion--this is a full 32 ounces, and seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tossed my other more expensive face creams, and just use this now for my whole body.  </li>
            <li>When I use this lotion my skin feels silky soft and I don&#x27;t get that dry, itchy feeling</li>
            <li>My face is moisturized without feeling greasy and my dry elbows and knees are simply soft now.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, and it is January.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of a pina colada -- it is quite pleasant though and not overwhelmingly coconutty at all - very subtle smell.  </li>
            <li>It has limited ingredients with natural extracts which I like.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells natural, although it does not last very long.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels much improved after only a week and half.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s not super expensive and that&#x27;s had fairly good reviews on EWG.  </li>
            <li>Plus the bottle is pretty big for the price, so it seems like it should last for several months even if you use some everyday.</li>
            <li>The only way to make a coconut scented anything is with fragrance oil, and very few companies get coconut right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the value... I have very dry and fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There are some I&#x27;d rather do without, but I think the good out way the bad .</li>

            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the price and the smell.</li>
            <li> So I end up having to use a lot more than I would with a richer lotion.  </li>
            <li> Yep, Water!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly pay more for a  non-watery version of this</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is okay.  </li>

            <li> I Love it.</li>
            <li> and I love adding coconut oil.</li>

            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> and Gluten-Free!  :-)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this, the lotion is moisturizing yet not greasy, and it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> i added some more coconut oil to it and now its like heaven .</li>

            <li> nice, light and moisturizing on the skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks EO Products!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a bit strong at first but as it dries the fragrance mellows out very nicely.</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant, no nasty chemical/perfume smells and good alternative to most commercial lotions.</li>
            <li> it is a great value and it works much better than all of the high $ ones you find at the spas and Make up, bath body stores.</li>
            <li> nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one as a great bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes adequately and has a convenient pump on top!</li>
            <li> Many times I will put this on after shaving my legs and its nice that it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, good consistency and not as \\&quot;watery\\&quot; as before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have been really happy to have the much more natural product that works even better than what we had before.</li>
            <li> The scent is great and for a person with normal skin</li>
            <li> I enjoy good quality, nicely scented body products, and as much as I wanted to like this lotion, I just couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> 99% organic is pretty good.</li>
            <li> lotion feels pretty good and seems to absorb well.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first about the EO lotion because it seemed too good</li>
            <li> BUT, beware that the scent reminds me more of lemon pound cake, instead of lemon coconut; but this shouldn&#x27;t be a huge concern because I&#x27;ve found that it leaves a very light scent on your skin anyway.</li>
            <li> Very good - smells nice and does a better job than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this lotion!</li>
            <li> $10 for a huge bottle of organic lotion is such a great price too!  </li>
            <li> Light smell, not greasy, and great for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, works great with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Strong lemon scent is refreshing and isnt overpowering.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, absorbs quickly, and restores moisture to my skin.  </li>
            <li> This smells great, absorbs fast, is light, non greasy</li>
            <li> it a good moisturizer and it absorbed and glide smoothly to skin</li>
            <li> Plus I love that many of the ingredients are organic and I feel comfortable using it on my boys.</li>
            <li> Great lemon coconut smell very natural.  </li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer and very light, just I am not very fond of strong, coconut and lime smell.</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling smooth and moisturized and the scent is excellent; lemon/coconut that smells so natural</li>
            <li> A good price for this large bottle, I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> At the cost of 5 dollars for the large bottle it was a good deal</li>
            <li> Amazing product, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild and goes away fairly quickly which is good.  </li>
            <li> Huge bottle that lasts many months.</li>
            <li> , it makes the tone of my face more smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion and the light coconut and lemon smell.</li>
            <li> Great natural lotion, and</li>
            <li> Love the thing that it is organic and sulfates free.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a great smell to it, leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t have all the yucky stuff you don&#x27;t want in a lotion.</li>
            <li> Works well and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I think it would be great if they removed the un natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I have been searching for a really great lotion that has no harsh chemicals, animal products or one that is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> If you love lemon bread with that light smell of lemon then your going to adore this lotion.</li>
            <li> I also feel better about the lotion not being animal tested, paraben free and non GMO.</li>
            <li> The smell is heavier while going on, but after it dries it fades to be lightly lemony-sweet if you are touching your nose to your skin to smell it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly without leaving any residue and the scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li> My adult son got some and put in zinc oxide to make some sunscreen and is happy using it that way also.</li>
            <li> Smells like lemon sherbet when first put on, but quickly becomes a mild pleasant smell even my husband liked.  </li>
            <li> This is great natural lotion.</li>
            <li> Okay if you are looking for a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Those to me are the 2 most important qualitiies in the body products I choose to purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the thinner side, which is actually good because it spreads really well.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight, absorbs quickly and great smell.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly strong fresh lemon scent that fades away nicely.</li>
            <li> It smells marvelous, and I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts or dryness or blocked pores or greasy feeling as I have with other lotions.</li>
            <li> When I first got this lotion, I love it so much as it&#x27;s got a great scent and does not stick.</li>
            <li> such a good value!</li>
            <li> The sent is refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li> Great for dry toddler skin too, they love the smell :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient because of the pump, and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a clean, non-toxic product, much more so than the others always claim.</li>
            <li> Unless you love smelling like a cross between a lemon cupcake and a pina colada, you will not be happy.  </li>
            <li> Phew, this has a really strong (and somewhat chemical-y) scent to it.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious, but at first you definitely smell more of the lemon than coconut, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> (and I am often allergic to too strongly scented lotions), but at that price point I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> lemon smell is a bit strong</li>
            <li> This should not be too strong as to alienate coworkers.</li>
            <li> it smells delightful, has just the right texture and consistency, and i use it almost every day (as body lotion only).</li>
            <li> Smells great with a pleasant, not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> ( the lavender is pretty nice )</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, the texture &amp; consistency are perfect for me- smooth, not too thick or too runny.</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle is huge yet very inexpensive, which is great since I use it on my whole body.  </li>
            <li> Pure with no nasty chemicals makes it easy to over indulge!</li>

            <li> I put it on my whole family and they love it!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, goes on lightly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very light and fresh, but not  girly.</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite large and had a handy dispenser pump</li>
            <li> I thought I would love the coconut lemon smell because I love both coconut and lemon, but together in this particular lotion I feel like a pina colada!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also huge.  </li>

            <li> so well given how light it is.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, very moisturizing</li>
            <li> This smelled really nice, but wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something with a light scent.</li>
            <li> It is light and non-greasy and has a delectable (but not overpowering) smell.</li>

            <li> Non-greasy and makes your skin feel smooth after the shower.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic and light.  </li>
            <li> do not hate the product.</li>
            <li> For those of you with Gluten allergies, this is Gluten free.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I hope this company improves on its formula by removing the cheap filler Glyceryl Stearate (palm oil).</li>
            <li> I do not use it on my face because I have my own moisturizer I use, but I use this lotion on my hands and body and it really leaves my skin feeling moist.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gluten free, paraben free, and so on.</li>
            <li> (Skin Deep is a great place to review ingredients</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light lotion (don&#x27;t expect body butter creaminess) that absorbs well after a shower.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a scent I enjoy.  </li>

            <li> If you are sensitive to fakey smells, this might be OK if you liked coconut and lemon.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin SO soft and it smells SO good.</li>
            <li> The smell is so good, and it feels soft and smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The smell honestly reminds me of a light Thai curry (lemongrass and coconut, not so much the spices).</li>
            <li> Strong, sweet lemon smell but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell but needs a little help to become a suitable moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just incredible, even when I exercise it doesn&#x27;t become slimy like other lotions.</li>
            <li> It has a very light lemon scent with a hint of coconut and seems pretty gender neutral.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean and light and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to slather on quickly.  </li>
            <li> It starts out strong but fades quickly and does not provoke my allergies as some fragrances do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a new favorite!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my new favorite :)</li>
            <li> Use this everyday , pleasant perfume, not greasy , skin feels nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have tried of theirs and I will be buying more products.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this one, but it&#x27;s just not as emollient as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it&#x27;s not a thick lotion but is still effective.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and works great for kids and adults.</li>
            <li> Palm oil, even the so called RSPO is not ECO or animal friendly.</li>
            <li> i know its maddening but worth educating yourself over!    </li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling and smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and because it&#x27;s a great price for the size, I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> The first lotion I laid eyes on happened to be Everyone Lotion, and it was labeled &#x27;gluten free&#x27;!</li>
            <li> You will love it after the first use.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of fresh baked lemon cookies, yum!</li>
            <li> The size is great and it lasts a long time, spreads smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural lotions and this one is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to those who are sensitive to smells as well as anyone who wants a great lotion without feeling like they have grease on them.</li>
            <li> less than ideal.</li>
            <li> The ingredients were OK too - not the most natural of lotions out there, but I gave it a pass.</li>
            <li> I think it will be great in the summer months when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it is in the winter.</li>
            <li> Such a great, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Clean citrus smell.</li>
            <li> The coconut/lemon smells so good and the lotion is light enough to use on your face as well.</li>
            <li> feel like the more natural the product the better for your body.</li>
            <li> Light lotion that goes on quickly and leaves you smelling your hands for quite a while after application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple hours and the smell has faded away to almost nothing, but my skin feels very soft and nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to find a natural product that is affordable!  </li>
            <li> If you are worried about DIMETHICONE or anything else, you might want to consider making your own lotions, otherwise this is as close to ALL NATURAL as I believe we are going to get!</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Not too coconutty and the smell dissipates fairly quickly, but smells lovely when you first apply.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, and it is rich and moisturizing, while still leaving a clear feel to your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is light and smells so fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Great all natural lotion with w high safety rating from ewg.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth with this huge bottle of lotion.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and leaves skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Everyone Lotion uses all natural ingredients, has an amazing smell, and can be used anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> WOW this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a light, non greasy, easily absorbed lotion.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion ever.</li>
            <li> Just a nice soft lemon/coconut scent.</li>
            <li> And a quickie hand lotion when I&#x27;m in a hurry is ok, as it rubs in fast.</li>
            <li> It is a good basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really like it :-)</li>
            <li> I wondered if it would do a good enough job moisturizing my skin, which I would describe as &amp;#34;moderately dry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly picky when it comes to lotion, and especially anything with coconut.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, handy pump, doesn&#x27;t take much product to be effective.</li>
            <li> a deal to be true</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really smell the coconut at all - it&#x27;s more like a lemon confection, but my mom took one whiff and all she could smell was coconut and no lemon.</li>
            <li> This brand caught my interest and after seeing the price for such a good sized bottle, I impulsively dropped this into my cart</li>
            <li> A lil greasy but not bad.</li>
            <li> in all I&#x27;m satisfied because I believe that this lotion is truly 1 of the highest bang for your bucks for all-natural, value conscious lotions on the market!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling and for someone who doesn&#x27;t have very dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong at first and disappears after a while.</li>
            <li> Whatever we put on our bodies is absorbed into the bloodstream, so it is important to avoid the many chemicals that are standard in most lotions.</li>
            <li> It smells like real lemons which is very clean.  </li>
            <li> Overall looks like great quality product and large quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s fine at first</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and fresh, and I would recommend it for men as well.</li>
            <li> Thankfully there is a quick fix for this issue.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I was really amazed at what  a great product this is, especially for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not beat the price.will order more in the future for sure.</li>
            <li> Trying to find more natural and paraben free products, bought this for my fiance.</li>
            <li> but this is name for quick application after showering.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for a great product, but I will be returning this as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> No greasy at all, blends in quickly, and my skin feels</li>
            <li> I used it while pregnant and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> So it will spread very easily and very quickly but it won&#x27;t moisturize deeply.</li>
            <li> soon I will buy more I really highly recomended</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this lotion because the price was right</li>
            <li> Even in the hot summer, this was way too light for my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a billion other lotions and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Since it was very hot here in SoCal, my jar of Coconut oil is now in it&#x27;s liquid form.  </li>
            <li> My young daughter applies this lotion with no coaxing, much due the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> It has a great consistency; is thinner then a body butter but not watered down at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product  mainly because it was such a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I have always used EO lotions, but this one is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> It firms my skin, smells good when you apply, and it moisturizes so much better than any lotion I tried in the past.</li>
            <li> best cream ever last a long time</li>
            <li> The smell is light and clean though so overall, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> this is pretty much only good for hands</li>
            <li> I love the scent - very soft, won&#x27;t enter the room before you do.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, keeps skin very soft, and love the all-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the fact it&#x27;s gluten-free, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but the smell was a little more sweet than i thought!</li>
            <li> and it never fails, adverse side effects abound!  </li>
            <li> I love the way how soft it makes my skin!</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, does NOT leave any greasy feeling, and I am buying my own big container of it ASAP!</li>
            <li> The smell is clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very lightweight and probably fine for summertime use, but I found it to be less-than-desireable for winter time skin care.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this large bottle because I use our lotions for massaging feet and body and need something really smooth and emollient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SCENT: Right from the pump, the lemon is the most prominent scent here, however, only when first pumped.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s huge, so will last a long time, rubs in easily, and it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is light, fades quickly; it&#x27;s very lemony with coconut undertones.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The smell is light, but very calming.  </li>
            <li> I have used it only 1 week and see amazing results.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Smooth, gentle lemon scent that fades within minutes.  </li>
            <li> In any case, this lotion is deceivingly light but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday moisturizing needs.</li>
            <li> but this is just amazing and it last all day.</li>
            <li> : Amazing considering this is natural and how much one gets is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But just as an everyday lotion, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Jergens lotion products for a long time and was very satisfied with those products, until Jergens got me detained and searched by homeland security.</li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Coconut and Lemon combination smells really fresh and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh, and keeps my body moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice as a basic hand lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh, not chemically.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of hydration, this is an OK light basic lotion.  </li>
            <li> and I love that EO products use [mostly] natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for more natural products and came across this lotion.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and much better than before using it.</li>
            <li> The plus to that is that the scent does fade and once absorbed by the skin,</li>
            <li> The scent and the price are worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I also love that this is made with mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It literally smells like coconut milk that you get in the can to cook with, and literally a fresh sliced lemon.</li>
            <li> love this natural lotion.</li>
            <li> - I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Do you know how rare that is?</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a more natural product</li>
            <li> I tried making my own and figured this was inexpensive enough to have on hand for when my homemade lotions aren&#x27;t working out so well.</li>
            <li> Remember, your skin is a sponge and anything that you put on it is absorbed into your blood stream.</li>
            <li> The scent just makes you smile because it is so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but I don&#x27;t  really like sweet food smells in lotions.</li>
            <li> The actual quality of the lotion itself is nice.  </li>
            <li> I tend to buy mostly organic or synthetic free body products as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best lotions I have tired.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent</li>
            <li> Recieved this 2 days early :)</li>
            <li> I like the large amount but did not like the strong lime scent at first.</li>
            <li> and it gets absorbed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I normal have insanely dry skin during all seasons, this lotion is great</li>
            <li> Great, clean fragrance from natural botanical oils, minus the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Please remove the dimethicone and I will be a lifetime user as I love the scent and most other ingredients.</li>
            <li> and it seemed more organic than many of the options out there with parabens and other toxins.  </li>
            <li> Nice, light weight lotion with a lovely subtle coconut-lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, very subtle, and great ingredients.</li>
            <li> I will try a different scent but the lotion itself aside from this particular scent was good.</li>
            <li> Love love love and last a long time!</li>
            <li> It is firming, which was right away noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about coconut lotions, if it isn&#x27;t done right</li>
            <li> The smell just didn&#x27;t sit right with me</li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all, just melts right into the skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs right in.  </li>
            <li> Boy, did I make the right decision.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li> no scent of coconut not to thick or watery non greasy absorbes very quick leaves hands feeling very soft great price for this much NATURAL lotion i dont think it can be beat :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely try this if you want a nice lotion, a great price, and less toxins than other brands.</li>
            <li> It felt great for the first 5 minutes, and then my skin felt tight and even dryer than before!</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs really fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, I love that it&#x27;s natural abd that you can use it for your while body!</li>
            <li> It absorbs more than Aveeno, but it does seem to moisturize quite well, even if I maybe use a little more of it</li>
            <li> Large quantity!</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild and natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and my smell is very heightened</li>
            <li> I have used it on the face, and it&#x27;s great, but I do ADD another product since I have all the physical moisture of an actual rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super gentle.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly but really works.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really enjoying this product and it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like that it is safe for my whole family from baby to adult.</li>
            <li> You get a fair amount for what you pay, while actually taking care of your skin, and improving it naturally.</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs super fast.  </li>
            <li> It is light, easily absorbed into the skin, all natural, not tested on animals and made by a family owned company.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Also this a very large product looks exactly how it does in the picture...</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing, relatively fast drying and absorbing, and you get a lot of product for your money&#x27;s worth (especially for a paraben free, cruelty free lotion).  </li>
            <li> My skin gets a beautiful shine and it doesn&#x27;t get extremely dry by the next day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have very much moisturizing power though.</li>
            <li> and so far this has been working just fine.</li>
            <li> the smell is nice and seems to be working on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little bit thicker consistency would be good.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and fresh and is not full of harmful chemicals. :)</li>
            <li> so I am always looking for natural and cruelty free lotions.  </li>
            <li> I was at first concerned about the scent</li>
            <li> my first shipment exploded all over the protective bags.  </li>
            <li> I have tried SO many different lotions...</li>
            <li> It leaves me silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> at first I found the fragrance off-putting, but I&#x27;ve grown used to it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, however, when it arrived, it was open with lotion all over the inside of the plastic bag containing the lotion bottle.  </li>
            <li> Coconut and Lemon is pretty much smelling like summertime in a bottle!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li> I personally need something more for my body in the winter, but I might keep using this on my hands and face year around.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as soft and smooth as I was hoping...</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It takes two or three minutes to stop being sticky and then my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazingly smooth and natural.  </li>
            <li> Very tropical and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching natural body care products that are paraben and chemical free.</li>
            <li> It will probably last a really long time which is great.</li>
            <li> I have decided not to make any more purchase of this lotion after my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> First time I have tried this lotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very scented!  </li>
            <li> I am glad Amazon had it as my local health food store was clueless about what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Very summery!  </li>
            <li> I love it and will purchase again as soon as this bottle gets low.</li>
            <li> I love it for daily use.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but not &#x27;sticky&#x27; or &#x27;tacky&#x27; after you apply it!</li>
            <li> There are no scary ingredients, and it works like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I use this after the shower and it works pretty well though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see this same scent in a lotion just for the body</li>
            <li> I really do love this lotion and plan on buying several to keep around the house.</li>
            <li> I was concerned the first time I used it because it feels so lightweight</li>
            <li> That was the first thing I noticed</li>
            <li> First lotion you can trust because you know what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> I will most likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This lotion was EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I would consider trying this lotion in another scent, but will stick with a smaller size until I know for sure</li>
            <li> I am excited it can be used as a face lotion as well, since it&#x27;s all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I have a giant bottle of this!</li>
            <li> now know why it&#x27;s cheap for a big bottle full of \\&quot;organic lotion\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Just looked at the ingredients, and the first one listed is?  </li>
            <li> Very affordable!  </li>
            <li> It IS time to stop using poison products and start supporting companies that put together healthful products for us to use.</li>
            <li> I have used most scents of this product and my current infatuation is the Coconut and Lemon.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Overall I like the EO product lines as they are mostly organic and</li>
            <li> I love the soap of the same smell but for some reason the lotion smells like frosting to me.  </li>
            <li> and my skin just drinks it up and feel soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it!</li>
            <li> Bit hesitant of the smell when I first used the product.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Light enough for repeat, daily use (not that you need to apply, and apply, and apply; I just LOVE the light scent) and rich enough for nighttime slathering.</li>
            <li> I like products that are natural and are budget friendly.  </li>
            <li> When I ran out of my facial organic creme last time after forgetting to reorder, I used the everyone lotion on my face to moisturize after showering, and it felt good on my skin</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the scent would be less strong but it&#x27;s fair to say that the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger for too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also male, and while it smells sweet and fruity when I apply, the smell fades quickly and I don&#x27;t worry about others thinking I&#x27;m wearing women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> pretty much cover myself in this lotion every day or two.</li>
            <li> I also love how the ingredients are more natural than other lotions I normally buy.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t linger a long time but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural body lotion: paraben free, chemical perservative free, Sodium Lauryl Sulfrate free (generally a foaming agent, makes my skin itchy and red),</li>
            <li> The lotion has a nice fragrance but it is just an average lotion.</li>
            <li> Good for the price but a little too watery for the high Sierra mountains.</li>
            <li> Fresh lively smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly emollient if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my always-dry skin soft.</li>
            <li> SO, I would not recommend this for extremely dry skin, unless you don&#x27;t mind applying this many times over.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep my dry skin moist for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without researching it too deeply, the ingredients all appear to be pretty innocuous, and it&#x27;s free of lots of things like Parabens,  polysorbate, EDTA, etc.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and somehow decided it must not smell as strong as others said - please don&#x27;t make the same mistake.  </li>
            <li> i only wish they had a scent thats lasts but not too strong Update ...</li>
            <li> I love every single EO product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I do like they are mostly pure ingredients.</li>
            <li> Large size&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> Large container lasts a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Avalon hand and body lotion in lemon scent for now, but will keep an eye out here for new scents that might be better.</li>
            <li> He says that&#x27;s fine, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me, but next time I&#x27;ll be trying the Coconut.</li>
            <li> lotion is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Although I can find several lotions with those criteria, none have been as pleasant odored or creamy soft such as this.</li>
            <li> but luckily it goes right back on and still works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good vegan body lotion for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion, can&#x27;t wait to try other scents...leaves skin very soft and don&#x27;t feel dry by the end of the day like  most lotions...but not greasy at all and soaks right in.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion is perfect -- thin enough to pour easily into other dispensers but thick enough to feel perfect on my skin.</li>
            <li> So clean &amp; my young kids live the smell too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely not suggest anyone buy this huge bottle until they smelled it.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle of lotion that&#x27;s priced fairly low for what it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge bottle so it should last a while.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle &amp; can put it on after shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer much from outbreaks to begin with, but this lotion covers all my skin needs and it is now a keeper.  </li>
            <li> Light, yet moisturizing enough for even the drier seasons</li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing without any greasiness</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first skincare product that&#x27;s given me the delight of feeling like a normal girl.</li>
            <li> The whole family likes it.</li>
            <li> It also really moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not over empowering and you can really distinguish the two scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like they&#x27;ve given their products a bit of a modern facelift.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have the coconut + lemon scented lotion, and the coconut is a bit much for my taste.  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t keep the moisture in for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an unusual fragrance, but I quite like it.</li>
            <li> Skin really glows with my monthly purchase of this item.</li>
            <li> My son wants to eat this stuff; it smells like creamy lemon bars.</li>
            <li> Perks: Non GMO, cruelty free, plant-based, and scented with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I realize lotion can&#x27;t really moisturize, but they should keep the moisture in that is there.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> It smells so much like a lemon tart that I wanna grab a spoon and dig in.</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> This stuff absolutely crushes every one of those.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell the coconut a whole lot</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> I like the coconut-lemon scent, though I don&#x27;t get much of the lemon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much of it.</li>
            <li> Love the minimal ingredients in this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Safe to use even on my 3 year old and the price is fantastic for such a big bottle with quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Cheap and just what you need daily..</li>
            <li> HIghly recommend this lotion!  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted to like it, but it just didn&#x27;t work on me no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li> it reminds me too much like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; ingredient list in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A must have for the whole fam.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is awkward at best.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well</li>
            <li> It is even light enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Very emollient.</li>
            <li> All in all - really like this lotion and plan to continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I recently went paraben free and that is why I purchased this lotion.  </li>
            <li> This really do smell like cookies, also i used this on my face</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight, almost watery to a degree.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for EVERYONE and EVERYBODY!</li>
            <li> The cheap store brand lotion seems to last longer in both moisturizing and fragrance.</li>
            <li> very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it for foot rubs as it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;gunk&#x27; up... and with the list of natural ingredients I am not afraid to use it on my kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a total stickler for 100% products, but this all natural lotion is magic.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I&#x27;ve ordered, but it is such a popular winner, I&#x27;ll stick with the Coconut &amp; Lemon.</li>
            <li> However, one of my favorite parts is that this lotion is natural and made with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a good value, at least where I bought it.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the Alba Botanica Cocoa Butter body lotion in a giant size bottle with fierce loyalty, but since becoming a student again, I could not withstand the $7 price hike.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me any negative reaction so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> and I must say that overall I&#x27;m mostly satisfied with this lotion, thus far.  </li>
            <li> It is great for skin that&#x27;s not super dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thinner because it spreads better and on hot days</li>
            <li> My husband and I try to massage each others feet and upper back every night, so it&#x27;s important for us to not use lotions full of harmful</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, the ingredients are pure and all natural, but the level of moisture it provides is not very much.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the cow udder oily junk or lanolin stuff I&#x27;ve been relying on for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have this BIG supply of lotion in my home, from which I can easily refill my smaller, decorative dispensers in other rooms.  </li>
            <li> I love how it isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li> Its not thick, but not thin lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love that it does not have a lot of chemicals in it, and it goes on smoothly and actually absorbs into your skin without lots of effort, unlike some of the other natural brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty masculine guy, and I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> The coconut/lemon has a fairly strong natural lemon scent with a more subtle coconut backnote.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite lotion ever (shhh- don&#x27;t tell Burt&#x27;s Bees).</li>
            <li> This is our new lotion!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new, and this looked promising.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is amazing- vaguely tropical but light-</li>
            <li> Now, I actually like it better than my facial creme!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is because I eat mainly plant based foods, so</li>
            <li> I used it mainly for my hands and body</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s mainly why I purchased this lotion AND their body wash (soap).  </li>
            <li> Works great for the whole family and is not that expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used it on stretch marks from being pregnant and it reduces their appearance and is not gross and oily.</li>
            <li> , my weird allergies want to personally thank the makers of this delightful product for your restraint in NOT jumping on the shea butter bandwagon.</li>
            <li> This would be great as a summer body lotion, but if you want something thick and substantial that will deeply moisturize, this may not be the one.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, my kids have ULTRA sensitive, rough skin.</li>
            <li> It feels and works like regular lotion, nothing super fancy.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to find this one.</li>
            <li> In the winter I use the lavender scent, since this one seems particularly summery.</li>
            <li> Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a one-time thing, I tried it after my next shower and had similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product not only satisfies my skins needs for moisture, but unlike many other lotions does NOT leave you feeling greasy or even more dry than</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I think my expectations were too high based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> Feels like a high quality lotion.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion for foot massages.</li>
            <li> but with a slight scent and same big bottle n great price</li>
            <li> The lotion texture is a little more...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little bit more viscous than what I&#x27;d like, but all of us can use it, and nobody minds the smell.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t live in a very dry climate, I think this will work fine.</li>
            <li> This is only good for people who want very little moisture.</li>
            <li> I have very sensistive skin and decided I wanted to try out some natural lotion.</li>
            <li> my two year old son thinks it smells like ice cream, haha.  </li>
            <li> I recently started trying to buy more natural products after hearing about potentially harmful chemicals in mainstream products.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> My skin is fairly normal, so anyone with skin problems would probably look for something to help their skin problems.  </li>
            <li> I applied more and my skin broke out after too heavy an application.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s normal and does its job.</li>
            <li> Good product, but the pump was broken and I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, not quite as thick as I prefer, but</li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any red skin on face due to shaving and especially on my neck and putting it after washing my face in the morning makes it feel good.</li>
            <li> &gt;  pure and natural - gentle enough for the whole family</li>
            <li> BUT, like the other reviewers mentioned this lotion is way too light.</li>
            <li> Its a little thin for your body however great for your face!</li>
            <li> And then again, I got my new lotion with a brand new pump and the bottle</li>
            <li> I live in Florida,</li>
            <li> I live in a winter area</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado</li>
            <li> I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I also live in the northeast -</li>
            <li> EO will be my new brand.</li>
            <li> and I shop for something new.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li> Would love it if they made a lotion with raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> It is safe for use everyday and made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I do have super dry skin and need something thicker so my hands</li>
            <li> and I would not recommend this for super dry or flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Would have given five stars if the top hadn&#x27;t broken so easily from regular use.</li>
            <li> I really dont have much issue with this especially considering out of the 27 ingredients listed its 23rd on the list.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was look for a large quantity lotion (32oz is hard to find) that was more natural than not and would moisturize well</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scented lotions</li>
            <li> I use it daily and like it very much</li>
            <li> /&gt;  gentle and fragrant with ingredients and essential oils that are pure, natural and organic&lt;br</li>
            <li> just completing my first big bottle and will reorder.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t plan on using it on my face regardless, no scented products allowed there!</li>
            <li> It has a fresh lemon-y coconut-y scent, which doesn&#x27;t linger too long</li>
            <li> I can smell the lotion on my skin hours later, but I don&#x27;t think anyone else has noticed it -- and that&#x27;s exactly what I want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaving me feeling just so soft!</li>
            <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t sting in the open cracks either like many other lotions do.</li>
            <li> a total first for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and you can use it everywhere - including your face!</li>
            <li> and they felt soft!</li>
            <li> So far I like it!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using it every night after my shower for a solid week (at least) and it has done a fine job keeping my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sickeningly sweet, which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free products that actually work extremely well.</li>
            <li> And, the lotion is pretty weak -- it&#x27;s not straight watery, but it&#x27;s not as creamy as good lotion should be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light that I even use it on my face even though I typically avoid greasy lotions for my face.</li>
            <li> and the smell is strong at first but subtle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Smooth texture, applied evenly, and has less chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> lotion is worth a go- for combination skin, dry skin, or oily skin like my partner.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dry hands and it absorbed well</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and sinks into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> skin deep gives this a 2, which overall is not bad</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much we dislike it, and we all love both lemons and coconut (my little boys use coconut and lemon scented everything!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and so far this hasn&#x27;t irritated it</li>
            <li> It causes no irritation, it&#x27;s all organic (i.e. not full of toxic chemicals to slather on your skin), it&#x27;s light and non-greasy and it smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> and I like that it is all natural and can be used on my kids sensitive skin as well!</li>
            <li> Its super hot and dry all summer, and winters are blizzard like but still dry.  </li>
            <li> pure essential oils nurture and soothe the skin</li>
            <li> It your skin isn&#x27;t dry or you live in a hot climate this may work.</li>
            <li> A little watery, but light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> That is almost expected as I have to do this with most anyway since my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to tell with this lotion that they have left out the bad chemicals, because it works good and smells great.</li>
            <li> More of a light lotion (we will see how it does for cold winter).</li>
            <li> Sinks in fast without to much work.</li>
            <li> It leaves me soft &amp; not greasy.</li>
            <li> No petroleum products as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s worked</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> Then I applied you and have been transformed from a look-at-me-and-I&#x27;ll-rash-up scale monster to a lush, glistening, lightly-scented lily.</li>
            <li> Our skin is the largest organ and requires natural products.</li>
            <li> therefore your claims of natural are unwarranted.</li>
            <li> We have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s contains no chemicals and is all natural, just wish it was so runny.</li>
            <li> absorbs into skin leaving soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use  this after a shower when my skin is damp, yet shortly thereafter, my skin isn&#x27;t very moist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for my chapped hands, so that&#x27;s why only four stars.</li>
            <li> Purchased this lotion based on the reviews and because it was natural.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it though because of the price, the quantity and the fact its natural.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> I even have used this on my young daughter and it worked well.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for the young men of the house.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve developed a number of areas that look like excema.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have children with sensitive skin as well as myself</li>
            <li> all natural smells.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two so far and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> The lotion keeps my skin soft without being greasy or clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Yes, there are a lot of perservatives in this, its a bit of an overkill, but theyre natural nontheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of 2 young boys-</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have used about every lotion on the market and love EO Everyday lotion, but wanted something in a larger size.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin naturally soft and smooth without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I should give this lotion 4 stars for its poor moisturizing, but the smell is so divine that it is deserving of 5 stars just for that.</li>
            <li> but I love my moisturizers really thick and luxurious</li>
            <li> I actually get more moisture using plain old coconut oil</li>
            <li> so I had a bit of a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thin, and absorbs quickly, but is not nearly as moisturizing as Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, which is my favorite lotion on the market today.</li>
            <li> and I believe it&#x27;s the best on the market right now because everything else I&#x27;ve tried has been terrible or isn&#x27;t comparable to the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this lotion because although it has a thin consistency, it coats and hydrates dry skin very well, even dry rough feet.  </li>
            <li> I have spent way more on other brands in order to go natural</li>
            <li> I have to rub it in pretty well to get it all to absorb into my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I might go ahead and add some additional fragrance in it myself to make it less sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> (My skin is normal, its not dry, I just like to keep it mosturized and use it</li>
            <li> I opted for this because it was all natural, and I&#x27;m trying to stay away from various chemicals, and GMO products, not to mention the price point was the main decision maker.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, especially after so many other comments about how great this stuff smells.</li>
            <li> I may try a different scent however as the lotion was, for the price, quite decent.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so I could probably use something a little stronger, but it works for everyday use, and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> The moisture doesn&#x27;t last a long time and washes right off</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very heavy.</li>
            <li> To get the free shipping I went ahead and sprang for the lavender lotion and matching body wash along with another small item.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a fabulous moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t use animals or harsh chemicals to produce, this is THE lotion!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t soak in too fast, but doesn&#x27;t take too long either.</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic due to the amount that you get in the bottle and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> In 48 hours, this lotion has completely smoothed over my infant daughter&#x27;s rough, sensitive skin, which no other lotion has accomplished.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, it is subtle yet it lasts a long time, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find lotion without all the harsh chemicals and alcohols that actually DRY your skin out, forcing you to use more and more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as other lotions, but works great for me and my family considering that we&#x27;re not absorbing harmful chemicals into our skin</li>
            <li> it did nothing to help our families dry skin which really is a bummer</li>
            <li> The last one lasted for several month and my skin really appreciates this lotion all around.</li>
            <li> Not the type of fragrance that&#x27;ll turn your colleagues off - just wonderfully fresh, lemony, slightly coconutty scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and fantastic, very natural smell not perfumy and overbearing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated when I first apply this lotion, but I often find that my skin is dry after a couple hours of the initial application.</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes your skin super soft without nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> The huge con is that its not moisturizing enough because after 5 minutes my newly shaven legs will become tight and dry feeling.</li>
            <li> but because it&#x27;s not very thick - it&#x27;ll last awhile in this size.</li>
            <li> It smells a little different, lemon and coconut, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin right now since winter has dragged on, and have been looking for a nice lotion that isn&#x27;t very expensive and without lots of chemicals.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t it, but I like the scent and will continue to use it for general purposes.</li>
            <li> Generally, I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Body</li>
            <li> /&gt;She wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell at first, although, I love it, but she&#x27;s started to get used to it.</li>
            <li> But my diabetic hands don&#x27;t think this is anywhere near moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrance, this isn&#x27;t likely for you.</li>
            <li> later purchased a bottle of EL in lavender/aloe; don&#x27;t like it nearly as well as</li>
            <li> My hands actually feel soft for hours after using it.</li>
            <li> My kids and I love this lotion but the packaging for shipping was poor.  </li>
            <li> I will say that I felt that the lotion was a bit thin and that is why I gave it four out of five, but I would surely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but my skin still felt a little dry after applying it.</li>
            <li> To me it isn&#x27;t a fake smell -  while the citrus and coconut smells are strong, they smell very much as if you squeezed citrus and cut open a coconut.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness that usually makes my skin uncomfortably itchy during winter.</li>
            <li> This lotion is light but heavy enough that it keeps my skin from drying out during the dry, winter months.</li>
            <li> I noticed it does turn my face red, or parts of my skin red for a few minutes after application, but it quickly wears away.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the scent, which can easily be remedied by purchasing a different one next time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great price for this bottle too--nice to not spend $9.99 on a little tiny bottle of lotion--this is a full 32 ounces, and seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tossed my other more expensive face creams, and just use this now for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> When I use this lotion my skin feels silky soft and I don&#x27;t get that dry, itchy feeling</li>
            <li> My face is moisturized without feeling greasy and my dry elbows and knees are simply soft now.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin, and it is January.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a pina colada -- it is quite pleasant though and not overwhelmingly coconutty at all - very subtle smell.  </li>
            <li> It has limited ingredients with natural extracts which I like.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells natural, although it does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels much improved after only a week and half.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s not super expensive and that&#x27;s had fairly good reviews on EWG.  </li>
            <li> Plus the bottle is pretty big for the price, so it seems like it should last for several months even if you use some everyday.</li>
            <li> The only way to make a coconut scented anything is with fragrance oil, and very few companies get coconut right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the value... I have very dry and fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There are some I&#x27;d rather do without, but I think the good out way the bad .</li>
            <li> But I do have to use something more emollient and thick on my hands and feet and elbows during our harsh Michigan winters.</li>
            <li> : Its not too watery and not too thick, its just right for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trouble with coconut is that you can&#x27;t get it in an essential oil form, and the natural coconut in coconut oil disappears from the oil when it&#x27;s overwhelmed by other scents.</li>
            <li> Lotion is ok...smells decent and the ingredients aren&#x27;t as bad as MOST of the stuff on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had that problem with other natural lotions with strong-smelling lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have a two year old son and an extremely picky husband.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it seems like I either get oily, or itchy, or not really moisturized... something!</li>
            <li> All the other natural aspects are a bonus.</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday for my son who is 5 yrs old and has problem skin due to allergies.  </li>
            <li> No doubt I will be tired of the fragrance before I finish the bottle, but so far I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> I only bought this lotion because it was relatively inexpensive for 32 oz, and I normally buy Booth&#x27;s 4 in 1 32 oz lotion, but Amazon no longer offers it as an add-on item for cheap :(</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion for an everyday use.</li>
            <li> I could probably put this on my arms and legs 3-4 times a day to feel thoroughly moisturized, so if I&#x27;m really feeling dry, I don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li> We were using a different, OTC brand name product, but then I developed a fragrance sensitivity and the brand didn&#x27;t have a product with no fragrance or at least just natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Product is long lasting and none oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time and when it&#x27;s done I&#x27;ll probably buy another.</li>
            <li> I normally would in the winter when my skin gets so dried out.  </li>
            <li> Pretty thick.</li>
            <li> but I can live with a little dryness in exchange for cleaner ingredients</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5, but my face is very sensitive and it stung a little, not a lot.  </li>
            <li> I was hooked on the ridiculously over priced Pure Fiji lotion but this has replaced it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, and I have had eczema my entire life.</li>
            <li> It does feel thin, but absorbs fast, &amp; my skin feels moisturized &amp; soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this lotion had a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed upon smelling it - serves me right to have bought a jug full of the stuff without trying it.</li>
            <li> Left my skin dry and ashy!</li>
            <li> Not only does it your skin drink up, I add other essential oils, coconut oil etc.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter especially likes it over other lotions.</li>
            <li> then after my next shower I applied it liberally all over (since I have very dry skin in the winter).</li>
            <li> I really like the lemon lotion and the value for the money is hard to beat as well.  </li>
            <li> This is not a natural product.</li>
            <li> I smell like a lemon cookie and feel soft without heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin with a tendency to break out if I use heavily perfumed creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few all (or mostly) natural lotions out there.</li>
            <li> The scent does not linger long</li>
            <li> First off, the pump arrived completely broken off, which I had to replace with another pump from a different lotion that I had laying around.</li>
            <li> I can see this being the only body lotion I use for a very long time!!</li>
            <li> I participate in bodybuilding, and various extreme sports and exercise regimens</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m also going to try that other one they sell in the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I will have to try the other scents, but I just can&#x27;t get enough of the coconut and lemon.</li>
            <li> blends well with other oils and isn&#x27;t suuuuuuuper creamy, which I totally dig.</li>
            <li> Next order, we will try the other scents too.</li>
            <li> But, after multiple uses I can no longer fathom using any other lotion but this</li>
            <li> I had to keep applying to my dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> so I have a tendency to have dry skin and this lotion helps a lot with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I purchased for children with dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you might need to put it on twice.</li>
            <li> I tried using this to help the the mildly dry skin on my feet and it would take about 3 or 4 applications before it would seem to have any affect.</li>
            <li> in dry weather</li>
            <li> Crazy cheap especially for your face.</li>
            <li> Even though my little girls want to use it all the time, looking at the bottle we&#x27;ve barely used any.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if coconut and lemon would go together, but I was pleasantly surprised by the pleasing smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick of a body lotion as I normally would prefer, ie: Avalon Organics, etc</li>
            <li> and my skin looked dry after applying in the summer!</li>
            <li> It works for everything -- dry lotion, sunburn, you name it, it works!  </li>
            <li> Consider making a larger size so I can purchase less plastic (but thank you for being recyclable) or consider a thinner plastic \\&quot;bag\\&quot; for refills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the Beauty without Cruelty that I had tried previously despite</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this lotion work for me in the warmer seasons, but not the winter season.</li>
            <li> so my skin gets very very dry.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is not for people with very dry hands.</li>
            <li> my daughters legs as we have very very dry legs</li>
            <li> We were only using coconut oil, but that sometimes is just a little too greasy after a morning shower.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lotions and they never help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of the thin consistency, but it soaked into my skin and left my legs feeling soft and smooth all day without any sort of residue.  </li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and I bought it months ago, and I&#x27;m not the only one here using it either.</li>
            <li> The smell will last a few minutes before it is no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> It quickly sinks into my skin.  </li>
            <li> For anyone else that tries this and loves it, check out Everyone Nourish hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work as expected.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed the scent does not last and the lotion is cheap.  </li>
            <li> I tried all organic, natural products but either my skin was dry by the next day or felt weird.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, hydrates well and leaves my skin feeling so soft which is no easy feat for someone living through this cold Midwest winter!</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> I mean pretty thick for a person living in desert California needing nourishment.</li>
            <li> I hope they make one that&#x27;s thick and for extra dry skin like eucerin calming cream</li>
            <li> I have not tried the other fragrances</li>
            <li> Unfortunately due to being in the mountains</li>
            <li> than other lotions i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple ingredients I wish they didnt have in their items but for the price and compared to other products out there this works for me.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t ruin my other packages.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hands from drying out for longer than other leading brands that my wife has tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, so I usually go to Walmart and get (Jergans, Nivea, Gold bond, or Lubriderm for men)</li>
            <li> I simply cannot get past it.</li>
            <li> Extremely healing.</li>
            <li> I feel like it moisturizes extremely well</li>
            <li> ( of course It was because of all of the alcohol and fragrances in it and other chemical. )  </li>
            <li> I feel absolutely no difference!</li>
            <li> This lotion is extremely lightweight.</li>
            <li> You can tell it has a natural plant base that creates a thin coating that absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I think the broken pump was back luck and me not liking the smell is personal.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my skin is hydrated the whole next day even in this cold weather.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe that he and I can use the same lotion, on bodies and face.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using it daily for the past few weeks, so if it was going to bother my skin</li>
            <li> Hydrating and non irritating on sensitive skin, will keep getting it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Heaven shine down upon you, makers of Coconut plus Lemon</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel too watered down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a miracle lotion but with everyday use I feel less dry than usual.</li>
            <li> Once again, I am pump less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One odd thing -</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting in on my face, but my face is actually less red and irritated after using the lotion for several days.  </li>
            <li> I probably lost half an ounce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and half.</li>
            <li> I also tend to get bored of 1 particular brand after the bottle is up</li>
            <li> The scent was nothing like I expected, very dull and flat</li>
            <li> It was a mess.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use hair products, and have been using this lotion for my thick curly dry hair</li>
            <li> Was not familiar with the brand, but gave it a try based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> It has little to no detectable coconut smell and while the smell is pleasing, it isn&#x27;t as expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I add a little baby oil and lotion to this to give me the consistency I desire.</li>
            <li> so I was a little concerned, but this lotion does not bother me.</li>
            <li> A little thinner consistency than I prefer, however it does the job.  </li>
            <li> a little unusual(smells just like coconut/lemon cake)</li>
            <li> I have the type of dry skin that needs some serious slathering, and this does the job.</li>
            <li> so I applied it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday after showers and periodically throughout the day on my hands.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it as my everyday body lotion because it&#x27;s a lighter skin coating lotion.</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; would be that the formula is a bit thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy to return, so I&#x27;m putting it in the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell, it wears off after a few hours anyway.</li>
            <li> but it is an everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> No greasiness left behind.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> He uses EO lotion everyday.</li>
            <li> will update after a few days</li>
            <li> Dimethicone is very bad for your skin and many people have adverse reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Its not strong at all.</li>
            <li> This lotion did irritate my skin very slightly after I put it on after showering.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t buy two bars of disgusting Irish Spring or Dove  or any of the garbage soaps full of poison for that price.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; but is soon rubbed in and doesn&#x27;t leave feet feeling all greasy and nasty, but very smooth and satiny.</li>
            <li> He scratches his legs raw</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t go there first, as I usually do), though none are terribly bad.  </li>
            <li> Not a super thick or emollient lotion.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, and not too thin and instantly relieving.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming with coconut or lemon.</li>
            <li> Even though it leaves a slick coating for awhile, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel as hydrated as some lotions do.  </li>
            <li> I buy a ton of stuff on amazon and have gotten a bit lazy when it comes to reviews</li>
            <li> I usually like vanillas and Christmas scents etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter for the past week who has had issues with eczema for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually acne prone.</li>
            <li> It also collects in small chunks on your skin.</li>
            <li> Even my husband loves it, and he usually insists on unscented stuff.</li>
            <li> During an exceptionally cold and dry winter I had to apply twice per day on very dry areas.  </li>
            <li> It is a thinner LOTION, not cream, so you feel the need to use a little extra, but nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> While her bad spots are still fairly rough, it&#x27;s only been a week</li>
            <li> It was definitely too thin to use as a hand lotion, and too thin to use as a moisturizer in the winter.</li>
            <li> Very odd!</li>
            <li> Although there might be 1 or 2 ingredients on here that are questionable, I find that aside from straight coconut oil (which I also use all the time) there are very few OTC lotions that don&#x27;t have at least 1 ingredient that is questionable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a LOT of lotion over my lifetime, especially after I moved to Minnesota where we have very cold and very dry winters.</li>
            <li> I have ordering a lot things from amazon lately.  </li>
            <li> This size lasts us at least 3 months as well.</li>
            <li> I need to bear with it for at least 12 months.</li>
            <li> At least they had plastic wrap around the bottle</li>
            <li> lately-</li>
            <li> Needs to be reapplied at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is thick but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Smells yummy, it&#x27;s thick and creamy, made with organic ingredients, and you get a ton for the price.</li>
            <li> Not too thick.</li>
            <li> It is very thin and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I mean, aren&#x27;t we supposed to put the lime in the coconut?  </li>
            <li> It has been keeping my skin hydrated this dry, cold winter.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not full of scary things that may or may not be toxic.</li>
            <li> The smell is faint though and almost indetectible after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Dries out your skin not a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to thick or too thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong fake smell at all.  </li>
            <li> But it drys very slowly.</li>
            <li> I mean A LOT!  </li>
            <li> I really like Everyone Lotion, but the coconut lemon has the worst sent.</li>
            <li> thin, almost no scent - dollar store quality - put it in guest bath</li>
            <li> However, I received one with a broken pump</li>
            <li> However, the consistency is a bit to thin for me.</li>
            <li> I rated it a 4 instead of 5 because it is just slightly thin.</li>
            <li> i wanted to like this, but the lotion is rather thin, and my skin became itchy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m already tired of the scent so will have to use this over time.</li>
            <li> The packaging was damaged when I received it (part of the pump was broken)</li>
            <li> I hope well because i am tired of paying 8 a tube for eucerin calming cream .</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle, even for man to use without smelling like his lady all day.  </li>
            <li> Well unfortunately the detector went off and I was promptly whisked away.</li>
            <li> For this price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is unfortunately one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that &#x27;fake&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li> My skin is itchy and cracked and horrible, especially on my hands.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thin.</li>
            <li> I like lotions that are thicker - this one was disappointing because it&#x27;s on the thinner - feels cheaper - side.  </li>
            <li> so yes, it gets a bit cold here.</li>
            <li> it is SO unpleasant.</li>
            <li> As soon as it hits my skin the scent blends and its very faint.</li>
            <li> anyone is out there with any reservations, has had D-E-C-A-D-E-S of bad luck with body lotion, don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy......that might also be the bad thing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make it a bad lotion by itself</li>
            <li> I hate the fact that I was mislead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li> and I hate perfume and scents.  </li>
            <li> much to hate on here.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, though, that it was terrible for household members with eczema.</li>
            <li> I had tried another brand that I hated, as it took forever to rub in (it was like rubbing soap into your skin).  </li>
            <li> I find it smells like insect repellent - citronella.</li>
            <li> The pump is terrible though and after trying for an hour I have given up trying to get it to work</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff! Nice smell.</li>
            <li> Pros: Absorbs quickly, is light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and can be used anywhere on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The lemon smell reminds me a bit of lemon curd and the coconut isn&#x27;t prominent. I was hoping that the scent would be less strong but it&#x27;s fair to say that the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger for too long. It&#x27;s all about preference.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Smells great and moisturized well!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion &amp; use the Lavender scented lotion at night! Not organic but I still love it!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotion. This stuff smells great, is easy to apply. and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I really like Everyone Lotion, but the coconut lemon has the worst sent. Only 1 person on our team likes it.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  it smells delightful, has just the right texture and consistency, and i use it almost every day (as body lotion only).</li>
            <li> I love the smell. It leaves me soft &amp; not greasy. It&#x27;s gentle &amp; can put it on after shaving.</li>
            <li> I am back to buy another bottle.  The last one lasted for several month and my skin really appreciates this lotion all around. It firms my skin, smells good when you apply, and it moisturizes so much better than any lotion I tried in the past. I am not into chemical and GMO laden products so I am always looking for natural and cruelty free lotions.  This is the perfect match for me.  When I ran out of my facial organic creme last time after forgetting to reorder, I used the everyone lotion on my face to moisturize after showering, and it felt good on my skin so I applied it for a few days.  Now, I actually like it better than my facial creme! It is firming, which was right away noticeable.  And it seems to reduce puffiness around my eyes, and overall, it makes the tone of my face more smooth.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because I eat mainly plant based foods, so I don&#x27;t suffer much from outbreaks to begin with, but this lotion covers all my skin needs and it is now a keeper.  I have not tried the other fragrances but this one  is very pleasant to me.</li>
            <li> This is good lotion.  For natural lotion, it it a great deal and smells great!  I would buy it again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have ordering a lot things from amazon lately.  The products have been great.  This lotion is wonderful ! Its not thick, but not thin lotion.  Its perfect.  The smell is great, you do smell the lemon and coconut my favorite scent.  I will now order the body wash ! If you love those scents go for it !</li>
            <li> This is a light, non greasy, easily absorbed lotion. Great, clean fragrance from natural botanical oils, minus the chemicals. Whatever we put on our bodies is absorbed into the bloodstream, so it is important to avoid the many chemicals that are standard in most lotions. This product seems of good quality, and is a good value. The fragrance is light, fades quickly; it&#x27;s very lemony with coconut undertones. It feels nice on the face and anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li> So, I love this lotion. I have very sensistive skin and decided I wanted to try out some natural lotion. I was at first concerned about the scent but once I recieved it, it wasn&#x27;t a concern. Great lotion, its non-greasy and dries fast and the scent of the lotions fades aways very quickly! I love it. I plan purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> great smell I love coconut very healthy for you skin  good combination lemon coconut soon I will buy more I really highly recomended</li>
            <li> great lotion.  nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> I really like how it goes on, smells great.  No petroleum products as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I thought this lotion was very good.  I recently started trying to buy more natural products after hearing about potentially harmful chemicals in mainstream products.  I was impressed with this lotion because although it has a thin consistency, it coats and hydrates dry skin very well, even dry rough feet.  Plus the bottle is pretty big for the price, so it seems like it should last for several months even if you use some everyday.</li>
            <li> This lotion is light but heavy enough that it keeps my skin from drying out during the dry, winter months. I use it everyday after showers and periodically throughout the day on my hands. So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness that usually makes my skin uncomfortably itchy during winter. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s worked so well given how light it is. I&#x27;m also male, and while it smells sweet and fruity when I apply, the smell fades quickly and I don&#x27;t worry about others thinking I&#x27;m wearing women&#x27;s perfume. I&#x27;ve had that problem with other natural lotions with strong-smelling lavender fragrance. I&#x27;ll admit that I actually like the tropical scent and I appreciate it being discrete enough so as not to be detectable by those around me. It&#x27;s also paraben-free and an awesome price for this big of a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Paraben-free&lt;br /&gt;- Scent: Guys, you can wear this in public. Nobody will know!&lt;br /&gt;- Light, yet moisturizing enough for even the drier seasons&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, even on my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s \\&quot;more natural\\&quot;, but not an organic lotion. I still feel good about using it over chemical and preservative-laden lotions from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Left my skin dry and ashy!</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not as moisturizing as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is intoxicating.!</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  The scent is very mild and natural.  It&#x27;s not a strong fake smell at all.  I would recommend this to those who are sensitive to smells as well as anyone who wants a great lotion without feeling like they have grease on them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately due to being in the mountains my first shipment exploded all over the protective bags.  But Amazon replaced with no issues and even had UPS pick up the box of exploded lotion/body soap.  Very impressed.  The second shipment had zero issues with altitude.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I have tried SO many different lotions...I mean A LOT!  This is my favorite by far.  I love the scent and it works so well.  Plus it is affordable.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great but not for me. It is very thin and I have very dry skin. I had to keep applying to my dry, flaky skin. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have sensitive skin. It leaves me silky soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t beak out or itch at all. It is great from head to toe. Will absolutely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> The coconut+lemon is a nice light moisturizer, with an amazing scent. I love that it&#x27;s so gentle I can use it on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and the light coconut and lemon smell. It&#x27;s so light that I even use it on my face even though I typically avoid greasy lotions for my face.</li>
            <li> at first I found the fragrance off-putting, but I&#x27;ve grown used to it.  It&#x27;s nice to have this BIG supply of lotion in my home, from which I can easily refill my smaller, decorative dispensers in other rooms.  The consistency of the lotion is perfect -- thin enough to pour easily into other dispensers but thick enough to feel perfect on my skin.</li>
            <li> This smelled really nice, but wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great natural lotion, and the scent is great. Love the thing that it is organic and sulfates free.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion and it smells good (like lemon and coconut) will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Prominent lemon scent. Smells like the dessert lemon bars. EO lotion is my favorite and I am picky picky. It is very moisturizing without any greasiness and I often use it as a facial moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> The lotion texture is a little more...watery? oily? than other lotions i&#x27;ve used.  which is not a deal-breaker, but the smell - which is something like a mix between suntan lotion and bathroom cleaner... that is really kind of a turn off.  ew.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a great smell to it, leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t have all the yucky stuff you don&#x27;t want in a lotion.</li>
            <li> smells great  , nice large size, feels nice not greasy.</li>
            <li> Works well and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it has a nice smell and a good value.</li>
            <li> My daughter got us started on this Lotion, it will always be a fixture in our house, it smells like coconut cream pie ,very mild &amp; great feeling to the skin. We Love it!</li>
            <li> love this lotion...doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, no over powering scent.  just completing my first big bottle and will reorder.</li>
            <li> Its a little thin for your body however great for your face! The best ingredients used for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> My two biggest reservations about using skin lotion is any greasy residue and the scent.  Both are perfect for this product...it absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling smooth and moisturized and the scent is excellent; lemon/coconut that smells so natural it seems almost edible!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  I already use the Everyone Soap for my daughter and love it, so I thought I&#x27;d give their lotion a try for myself when I was looking for another organic lotion.  I had tried another brand that I hated, as it took forever to rub in (it was like rubbing soap into your skin).  Out of all the Everyone Lotion&#x27;s scents this one was my favorite.  I&#x27;m pregnant and my smell is very heightened so I wanted something with a light scent. This one fit the bill and smells so yummy!  $10 for a huge bottle of organic lotion is such a great price too!  Can&#x27;t wait to try the matching scented soap for myself!</li>
            <li> I love the coconut and le mon lotion. It is moisturising as well as refreshing.</li>
            <li> I used it mainly for my hands and body but I started it using it on face after I shave my beard and noticed the big difference. I didn&#x27;t have any red skin on face due to shaving and especially on my neck and putting it after washing my face in the morning makes it feel good. I do recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Love the texture, the scent and the way my skin feels after using it, but the fact that it is organic is the cherry on top!</li>
            <li> I had no idea what I was getting when I bought this. It was a nice surprise. Both my husband I can use it and like it. I don&#x27;t use it on my face but use it everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Really a wonderful product. The sent is refreshing and clean. My daughter requested some of these products for Christmas. Added to ship and save:)</li>
            <li> We love this lotion!  It&#x27;s not to thick or too thin and the smell is strong at first but subtle on the skin.  We had the citrus one before and I think I liked it better, but the rest of my family likes the coconut.  It&#x27;s so nice to find a natural product that is affordable!  This size lasts us at least 3 months as well.</li>
            <li> The idea of a lotion that everyone in my family could use seemed too good to be true.  However, this lotion is great.  I have a two year old son and an extremely picky husband.  This lotion does not seem &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34;.  It seems wonderful!  The price is great too.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, however, when it arrived, it was open with lotion all over the inside of the plastic bag containing the lotion bottle.  Not a big deal, not going to return it, but the packaging crew might want to ensure that the lotion topper is in the locked position.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! I have been using this lotion for over a year and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. It is light and non-greasy and has a delectable (but not overpowering) smell.</li>
            <li> Smell like a sugar cookie without burning from a chemical reaction? Yes. Yes, I will. Heaven shine down upon you, makers of Coconut plus Lemon Everyone lotion!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, vegetarian, GMO free, gluten free, cruelty free? Riiiiight. Surely you will cause welts like everything else. I looked at you sidelong. I raised my eyebrow at you. I glared at you when you arrived. Then I applied you and have been transformed from a look-at-me-and-I&#x27;ll-rash-up scale monster to a lush, glistening, lightly-scented lily. Do you make this in a 32 GALLON size? Because you ought to. Decades I&#x27;ve searched for a lotion like this. Light enough for repeat, daily use (not that you need to apply, and apply, and apply; I just LOVE the light scent) and rich enough for nighttime slathering. I have used it on the face, and it&#x27;s great, but I do ADD another product since I have all the physical moisture of an actual rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first skincare product that&#x27;s given me the delight of feeling like a normal girl. And you&#x27;re good! You&#x27;re honest-to-goodness good! You&#x27;re not full of scary things that may or may not be toxic. You&#x27;re like the best boyfriend ever. Except you&#x27;re an organic lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One simple request? Consider making a larger size so I can purchase less plastic (but thank you for being recyclable) or consider a thinner plastic \\&quot;bag\\&quot; for refills. And that&#x27;s just me nitpicking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is out there with any reservations, has had D-E-C-A-D-E-S of bad luck with body lotion, don&#x27;t hesitate. Try it. Or may I return to my former scale-monster state.</li>
            <li> awesome lotion! It smells a little different, lemon and coconut, but it&#x27;s not bad. This lotion absorbs really fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, I love that it&#x27;s natural abd that you can use it for your while body! Super awesome price too!</li>
            <li> My son has KP and this product is good for his skin. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like that they use polysorbate, as it is linked to cancer.  But I do like they are mostly pure ingredients.</li>
            <li> thin, almost no scent - dollar store quality - put it in guest bath</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for a few months.  However, I received one with a broken pump so I had to recycle another pump from another product to use my lotion.  And then again, I got my new lotion with a brand new pump and the bottle fell on the floor from a short distance breaking the pump.  Once again, I am pump less.</li>
            <li> love it, very light, non greasy and lemon smell..</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion in the world. The whole family likes it. Fragrance is pleasant without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I had been using Jergens lotion products for a long time and was very satisfied with those products, until Jergens got me detained and searched by homeland security. I was walking through the bomb detector in the airport and was very sure that I would pass through with no issue. Well unfortunately the detector went off and I was promptly whisked away. It turns out that the Jergens lotion ingredients were the culprit. I figured if my lotion ingredients set off bomb detectors, then I probably should not be using it on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus began my search for an organic and paraben free lotion. I saw this product and decided to give it a go. I must state that I adore the smell of this lotion. However, the consistency is a bit to thin for me. My skin feels hydrated when I first apply this lotion, but I often find that my skin is dry after a couple hours of the initial application. Thankfully there is a quick fix for this issue. To make the lotion last longer I simply mix it with a bit of 100% coconut oil. The coconut oil enhances the lotion and makes my skin stay hydrated all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is pretty decent. It has a great smell but needs a little help to become a suitable moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but the smell was a little more sweet than i thought! Reminds me of a pie! Great for those of you who love sweets!</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, it&#x27;s thick and creamy, made with organic ingredients, and you get a ton for the price. This is my second bottle of this product and it took 9 months for me to finish it. I use it on my toddler as well and it&#x27;s super gentle.</li>
            <li> great stuff!  Non-greasy and makes your skin feel smooth after the shower. Love the natural ingredients.  That&#x27;s mainly why I purchased this lotion AND their body wash (soap).  Great scent too....very light. Have bought it before, and will again and again.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite lotions.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural lotions and this one is by far my favorite!! The scent is fantastic and light.  It also really moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. I love that it does not have a lot of chemicals in it, and it goes on smoothly and actually absorbs into your skin without lots of effort, unlike some of the other natural brands I have tried. The smell is light and great!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It smells so good.</li>
            <li> A little watery, but light and non-greasy. Great smell.</li>
            <li> I have this lotion on subscription order. It is rated 2 on EWG&#x27;s website and smells good. Works great for the whole family and is not that expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this when Amazon offered a 20% off coupon.  To get the free shipping I went ahead and sprang for the lavender lotion and matching body wash along with another small item.  This lotion is pretty close to perfect.  It moisturizes without being greasy, and smells great.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like the scent.  I mean, aren&#x27;t we supposed to put the lime in the coconut?  It is enjoyable though and you will smell like a pie.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars for the amount you receive for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not over empowering and you can really distinguish the two scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Coconut and Lemon combination smells really fresh and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion ever. It smells devine, doesn&#x27;t go on greasy, quickly absorbs, and it is the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, the ingredients are pure and all natural, but the level of moisture it provides is not very much. I added some apricot and jojoba oil to it and that helps. If it was more moisturizing. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, although I don&#x27;t use it on my face. I can literally slather it all over, no skin irritations. Seems like it will last forever. I rated it a 4 instead of 5 because it is just slightly thin. I&#x27;m sure people with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin will find this perfect, nice scent, as well</li>
            <li> I started with the lavender everyone lotion which I ADORE, but have now switched over to the coconut lemon lotion. I&#x27;m picky about coconut lotions, if it isn&#x27;t done right it is SO unpleasant. THIS lotion has a perfect balance of coconut and lemon, where it doesn&#x27;t feel overwhelming. It is understated and delicious lol! I live in Florida, so finding a perfect lightweight lotion means a lot to me. This is not sticky feeling and its great while I work out in the gym as it does not sting my eyes. I like to have a face moisturizer all the time - it just feels better. Anyway I&#x27;ve been using this daily head to toe after showers. It is an excellent value for the amount of lotion you get! - Coconut and Lemon is pretty much smelling like summertime in a bottle! I love it. Check it out.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve used to date! The smell is fresh, and keeps my body moisturized all day. Plenty of bang for your buck too.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on so smooth and smells delicious!  This was the first time I&#x27;ve tried it and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Not overwhelming with coconut or lemon. My husband likes it too! Not too runny and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It smells too good. But my diabetic hands don&#x27;t think this is anywhere near moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> best cream ever last a long time</li>
            <li> This is not a natural product.Please remove the dimethicone and I will be a lifetime user as I love the scent and most other ingredients. Dimethicone is very bad for your skin and many people have adverse reaction to it. Our skin is the largest organ and requires natural products. Dimethicone is NOT Natural-just the opposite therefore your claims of natural are unwarranted. It is a silicone based man made polymer-PLASTIC!. Also the benzol alcohol is likely man made and a skin irritant over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not hate the product. I think it would be great if they removed the un natural ingredients. I hate the fact that I was mislead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the truth about Dimethicone here:&lt;br /&gt;http://cincovidas.com/dimethicone-the-truth-behind-this-common-cosmetics-ingredient/</li>
            <li> Best lotion that I ever tried. Instantly heals irritated skin. Wish they would sell this in a local store. Product is long lasting and none oily feeling. No chemicals.  5 star product.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and a pleasant smell. A great summer body lotion. I personally need something more for my body in the winter, but I might keep using this on my hands and face year around.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because of the unit price. It&#x27;s hard to find good vegan body lotion for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much cover myself in this lotion every day or two. It absorbs quickly but really works. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face (I use a lotion with SPF for that), but it makes my hands, elbows and legs very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One odd thing - my husband says the Citrus scent makes me smell like Trix Cereal. He says that&#x27;s fine, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me, but next time I&#x27;ll be trying the Coconut.</li>
            <li> Smells like lemon cookies! It has a great consistency; is thinner then a body butter but not watered down at all. This is the first product I have tried of theirs and I will be buying more products. My husband loves it too!</li>
            <li> I love the EO products. It looks like they&#x27;ve given their products a bit of a modern facelift. I was excited to try this one, but it&#x27;s just not as emollient as I was hoping for. It isn&#x27;t as soft and smooth as I was hoping...I have to rub it in pretty well to get it all to absorb into my dry skin. I purchased this large bottle because I use our lotions for massaging feet and body and need something really smooth and emollient. This product isn&#x27;t it, but I like the scent and will continue to use it for general purposes.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what i ordered. I love this product everyone should try it. My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean and crisp. Absorbs well and does not leave a greasy feeling. I did not put it on my face but I&#x27;m sure it would be ok.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion, and mostly use it for my hands. I keep it in my 2nd bathroom by the kitchen. It&#x27;s nice as a basic hand lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as my everyday body lotion because it&#x27;s a lighter skin coating lotion.</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer and very light, just I am not very fond of strong, coconut and lime smell. I will order again though, because this lotion keeps me moisturized all day. Great for dry toddler skin too, they love the smell :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion for a while. I have used it on stretch marks from being pregnant and it reduces their appearance and is not gross and oily. It also smells great unlike most products I have found.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice.  Fresh lively smell.  Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It smells just like lemon coconut.  It can be used on the face too, which as a mother in her 40&#x27;s, it has good moisture for my skin.  I don&#x27;t use it every day on my face, but when I am washing my face in my kids bathroom, I do use it.&lt;br /&gt;I like that is uses only essential oils, is non GMO, and no animal testing.  For those of you with Gluten allergies, this is Gluten free.  A good price for this large bottle, I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> A lil greasy but not bad.</li>
            <li> i wanted to like this, but the lotion is rather thin, and my skin became itchy. even at this price, it&#x27;s no bargain.</li>
            <li> No animal testing. Feels great</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, goes on lightly and absorbs quickly. I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! Couldn&#x27;t be happier! I bought the lemon/coconut lotion and body wash as well as the nourish shampoo and conditioner... this brand is exactly what I was looking for at a great price! Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Products received as scheduled &amp; as described. My practice members LOVE this stuff. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The only downside to the coconut lemon lotion is that one can&#x27;t eat it by the spoonful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my weird allergies want to personally thank the makers of this delightful product for your restraint in NOT jumping on the shea butter bandwagon.</li>
            <li> I was really amazed at what  a great product this is, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on light, spells great, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> We have really sensitive skin. We were using a different, OTC brand name product, but then I developed a fragrance sensitivity and the brand didn&#x27;t have a product with no fragrance or at least just natural fragrance.  This lotion was the answer. It&#x27;s just a little bit more viscous than what I&#x27;d like, but all of us can use it, and nobody minds the smell. It&#x27;s not too girly for the guys and not too manly for the gals. We have been really happy to have the much more natural product that works even better than what we had before.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion.  I use it on me, my kids and give it as gifts.  It smells delightful too</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion in my opinion.  I LOVE the smell &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel.  I&#x27;m a fan for life!  My whole family uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> The Everyone Lotion is great.  Super moisturizing, relatively fast drying and absorbing, and you get a lot of product for your money&#x27;s worth (especially for a paraben free, cruelty free lotion).  My only complaint is the scent, which can easily be remedied by purchasing a different one next time.  I have the coconut + lemon scented lotion, and the coconut is a bit much for my taste.  However, after an hour or so, the smell tends to fade.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion smells! It&#x27;s contains no chemicals and is all natural, just wish it was so runny. A little bit thicker consistency would be good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. As others have mentioned, it&#x27;s not a thick lotion but is still effective. I kind of like that it&#x27;s a little thinner because it spreads better and on hot days I don&#x27;t want to be all oiled up. It&#x27;s great that it can be used on face and body and is such a great deal. It smells marvelous, and I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts or dryness or blocked pores or greasy feeling as I have with other lotions. Love it.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice and it&#x27;s a huge bottle. Not very moisturizing in my opinion. Used it for about a week and realized that my legs were flaky…ewwww! I will save it for the summer but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild and goes away fairly quickly which is good.  It takes two or three minutes to stop being sticky and then my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you should!  Amazingly smooth and natural.  Once you have applied it, your skin feels hydrated AND clean--not greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good lotion, but it makes me smell like a glazed donut, and what&#x27;s not to love about that? Mmmm...</li>
            <li> Great lotion for everyday use. Strong lemon scent is refreshing and isnt overpowering. Not a super thick or emollient lotion.</li>
            <li> Good for the price but a little too watery for the high Sierra mountains. I mix it with coconut oil and then it&#x27;s up to par.</li>
            <li> This is my top favorite lotion! It smells wonderful and feels great!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this lotion work for me in the warmer seasons, but not the winter season. I like that it has a low Skin Deep rating.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t keep the moisture in for the whole day.  If you don&#x27;t live in a very dry climate, I think this will work fine.</li>
            <li> I think that at about $10 a bottle, this is a very good value. I personally like the scent of the coconut plus lemon. It is very light and fresh, but not  girly. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; would be that the formula is a bit thin. I personally would like it if the lotion were a bit thicker and lasted a bit longer. Otherwise, I am very satisfied product and it makes for an excellent lotion to keep at your desk to use periodically throughout the day since it absorbs quickly.  I prefer something a bit more dense to apply immediately after a shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Lemon and coconut and I love it. Very tropical and fresh. It&#x27;s an unusual fragrance, but I quite like it. The lotion is light and not greasy. Yet, it works for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is really good lotion. It smells nice and is not greasy at all. I have been able to put it everywhere and not break out at all.</li>
            <li> Phew, this has a really strong (and somewhat chemical-y) scent to it. No idea how well it moisturizes because I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it on my skin. Disappointed, especially after so many other comments about how great this stuff smells. I wound up tossing it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching natural body care products that are paraben and chemical free. This lotion is amazing! It smells fantastic and moisturizes beautifully! I love every single EO product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free products that actually work extremely well. Thanks EO Products!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG! I love this lotion! Never used it before but I have been searching for a really great lotion that has no harsh chemicals, animal products or one that is not tested on animals. Although I can find several lotions with those criteria, none have been as pleasant odored or creamy soft such as this. If you&#x27;re looking for a fabulous moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t use animals or harsh chemicals to produce, this is THE lotion!</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and it leaves my skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and works great for kids and adults. The smell is pretty good too!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me. The smell was;t enough of a reason to keep it</li>
            <li> Great smell that&#x27;s not too overpowering. The consistency is substantial not too watery. Overall I&#x27;m really enjoying this product and it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, absorbency and size of the bottle.  I also appreciate the low score on the Environmental Working Group gave it.  It smells fresh, not chemically.</li>
            <li> Every lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried has always been geared toward a specific segment of society... purchase a lotion that&#x27;s not suited for your gender, scent preference, race, skin tone, age, movie taste, career etc etc and it never fails, adverse side effects abound!  The sleepless nights, bleeding heels that leak through shoe soles, you name it... if you&#x27;re a person that has specific traits (and many of us do) and you&#x27;ve ever applied the wrong lotion?  Well, then you know all too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL NOW!  This lotion is literally for everyone and everybody... finally, someone gets it!  EVERYONE gets it.  Now I just need to find out if Everyone makes toothpaste, deodorant, perfume, cologne and so on.</li>
            <li> I thought I would love the coconut lemon smell because I love both coconut and lemon, but together in this particular lotion I feel like a pina colada! And it&#x27;s fine at first but I&#x27;m already tired of the scent so will have to use this over time. I might go ahead and add some additional fragrance in it myself to make it less sweet smelling. The lotion itself is good and goes on smoothly but I wish I would have gotten a more neutral scent or unscented.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! Its not greasy although there are essential oils in it.  I like that you can use it everywhere on the body!</li>
            <li> The smell is light yet very nice. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product, but the pump was broken and I don&#x27;t like the smell. I find it smells like insect repellent - citronella. I think the broken pump was back luck and me not liking the smell is personal. Overall looks like great quality product and large quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  I was a little skeptical of the thin consistency, but it soaked into my skin and left my legs feeling soft and smooth all day without any sort of residue.  The scent smells natural, although it does not last very long.  This is such a great value!</li>
            <li> Favorite lotion ever! Absorbs well, better price here than wholefoods</li>
            <li> Smells good. I&#x27;m a guy. The scent goes away after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Skin really glows with my monthly purchase of this item.It is a necessity from now on.</li>
            <li> this lotion is the best.softens the skin and smells great .can not beat the price.will order more in the future for sure.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on easily and has a great smell. You can smell lemons and coconut all over the house. It has very good quality ingredients like Coconut, Calendula and lemon. This bottle will last a long time and when it&#x27;s done I&#x27;ll probably buy another.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the fact it&#x27;s gluten-free, and it smells amazing! It&#x27;s also cheaper than what I pay for comparable products at the local shops.</li>
            <li> Lotion is ok...smells decent and the ingredients aren&#x27;t as bad as MOST of the stuff on the market. The pump is terrible though and after trying for an hour I have given up trying to get it to work so I will have to just put it into another bottle: less than ideal. You get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
            <li> The lightest lotion I have ever used. Even in the hot summer, this was way too light for my skin and my skin looked dry after applying in the summer! Gave away to my sister. It your skin isn&#x27;t dry or you live in a hot climate this may work. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Great smell and a nice clean finish.</li>
            <li> I smell like a lemon cookie and feel soft without heavy residue. I don&#x27;t use hair products, and have been using this lotion for my thick curly dry hair and it&#x27;s also great. I know a lot of folks wouldn&#x27;t recommend body lotion for hair, but mine loves it so..eh! Great for Spring! :)</li>
            <li> Smells nice and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells delicious!! If you love lemons then your going to love this lotion.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and sinks into your skin quickly.  Very light weight lotion.  You get your money&#x27;s worth with this huge bottle of lotion.  I live in a winter area so my skin gets very very dry.  When I use this lotion my skin feels silky soft and I don&#x27;t get that dry, itchy feeling I normally would in the winter when my skin gets so dried out.  I highly recommend this lotion.  The smell is light, but very calming.  If you love lemon bread with that light smell of lemon then your going to adore this lotion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as I fell in love with the scent when I used it at a friend&#x27;s house. The smell is wonderful - a great light smell of lemon, mixed with a hint of coconut. The ingredients were OK too - not the most natural of lotions out there, but I gave it a pass. The value is great too - you get A LOT of lotion for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking off one star as the thickness of the lotion was not to my liking. It was thinner than I actually needed. It was definitely too thin to use as a hand lotion, and too thin to use as a moisturizer in the winter. This would be great as a summer body lotion, but if you want something thick and substantial that will deeply moisturize, this may not be the one.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how well this moisturizes. Not greasy at all and there are no harmful ingredients in this which is why I bought it. Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great, not too overwhelming and the texture is nice too. BUT, like the other reviewers mentioned this lotion is way too light. Many times I will put this on after shaving my legs and its nice that it absorbs quickly. The huge con is that its not moisturizing enough because after 5 minutes my newly shaven legs will become tight and dry feeling. I hope this company improves on its formula by removing the cheap filler Glyceryl Stearate (palm oil). Palm oil, even the so called RSPO is not ECO or animal friendly. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful and I hate perfume and scents.  It smells like a yummy coconut lemon pie!&lt;br /&gt;Couple ingredients I wish they didnt have in their items but for the price and compared to other products out there this works for me.</li>
            <li> Great smelling lotion and a lot for the money.  I would definitely purchase it again.  My skin is fairly normal, so anyone with skin problems would probably look for something to help their skin problems.  But, if you just need some body lotion and you happen to like Coconut and Lemon, I would recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells SO GOOD!!&lt;br /&gt;It also feels great on my skin. I do not use it on my face because I have my own moisturizer I use, but I use this lotion on my hands and body and it really leaves my skin feeling moist. I live in Colorado so I have a tendency to have dry skin and this lotion helps a lot with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great deal--It really is a HUGE bottle and it is a great price for what you are getting! I also love how the ingredients are more natural than other lotions I normally buy.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion a lot, the smell is lovely and it feels great, absorbs quickly. Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is lightweight yet seems to moisturize well. I think it will be great in the summer months when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it is in the winter. My son has also used it on his eczema with no problem or irritation. The scent it light and pleasant as well. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite lotion ever (shhh- don&#x27;t tell Burt&#x27;s Bees). Not too thick, and not too thin and instantly relieving. I use this on my kids, as well. My son wants to eat this stuff; it smells like creamy lemon bars. What&#x27;s more, my kids have ULTRA sensitive, rough skin. In 48 hours, this lotion has completely smoothed over my infant daughter&#x27;s rough, sensitive skin, which no other lotion has accomplished. Perks: Non GMO, cruelty free, plant-based, and scented with essential oils. I&#x27;m not a total stickler for 100% products, but this all natural lotion is magic. And you can use it on your face! A 32oz bottle w/pump and under 8 bucks-?! Get it!</li>
            <li> My favorite all over lotion! Smells great, no yucky ingredients!</li>
            <li> Great lemon coconut smell very natural.  Does not moisturize as well as the chemical stuff during the winter but I can live with a little dryness in exchange for cleaner ingredients</li>
            <li> Okay lotion but I did not like the smell at all. The smell just didn&#x27;t sit right with me so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, not quite as thick as I prefer, but the smell is nice and seems to be working on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good formula, great smell, does the job...husband and I, and also visiting granddaughters love the all-over soap and this all-over lotion. This is the only fragrance I&#x27;ve ordered, but it is such a popular winner, I&#x27;ll stick with the Coconut &amp; Lemon.</li>
            <li> This is nice lotion. I love the scent - very soft, won&#x27;t enter the room before you do. Just a nice soft lemon/coconut scent. It makes your skin feel nice, non-greasy, absorbs well.  I find that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few hours. I could probably put this on my arms and legs 3-4 times a day to feel thoroughly moisturized, so if I&#x27;m really feeling dry, I don&#x27;t waste it. But it&#x27;s nice for my face, since I don&#x27;t need a lot of moisture there. And a quickie hand lotion when I&#x27;m in a hurry is ok, as it rubs in fast.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. It&#x27;s light, but my skin still felt a little dry after applying it. I applied more and my skin broke out after too heavy an application.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Works well. Not too thick.</li>
            <li> This is a great light smelling, non greasy lotion you can use for your entire body and it&#x27;s a great price too! It will probably last a really long time which is great. I also feel better about the lotion not being animal tested, paraben free and non GMO.</li>
            <li> Great absorbing lotion, just don&#x27;t care for the lemon scent because it reminds me of cleaner. Buy the unscented... its great!</li>
            <li> When I first got this lotion, I love it so much as it&#x27;s got a great scent and does not stick. Onto my 2nd bottle of lotion, I started to notice that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well. I have decided not to make any more purchase of this lotion after my 2nd bottle. It&#x27;s good product to try though.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday , pleasant perfume, not greasy , skin feels nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this product which is what prompted me to buy this lotion, although I still love the fact that it has a lot of organic ingredients, the sample fragrance was much more potent.</li>
            <li> First time I have tried this lotion and I love it!!  absorbs into skin leaving soft and not greasy.  The smell is subtle and fantastic, very natural smell not perfumy and overbearing.</li>
            <li> I think my expectations were too high based on the reviews. I do like that it&#x27;s gluten free, paraben free, and so on. But, not all of the ingredients are as wonderful (Skin Deep is a great place to review ingredients and I didn&#x27;t go there first, as I usually do), though none are terribly bad.  If you are concerned about those things, this may not be the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of hydration, this is an OK light basic lotion.  It&#x27;s not terribly emollient if you have dry skin.  Even though it leaves a slick coating for awhile, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel as hydrated as some lotions do.  I realize lotion can&#x27;t really moisturize, but they should keep the moisture in that is there.  I use  this after a shower when my skin is damp, yet shortly thereafter, my skin isn&#x27;t very moist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very scented!  To me, the smell is nice, but definitely strong.  I can see how some people would not like this.  To me it isn&#x27;t a fake smell -  while the citrus and coconut smells are strong, they smell very much as if you squeezed citrus and cut open a coconut. If you are sensitive to fragrance, this isn&#x27;t likely for you. If you are sensitive to fakey smells, this might be OK if you liked coconut and lemon. Then again, maybe not.  I&#x27;d definitely not suggest anyone buy this huge bottle until they smelled it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! The smell makes my morning.</li>
            <li> I love, love this lotion.  I was not sure if coconut and lemon would go together, but I was pleasantly surprised by the pleasing smell.  I was skeptical about putting in on my face, but my face is actually less red and irritated after using the lotion for several days.  I&#x27;ve put it on the rest of my body too.  The lotion moisturizes without being greasy, which is very important to me.  However, one of my favorite parts is that this lotion is natural and made with essential oils.  I will keep using Everyone Lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is organic and it smells nice. I love the fact you can use it anywhere. Great.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells SO GOOD! Just like a lemon bar, it&#x27;s amazing. The smell is heavier while going on, but after it dries it fades to be lightly lemony-sweet if you are touching your nose to your skin to smell it. My fiance uses it too and he has no complaints. Leaves skin moisturized without being greasy and even works great for after sun. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t plan on using it on my face regardless, no scented products allowed there!</li>
            <li> I really like the lemon lotion and the value for the money is hard to beat as well.  I am glad Amazon had it as my local health food store was clueless about what I wanted. The shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this lotion because the price was right and it seemed more organic than many of the options out there with parabens and other toxins.  And I adore the smell of lemons and coconut but unfortunately this lotion had a strong chemical smell.  I didn&#x27;t care for the smell when I put it on, and it didn&#x27;t get any better once it had been on my skin for a while.  It&#x27;s too heavy to return, so I&#x27;m putting it in the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> hey all!    skin deep gives this a 2, which overall is not bad but it still rates for low cancer concerns. i know its maddening but worth educating yourself over!    here&#x27;s the link:  [...]</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled more like coconut. It is a good basic moisturizer. It is safe for use everyday and made with natural ingredients. I actually get more moisture using plain old coconut oil but this is nice to use as well. I like that it is safe for my whole family from baby to adult.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light and absorbs very nicely. It smells so much like a lemon tart that I wanna grab a spoon and dig in.</li>
            <li> I taut about how good the product is. After it arrived, it&#x27;s just soso. I mean pretty thick for a person living in desert California needing nourishment. But it drys very slowly. After I put it on and think about washing fruits, I see the bubbles and worry that it may poison my food. The smell is soso. I guess I finally realize I like rosa one. But the bottle is BIG. I need to bear with it for at least 12 months.</li>
            <li> The scent is great and for a person with normal skin this lotion might be enough moisture,  but I purchased for children with dry skin. It did not provide enough moisture for my kiddos. We were applying twice daily as is our routine. This just didn&#x27;t measure up. Glad to have tried it, but will not continue purchasing for them. Great summery scent for those who don&#x27;t need as much moisture perhaps.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Feels like a high quality lotion. Doesn&#x27;t feel too watered down. Doesn&#x27;t soak in too fast, but doesn&#x27;t take too long either. Feels great on the arms, shoulders, and chest right after a shower. Leaves you feeling and smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Everyone Lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the lemony scent. It goes on great with no greasy feel. It&#x27;s not as thick as other lotions, but works great for me and my family considering that we&#x27;re not absorbing harmful chemicals into our skin</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, absorbs quickly and great smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Actually absorbs into your skin.  Nice that its so strictly controlled for ingredients.  Definitely recommend this to people</li>
            <li> This is about the only lotion I have found I can use.  It has a pleasant smell and it doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  It is organic.  Maybe that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t make me itch and break out.  I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It is still great lotion for me.  When the package arrived it was in a plastic bag and the lotion had leaked out into the bag.  It was a mess.  That is the only problem I&#x27;ve had ordering.  I couldn&#x27;t believed it had leaked out of the bottle.  It&#x27;s still useable.  I probably lost half an ounce.</li>
            <li> Smells &amp; feels great. Tremendous value!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the ingredients list for this price!  It also smells amazing.  I love how it isn&#x27;t super thick so it is easy to slather on quickly.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my always-dry skin soft. During an exceptionally cold and dry winter I had to apply twice per day on very dry areas.  That is almost expected as I have to do this with most anyway since my skin is very dry. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> Grey lotion,  great price,  smells good YAY !</li>
            <li> Lotion smells nice. Good sized bottle. More of a light lotion (we will see how it does for cold winter). Lotion leaked out during shipping so I had a bit of a mess to clean up. At least they had plastic wrap around the bottle so it didn&#x27;t ruin my other packages.</li>
            <li> This is the some really good, smooth, nice smelling lotion.  The bottle is also huge.  The scent is very subtle, even for man to use without smelling like his lady all day.  It keeps my hands from drying out for longer than other leading brands that my wife has tried.  We can&#x27;t find a better deal on lotion.  With S&amp;S it makes it even a better bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump works well, although don&#x27;t let your kids get ahold of it. The top does pop off but luckily it goes right back on and still works.  We will have a constant supply of this in our house, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and works well for the price.  It&#x27;s a light lotion (don&#x27;t expect body butter creaminess) that absorbs well after a shower. I wouldn&#x27;t categorize it as ultra moisturizing and I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face. It has a fresh lemon-y coconut-y scent, which doesn&#x27;t linger too long and I love that EO products use [mostly] natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and half. I&#x27;m a male, so I usually go to Walmart and get (Jergans, Nivea, Gold bond, or Lubriderm for men) This stuff absolutely crushes every one of those. I opted for this because it was all natural, and I&#x27;m trying to stay away from various chemicals, and GMO products, not to mention the price point was the main decision maker. You get a fair amount for what you pay, while actually taking care of your skin, and improving it naturally. I participate in bodybuilding, and various extreme sports and exercise regimens and this stuff is light, and stays on all day, without getting you greasy. I noticed it does turn my face red, or parts of my skin red for a few minutes after application, but it quickly wears away. Skin feels much improved after only a week and half. The scent is clean and fresh, and I would recommend it for men as well. If you don&#x27;t like the smell, it wears off after a few hours anyway. I&#x27;m a pretty masculine guy, and I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I gave this lotion a try.  The lemon/coconut scent is divine!  It smells like lemon cookies.  I don&#x27;t smell the coconut a whole lot but I imagine it&#x27;s in there to &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; the lemon scent and it does.  The scent doesn&#x27;t linger a long time but that&#x27;s okay.  Using this as body lotion after my shower is something I look forward to.  It makes my skin feel silky and moisturized and I love the scent.  Very summery!  (Although, I imagine it will perk me up this winter, too.)</li>
            <li> Trying to find more natural and paraben free products, bought this for my fiance. She loves it, it works great and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I have very dry skin, so I could probably use something a little stronger, but it works for everyday use, and the smell is great. It&#x27;s also great to put a dab in your hair if it&#x27;s frizzy.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like cheap flavored lemon creme. I was so disappointed upon smelling it - serves me right to have bought a jug full of the stuff without trying it. As a lotion it works fine - its light texture is perfect for the summer and it gets absorbed pretty quickly. But the smell - sigh. I simply cannot get past it. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is gluten free. I was disappointed, though, that it was terrible for household members with eczema. I had hoped it would truly be for &amp;#34;everyone.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily.  I&#x27;m able to use the lotion on my face and body.  I&#x27;ve had no breakouts on my face.  It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion but it is an everyday lotion. If you have dry skin you might need to put it on twice. It&#x27;s really an excellent price and I will buy it again and I&#x27;m also going to try that other one they sell in the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the smell--light coconut with a hint of lemon.  So clean &amp; my young kids live the smell too. Sometimes I use it on them too ( 5 &amp; 7 yo). My kids have eczema &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make it flare up at all.  It does feel thin, but absorbs fast, &amp; my skin feels moisturized &amp; soft in the morning. I&#x27;ve only used it on my body since I&#x27;m acne prone &amp; don&#x27;t want to take any chances.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. It smells amazing and leaves skin so soft. Whenever friends and family come by and they use the bottle that&#x27;s in the guest restroom, they always ask where I got it!!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and is super moisturizing!  No greasiness left behind.  I was hooked on the ridiculously over priced Pure Fiji lotion but this has replaced it!</li>
            <li> Was not familiar with the brand, but gave it a try based on the reviews. Great product, not too greasy and absorbed well. Awesome fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly well priced and a great value.</li>
            <li> smells great and is cheap</li>
            <li> Yummy smelling, light but moisturizing, REALLY great ingredients!</li>
            <li> Best lotion we have ever used, thanks</li>
            <li> Very nice smell, smooth and soothing, not greasy at all.  Extremely healing. I have used it only 1 week and see amazing results. I love it and will purchase again as soon as this bottle gets low. it is a great value and it works much better than all of the high $ ones you find at the spas and Make up, bath body stores.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle.  Smells great, not too coconut-y. My husband uses it too. It has been keeping my skin hydrated this dry, cold winter.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion every day after I shower. It has kept my skin flake-free during the winter. It&#x27;s convenient because of the pump, and it absorbs very quickly. I like the coconut-lemon scent, though I don&#x27;t get much of the lemon. I can smell the lotion on my skin hours later, but I don&#x27;t think anyone else has noticed it -- and that&#x27;s exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the lotion on my face. It doesn&#x27;t do much for my chapped hands, so that&#x27;s why only four stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this lotion. It smells so good. It&#x27;s a nice combination of lemon and coconut. Its not strong at all. Its also has a nice even consistency. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice  and will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. It&#x27;s not greasy and sticky.</li>
            <li> I give this lotion  a 5 star because it soaks into my skin so perfectly. Leaving me feeling just so soft! Not sticky or greasy and it&#x27;s not very heavy. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve tried a billion other lotions and this one is by far the best! I used it from head to toe and it has done every part of my body wonderful. My face is moisturized without feeling greasy and my dry elbows and knees are simply soft now. The smell kinda bothers me, I got the coconut and lemon one and it&#x27;s way more lemony than anything. But I can get used to it. I&#x27;ve just never used any lemon scented products before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re looking for a good lotion for an amazing price and a huge amount this one is for you. I will be repurchasing this when I use it all. It will prolly take me a year or so cause it&#x27;s so much of it. And I look forward to trying EO&#x27;s soaps!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like the scent, but i love it!</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable using this every morning after a shower. The smell is light and fresh and is not full of harmful chemicals. :)</li>
            <li> Smells yummy. A light lemon scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. Pretty thick. 99% organic is pretty good. $10 for 32oz is unbeatable. I normal have insanely dry skin during all seasons, this lotion is great It lasts. I&#x27;ve used others that cost more and its like I didn&#x27;t even put any on 5mins later. I&#x27;ll probably be stickin with EO for awhile. I do have super dry skin and need something thicker so my hands but this is name for quick application after showering.</li>
            <li> Great product with not a lot of chemicals as found in so many lotions today.I have been using this product for about 2 years and it is not greasy and you get a fair amount for your money.</li>
            <li> works, not my favorite</li>
            <li> Feels good and smells good.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to tell with this lotion that they have left out the bad chemicals, because it works good and smells great.</li>
            <li> For this price you really can&#x27;t go wrong. I use it everyday, and I bought it months ago, and I&#x27;m not the only one here using it either. Smells pleasant, no nasty chemical/perfume smells and good alternative to most commercial lotions.</li>
            <li> Love the minimal ingredients in this lotion.  Light smell, not greasy, and great for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for more natural products and came across this lotion.  It has limited ingredients with natural extracts which I like.  I have extremely sensitive skin with a tendency to break out if I use heavily perfumed creams and lotions.  This smells great, absorbs fast, is light, non greasy and I don&#x27;t break out.  I really like this product and because it&#x27;s a great price for the size, I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. my skin literally feels like silk and I smell like a coconut cream pie! My husband even commented on the scent. Tried to get him to try it but hes not a fan of lotion. Safe to use even on my 3 year old and the price is fantastic for such a big bottle with quality ingredients. This is the only lotion I will buy from now on! Please keep making It EO and please keep selling it Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just received yesterday smell great my daughter took both bottles. Will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Cheap and just what you need daily.. Lasts for over two months at $10 bucks it cant be beat. My skin is soft and much better than before using it. I will just stick to this and change the flavor each time. This particular coconut lemon is so awesome - Makes me feel like Im on a beach.</li>
            <li> Everybody in my family hates the smell of this including me. It&#x27;s sitting unused in our bathroom. We tried to give it away, but nobody else likes the smell either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the list of ingredients is great and it&#x27;s a good value item. This is a clean, non-toxic product, much more so than the others always claim. I like the density and grease level of the option too. It absorbs nicely. I would recommend this brand to anybody, but not this scent. I can&#x27;t stress enough how much we dislike it, and we all love both lemons and coconut (my little boys use coconut and lemon scented everything! I thought this would be perfect...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble with coconut is that you can&#x27;t get it in an essential oil form, and the natural coconut in coconut oil disappears from the oil when it&#x27;s overwhelmed by other scents. The only way to make a coconut scented anything is with fragrance oil, and very few companies get coconut right. This is unfortunately one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Avalon hand and body lotion in lemon scent for now, but will keep an eye out here for new scents that might be better.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle of product and I do keep it in the shower. Applying lotion to damp skin is the best use of a moisturizer. This lotion smells like something yummy to eat - maybe lemon pie or yoghurt. I love it for daily use. I use it everywhere on my skin. It is not greasy at all, just melts right into the skin. Really like it :-)</li>
            <li> Great value, love the smell and the hydration it provides for my skin.  Only drawback is that the pump provided doesn&#x27;t work so it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle getting it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use all the varieties.</li>
            <li> I have used about every lotion on the market and love EO Everyday lotion, but wanted something in a larger size. When I saw EO came out with this I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because it&#x27;s their &#x27;value size&#x27;, but it is a GREAT lotion and smells like heaven. Not that &#x27;fake&#x27; smell. Very moisturizing, but not &#x27;sticky&#x27; or &#x27;tacky&#x27; after you apply it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin nice and smooth. I use it after I shower and it works perfect</li>
            <li> Oh. my. gosh.  I buy a ton of stuff on amazon and have gotten a bit lazy when it comes to reviews lately- but this lotion is everything and more!  The scent is a gentle afternoon day on the beach, and the texture is just incredible.  I tossed my other more expensive face creams, and just use this now for my whole body.  It&#x27;s just incredible, even when I exercise it doesn&#x27;t become slimy like other lotions.</li>
            <li> Excellent and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well and both my boyfriend and myself can use it. It&#x27;s a giant bottle, which is awesome for the price. I put it on every night after I shower and I feel like my skin is hydrated the whole next day even in this cold weather. It&#x27;s not some kind of miracle-worker lotion but it&#x27;s normal and does its job. I would not order the coconut lemon scent again though. It&#x27;s a little sickeningly sweet, which is unusual for me. I usually like vanillas and Christmas scents etc.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a nice fragrance but it is just an average lotion. The catchy title is what sold me. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this lotion based on the reviews and because it was natural. The smell is UNREAL. Smells like lemon bars. The lotion is incredibly smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky or tacky. I love it.</li>
            <li> The lotion is non-greasy, light, and very effective. It makes your skin naturally soft and smooth without all the harsh chemicals. BUT, beware that the scent reminds me more of lemon pound cake, instead of lemon coconut; but this shouldn&#x27;t be a huge concern because I&#x27;ve found that it leaves a very light scent on your skin anyway. I will definently purchase this lotion again, but I will try the lavender and aloe one instead.</li>
            <li> Wonderful light scent. The lotion absorbs super fast.  Plus great value size. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, great moisturizer. I even use it on my toddlers.</li>
            <li> My kids and I love this lotion but the packaging for shipping was poor.  It was a plastic bag and the pump released quite a bit of lotion into the bag during shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful lotion!  AND cruelty free, a bargain!  Discovered it because someone had it on their desk and I tried it!  HIghly recommend this lotion!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion. It feels and works like regular lotion, nothing super fancy. But it leaves my skin smelling great!</li>
            <li> Great lotion......smells like lemons.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> bought for my aunt that went through chemo</li>
            <li> I love one thing about this product. It&#x27;s non-greasy......that might also be the bad thing. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for me! This lotion is not for people with very dry hands. I read the reviews and I really wanted to like it, but it just didn&#x27;t work on me no matter how much I use. I don&#x27;t dislike or like the smell. It&#x27;s strong at first and disappears after a while. It&#x27;s a huge bottle and I have a lot left. So I gave it to my sister. Her family seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, really lasts, skin feels great and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, works great with my sensitive skin. I wish it smelled a bit more like coconut but it actually smells just like lemon meringue pie! The smell is faint though and almost indetectible after a few minutes. It&#x27;s not really a miracle lotion but with everyday use I feel less dry than usual.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...smells great, absorbs beautifully. Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It is light and smells so fresh &amp; clean. Even though my little girls want to use it all the time, looking at the bottle we&#x27;ve barely used any. I&#x27;m always looking for non-toxic products and this one fits the bill. There are no scary ingredients, and it works like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance.  Lotion is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion- it is light but moisturizes well. I gave it only 4 stars because going on it reminds me too much like sunscreen. The plus to that is that the scent does fade and once absorbed by the skin, doesn&#x27;t smell. I will continue using it though because of the price, the quantity and the fact its natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I tried all organic, natural products but either my skin was dry by the next day or felt weird. This on e is perfect. My skin gets a beautiful shine and it doesn&#x27;t get extremely dry by the next day.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it. It seems to work great and its good that I can use it on my face too. Its a pain to have different lotions for different needs. Just use this when you get out of the shower and that&#x27;s all you need. I will say that I felt that the lotion was a bit thin and that is why I gave it four out of five, but I would surely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I should give this lotion 4 stars for its poor moisturizing, but the smell is so divine that it is deserving of 5 stars just for that. It does a good job at moisturizing I just wish it were a bit heavier. I use this after the shower and it works pretty well though. I also use this on my hands after washing them. I&#x27;d love to see this same scent in a lotion just for the body so it can be heavier with more moisture. I would still want it to be in a pump bottle though. I love that feature. You can&#x27;t beat the price on this! The scent and the price are worth 5 stars. I also love that this is made with mostly natural ingredients. There are some I&#x27;d rather do without, but I think the good out way the bad . I can live with it. I really do love this lotion and plan on buying several to keep around the house. I will have to try the other scents, but I just can&#x27;t get enough of the coconut and lemon.</li>
            <li> Lovely lotion - great texture and absorbs well. Fabulous light scent. And did you see the price???  Woohoo.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  So glad I can order it on Amazon now...</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have very sensitive skin and so far this has been working just fine. Strong, sweet lemon smell but isn&#x27;t overpowering. Great for everyday use. I will order again (if I ever make it through this bottle, it&#x27;s a lot of lotion, great price)</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; ingredient list in my opinion. Plus it is a great value considering you get 32 ounces - the bottle is positively huge!! I was concerned the first time I used it because it feels so lightweight I wondered if it would do a good enough job moisturizing my skin, which I would describe as &amp;#34;moderately dry&amp;#34;. Well, I&#x27;ve been using it every night after my shower for a solid week (at least) and it has done a fine job keeping my skin soft and smooth. I also love the scent. You can smell both the lemon and coconut very well they are nicely balanced. Plus both notes smell so &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;  - meaning they don&#x27;t smell synthetic at all. It is a bit strong at first but as it dries the fragrance mellows out very nicely. I can see this being the only body lotion I use for a very long time!!</li>
            <li> I just got this lotion and tried it. It literally smells like coconut milk that you get in the can to cook with, and literally a fresh sliced lemon. I&#x27;ve also never put on a lotion that felt this good on my skin before. I&#x27;ve used a LOT of lotion over my lifetime, especially after I moved to Minnesota where we have very cold and very dry winters. My skin is itchy and cracked and horrible, especially on my hands. This lotion doesn&#x27;t sting in the open cracks either like many other lotions do. I know that sounds gross, but when you have to rely on a lotion to keep your skin from literally falling apart and you have to use it a lot, it matters. My kids who also suffer from winter skin issues will love that it doesn&#x27;t hurt them too. This is way better than the cow udder oily junk or lanolin stuff I&#x27;ve been relying on for years. And, it smells much better. :) Wonderful product, I&#x27;m going to keep buying this.</li>
            <li> I used to use St. Ives because it was cheap and readily available but then Unilever bought them, they test on animals and my boycott began. After using a Lavender sent EO Lotion I was lucky enough to find this one. It smells SO GOOD. Like Lemon Marangue Pie lol. It is light, easily absorbed into the skin, all natural, not tested on animals and made by a family owned company.&lt;br /&gt;Not much to hate on here. A must have for the whole fam.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.  Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last.  Needs to be reapplied at least twice a day.  Would buy again because it&#x27;s a good price and organic.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful.  Just a hint on lemon and coconut so its not overpowering.  This lotion is light and goes on easily.  Great for the body and the hands.  I even have used this on my young daughter and it worked well.  I highly recommend this lotion for an everyday use.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was look for a large quantity lotion (32oz is hard to find) that was more natural than not and would moisturize well so I bought this one. The smell of the lotion is awkward at best. That was the first thing I noticed and I still do not like the smell of this when I put it on, but somehow once it&#x27;s been on for 5-10 minutes it settles into the one of the most delicious smelling lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. It moisturizes very well and this is my go to lotion now.</li>
            <li> Smooth, gentle lemon scent that fades within minutes.  Not greasy.  Absorbs right in.  I use as a make-up remover as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! I&#x27;m fairly picky when it comes to lotion, and especially anything with coconut. I wanted to try something new, and this looked promising. It did not disappoint! Such a great, fresh smell. The consistency is nice. I do wish it was just a touch thicker, but that won&#x27;t keep me from buying it again. I&#x27;ve actually already purchased my second bottle so I can keep one at work. Would be great to keep in the kitchen, too.</li>
            <li> Really like this, it smells wonderful and its so soothing. The moisture doesn&#x27;t last a long time and washes right off but I like it.</li>
            <li> creamy, non-greasy, smells great, pumps well, use all over</li>
            <li> love this natural lotion. smells so good.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few all (or mostly) natural lotions out there. I put it on my whole family and they love it! Smells good, works well, and the brand is one I trust. We use it on our baby and he loves his \\&quot;spa lotion\\&quot;. Well done EO! Also, they also scored a 2 on the EWG.org list...Although there might be 1 or 2 ingredients on here that are questionable, I find that aside from straight coconut oil (which I also use all the time) there are very few OTC lotions that don&#x27;t have at least 1 ingredient that is questionable. If you are worried about DIMETHICONE or anything else, you might want to consider making your own lotions, otherwise this is as close to ALL NATURAL as I believe we are going to get!</li>
            <li> Everyone that has tried this has commented on how good it smells! It smells kind of like a warm lemon scent with a touch of lingering coconut! The smell will last a few minutes before it is no longer noticeable. It is a very light lotion. So it will spread very easily and very quickly but it won&#x27;t moisturize deeply. This lotion is probably best applied when you first get out of the shower. I tried using this to help the the mildly dry skin on my feet and it would take about 3 or 4 applications before it would seem to have any affect. SO, I would not recommend this for extremely dry skin, unless you don&#x27;t mind applying this many times over.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Feels great! First lotion you can trust because you know what&#x27;s in it. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the young men of the house. They love it. The smell and absorbency.&lt;br /&gt;***AWESOME***</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It goes on smoothly without leaving any residue and the scent is refreshing. It is even light enough to use on my face. I will most likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and non greasy feel.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Lotion smells more like lemon than coconut. It&#x27;s also very thin. It&#x27;s smooth and a great price, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll end up going through it all.</li>
            <li> This is so fragrant and moistizing I use it every day all over my body. Pure with no nasty chemicals makes it easy to over indulge!</li>
            <li> This lotion was EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Not only does it your skin drink up, I add other essential oils, coconut oil etc. to the mix of all my lotions and this formulation blends well with other oils and isn&#x27;t suuuuuuuper creamy, which I totally dig.</li>
            <li> This lotion is incredible! It is very hard to find lotion without all the harsh chemicals and alcohols that actually DRY your skin out, forcing you to use more and more. Everyone Lotion uses all natural ingredients, has an amazing smell, and can be used anywhere on your body. I even use it as my aftershave. You won&#x27;t find a better quality lotion out there!!!</li>
            <li> This is only good for people who want very little moisture. I like lots of moisture so did not like this lotion.</li>
            <li> This has become my go to body lotion of choice.  Clean citrus smell. Goes on smooth, hydrates well and leaves my skin feeling so soft which is no easy feat for someone living through this cold Midwest winter!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion.  It works for everything -- dry lotion, sunburn, you name it, it works!  This is the best scent ever!</li>
            <li> Best organic lotion without carcinogens and harmful contaminates. I strongly recommend! This ended my search for a replacement lotion and I believe it&#x27;s the best on the market right now because everything else I&#x27;ve tried has been terrible or isn&#x27;t comparable to the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion. Use it everywhere!</li>
            <li> For starters, everyone knows you put the &amp;#34;lime in the coconut&amp;#34; not the lemon. So the smell is a bit overpowering. And, the lotion is pretty weak -- it&#x27;s not straight watery, but it&#x27;s not as creamy as good lotion should be. It doesn&#x27;t keep my dry skin moist for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I enjoy good quality, nicely scented body products, and as much as I wanted to like this lotion, I just couldn&#x27;t.  The lotion is very lightweight and probably fine for summertime use, but I found it to be less-than-desireable for winter time skin care.  The scent was nothing like I expected, very dull and flat - I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a fresh scent.  I would consider trying this lotion in another scent, but will stick with a smaller size until I know for sure it&#x27;s a scent I enjoy.  The packaging was damaged when I received it (part of the pump was broken) but I was able to make it work so I could use it.</li>
            <li> I so loved my Aveeno lotion but celiac disease prompted me to make a change. I walked into the grocery store hoping to find a good gluten-free brand. The first lotion I laid eyes on happened to be Everyone Lotion, and it was labeled &#x27;gluten free&#x27;! Do you know how rare that is? I decided on the coconut lemon and have been really happy with it. It absorbs more than Aveeno, but it does seem to moisturize quite well, even if I maybe use a little more of it overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later purchased a bottle of EL in lavender/aloe; don&#x27;t like it nearly as well as the fragrance is to me overpowering. The coconut/lemon has a fairly strong natural lemon scent with a more subtle coconut backnote. It starts out strong but fades quickly and does not provoke my allergies as some fragrances do. Plus it&#x27;s a good value, at least where I bought it. So grateful to have found it.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin SO soft and it smells SO good. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and my favorite is that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Ingredients listed on Amazon don&#x27;t have all shown. Also listed on the bottle but not listed in the ad is Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, coconut flavor extract, xanthan gum, dimethicone, benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, and Sodium Phytate. Doesn&#x27;t make it a bad lotion by itself but they should have the ingredients listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is like a cheap yoplait brand lemon yogurt or lemon pledge. It depends on how &amp;#34;liberally&amp;#34; you apply it. It has little to no detectable coconut smell and while the smell is pleasing, it isn&#x27;t as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion feels pretty good and seems to absorb well. At the cost of 5 dollars for the large bottle it was a good deal but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again. I may try a different scent however as the lotion was, for the price, quite decent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Not too coconutty and the smell dissipates fairly quickly, but smells lovely when you first apply. Very emollient.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. It smells great and makes your skin super soft without nasty chemicals. I won&#x27;t buy anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> I had no idea this product existed until I tried my Mom&#x27;s sitting on her bathroom counter... I LOVE IT!!!!!! It smells delicious, but at first you definitely smell more of the lemon than coconut, which is fine with me. It&#x27;s a good mix, I think. It absorbs quickly, does NOT leave any greasy feeling, and I am buying my own big container of it ASAP! It is a thinner LOTION, not cream, so you feel the need to use a little extra, but nothing crazy. It&#x27;s been a couple hours and the smell has faded away to almost nothing, but my skin feels very soft and nice. I have sensitive, dry skin right now since winter has dragged on, and have been looking for a nice lotion that isn&#x27;t very expensive and without lots of chemicals. This is a winner. I am excited it can be used as a face lotion as well, since it&#x27;s all natural ingredients! You will love it after the first use.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so happy i came across this lotion.  it&#x27;s huge, so will last a long time, rubs in easily, and it smells amazing!  my two year old son thinks it smells like ice cream, haha.  i especially love how low it rates on ewg.  it&#x27;s my new favorite :)</li>
            <li> Smells great and glides on smoothly but I love my moisturizers really thick and luxurious so I add a little baby oil and lotion to this to give me the consistency I desire.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion, can&#x27;t wait to try other scents...leaves skin very soft and don&#x27;t feel dry by the end of the day like  most lotions...but not greasy at all and soaks right in. Big bottle, handy pump, doesn&#x27;t take much product to be effective.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> It has an interesting scent and is as described. Not the thickest lotion out there but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion for foot massages. It goes on a little &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; but is soon rubbed in and doesn&#x27;t leave feet feeling all greasy and nasty, but very smooth and satiny. The smell is good, not too strong, but pleasant. Some lotions are overwhelming, but this one is not. Light lemony scent with just a hint of coconut beneath it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price for this bottle too--nice to not spend $9.99 on a little tiny bottle of lotion--this is a full 32 ounces, and seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without researching it too deeply, the ingredients all appear to be pretty innocuous, and it&#x27;s free of lots of things like Parabens,  polysorbate, EDTA, etc. My husband and I try to massage each others feet and upper back every night, so it&#x27;s important for us to not use lotions full of harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used a lot of lotions and oils through the years, and I have to say, this lotion pleases us both, so we will continue to use it. We like it as well as the Sacred Earth Massage Cream we used to us. Next order, we will try the other scents too.</li>
            <li> First off, the pump arrived completely broken off, which I had to replace with another pump from a different lotion that I had laying around. I have dry, sensitive skin, and it is January. This lotion is thin, and absorbs quickly, but is not nearly as moisturizing as Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, which is my favorite lotion on the market today. This lotion did irritate my skin very slightly after I put it on after showering. It definitely DOES NOT SMELL LIKE COCONUT!!!! It is all a lemon, almost lysol smell, that fades to a lighter lemon smell. I only bought this lotion because it was relatively inexpensive for 32 oz, and I normally buy Booth&#x27;s 4 in 1 32 oz lotion, but Amazon no longer offers it as an add-on item for cheap :( Although I like the ingredients of this lotion, I would not buy it again or recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, not greasy. Smells good and is healthy for the body.&lt;br /&gt;Live in dry weather and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I like that it is all natural and can be used on my kids sensitive skin as well!</li>
            <li> I like lotions that are thicker - this one was disappointing because it&#x27;s on the thinner - feels cheaper - side.  The smell is light and clean though so overall, it&#x27;s okay.  I won&#x27;t buy it again but because it&#x27;s not very thick - it&#x27;ll last awhile in this size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter for the past week who has had issues with eczema for years.  We&#x27;ve struggled to find lotions that she can tolerate, that&#x27;s not super expensive and that&#x27;s had fairly good reviews on EWG.  This lotion is fabulous!  Her skin is the softest it&#x27;s ever been!  While her bad spots are still fairly rough, it&#x27;s only been a week so I&#x27;m hoping that improvement will continue as we continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell at first, although, I love it, but she&#x27;s started to get used to it.</li>
            <li> This is a light lotion that smells amazing. The scent does not linger long and I would not recommend this for super dry or flakey skin. It&#x27;s more of an every day lotion that is probably best for warmer weather use -- thus the summery lemon coconut smell. The size is great and it lasts a long time, spreads smoothly and absorbs quickly. I have very sensitive skin and this does not break me out or cause any sensitivity. But I do have to use something more emollient and thick on my hands and feet and elbows during our harsh Michigan winters.</li>
            <li> I use this great find now.  Healthy for my body  Bulk item great for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Would have given five stars if the top hadn&#x27;t broken so easily from regular use.</li>
            <li> love the ingredients, love the smell. it&#x27;s nice and light as well.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, keeps skin very soft, and love the all-natural ingredients. What a great price for the amount, too.</li>
            <li> Very good - smells nice and does a better job than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great product. Absorbs quickly. Goes with a Celiac lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Disappointed the scent does not last and the lotion is cheap.  Dries out your skin not a good moisturizer.  I do not recommend</li>
            <li> I have always used EO lotions, but this one is my new favorite.  The smell is amazing, and it is rich and moisturizing, while still leaving a clear feel to your skin.  It&#x27;s a great value, too!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, it&#x27;s very light and pleasant. The lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. Also like that it&#x27;s a more natural product and you get a huge thing of lotion for the price. I have very sensitive skin, and so far this hasn&#x27;t irritated it (I&#x27;ve been using it daily for the past few weeks, so if it was going to bother my skin it probably would of). All in all - really like this lotion and plan to continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect. It causes no irritation, it&#x27;s all organic (i.e. not full of toxic chemicals to slather on your skin), it&#x27;s light and non-greasy and it smells like heaven. Not the type of fragrance that&#x27;ll turn your colleagues off - just wonderfully fresh, lemony, slightly coconutty scent. It moisturizes and disappears into the skin.I love it and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:  Cruelty free. Large size&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:  I find the fragrance cloying and I&#x27;ve developed a number of areas that look like excema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m going back to the Beauty without Cruelty that I had tried previously despite it&#x27;s smaller sze.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and does a good job moisturizing. I tried making my own and figured this was inexpensive enough to have on hand for when my homemade lotions aren&#x27;t working out so well. (Separating)</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful! It feels like my skin drinks it up as I put it on! Great for making your skin smooth!</li>
            <li> I recently went paraben free and that is why I purchased this lotion.  The coconut lemon scent is fresh and so nice; I love it!  The smell is not overpowering at all.  The lotion itself provides the perfect amount of moisturization without feeling heavy or greasy.  It quickly sinks into my skin.  I love that the bottle is huge yet very inexpensive, which is great since I use it on my whole body.  On the bottle it says you can use it on your face, but I have not tried that yet.  For anyone else that tries this and loves it, check out Everyone Nourish hair conditioner.  It smells just like this lotion and is wonderful (my review for it is here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JJQ7KYA/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_thx_view).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product  mainly because it was such a great deal.  Generally, I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Body Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me l lot of C.O. Bigelow&#x27;s Lemon body lotion ($14.00 for 10 ounces).  No doubt I will be tired of the fragrance before I finish the bottle, but so far I like it very much.  It works well on body and hands.  By the way, it is more lemony than coconuty.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It comes in a huge bottle, with a very good price and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scented lotions so I was a little concerned, but this lotion does not bother me. I love the way how soft it makes my skin! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling but also has enough moisturizer in it that it doesn&#x27;t feel like water.</li>
            <li> This really do smell like cookies, also i used this on my face and i didn&#x27;t experience any break outs at all, and I&#x27;m usually acne prone. Also this a very large product looks exactly how it does in the picture... Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Love the price and the smell. Sinks in fast without to much work.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like bathroom cleaning product. It also collects in small chunks on your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! Moisturizes without feeling greasy. It has good ingredients and you get a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light lotion.  Perfect for everyday use right out of the shower.  The smell reminds me of a pina colada -- it is quite pleasant though and not overwhelmingly coconutty at all - very subtle smell.  In the winter I use the lavender scent, since this one seems particularly summery.</li>
            <li> A great value considering the amount provided, and the ingredients within.  Smells great with a pleasant, not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the Alba Botanica Cocoa Butter body lotion in a giant size bottle with fierce loyalty, but since becoming a student again, I could not withstand the $7 price hike. I was apprehensive at first about the EO lotion because it seemed too good a deal to be true (and I am often allergic to too strongly scented lotions), but at that price point I decided to take a chance. Boy, did I make the right decision. This stuff literally smells like heaven and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out in hives at all! I don&#x27;t really smell the coconut at all - it&#x27;s more like a lemon confection, but my mom took one whiff and all she could smell was coconut and no lemon. Very odd! (It might be because she grew up around coconuts and I didn&#x27;t.. who knows.) In any case, this lotion is deceivingly light but very moisturizing. I have the type of dry skin that needs some serious slathering, and this does the job. I also live in the northeast - so yes, it gets a bit cold here. It absorbs well and it smells great. I&#x27;m so glad I have a giant bottle of this!</li>
            <li> Update:  Since it was very hot here in SoCal, my jar of Coconut oil is now in it&#x27;s liquid form.  So I decided to pour 1/4 of a cup of Organic Coconut Oil into this bottle of lotion.  I shook / mixed it up real good and can now say that the lotion is now perfect!  Great for dry skin, good consistency and not as \\&quot;watery\\&quot; as before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now know why it&#x27;s cheap for a big bottle full of \\&quot;organic lotion\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s very lightweight, almost watery to a degree.  So I end up having to use a lot more than I would with a richer lotion.  (edit:  Just looked at the ingredients, and the first one listed is?  Yep, Water!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly pay more for a  non-watery version of this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay.  I smell more lemon than anything else.  It doesn&#x27;t give me any negative reaction so that&#x27;s good.  Would love it if they made a lotion with raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> Nice lightly scented lotion. My teen daughter especially likes it over other lotions. My adult son got some and put in zinc oxide to make some sunscreen and is happy using it that way also. You get a huge bottle for the money.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells delicious! My young daughter applies this lotion with no coaxing, much due the wonderful smell. This is our new lotion! Highly recommend for EVERYONE and EVERYBODY!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  The smell is so good, and it feels soft and smooth on my skin.  I am very impressed by the quality.</li>
            <li> Great product.It is light and the smell is good. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase..smells good and absorbs into skin very well. I will buy this product again</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! The coconut/lemon smells so good and the lotion is light enough to use on your face as well. Crazy cheap especially for your face.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this lotion a 5, but I can&#x27;t.  The smell is fantastic.  Smells like lemon sherbet when first put on, but quickly becomes a mild pleasant smell even my husband liked.  I would give it a 5, but my face is very sensitive and it stung a little, not a lot.  I will purchase as a body lotion again, but I need to use something else for my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and moisturized! I use it on my face, buttocks and the rest of the body.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. Even my husband loves it, and he usually insists on unscented stuff. Light, non-greasy lotion. Attractive packaging, nice pump. Great for everyday moisturizing needs. If you need super-duper hydration, however, this might not be enough.</li>
            <li> Great all natural lotion with w high safety rating from ewg. Very pleased with this product. Will recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li> I Love it. Smells great.great deal.I use it for mixing with my self tanner and I love adding coconut oil.It does have coconut oil in it but I always mix coconut oil with my lotion.</li>
            <li> Great smelling lotion for the whole family.  Hydrating and non irritating on sensitive skin, will keep getting it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  Smells great, we use for the entire family.  Very affordable!  Oh! and Gluten-Free!  :-)</li>
            <li> This is great natural lotion. I feel like it moisturizes extremely well and I wI&#x27;ll continue to purchase this...&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the more natural the product the better for your body. But overall I lover this and the scent is nice too, not too overwhelming.:)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and somehow decided it must not smell as strong as others said - please don&#x27;t make the same mistake.  Unless you love smelling like a cross between a lemon cupcake and a pina colada, you will not be happy.  The lotion itself is light and nice, it would be great if the smell wasn&#x27;t so strong and so sweet.  Unfortunately, I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I am taking the time to post the ingredients to this soap for your reading pleasure. This is one of the best soaps on the market and it is all natural. There are no garbage ingredients or poisons that the big manufacturers put in their products. Remember, your skin is a sponge and anything that you put on it is absorbed into your blood stream. It IS time to stop using poison products and start supporting companies that put together healthful products for us to use. The price is fantastic due to the amount that you get in the bottle and how long it lasts. I have calculated it to be about $ 3.00 dollars per month. you can&#x27;t buy two bars of disgusting Irish Spring or Dove  or any of the garbage soaps full of poison for that price. Here are a list of ingredients. I have used most scents of this product and my current infatuation is the Coconut and Lemon. The scent just makes you smile because it is so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3 in 1: shampoo, body wash, bath - perfect for a cleansing shampoo, invigorating shower and a fragrant, luxurious, bath&lt;br /&gt;  pure and natural - gentle enough for the whole family&lt;br /&gt;  for the informed, practical, value-conscious consumer&lt;br /&gt;  pure essential oils nurture and soothe the skin&lt;br /&gt;  gentle and fragrant with ingredients and essential oils that are pure, natural and organic&lt;br /&gt;  cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, non-GMO verified, sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate free.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients found in this product:&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Chloride, Coco-Glucoside, Panthenol, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Extract, EO Organic Herbal Blend [Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Organic Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Organic Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, and Organic Camelia Sinensis Leaf Extract], Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopherolassium Sorbate, Tocopherol</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this, the lotion is moisturizing yet not greasy, and it&#x27;s organic. The scent is amazing, it is subtle yet it lasts a long time, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works ! This lotion is full of organic ingredients and of course the wonderful coconut oil. I have tried other lotions and they never help my dry skin. ( of course It was because of all of the alcohol and fragrances in it and other chemical. )  You won&#x27;t see any of those here. You can even use this on your face. To make it extra -extra hydrading i added some more coconut oil to it and now its like heaven . It also smells like a coconut lemon cookie ...that&#x27;s the downside bc it makes me crave cookies ;) I&#x27;m so glad I found this lotion and let&#x27;s not forget the size ! It will last forever !    Update ... the smell is just isn&#x27;t for me. Maybe in the summer. Can&#x27;t smell like cookie and lemons and wear any perfume with it.... pick a different scent ...add your coconut out and you&#x27;ll be just fine.  ( the lavender is pretty nice )</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this lotion! It was all-natural, affordable, smelled great, and seemed nice on my hands at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then after my next shower I applied it liberally all over (since I have very dry skin in the winter). It felt great for the first 5 minutes, and then my skin felt tight and even dryer than before! I feel absolutely no difference! Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a one-time thing, I tried it after my next shower and had similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for a great product, but I will be returning this as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Perfection! I couldn&#x27;t be happier! EO will be my new brand. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Calling something the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; lotion is not something I do every day. I am a lotion snob. I have sensitive skin and it seems like I either get oily, or itchy, or not really moisturized... something! But with EO Everyone lotion, I can use the same lotion on my body as my face- a total first for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing lotion. I swear it even heals my skin... I put it on at night and in the morning there is a noticeable difference. The fragrance is amazing- vaguely tropical but light- not a bit overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is worth a go- for combination skin, dry skin, or oily skin like my partner. Hard to believe that he and I can use the same lotion, on bodies and face. It&#x27;s a miracle product... and the simplicity of only buying one lotion to keep in the bathroom? Priceless.</li>
            <li> lemon smell is a bit strong</li>
            <li> This is sitting next to the bathroom sink and we use it all over!! I have children with sensitive skin as well as myself so I decided to try this organic product. The scent is light and smells heavenly. Not too strong with either the coconut or lemon scents but a good combo of both. Light lotion that goes on quickly and leaves you smelling your hands for quite a while after application. Yum!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling and for someone who doesn&#x27;t have very dry skin it is goes in nicely and the scent dissipates after an hour. Which is perfect for me as work in a non-scented area. Overall I like the EO product lines as they are mostly organic and all natural smells.</li>
            <li> I love the soap of the same smell but for some reason the lotion smells like frosting to me.  That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but I don&#x27;t  really like sweet food smells in lotions.</li>
            <li> Yum it smells so good &amp; works so well!</li>
            <li> Really big bottle. Light tropical coconutty scent. Doesn&#x27;t have very much moisturizing power though. Okay if you are looking for a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love love love and last a long time!</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion for sensitive skin! And the smell is great and light.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle of lotion that&#x27;s priced fairly low for what it is. It&#x27;s all natural and you can use it everywhere - including your face! It has a very light lemon scent with a hint of coconut and seems pretty gender neutral. The smell honestly reminds me of a light Thai curry (lemongrass and coconut, not so much the spices). My boyfriend says it reminds him of lemon cookies. It moisturizes adequately and has a convenient pump on top! I like it!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell and gentleness of this lotion. We were only using coconut oil, but that sometimes is just a little too greasy after a morning shower. He uses EO lotion everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! No greasy residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great when applying (think lemon shortbread) but the scent does not linger- 5 minutes later the smell is gone- and I don&#x27;t feel that it moisturizers very deeply either. The cheap store brand lotion seems to last longer in both moisturizing and fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Natural/low EWG rating and the value is amazing! Huge bottle that lasts many months. I have purchased two so far and will continue to use this. I have spent way more on other brands in order to go natural, now I usually look for Everyone/EO brand first because the prices are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the value... I have very dry and fairly sensitive skin. This provides really great moisture and does not irrtiate my skin. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! The smell is clean and light and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Smells... like cake. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it but it smells amazing. (I&#x27;m a guy) feels great and lightweight, I can&#x27;t stand greasy lotoins but this is just amazing and it last all day. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> You can use it all over and the fragrance is very light. There&#x27;s no drying or greasy feeling and my skin just drinks it up and feel soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li> A little thinner consistency than I prefer, however it does the job.  Love the smell, very subtle, and great ingredients.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really good.  I love the smell!  It smells like real lemons which is very clean.  I use the soap in this lemon flavor as well as the lime too.  Great and clean for everyone.  So simple.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS LOTION!! .. You need to try this one.. it a good moisturizer and it absorbed and glide smoothly to skin&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL IS SO GOOD!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is extremely lightweight. It is great for skin that&#x27;s not super dry. Or even as face lotion. It&#x27;s a huge bottle &amp; smell great!</li>
            <li> Great lotion, smells great!  The whole family uses it!</li>
            <li> This lotion gets a fantastic rating from the SkinDeep database that let&#x27;s you know about toxins in beauty products. Between that rating and the price, I had to try it. I ordered the lemon scent and it is perfect for my sensitive skin. While most scents irritate me, this one is mild and pleasant. The lotion keeps my skin soft without being greasy or clogging my pores. And the bottle is huge for the price. One bottle lasts me about 2.5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try this if you want a nice lotion, a great price, and less toxins than other brands.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, exactly what I wanted! I was looking for a natural body lotion: paraben free, chemical perservative free, Sodium Lauryl Sulfrate free (generally a foaming agent, makes my skin itchy and red), no synthetic dyes, fragrance/parfum free, cruelty free, non greasy, rubs in quickly, and didnt have an overwelming scent; this fits the bill perfectly. All the other natural aspects are a bonus. (My skin is normal, its not dry, I just like to keep it mosturized and use it daily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: Yes, it has Dimethicone in it. I really dont have much issue with this especially considering out of the 27 ingredients listed its 23rd on the list. Yes, there are a lot of perservatives in this, its a bit of an overkill, but theyre natural nontheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT: Right from the pump, the lemon is the most prominent scent here, however, only when first pumped. As soon as it hits my skin the scent blends and its very faint. No greasy at all, blends in quickly, and my skin feels nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONSISTENCY: Its not too watery and not too thick, its just right for me. Also, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE: Amazing considering this is natural and how much one gets is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, wonderful product, Im not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion!  Product came quick :)</li>
            <li> Bit hesitant of the smell when I first used the product. But, after multiple uses I can no longer fathom using any other lotion but this</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing! It is a fairly strong fresh lemon scent that fades away nicely. It is not overpowering like some lotions. And because it fades, I do not see any problem with using it in an office environment. This should not be too strong as to alienate coworkers. The feel of the lotion is a medium thickness that is not at all greasy. You can tell it has a natural plant base that creates a thin coating that absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> The actual quality of the lotion itself is nice.  It&#x27;s on the thinner side, which is actually good because it spreads really well.  The scent, however, is just not for me.  I typically love coconut scents.  I bought this because I ran out of St. Ive&#x27;s coconut &amp; orchid so I thought I&#x27;d try this as the ingredients looked so good.  But the scent just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I tend to buy mostly organic or synthetic free body products as much as possible.  I also tend to get bored of 1 particular brand after the bottle is up and I shop for something new.  Recently, I was running out of my organic lotion container and was searching through all of the options and came across this brand called EO Everyone.  I like products that are natural and are budget friendly.  Those to me are the 2 most important qualitiies in the body products I choose to purchase.  This brand caught my interest and after seeing the price for such a good sized bottle, I impulsively dropped this into my cart right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-Forward now a couple of months and I must say that overall I&#x27;m mostly satisfied with this lotion, thus far.  It&#x27;s not as thick of a body lotion as I normally would prefer, ie: Avalon Organics, etc however, it gets the job done, so I won&#x27;t complain and this bottle appears like it is going to last me a loooooong looooooong time before needing to be replaced.  That equals great value!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m satisfied because I believe that this lotion is truly 1 of the highest bang for your bucks for all-natural, value conscious lotions on the market!!! I highly recommend this one as a great bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> such a good value! natural ingredients. smells great and feels great on skin. I will never use anything else on my skin. very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, great lotion for a very reasonable price. The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming. I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! a little unusual(smells just like coconut/lemon cake) but I like that! It absorbs well &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily or sticky. Skin is moisturized all day. Just wish the scent lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!! The smell is amazing, the texture &amp; consistency are perfect for me- smooth, not too thick or too runny. My hands actually feel soft for hours after using it. I&#x27;m a mom of 2 young boys- I dig in dirt and sand daily and am constantly washing dishes which dries out my hands. I&#x27;ve never had a lotion work so well! Plus I love that many of the ingredients are organic and I feel comfortable using it on my boys. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the lotion</li>
            <li> It is organic. I use it every single day. The best lotion that I&#x27;ve found. Makes my skin feel refreshed. No breakouts from it. You can put it anywhere. Been using for a year now and will continue.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert.  Its super hot and dry all summer, and winters are blizzard like but still dry.  I have skin that drinks lotion up like a sponge and still begs for more.  This product not only satisfies my skins needs for moisture, but unlike many other lotions does NOT leave you feeling greasy or even more dry than before you used it.  My husband loves it for foot rubs as it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;gunk&#x27; up... and with the list of natural ingredients I am not afraid to use it on my kids.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome! It really moisturizes my skin plus it smells really, really good!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have extremely dry skin, and I have had eczema my entire life. This lotion smells good, it hydrates my skin, and does its job. The smell reminds me of fresh baked lemon cookies, yum! And a little goes a long way with this product. I&#x27;ve found a new favorite!</li>
            <li> smells great and it&#x27;s a great value for the price.  The bottle is quite large and had a handy dispenser pump</li>
            <li> Seems to work as expected.  It&#x27;s not oily and smells great.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion... it&#x27;s not greasy and does a good job of moisturizing my skin.  It&#x27;s a huge bottle so it should last a while.  :)</li>
            <li> This is a very light lotion for face and body. I like the large amount but did not like the strong lime scent at first. I will try a different scent but the lotion itself aside from this particular scent was good.</li>
            <li> Light feel that moisturizes well. Perfect in the kitchen!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, absorbs quickly, and restores moisture to my skin.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion quite a bit. I used it while pregnant and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not super moisturizing. But just as an everyday lotion, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever!  It has an amazing scent and not overpowering.  My skin loves this lotion and i love that i can use it for my face too.</li>
            <li> For the price this is great lotion, will definitely buy again.  It has a stronger coconut smell than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Great stuff with nice fragrance.not too oily for me .</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lotions I have tired. The smell of this one is heavenly.</li>
            <li> I am loving this lotion!  The scent is awesome (and not overpowering), and I also love that it&#x27;s versatile and can be used for body and face.  The added bonus is that it&#x27;s made with organic products and is cruelty-free.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Smooth texture, applied evenly, and has less chemicals in it.  Has a good aroma too, for those concerned about it.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and not greasy at all. Large container lasts a while. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and like it very much</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!! Absorbs quickly lightly, scented, perfect!!</li>
            <li> Not greasy; works very well; nice scent.</li>
            <li> WOW this product is amazing. yep i got two bottles of lotion and two soap. love them! nice, light and moisturizing on the skin. Fresh scent and it&#x27;s not overpowering!! love them!!</li>
            <li> Nice, light weight lotion with a lovely subtle coconut-lemon scent. Large quantity!</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday for my son who is 5 yrs old and has problem skin due to allergies.  He scratches his legs raw and when I put lotion on his skin he cries in pain from stinging but with this lotion he didn&#x27;t feel any pain whatsoever!  I used it on my dry hands and it absorbed well and they felt soft! So far I like it! The smell is very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Recieved this 2 days early :) It smellys like lemon at forst then 5 mins later the smell is gone. no scent of coconut not to thick or watery non greasy absorbes very quick leaves hands feeling very soft great price for this much NATURAL lotion i dont think it can be beat :) i just put it on mine and my daughters legs as we have very very dry legs and we will see how that works. I hope well because i am tired of paying 8 a tube for eucerin calming cream . will update after a few days i only wish they had a scent thats lasts but not too strong Update ...this is pretty much only good for hands it did nothing to help our families dry skin which really is a bummer I hope they make one that&#x27;s thick and for extra dry skin like eucerin calming cream but with a slight scent and same big bottle n great price please</li>
