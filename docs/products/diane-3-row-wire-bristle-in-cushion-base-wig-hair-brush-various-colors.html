            <li>Very pleased with this brush, which has features recommended by my wig fitter.  </li>
            <li>Also very pleased with the shipping time.</li>
            <li>I could not find the three row brush at any stores in my area and was happy to be able to order online.  </li>
            <li>but they go right through my wig hair untangling it perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this brush!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>But I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller any more!</li>
            <li>Beautifully style your wig and detangle and smooth.</li>
            <li>What pleased me was the shipping speed, though!</li>
            <li>I may ave to pick up a couple more of these!</li>
            <li>recommend this brush for your wigs if they get  tangled easy, worked great on the wig I purchased thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very cheap also with good prices.</li>
            <li>It works amazing</li>
            <li>Works amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It fits quite nicely in my tote bag that I bring to conventions too.</li>
            <li>even for my own hair..</li>
            <li>The vendor was courteous and diligent in getting my order straightened out.</li>
            <li>But it is a really nice brush.  </li>
            <li>No problems whatsoever, and in fact it gets rid of the problem tangles in my wigs, extensions, and even my own hair.</li>
            <li>Use on wigs or your own hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my new wig and it is amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>used 3 times and tines broke out and bend very easily.</li>
            <li>Just what I need, goes through the wig very easily.</li>
            <li>I find that the teeth come out very easily</li>
            <li>I ususally use a brush and shampoo to untangle them, but I felt as though getting a wig hair brush might be more effective than using a comb and brush combo.</li>
            <li>I have synthetic wigs for fun and it works great.</li>
            <li>At this price it&#x27;s a good deal with free shipping.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described and great price.  </li>
            <li>Matches description and works fine!</li>
            <li>Very cheap.</li>
            <li>Good pricing for the brush and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt matter if just for a wig or your own hair this is a fine quality comb</li>
            <li>Came early and is very nice quality super happy with it.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more because believe it or not it works well for teasing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel you can get better brush from the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>It seems like much better quality.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and fast which was great</li>
            <li>Just sayin, my wigs have never looked better.</li>
            <li>The hair brush is cute and portable.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>The handle is sturdy and I love the feel of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order two more, one for each bathroom.</li>
            <li>It works really great for detangling knots in wigs and real hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Rated 4 stars though because the bottom tip is a LOT more blunt than the photos show.</li>
            <li>Eh not the best wig brush ever, you could buy a better one for probably the same amount.</li>
            <li>17 more words, 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0</li>
            <li>But, it has gotten the most use from my kids.  </li>
            <li>I guess :)</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again from supplier but ask you make the packaging more fitting to size.</li>
            <li>And my wigs look fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and it works well on my wigs.</li>
            <li>I have many wigs that I use for photography</li>
            <li>Okay as brushes go.</li>
            <li>but its more plastic and no metal.  </li>
            <li>but it work ok</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it, and plan on looking for a more quality wig brush.</li>
            <li>Item is great for wigs or even normal hair!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good with my wig, but it&#x27;s not the best quality, so don&#x27;t brush too hard or else the brush part detaches from the plastic part! lol</li>
            <li>Works great as a normal hair brush, makes getting tangles out easy according to my GF.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tool at a great price, and a necessary one if you are going to detangle any wig-a regular hairbrush, even a good one, just won&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it smoothly combs your wigs hair.</li>
            <li>Works great without damaging the natural or synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>What made it even better is the fact that it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>it makes your wig look fabulous and stunning and i recommend it for anyone looking for a wig brush.</li>
            <li>but wow it works great</li>
            <li>Not exactly the best choice for wig treatment, so</li>
            <li>Brush is perfect for getting out the tangles of my synthetic pieces and the other end helps to separate the curls.</li>
            <li>The delivery was 6 days after I ordered it which as great, it came in red which as my favorite color too.</li>
            <li>Detangled a resistant wig so easily</li>
            <li>Broke easily.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t pull out any wig hair and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>i recomend this product to anyone who is looking easy matinance that will work</li>
            <li>Easily combs through my wig without any snags.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist loved it so much when she was trimming one of my cosplay wigs that she turned around and used it on my hair because of the little handle edge that made it really easy to separate the hairs for a perfect part.</li>
            <li>its nice, works well and doesnt pull on the wig hair too much!</li>
            <li>Worked perfect on a human hair wig for taking out knots etc., very gentle.</li>
            <li>It definitely is good to get the tangles out of a newly opened wig.</li>
            <li>Although I still use my normal hair comb and brushes more it&#x27;s still nice to have around when I need it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have one so this worked out fine.</li>
            <li>I havent used the pick end of it but assume it will work just fine.  </li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be at first, so I kept a rat tail comb nearby!)</li>
            <li>I wanted a genuine wig brush to treat my wigs with love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it for a costume wig that was very well-made so this should work nicely.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush .  </li>
            <li>It can comfortably fit into a hand bag.</li>
            <li>used one and the teeth fell out, cheaply manufactured.</li>
            <li>Needed it but snagged cheap wigs</li>
            <li>These are great brushes for my short hair.</li>
            <li>Gets the knots out but it handles straight wigs nicely but needs to be replaced after a curly wig</li>
            <li>Although the product bag comes with a replacement guarantee, it will cost me more in time to return it than it is worth.</li>
            <li>Got all the tangles out and the wig looks shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>it is amazing brush for a wig, you can style with whatever you want from curls, wavy or straight.</li>
            <li>It seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Cheap-- the bristles are stuck through a rubber backing that&#x27;s just glued onto the plastic.</li>
            <li>I like the cheap wigs, bit upkeep is a pain.</li>
            <li>Instead of a wire wig brush, I instead received a cheap shower comb.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect and gentle enough to work with wigs.</li>
            <li>They have used it very successfully to brush My Little Ponies and Barbie hair.  </li>
            <li>Also works pretty darn good on real hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this on my long and very tangled wig, and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>A Con-bag is like water, food, wig brush, small sowing kit, and so on, and this fits perfectly in there.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I might get a spare for when i go to conventions!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you spray conditioner on first.</li>
            <li>and it was even able to restore one of my wigs that was very nappy!</li>
            <li>Broke right away!</li>
            <li>although my sister uses it more than i do, i really like it.</li>
            <li>When I tried it on my blob of hair (also known as a very messed up wig), it worked better than a charm.</li>
            <li>what they wrote are true...</li>
            <li>When this item came the bristles were very crooked, but it does the job fairly well.</li>
            <li>Already had one and loved it....expect the same here.</li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase at all.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, still works despite that, and got here within 5 business days.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t break easy and it actually brushes the hair nicely.</li>
            <li>I mean the price is great and all!)</li>
            <li>This is a real help since i just bought a really long cosplay wig and it tangles very easily!!</li>
            <li>This brush makes my wig much softer and way less frizzy, which helps greatly when you want your cosplay to look effortless and authentic.</li>
            <li>Super helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adequate..</li>
            <li>Luckily it still works well for parting the hair.</li>
            <li>This brush worked well, and is a much better choice than using your normal brush, so the wigs don&#x27;t get hair oils in them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty ergonomic, comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and overall a good cheap wig brush.</li>
            <li>Goodness knows how most of the sensibly priced Elsa wigs look like old lady mullets!</li>
            <li>It came apart when she used it the first time!</li>
            <li>This brush is MUCH easier on the wigs and makes them silky smooth again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it is holding up great.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth its cost.</li>
            <li>If the brush proves to work</li>
            <li>Was worth the wait and stress though.</li>
            <li>it works really well for my hair after braiding/twisting it since that becomes a birds nest &amp; it did such an awesome job on my long wigs after a windy day.</li>
            <li>But overall I love this brush and its more convenient and easy to hold than a Big handle.</li>
            <li>should,so that&#x27;s all  right.</li>
            <li>It said I would receive it between January 25th and January 30th, and it came right on the 25th.</li>
            <li>It worked fine but the black rubber part kind of popped out on me one time while I was brushing my wig.</li>
            <li>Great little brush!</li>
            <li>This brush broke right after the first use</li>
            <li>On the plus side it got to my house super fast.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the quick turnaround and price.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and the brush works.</li>
            <li>I love how it styles my short wigs!</li>
            <li>This brush is flimsy and wires came out the first comb through.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>broke the first time i used it</li>
            <li>the bristles were all bent straight out of the package!</li>
            <li>It maybe  would&#x27;ve worked better if I knew how to properly use it</li>
            <li>Pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>My wig was a wreck and it really helped!</li>
            <li>FAST shipping!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time ordering wigs for a cosplay, and I figured I should get a wig brush in case the wigs came in tangled.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this brush it broke.</li>
            <li>Having tried so many brushes in my life time a finally just carry this one in my bag.</li>
            <li>This is obviously a wig brush and it worked well for what we needed it for - a wig brush :)</li>
            <li>Still works ok, but I also bought the American Girl Doll Hair Brush at the same time and like that one much much better.</li>
            <li>i would reccomend it to anyone who wears wigs.and needs a good small wig brush</li>
            <li>Anyone with wigs knows how important a wig brush is and these are great, small and light but very durable and long lasting</li>
            <li>Her everyday brush performed better!</li>
            <li>It works great on the wig I just got, but it came with crooked bristles, probably because it was just sent in some little envelope.</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive, but seems like it will hold up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The brush really held its own against even the most difficult wigs.</li>
            <li>However the bristles require gentle handling when brushing a wig, to avoid pulling out much of the wig hair.</li>
            <li>makes styling much easier.  </li>
            <li>The brush is well made and very durable.  </li>
            <li>The craftsmanship was even better than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>oh well, otherwise it maintains my wig very well.</li>
            <li>Nothing much else to say about it except I wish I waited to buy one at the store.</li>
            <li>i wasen&#x60;t expecting much for the price</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>I was very upset I was really looking forward to getting it too</li>
            <li>I really needed this to work out the snarls in my theatre wigs.</li>
            <li>This brush really helps with that.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very flimsy, but we&#x27;ll see if it works on the wig I have coming in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Very durable comb, doesn&#x27;t slip out of hand, get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li>Came in a nice package, only 1 bristle was bent, and it&#x27;s on the end, so no big deal.</li>
            <li>Product works great, but the packaging was a bit wasteful for such a small item.</li>
            <li>Yet, this is a third wig brush I have purchased and first pass through a wig the bristles came right OUT.</li>
            <li>It does the job and helped me brush my old tangle forgotten wig totally straight!</li>
            <li>not worth the money, better off to purchase from a hair store</li>
            <li>It kept the static down and smoothed it out.</li>
            <li>I bought this to brush one of my daughter&#x27;s doll&#x27;s hair which was particularly unruly.  </li>
            <li>I suggest it to all who want a decent brush.</li>
            <li>Detangles my wigs well, strong bristles and minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>As this being my first wig brush, I was slightly nervous (also it being so cheap).</li>
            <li>I recommend highly</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Perfect brush, works extremely well and hasn&#x27;t broken any of it&#x27;s bristles</li>
            <li>I love this little wig brush.</li>
            <li>I was using a normal brush on my wigs and it was pulling the hair out and getting stuck in the tangles.</li>
            <li>Very seldom do I give bad reviews but this just isn&#x27;t a very good wig brush.</li>
            <li>It helped a lot with my new wigs that came in too.</li>
            <li>Just a couple GENTLE strokes through one of my wigs, needing only a gentle brushing, bent over 50 percent of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>The teeth come out of the comb when I brushed my wigs for the first time.</li>
            <li>I had to use a hot glue gun to glue back on the brush</li>
            <li>I thought my blonde wig was totaled, but this got the snarls out nicely and very little har came out.</li>
            <li>The brush is not super expensive and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I will admit that the prongs do bend easily while working with longer wigs, but they bend back into place simple enough.</li>
            <li>Some people have reported bristles popping back in when you used it,but I certainly didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li>I bought this to style my 5 year old&#x27;s Elsa wig for her Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>These also were early</li>
            <li>I use it on natural hair.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>but so far it has helped with the tangles in my hair piece.</li>
            <li>and I think it really cut back the time to do so.</li>
            <li>All i can say is wow.</li>
            <li>keeps coming completely out.</li>
            <li>No complaints as far as quality.</li>
            <li>Brush came early &amp; packaged well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>My only beef with it is just that the bristles get a little bent easily</li>
            <li>Not suggested for high end human wigs.</li>
            <li>The narrow size easily moves the hair back in place without tangles.  </li>
            <li>The center bristle part came out during the first time brushing my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the rat tail end to help with parting,and since the comfort tips on the end of the bristles are little metal balls instead of being dipped in plastic, I have every confidence this brush will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Has done absolutely nothing to help me with a single one of my wigs.</li>
            <li>As other people have mentioned, the teeth pop out of the comb within the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>but it came a little bended but still useful.</li>
            <li>YES, the price was low but, expected a little more from it.</li>
            <li>It can be fixed by push them back in every time you use it.</li>
            <li>It shipped faster than I expected, and all of the bristles were straight.</li>
            <li>that you barely shove the edge of the rubber backing under</li>
            <li>It is not gentle at all and is honestly a really crappy brush</li>
            <li>I have used it a lot over the past few months and it has held up nice.</li>
            <li>This brush lost half of its bristles the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in both little styling projects on short wigs and huge detangling projects on a very long (and abused) wig.</li>
            <li>With other brushes I left half of hair on it and with a right product and handling of this particular brush it saves time and money.</li>
            <li>As a major cosplayer I own a ton of wigs, and some get tangled like crazy.</li>
            <li>They have thin bristles that bend easy</li>
            <li>It did arrive in an envelope mailer and the bristles were smashed in when I opened it, but they did go back to position with a little gentle nudging.</li>

            <li> Also very pleased with the shipping time.</li>
            <li> I could not find the three row brush at any stores in my area and was happy to be able to order online.  </li>
            <li> but they go right through my wig hair untangling it perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brush!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> But I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller any more!</li>
            <li> Beautifully style your wig and detangle and smooth.</li>
            <li> What pleased me was the shipping speed, though!</li>
            <li> I may ave to pick up a couple more of these!</li>
            <li> recommend this brush for your wigs if they get  tangled easy, worked great on the wig I purchased thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very cheap also with good prices.</li>
            <li> It works amazing</li>
            <li> Works amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It fits quite nicely in my tote bag that I bring to conventions too.</li>
            <li> even for my own hair..</li>
            <li> The vendor was courteous and diligent in getting my order straightened out.</li>
            <li> But it is a really nice brush.  </li>
            <li> No problems whatsoever, and in fact it gets rid of the problem tangles in my wigs, extensions, and even my own hair.</li>
            <li> Use on wigs or your own hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my new wig and it is amazing!!!  </li>
            <li> used 3 times and tines broke out and bend very easily.</li>
            <li> Just what I need, goes through the wig very easily.</li>
            <li> I find that the teeth come out very easily</li>
            <li> I ususally use a brush and shampoo to untangle them, but I felt as though getting a wig hair brush might be more effective than using a comb and brush combo.</li>
            <li> I have synthetic wigs for fun and it works great.</li>
            <li> At this price it&#x27;s a good deal with free shipping.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and great price.  </li>
            <li> Matches description and works fine!</li>
            <li> Very cheap.</li>
            <li> Good pricing for the brush and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt matter if just for a wig or your own hair this is a fine quality comb</li>
            <li> Came early and is very nice quality super happy with it.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more because believe it or not it works well for teasing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I feel you can get better brush from the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> It seems like much better quality.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and fast which was great</li>
            <li> Just sayin, my wigs have never looked better.</li>
            <li> The hair brush is cute and portable.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy and I love the feel of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order two more, one for each bathroom.</li>
            <li> It works really great for detangling knots in wigs and real hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Rated 4 stars though because the bottom tip is a LOT more blunt than the photos show.</li>
            <li> Eh not the best wig brush ever, you could buy a better one for probably the same amount.</li>
            <li> 17 more words, 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0</li>
            <li> But, it has gotten the most use from my kids.  </li>
            <li> I guess :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again from supplier but ask you make the packaging more fitting to size.</li>
            <li> And my wigs look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and it works well on my wigs.</li>
            <li> I have many wigs that I use for photography</li>
            <li> Okay as brushes go.</li>
            <li> but its more plastic and no metal.  </li>
            <li> but it work ok</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it, and plan on looking for a more quality wig brush.</li>
            <li> Item is great for wigs or even normal hair!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good with my wig, but it&#x27;s not the best quality, so don&#x27;t brush too hard or else the brush part detaches from the plastic part! lol</li>
            <li> Works great as a normal hair brush, makes getting tangles out easy according to my GF.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool at a great price, and a necessary one if you are going to detangle any wig-a regular hairbrush, even a good one, just won&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> I love it, it smoothly combs your wigs hair.</li>
            <li> Works great without damaging the natural or synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> What made it even better is the fact that it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> it makes your wig look fabulous and stunning and i recommend it for anyone looking for a wig brush.</li>
            <li> but wow it works great</li>
            <li> Not exactly the best choice for wig treatment, so</li>
            <li> Brush is perfect for getting out the tangles of my synthetic pieces and the other end helps to separate the curls.</li>
            <li> The delivery was 6 days after I ordered it which as great, it came in red which as my favorite color too.</li>
            <li> Detangled a resistant wig so easily</li>
            <li> Broke easily.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pull out any wig hair and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> i recomend this product to anyone who is looking easy matinance that will work</li>
            <li> Easily combs through my wig without any snags.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist loved it so much when she was trimming one of my cosplay wigs that she turned around and used it on my hair because of the little handle edge that made it really easy to separate the hairs for a perfect part.</li>
            <li> its nice, works well and doesnt pull on the wig hair too much!</li>
            <li> Worked perfect on a human hair wig for taking out knots etc., very gentle.</li>
            <li> It definitely is good to get the tangles out of a newly opened wig.</li>
            <li> Although I still use my normal hair comb and brushes more it&#x27;s still nice to have around when I need it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have one so this worked out fine.</li>
            <li> I havent used the pick end of it but assume it will work just fine.  </li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be at first, so I kept a rat tail comb nearby!)</li>
            <li> I wanted a genuine wig brush to treat my wigs with love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it for a costume wig that was very well-made so this should work nicely.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush .  </li>
            <li> It can comfortably fit into a hand bag.</li>
            <li> used one and the teeth fell out, cheaply manufactured.</li>
            <li> Needed it but snagged cheap wigs</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Gets the knots out but it handles straight wigs nicely but needs to be replaced after a curly wig</li>
            <li> Although the product bag comes with a replacement guarantee, it will cost me more in time to return it than it is worth.</li>
            <li> Got all the tangles out and the wig looks shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> it is amazing brush for a wig, you can style with whatever you want from curls, wavy or straight.</li>
            <li> It seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Cheap-- the bristles are stuck through a rubber backing that&#x27;s just glued onto the plastic.</li>
            <li> I like the cheap wigs, bit upkeep is a pain.</li>
            <li> Instead of a wire wig brush, I instead received a cheap shower comb.  </li>
            <li> This product is perfect and gentle enough to work with wigs.</li>
            <li> They have used it very successfully to brush My Little Ponies and Barbie hair.  </li>
            <li> Also works pretty darn good on real hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this on my long and very tangled wig, and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> A Con-bag is like water, food, wig brush, small sowing kit, and so on, and this fits perfectly in there.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I might get a spare for when i go to conventions!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you spray conditioner on first.</li>
            <li> and it was even able to restore one of my wigs that was very nappy!</li>
            <li> Broke right away!</li>
            <li> although my sister uses it more than i do, i really like it.</li>
            <li> When I tried it on my blob of hair (also known as a very messed up wig), it worked better than a charm.</li>
            <li> what they wrote are true...</li>
            <li> When this item came the bristles were very crooked, but it does the job fairly well.</li>
            <li> Already had one and loved it....expect the same here.</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, still works despite that, and got here within 5 business days.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t break easy and it actually brushes the hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I mean the price is great and all!)</li>
            <li> This is a real help since i just bought a really long cosplay wig and it tangles very easily!!</li>
            <li> This brush makes my wig much softer and way less frizzy, which helps greatly when you want your cosplay to look effortless and authentic.</li>
            <li> Super helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adequate..</li>
            <li> Luckily it still works well for parting the hair.</li>
            <li> This brush worked well, and is a much better choice than using your normal brush, so the wigs don&#x27;t get hair oils in them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ergonomic, comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and overall a good cheap wig brush.</li>
            <li> Goodness knows how most of the sensibly priced Elsa wigs look like old lady mullets!</li>
            <li> It came apart when she used it the first time!</li>
            <li> This brush is MUCH easier on the wigs and makes them silky smooth again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it is holding up great.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth its cost.</li>
            <li> If the brush proves to work</li>
            <li> Was worth the wait and stress though.</li>
            <li> it works really well for my hair after braiding/twisting it since that becomes a birds nest &amp; it did such an awesome job on my long wigs after a windy day.</li>
            <li> But overall I love this brush and its more convenient and easy to hold than a Big handle.</li>
            <li> should,so that&#x27;s all  right.</li>
            <li> It said I would receive it between January 25th and January 30th, and it came right on the 25th.</li>
            <li> It worked fine but the black rubber part kind of popped out on me one time while I was brushing my wig.</li>
            <li> Great little brush!</li>
            <li> This brush broke right after the first use</li>
            <li> On the plus side it got to my house super fast.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the quick turnaround and price.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and the brush works.</li>
            <li> I love how it styles my short wigs!</li>
            <li> This brush is flimsy and wires came out the first comb through.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> broke the first time i used it</li>
            <li> the bristles were all bent straight out of the package!</li>
            <li> It maybe  would&#x27;ve worked better if I knew how to properly use it</li>
            <li> Pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> My wig was a wreck and it really helped!</li>
            <li> FAST shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time ordering wigs for a cosplay, and I figured I should get a wig brush in case the wigs came in tangled.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush it broke.</li>
            <li> Having tried so many brushes in my life time a finally just carry this one in my bag.</li>
            <li> This is obviously a wig brush and it worked well for what we needed it for - a wig brush :)</li>
            <li> Still works ok, but I also bought the American Girl Doll Hair Brush at the same time and like that one much much better.</li>
            <li> i would reccomend it to anyone who wears wigs.and needs a good small wig brush</li>
            <li> Anyone with wigs knows how important a wig brush is and these are great, small and light but very durable and long lasting</li>
            <li> Her everyday brush performed better!</li>
            <li> It works great on the wig I just got, but it came with crooked bristles, probably because it was just sent in some little envelope.</li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive, but seems like it will hold up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The brush really held its own against even the most difficult wigs.</li>
            <li> However the bristles require gentle handling when brushing a wig, to avoid pulling out much of the wig hair.</li>
            <li> makes styling much easier.  </li>
            <li> The brush is well made and very durable.  </li>
            <li> The craftsmanship was even better than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> oh well, otherwise it maintains my wig very well.</li>
            <li> Nothing much else to say about it except I wish I waited to buy one at the store.</li>
            <li> i wasen&#x60;t expecting much for the price</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> I was very upset I was really looking forward to getting it too</li>
            <li> I really needed this to work out the snarls in my theatre wigs.</li>
            <li> This brush really helps with that.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very flimsy, but we&#x27;ll see if it works on the wig I have coming in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Very durable comb, doesn&#x27;t slip out of hand, get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li> Came in a nice package, only 1 bristle was bent, and it&#x27;s on the end, so no big deal.</li>
            <li> Product works great, but the packaging was a bit wasteful for such a small item.</li>
            <li> Yet, this is a third wig brush I have purchased and first pass through a wig the bristles came right OUT.</li>
            <li> It does the job and helped me brush my old tangle forgotten wig totally straight!</li>
            <li> not worth the money, better off to purchase from a hair store</li>
            <li> It kept the static down and smoothed it out.</li>
            <li> I bought this to brush one of my daughter&#x27;s doll&#x27;s hair which was particularly unruly.  </li>
            <li> I suggest it to all who want a decent brush.</li>
            <li> Detangles my wigs well, strong bristles and minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> As this being my first wig brush, I was slightly nervous (also it being so cheap).</li>
            <li> I recommend highly</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush, works extremely well and hasn&#x27;t broken any of it&#x27;s bristles</li>
            <li> I love this little wig brush.</li>
            <li> I was using a normal brush on my wigs and it was pulling the hair out and getting stuck in the tangles.</li>
            <li> Very seldom do I give bad reviews but this just isn&#x27;t a very good wig brush.</li>
            <li> It helped a lot with my new wigs that came in too.</li>
            <li> Just a couple GENTLE strokes through one of my wigs, needing only a gentle brushing, bent over 50 percent of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> The teeth come out of the comb when I brushed my wigs for the first time.</li>
            <li> I had to use a hot glue gun to glue back on the brush</li>
            <li> I thought my blonde wig was totaled, but this got the snarls out nicely and very little har came out.</li>
            <li> The brush is not super expensive and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I will admit that the prongs do bend easily while working with longer wigs, but they bend back into place simple enough.</li>
            <li> Some people have reported bristles popping back in when you used it,but I certainly didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this to style my 5 year old&#x27;s Elsa wig for her Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> These also were early</li>
            <li> I use it on natural hair.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> but so far it has helped with the tangles in my hair piece.</li>
            <li> and I think it really cut back the time to do so.</li>
            <li> All i can say is wow.</li>
            <li> keeps coming completely out.</li>
            <li> No complaints as far as quality.</li>
            <li> Brush came early &amp; packaged well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My only beef with it is just that the bristles get a little bent easily</li>
            <li> Not suggested for high end human wigs.</li>
            <li> The narrow size easily moves the hair back in place without tangles.  </li>
            <li> The center bristle part came out during the first time brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the rat tail end to help with parting,and since the comfort tips on the end of the bristles are little metal balls instead of being dipped in plastic, I have every confidence this brush will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Has done absolutely nothing to help me with a single one of my wigs.</li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned, the teeth pop out of the comb within the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> but it came a little bended but still useful.</li>
            <li> YES, the price was low but, expected a little more from it.</li>
            <li> It can be fixed by push them back in every time you use it.</li>
            <li> It shipped faster than I expected, and all of the bristles were straight.</li>
            <li> that you barely shove the edge of the rubber backing under</li>
            <li> It is not gentle at all and is honestly a really crappy brush</li>
            <li> I have used it a lot over the past few months and it has held up nice.</li>
            <li> This brush lost half of its bristles the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in both little styling projects on short wigs and huge detangling projects on a very long (and abused) wig.</li>
            <li> With other brushes I left half of hair on it and with a right product and handling of this particular brush it saves time and money.</li>
            <li> As a major cosplayer I own a ton of wigs, and some get tangled like crazy.</li>
            <li> They have thin bristles that bend easy</li>
            <li> It did arrive in an envelope mailer and the bristles were smashed in when I opened it, but they did go back to position with a little gentle nudging.</li>
            <li> If I brush too hard it just pops right out.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, the bristles were already bent slightly, so when I used it on doll hair, it didn&#x27;t take long for it to be really bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> spikes are hard to do and this brush is strong and little enough, to help stick it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any other brush so far.</li>
            <li> But I should have figured as much from the unbelievable low price.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the brush I received looked nothing like the brush in the picture.</li>
            <li> The bristles look delicate but has held on through tangle messes really well!</li>
            <li> It is sturdy plastic &amp; small enough to fit in a small purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I was extremely disappointed too after seeing all the good reviews</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad since I could pop it right back in and it was fine, but kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ll probably just superglue them back in, this really can&#x27;t be called a wig brush if it can&#x27;t handle common wig tangles.</li>
            <li> The little nubs at the end if each bristle actually grab hold of the nylon fibers and make it MORE difficult to run the brush through the hair.</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t pull too hard it doesn&#x27;t really tear any hair out.</li>
            <li> Had to use super glue to get it to finally stay but eventually tossed the brush due to poor quality and design.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> This brush came in four days after I ordered it which was two days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> bought for a long costume wig, worked well.</li>
            <li> It looks like the picture and none of the pins on it were crooked like other reviewers have mentioned</li>
            <li> I just recieved this brush yesterday and on its first use it broke, not sturdy at all and didn&#x27;t even do anything for my wig, in fact it made it worse</li>
            <li> though i dont recommend using this on curls unless you want them to be BIG curls instead of tight ones.</li>
            <li> only thing that raised a bit of concern for me was the packaging, it was ripped a little and rather flimsy.</li>
            <li> I can just grab it and carefully brush my wigs on the spot.</li>
            <li> , some of wigs only need a few strokes with the brush to get untangled.</li>
            <li> If your trying to brush the tangles out of the wig I suggest you be careful and</li>
            <li> when i got this it looked like it was going to be rough on my wig , but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> NOT very sturdy, fell apart within an hour of use.</li>
            <li> A few months later the metal bristles have started to fall out.</li>
            <li> but i think that was from the mailman not being careful.</li>
            <li> This brush didn&#x27;t work like I had expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the bristles falling out, although you have to be careful not to pull hairs out of your wig with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving the item three stars, just because I suppose that&#x27;s not really what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> As a brush designed for maintenance of wigs, I would have expected the bristles to be sturdy - period.  </li>
            <li> Just the thing to tame an American Dolls hair.</li>
            <li> : If brushed in semi-tangled or curly hair the black part that holds the bristles pops out but at least it can be pushed back in&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles were in mint condition upon arrival, unlike other reviewers&#x27; experiences.</li>
            <li> Small but big.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even brushing very hard, just enough to actually brush my wig.</li>
            <li> few of the bristles are a tad loose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to leave a positive/negative review for something so simple and basic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Asolutely not worth any money.</li>
            <li> Why would I want the entire set of bristle to pull out of the brush every time I run it through a thick wig...or try to brush some wig hair up into a ponytail?</li>
            <li> Previous to this, I used wide-tooth combs on my wigs.</li>
            <li> came in less than a week, works well, as described</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t care less about it.</li>
            <li> I got a red brush, which I actually wanted, but I think it&#x27;s a random draw.</li>
            <li> Not cool</li>
            <li> this does it for me and in little time.  </li>
            <li> The little metal brush things came bent</li>
            <li> The bristles were a little bent when i received it</li>
            <li> I recived it a little bent up, but that is probably the mail services fault.</li>
            <li> Terrible products, I got it to comb my daughters doll hair, and most of the teeth came out after a short time, not durable, not effective and not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> If you are working through a particularly tough knot in a wig the brush simply falls apart.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not for heavy use or removing tangles.</li>
            <li> A few were on their way to the trash bin</li>
            <li> but that gets annoying quick.</li>
            <li> however i felt the bristles on the brush were weak and were not much help against knots in the wig</li>
            <li> but im not satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> and because of its small size I would recommend it for people looking for something they can take with them.</li>
            <li> but it is quite convenient to pack because its small and skinny</li>
            <li> Wasted time and money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic plastic.</li>
            <li> It small</li>
            <li> The bristles came right off the plastic base.</li>
            <li> Bristles are thin and sharp.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to brush too hard!!</li>
            <li> but pull on the hair to hard.</li>
            <li> learned that the hard way..</li>
            <li> The comb arrived just about 2 weeks late which had me running in circles.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you paid for not very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This base wig hair brush works just as advertised and is decent quality...</li>
            <li> It was a serious lifesaver for my wigs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll hold up and do its job through thick and thin and is a must have for anyone who wears a lot of wigs.</li>
            <li> This wig brush worked well even on my messed-up sparsely thin but longggg wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a great brush for wig/weave hair.</li>
            <li> Newsflash manufacturers - the thin plastic edge</li>
            <li> and it came broken.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful with this brush, but it ended up coming out of the base within four uses.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> They want all these words but the words are meaningless:  to be or not to be, that is the quesrtion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather disappointing</li>
            <li> I will never understand why wig brushes have bristles made of metal, stabbing through a rubber backing that is in NO WAY affixed to the brush.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m not to mad</li>
            <li> Styling was almost impossible.</li>
            <li> Well, not to say this is a bad product or anything</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think they will fall out (unless you&#x27;re trying to untangle a bad knot).</li>
            <li> broke within 5 minutes of using :(</li>
            <li> cuz I didn&#x27;t spend a crazy amount of money on it!</li>
            <li> Fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush pop out of the base.  </li>
            <li> This seems insane.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good sturdy brush for my wigs.</li>
            <li> Just as it says! I love how it styles my short wigs!</li>
            <li> I was using a normal brush on my wigs and it was pulling the hair out and getting stuck in the tangles. This brush is MUCH easier on the wigs and makes them silky smooth again.</li>
            <li> broke within 5 minutes of using :( sorry but im not satisfied with this purchase you get what you pay for i guess</li>
            <li> Works great as a normal hair brush, makes getting tangles out easy according to my GF. Very cheap also with good prices.</li>
            <li> The teeth come out of the comb when I brushed my wigs for the first time. It can be fixed by push them back in every time you use it. On the plus side it got to my house super fast.</li>
            <li> Previous to this, I used wide-tooth combs on my wigs. Not exactly the best choice for wig treatment, so I wanted a genuine wig brush to treat my wigs with love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great buy! The bristles were in mint condition upon arrival, unlike other reviewers&#x27; experiences. This wig brush worked well even on my messed-up sparsely thin but longggg wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits quite nicely in my tote bag that I bring to conventions too. I can just grab it and carefully brush my wigs on the spot. I would recommend it for any cosplayers/wig stylists looking to treat their wigs with care.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. This brush is flimsy and wires came out the first comb through. Not a great brush for wig/weave hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to style my 5 year old&#x27;s Elsa wig for her Halloween costume. Goodness knows how most of the sensibly priced Elsa wigs look like old lady mullets! Styling was almost impossible.The little nubs at the end if each bristle actually grab hold of the nylon fibers and make it MORE difficult to run the brush through the hair. Her everyday brush performed better!</li>
            <li> These also were early</li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive, but seems like it will hold up. I bought it for a costume wig that was very well-made so this should work nicely. It did arrive in an envelope mailer and the bristles were smashed in when I opened it, but they did go back to position with a little gentle nudging. Not a bad purchase at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my new wig and it is amazing!!!  It goes through my with ease does not tangle at all.  I plan to order more because believe it or not it works well for teasing my hair.  It works  much better then any of my expensive wire brush and I don&#x27;t have to tease my hair to death.  this does it for me and in little time.  I recommend highly I think everybody needs this brush for a wig or your hair.</li>
            <li> Great little brush! I use it on natural hair.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like it. I feel you can get better brush from the beauty supply store. I ended up just throwing it away. Complete waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> Kinda cheep but it works great for wigs</li>
            <li> This is perfect for quick restyles on my mannequin wig between taking product shots. The narrow size easily moves the hair back in place without tangles.  Good pricing for the brush and quick delivery.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush .  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now.  Wish I&#x27;d had it years ago.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and the brush works. It would have five but I don&#x27;t care for the color, and tangling of the brush and the wig hair.</li>
            <li> Detangles my wigs well, strong bristles and minimal shedding. I may buy another one just to have for travel! I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this. Has done absolutely nothing to help me with a single one of my wigs.</li>
            <li> broke the first time i used it</li>
            <li> The brush is not super expensive and works wonderfully. I will admit that the prongs do bend easily while working with longer wigs, but they bend back into place simple enough. Good product and because of its small size I would recommend it for people looking for something they can take with them.</li>
            <li> Well, not to say this is a bad product or anything (&#x27;cause it kinda ain&#x27;t..I mean the price is great and all!) but when I got it, the bristles were crooked and messed up. It&#x27;s rather disappointing but hey! I payed for the price, yeah?</li>
            <li> I bought this for one of my wigs. It has worked perfectly and I have no complaints. I really like it.</li>
            <li> recommend this brush for your wigs if they get  tangled easy, worked great on the wig I purchased thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> This brush worked well, and is a much better choice than using your normal brush, so the wigs don&#x27;t get hair oils in them.</li>
            <li> Very nice wig brush. although my sister uses it more than i do, i really like it. it doesn&#x27;t break easy and it actually brushes the hair nicely. it doesn&#x27;t take out clumps of the wig or anything like that. would recomend</li>
            <li> This brush lost half of its bristles the first time I used it. They just fell out of it like pine needles. I bought one at the local beauty supply store instead for three dollars. It seems like much better quality.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for three days but so far it has helped with the tangles in my hair piece.</li>
            <li> The delivery was 6 days after I ordered it which as great, it came in red which as my favorite color too. ^^ It does the job and helped me brush my old tangle forgotten wig totally straight! It helped a lot with my new wigs that came in too. The bristles look delicate but has held on through tangle messes really well! I recommend this for anyone who owns wigs!</li>
            <li> slides through wig hair perfectly! I thought my blonde wig was totaled, but this got the snarls out nicely and very little har came out.</li>
            <li> This brush does wonders for my wigs! XD</li>
            <li> They have thin bristles that bend easy but they go right through my wig hair untangling it perfect! I love it</li>
            <li> Does what it has to do. It is sturdy and reliable. I love it :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!! but i got it in red instead of blue.. Its all good tho. LOL! I use this everyday. even for my own hair..</li>
            <li> I was very careful with this brush, but it ended up coming out of the base within four uses. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is amzing.&lt;br /&gt;It helped me style and spike my Dirk and Kankri Wig from HomeStuck&lt;br /&gt;The spikes are hard to do and this brush is strong and little enough, to help stick it up.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest all cosplayer&#x27;s / wig styler&#x27;s get this.&lt;br /&gt;Great for Con-Bags also! Small but big. It&#x27;s azmazing.</li>
            <li> It worked fine but the black rubber part kind of popped out on me one time while I was brushing my wig. It wasn&#x27;t too bad since I could pop it right back in and it was fine, but kind of annoying. It still did it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> The brush really held its own against even the most difficult wigs. It did not damage them and did a great job of helping me style effortlessly.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and fast which was great however i felt the bristles on the brush were weak and were not much help against knots in the wig but it is quite convenient to pack because its small and skinny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brush! I cosplay, so I definitely needed to invest in a wig brush. The prongs are evenly separated and they are flexible as to not tear the fibers! I love it!</li>
            <li> Just sayin, my wigs have never looked better. This brush makes my wig much softer and way less frizzy, which helps greatly when you want your cosplay to look effortless and authentic.</li>
            <li> As this being my first wig brush, I was slightly nervous (also it being so cheap). Now that I got it, I realized that buying this is one of the best choices a cosplayer could make. It shipped faster than I expected, and all of the bristles were straight. When I tried it on my blob of hair (also known as a very messed up wig), it worked better than a charm. It&#x27;s also great for a con-bag. A Con-bag is like water, food, wig brush, small sowing kit, and so on, and this fits perfectly in there. Also works pretty darn good on real hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a wig brush, buy this one!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased by this wig brush. As a major cosplayer I own a ton of wigs, and some get tangled like crazy. I ususally use a brush and shampoo to untangle them, but I felt as though getting a wig hair brush might be more effective than using a comb and brush combo. It works amazing, some of wigs only need a few strokes with the brush to get untangled. I love it so much I might get a spare for when i go to conventions!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping; Great packaging; Excellent product. This product is perfect and gentle enough to work with wigs. I have synthetic wigs for fun and it works great.</li>
            <li> used 3 times and tines broke out and bend very easily. Waste of money. Very seldom do I give bad reviews but this just isn&#x27;t a very good wig brush.</li>
            <li> The hair brush is cute and portable. It can comfortably fit into a hand bag. However the bristles require gentle handling when brushing a wig, to avoid pulling out much of the wig hair.</li>
            <li> This brush came in four days after I ordered it which was two days earlier than expected. It came in great condition and works well with taming my wigs. It is definitely worth its cost.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you paid for not very happy with this product the bristles were all bent straight out of the package! Not cool I guess I&#x27;m not to mad cuz I didn&#x27;t spend a crazy amount of money on it! But I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller any more! Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> Item is excellent for detangling wigs made of Kanekalon fiber. Synthetic fiber is not under my list of recommendations because it seems to frizz those types of wigs out.. ^^;</li>
            <li> Works great! Detangled a resistant wig so easily and I think it really cut back the time to do so.</li>
            <li> I love it, it smoothly combs your wigs hair. All i can say is wow. what they wrote are true...</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Super helpful.</li>
            <li> Very cheap. The center bristle part came out during the first time brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> I suppose it works like a wig brush should,so that&#x27;s all  right. It&#x27;s adequate..I don&#x27;t need any other brush so far.</li>
            <li> Works great without damaging the natural or synthetic hair. Would recommend this brush to anyone with wigs or extensions, good product</li>
            <li> Works pretty good with my wig, but it&#x27;s not the best quality, so don&#x27;t brush too hard or else the brush part detaches from the plastic part! lol</li>
            <li> It does what its supposed to do...  It gets the tangles out.  Just make sure you spray conditioner on first.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these one for my friend and one for myself and I got a blue and red one to chose from. If your trying to brush the tangles out of the wig I suggest you be careful and but pull on the hair to hard. It will pull the hair out of the wig.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush, works extremely well and hasn&#x27;t broken any of it&#x27;s bristles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wig brush what can I say. It just does it&#x27;s job and brushes wigs. Although I still use my normal hair comb and brushes more it&#x27;s still nice to have around when I need it.</li>
            <li> used one and the teeth fell out, cheaply manufactured. not worth the money, better off to purchase from a hair store</li>
            <li> when i got this it looked like it was going to be rough on my wig , but it isn&#x27;t.  makes styling much easier.  I would get it again</li>
            <li> it works really well for my hair after braiding/twisting it since that becomes a birds nest &amp; it did such an awesome job on my long wigs after a windy day.</li>
            <li> The brush is well made and very durable.  The craftsmanship was even better than I expected for the price.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> it broke the brush came apart even after i glued the brissels came out and i glued it but it still came apart</li>
            <li> This brush worked great on my synthetic wig. It kept the static down and smoothed it out.</li>
            <li> Needed it but snagged cheap wigs</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these brushes, however, only one arrived. After emailing the owner, the second brush was sent promptly. The vendor was courteous and diligent in getting my order straightened out. These are great brushes for my short hair. The handle is sturdy and I love the feel of the brushes. I&#x27;m going to order two more, one for each bathroom.</li>
            <li> This brush took awhile to come.  But it is a really nice brush.  Have been using it since my purchase.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush pop out of the base.  I ended up having to buy another brush from a different company.</li>
            <li> It works really great for detangling knots in wigs and real hair. My only problem with it, is the wire bristles part keeps coming completely out. If I brush too hard it just pops right out. Thankfully I can put it back in and keep going but that gets annoying quick. The shipping was fast and overall a good cheap wig brush.</li>
            <li> Came in a nice package, only 1 bristle was bent, and it&#x27;s on the end, so no big deal. Just what I need, goes through the wig very easily.</li>
            <li> It fell  apart as soon as I started brushing my wig!  This is garbage</li>
            <li> For wig owners! Whether you cosplay or not. I love this little wig brush. My hair stylist loved it so much when she was trimming one of my cosplay wigs that she turned around and used it on my hair because of the little handle edge that made it really easy to separate the hairs for a perfect part. Love it. If I ever lose this one, I&#x27;ll be buying another.</li>
            <li> Basically fell apart after I got it. It maybe  would&#x27;ve worked better if I knew how to properly use it but the bristles fell out and it tore every time i went to brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is perfect for getting out the tangles of my synthetic pieces and the other end helps to separate the curls. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> The little metal brush things came bent but I guess that&#x27;s from the mail. oh well, otherwise it maintains my wig very well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get wire, got plastic bristles</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush for wigs and I bought two of them and just love them!  Would recommend this to anyone who has wigs.</li>
            <li> It came apart when she used it the first time! Wasted time and money!</li>
            <li> Works great for detangling my synthetic wigs! Rated 4 stars though because the bottom tip is a LOT more blunt than the photos show. Luckily it still works well for parting the hair. (I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be at first, so I kept a rat tail comb nearby!)</li>
            <li> its a wig brush that works well and doesnt yank it, so yes, id reccommend this to anyone who needs a brush for their wigs</li>
            <li> NOT very sturdy, fell apart within an hour of use. Pretty flimsy. YES, the price was low but, expected a little more from it.</li>
            <li> The rubber part that houses the bristles popped out after 2 strokes of my hair. Had to use super glue to get it to finally stay but eventually tossed the brush due to poor quality and design.</li>
            <li> Brushes wigs perfectly without knotting any curls or wave! Definitely buy! It brushes deeply that way you will know where is the knot you have to take out.</li>
            <li> Broke easily. Fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> came in less than a week, works well, as described</li>
            <li> the bristles tend to want to come out of the brush so i keep having to put the rubber part back in and tuck it back under but then it happens again. so no i wouldnt recommend.</li>
            <li> Use it all on all of the toughest wigs and extensions. No problems whatsoever, and in fact it gets rid of the problem tangles in my wigs, extensions, and even my own hair.</li>
            <li> I will never understand why wig brushes have bristles made of metal, stabbing through a rubber backing that is in NO WAY affixed to the brush. Is it just me? Why would I want the entire set of bristle to pull out of the brush every time I run it through a thick wig...or try to brush some wig hair up into a ponytail? This seems insane. Yet, this is a third wig brush I have purchased and first pass through a wig the bristles came right OUT. Newsflash manufacturers - the thin plastic edge that you barely shove the edge of the rubber backing under DOES NOT hold the bristles into the brush. It&#x27;s not magic plastic.</li>
            <li> This comb is just wonderful! It looks like the picture and none of the pins on it were crooked like other reviewers have mentioned and it was even able to restore one of my wigs that was very nappy! What made it even better is the fact that it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush. I still prefer using combs for my cosplay wigs though.  Update: A few months later the metal bristles have started to fall out. You can put them back with pliers, but it&#x27;s a pain.</li>
            <li> Eh not the best wig brush ever, you could buy a better one for probably the same amount.</li>
            <li> Item is great for wigs or even normal hair! How can I write the required amount of words about one brush?</li>
            <li> Works well - I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Matches description and works fine! My wig was a wreck and it really helped! Didn&#x27;t fall apart as I&#x27;ve had some do!</li>
            <li> Broke right away! I started using it on my wigs when they were untangled and it broke instantly. It cannot handle a wig.</li>
            <li> Different color than pictures and it came broken.  Nothing much else to say about it except I wish I waited to buy one at the store.</li>
            <li> Gets the knots out but it handles straight wigs nicely but needs to be replaced after a curly wig</li>
            <li> Teeth began to fall out before I finished untangling the pony tail.  Ugh. Although the product bag comes with a replacement guarantee, it will cost me more in time to return it than it is worth.</li>
            <li> pulls at weft.  not recommended for short wigs.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST if you own wigs! Wonderful product, amazing results! Beautifully style your wig and detangle and smooth.</li>
            <li> FAST shipping! The bristles were a little bent when i received it but i think that was from the mailman not being careful. but worked wonders on my porcelain dolls hair! though i dont recommend using this on curls unless you want them to be BIG curls instead of tight ones. learned that the hard way.. lol But overall I love this brush and its more convenient and easy to hold than a Big handle.</li>
            <li> Just the thing to tame an American Dolls hair. Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> perfect. works great. 17 more words, 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0</li>
            <li> I needed to brush out and style my blond wig for my Zero Suit Samus cosplay and this brush works perfect!!! Got all the tangles out and the wig looks shiny and smooth. Didn&#x27;t seem to damage my wig at all.</li>
            <li> When this item came the bristles were very crooked, but it does the job fairly well. It didn&#x27;t pull out any wig hair and it&#x27;s easy to use. The bristles may have been crooked because of shipping but I don&#x27;t see how they were made so crooked. I do recommend the brush though.</li>
            <li> Terrible products, I got it to comb my daughters doll hair, and most of the teeth came out after a short time, not durable, not effective and not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Good brush for wigs. I find that the teeth come out very easily and my brush looks destroyed after 6 weeks. Not for heavy use or removing tangles.</li>
            <li> This brush does it&#x27;s job good. No complaints as far as quality. I have used it a lot over the past few months and it has held up nice.</li>
            <li> So I would rather use my regular brush because this brush causes the hair to fall out of my wigs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to leave a positive/negative review for something so simple and basic.&lt;br /&gt;It brushes hair. It doesn&#x27;t turn you into a unicorn. It just brushes. Use on wigs or your own hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end.</li>
            <li> it doesnt matter if just for a wig or your own hair this is a fine quality comb and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> its good on wigs but it came a little bended but still useful.</li>
            <li> Anyone with wigs knows how important a wig brush is and these are great, small and light but very durable and long lasting</li>
            <li> Does NOT work on doll hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have one so this worked out fine. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it is holding up great. At this price it&#x27;s a good deal with free shipping.</li>
            <li> This brush didn&#x27;t work like I had expected. I tried to brush a wig out with it in order to get rid of the tangles but it just doesn&#x27;t work! Not recommended if you&#x27;re trying to brush out tangles in a wig.</li>
            <li> I used this on my long and very tangled wig, and it worked perfectly.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the bristles falling out, although you have to be careful not to pull hairs out of your wig with it.  It&#x27;s a great tool at a great price, and a necessary one if you are going to detangle any wig-a regular hairbrush, even a good one, just won&#x27;t do.  This brush also works well on my own hair! But, it has gotten the most use from my kids.  They have used it very successfully to brush My Little Ponies and Barbie hair.  So, we all look great I guess :)</li>
            <li> it is amazing brush for a wig, you can style with whatever you want from curls, wavy or straight. it makes your wig look fabulous and stunning and i recommend it for anyone looking for a wig brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for the wigs I bought! As long as I don&#x27;t pull too hard it doesn&#x27;t really tear any hair out. It&#x27;s pretty ergonomic, comfortable to hold. I recommend it to anyone who has a wig or hair piece accessories.</li>
            <li> This base wig hair brush works just as advertised and is decent quality... I also appreciated the quick turnaround and price.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It made the wig I use a lot softer and helped fix others. It&#x27;s also good for styling.</li>
            <li> Product works great, but the packaging was a bit wasteful for such a small item. Will purchase again from supplier but ask you make the packaging more fitting to size.</li>
            <li> i wasen&#x60;t expecting much for the price but wow it works great i recomend this product to anyone who is looking easy matinance that will work</li>
            <li> This brush is a great brush and doesint break i would reccomend it to anyone who wears wigs.and needs a good small wig brush</li>
            <li> Works very well. No complaints here...And my wigs look fabulous! Can&#x27;t beat the price (paid close to nothing for it). I recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time ordering wigs for a cosplay, and I figured I should get a wig brush in case the wigs came in tangled. I still haven&#x27;t received my wigs yet so I haven&#x27;t tried out the brush, but it&#x27;s in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few of the bristles are a tad loose but I don&#x27;t think they will fall out (unless you&#x27;re trying to untangle a bad knot). Almost all of them are sturdy and I think this brush will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that raised a bit of concern for me was the packaging, it was ripped a little and rather flimsy. I don&#x27;t think the seller is at fault though, probably just shipping/handling issues. The brush I received was also red (not blue as in the product&#x27;s picture here) but I couldn&#x27;t care less about it. What pleased me was the shipping speed, though! It said I would receive it between January 25th and January 30th, and it came right on the 25th. If the brush proves to work well I think I&#x27;ll order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> They want all these words but the words are meaningless:  to be or not to be, that is the quesrtion</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush it broke. The bristles came right off the plastic base. It seems cheaply made. Asolutely not worth any money. Sont buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. It detangles quite effectively and is great for carrying around in your purse. My only beef with it is just that the bristles get a little bent easily but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> this product works great for all my wigs and helps me to keep them in great shape. thank you so much</li>
            <li> This is a must when purchasing any hair product. Having tried so many brushes in my life time a finally just carry this one in my bag. With other brushes I left half of hair on it and with a right product and handling of this particular brush it saves time and money. Thank you, Christine</li>
            <li> I recived it a little bent up, but that is probably the mail services fault. It works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and it works well on my wigs. I have many wigs that I use for photography and sometimes I will beat them all up. This was just what I needed to take care of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wig brush. Okay as brushes go.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter uses the brush to style her AG doll&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> It works great on the wig I just got, but it came with crooked bristles, probably because it was just sent in some little envelope. Not bad for the price, still works despite that, and got here within 5 business days.</li>
            <li> Got it today works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in both little styling projects on short wigs and huge detangling projects on a very long (and abused) wig. It&#x27;ll hold up and do its job through thick and thin and is a must have for anyone who wears a lot of wigs.</li>
            <li> I worked as a wig stylist in the 1970&#x27;s when synthetic wigs were a big fad. I wish we would have had brushes like this then.</li>
            <li> It worked for a bit till it broke. I had to use a hot glue gun to glue back on the brush</li>
            <li> This is obviously a wig brush and it worked well for what we needed it for - a wig brush :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome if you have to wear a wig. Styles easier than a pick/comb, probably because the are &amp;#34;wig brushes&amp;#34;. Already had one and loved it....expect the same here.</li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned, the teeth pop out of the comb within the first time you use it.  While I&#x27;ll probably just superglue them back in, this really can&#x27;t be called a wig brush if it can&#x27;t handle common wig tangles.</li>
            <li> This brush broke right after the first use I was very upset I was really looking forward to getting it too</li>
            <li> This is a good wig brush. It definitely is good to get the tangles out of a newly opened wig.</li>
            <li> This fell apart after using it for all of 1 minute. The rubber thing that the pins are embedded in gets disconnected from the brush handle. Yes, you can put them back together, but then they just come apart again. I wasn&#x27;t even brushing very hard, just enough to actually brush my wig.</li>
            <li> Pros: Brush came early &amp; packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;  It is sturdy plastic &amp; small enough to fit in a small purse.&lt;br /&gt;  Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If brushed in semi-tangled or curly hair the black part that holds the bristles pops out but at least it can be pushed back in&lt;br /&gt;  The brush that came was red instead of blue like I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Perfect brush! Works amazing. Worked perfect on a human hair wig for taking out knots etc., very gentle. So happy that we found this product.</li>
            <li> As soon as I used this item, the brush spikes popped off.</li>
            <li> but its more plastic and no metal.  Don&#x27;t buy it look for something more expensive, which will probably last longer.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this brush yesterday and on its first use it broke, not sturdy at all and didn&#x27;t even do anything for my wig, in fact it made it worse, I would not recommend this item at all and I wish i had never even bothered to buy it, I was extremely disappointed too after seeing all the good reviews</li>
            <li> I got a red brush, which I actually wanted, but I think it&#x27;s a random draw. Love the rat tail end to help with parting,and since the comfort tips on the end of the bristles are little metal balls instead of being dipped in plastic, I have every confidence this brush will last a long time. Very happy with this purchase! Some people have reported bristles popping back in when you used it,but I certainly didn&#x27;t have that problem. Just be careful not to brush too hard!!</li>
            <li> Cheap-- the bristles are stuck through a rubber backing that&#x27;s just glued onto the plastic. If you are working through a particularly tough knot in a wig the brush simply falls apart.</li>
            <li> I really needed this to work out the snarls in my theatre wigs. I was finding regular brushes did not work on my synthetic hair. I like the cheap wigs, bit upkeep is a pain. This brush really helps with that. It was a serious lifesaver for my wigs. A few were on their way to the trash bin it I couldn&#x27;t rescue them. I may ave to pick up a couple more of these!</li>
            <li> It does what it says!  Easily combs through my wig without any snags.  I havent used the pick end of it but assume it will work just fine.  The price was good and having Prime delivery I received it on time.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this brush. But I should have figured as much from the unbelievable low price.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the brush I received looked nothing like the brush in the picture. Instead of ball tips, the brush had rows of plastic bristles. Not only that, but there was no cushion in the brush. Instead the bristles just popped out of the plastic structure.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed as if I received a child&#x27;s brush for dolls. The bristles are very flimsy, but we&#x27;ll see if it works on the wig I have coming in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;If not, my review will not change.</li>
            <li> This is a real help since i just bought a really long cosplay wig and it tangles very easily!! It goes through the wig well and i just brushed through all of it so i could braid it and store it properly without getting the wig messed up.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, the bristles were already bent slightly, so when I used it on doll hair, it didn&#x27;t take long for it to be really bent out of shape. Still works ok, but I also bought the American Girl Doll Hair Brush at the same time and like that one much much better.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this brush, which has features recommended by my wig fitter.  Also very pleased with the shipping time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to brush one of my daughter&#x27;s doll&#x27;s hair which was particularly unruly.  The bristles eventually fell out.  I&#x27;m still giving the item three stars, just because I suppose that&#x27;s not really what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> Good for wigs and extensions. Doesn&#x27;t damage hair or pull hair out. I even use it to detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> It small but it work ok</li>
            <li> its nice, works well and doesnt pull on the wig hair too much! I suggest it to all who want a decent brush.</li>
            <li> Came early and is very nice quality super happy with it.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and great price.  Excellent quality and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Saved my Sailormoon wig.</li>
            <li> Instead of a wire wig brush, I instead received a cheap shower comb.  Will not be buying from this brand again.</li>
            <li> Bristles are thin and sharp. Not suggested for high end human wigs.</li>
            <li> bought for a long costume wig, worked well. happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great at detangling wigs.</li>
            <li> This thing has destroyed one of my wigs. It is not gentle at all and is honestly a really crappy brush</li>
            <li> As a brush designed for maintenance of wigs, I would have expected the bristles to be sturdy - period.  Just a couple GENTLE strokes through one of my wigs, needing only a gentle brushing, bent over 50 percent of the bristles.  I would not recommend it, and plan on looking for a more quality wig brush.</li>
            <li> Although my mail carrier lost the product for over a week, I still got what I paid for and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I could not find the three row brush at any stores in my area and was happy to be able to order online.  The package arrived promptly in good shape .  I like the brush and the price.</li>
            <li> the product itself works well but it has lots of bent wires. but all in all it works quite well.</li>
            <li> The comb arrived just about 2 weeks late which had me running in circles. Was worth the wait and stress though. Very durable comb, doesn&#x27;t slip out of hand, get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
