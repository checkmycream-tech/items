            <li>I love products that are eye appealing as well as functional</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better</li>
            <li>Just received these brushed a week ago, and let me just say I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li>As a licensed Esthetician and Makeup Artist, I am always looking for the next best makeup brush collection.</li>
            <li>the most durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try the USpicy Cosmetic Brushes.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s just a very cool, well designed box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these brushes are very high quality, they&#x27;re a very good price, and they work very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the USpicy® Cosmetics Makeup Brushes, they make a wonderful Christmas gift for a teenager, adult, and you can get one for yourself as well.  </li>
            <li>;) I personally own a nice set of Purdy paint brushes that could really expedite our departure, but</li>
            <li>As for use, the large brushes did a great job spreading liquid foundation as well as powder and all of the detail brushes performed very well.</li>
            <li>The angles of this brush make it fit the face</li>
            <li>really enjoy the USpicy 10 Piece Makeup Brush Collection.</li>
            <li>They were all smooth on the skin and even cleaned up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>know she is relatively picky on her products, so to have 5 stars given on this is a great sign.</li>
            <li>Her initial thought with respect to the looks of these brushes was that they look really nice, and she liked the box they were presented in.</li>
            <li>If you are going from one brush to ten, this is a very nice guide to have</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will certainly update here if there is a long term durability issue, but as it stands these brushes come with a certified cosmetics person&#x27;s stamp of approval!! :D</li>
            <li>She has used a particular brand of brush all these years due to her training as that brand had been the best for her skin and</li>
            <li>And she was glad to throw some of her older used ones</li>
            <li>This brush would also be great at blending a contour down the sides of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These come in a nice storage box, that slides open.</li>
            <li>Came really fast, they are good quality, it works for me I&#x27;m starting to do my make up</li>
            <li>Such a great value and lasted 3 washes so far with no issues.</li>
            <li>This brush would also be great to add a more dramatic highlight to the tops of your cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They make applying various types of makeup easy and the brush handles are strong and durable.</li>
            <li>i am getting this right</li>
            <li>A few strands came out when I washed them for the first time, but after that they were great.</li>
            <li>This instantly makes this item a great gift, especially if you aren&#x27;t looking for a gift that you&#x27;d have to wrap.</li>
            <li>The handles are not too long and not too short, they&#x27;re very comfortable to handle which makes applying make up very easy.</li>
            <li>It would also be good at blending a more dramatic contour into your cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the brushes -&lt;br /&gt;They are a lot higher quality than I was expecting for this price.</li>
            <li>This manual shows you what each brush&#x27;s intended purpose is, and exactly how to use them.</li>
            <li>but she did state with confidence that they are every bit as good if not better than the brushes she has been using all these years.</li>
            <li>I never promise a certain review.minum and the handle is made of wood.</li>
            <li>I never promise a certain review.</li>
            <li>This collection is made of very high quality products and they apply makeup like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;The USpicy 10 Piece Makeup brush collection comes with 5 face brushes and 5 eye or concealer brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was ready to try them out</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for both powder and liquid makeup, and they work very well with both.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves seem very durable</li>
            <li>They really hold the powder/make-up.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see having to replace these brushes anytime in the near future, and for this price range, there aren&#x27;t many brush sets that you can say that about.</li>
            <li>These brushes are unbeliveably soft!!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are made of very high quality materials, the bristles are extremely soft and don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, and there isn&#x27;t really any shedding.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re light, but not light enough that they feel cheap.</li>
            <li>These are clearly inexpensive brushes, but they do the job.</li>
            <li>Sooo soft and the bristles dont shed at all.</li>
            <li>The brush tips themselves are soft but also do not shed when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>Soft but sturdy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are such a high quality makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>They feel so soft and barely any fallout (you will never not have fallout).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if we add that time up she should be queen of all things perfume, makeup, and odd ways of twisting ones hair to postpone complaining about it, until exactly 1 hour after leaving the house!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it has only been a week she has made her way through some of them, and she says that to her they seem every bit as good as her expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>The box is a drawer-style, so if you wanted to you could easily use this box to store either your brushes, or other little things.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quite soft and dense and it applies my foundation perfectly, same thing goes for the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>There are ten brushes in total, and each one is very well made and feels like it would last a long time.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the brush&#x27;s they thick and soft and it comes with a little book to tell which brush is used for what for a person that know nothing about brushes.</li>
            <li>While she insist that she has taken no cosmetic training, I think that the hour and a half it takes to get ready to go somewhere, says otherwise.</li>
            <li>, she says &amp;#34;The big ones spread the base layers well as they should, and the small ones flow smooth and feel good to the face, causing no clumps or blemishes.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes are very well designed; with the gold writing on the black handle and simply the overall feel of them.</li>

            <li> Well to make it short, she cannot yet speak to the long term durability</li>
            <li> /&gt;Precision Flat Angled Brush: This brush will blend concealer into your hard to reach areas such as the creases by your nose, or really close under your eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> For a little background on my wife, she has several years of cosmetics experience and was even certified by a big name in the industry (classroom and real-world training).</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are soft, and I experience zero to very little fallout.</li>
            <li> Usually you would expect that this price would be terrible but these are amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that these brushes have a little weight to them, you can tell they are quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that these brushes have a little weight to them, you can tell they are quality brushes.</li>
            <li> the brush heads a little tug to see if they popped off.</li>
            <li> , please click on the little help link at that bottom, so i know i am hitting what you need to hear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Precision Round Brush:</li>
            <li> being said, i open the box, game</li>
            <li> The pointed tip of the brush gets into the hard to reach areas of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they r thick and work well</li>
            <li> while i could be wrong</li>

            <li> I was very excited to try the USpicy Cosmetic Brushes. I never really used cosmetic brushes, except for blush, until my last visit with my 17 year old daughter. She wanted to do my makeup before we went out, so I let her. She uses cosmetic brushes for almost everything she applies and I could not believe how much better the make up looked on me. So I was ready to try them out myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The USpicy® Cosmetics Makeup Brushes come with 6 brushes, in a nicely packaged gift box, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about wrapping it, and it would make a great stocking stuffer as well. I loved the quality of the brushes, and they are just so attractive as well. I love products that are eye appealing as well as functional so these were perfect for me. I can&#x27;t believe how much better my make up looks when I use the USpicy® Cosmetics Makeup Brushes to apply it.  I highly recommend the USpicy® Cosmetics Makeup Brushes, they make a wonderful Christmas gift for a teenager, adult, and you can get one for yourself as well.  I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> Just received these brushed a week ago, and let me just say I&#x27;m very happy! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy em !</li>
            <li> As a licensed Esthetician and Makeup Artist, I am always looking for the next best makeup brush collection. The USpicy 10 Piece makeup brush collection does not disappoint! This collection is made of very high quality products and they apply makeup like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;The USpicy 10 Piece Makeup brush collection comes with 5 face brushes and 5 eye or concealer brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat Angled Brush: Great for applying foundation, or achieving a perfect contour.The angles of this brush make it fit the face beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tapered Brush: Applies liquid or cream foundations to the face. The pointed tip of the brush gets into the hard to reach areas of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Round Brush: Applies powder or mineral products to the skin. This is the perfect brush to get a flawless finish with powder foundation, or apply blush with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rounded Angled Brush: Applies blush or bronzer to the cheekbones perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision Angled Brush: Great at blending products into the crease of your eye. This brush would also be great at blending a contour down the sides of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision Round Brush: This brush is what I use to blend out my eyeshadows. It would also be good at blending a more dramatic contour into your cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision Flat Brush: Is great to stipple concealer on your problem areas. This blends the concealer under my eyes beautifully, and helps me do a cream highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision Flat Angled Brush: This brush will blend concealer into your hard to reach areas such as the creases by your nose, or really close under your eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision Tapered Brush: Blends out your lower lid eyeshadows nicely. This brush would also be great to add a more dramatic highlight to the tops of your cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the USpicy 10 Piece Makeup Brush Collection. These brushes are made of very high quality materials, the bristles are extremely soft and don&#x27;t shed at all. The ferrule is made of aluminum and the handle is made of wood. I appreciate the fact that these brushes have a little weight to them, you can tell they are quality brushes. I would recommend this collection to anyone!

            <li> USpicy sent me these brushes to test and review....but I do not wear makeup so asked my wife to give them a thorough testing! For a little background on my wife, she has several years of cosmetics experience and was even certified by a big name in the industry (classroom and real-world training). This to me says that she has the experience necessary to have an informed opinion on this type of product. She has used a particular brand of brush all these years due to her training as that brand had been the best for her skin and the most durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough about my wife, so what did she think about the brushes? Well to make it short, she cannot yet speak to the long term durability but she did state with confidence that they are every bit as good if not better than the brushes she has been using all these years. That says a lot in my opinion from someone with industry knowledge. Her initial thought with respect to the looks of these brushes was that they look really nice, and she liked the box they were presented in. As for use, the large brushes did a great job spreading liquid foundation as well as powder and all of the detail brushes performed very well. They were all smooth on the skin and even cleaned up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly update here if there is a long term durability issue, but as it stands these brushes come with a certified cosmetics person&#x27;s stamp of approval!! :D</li>
            <li> Being a guy i wear make-up occasionally once a year only and that is halloween. while i could be wrong i, I dont think that these are made for that, so i handed these to my wife to review. While she insist that she has taken no cosmetic training, I think that the hour and a half it takes to get ready to go somewhere, says otherwise. So if we add that time up she should be queen of all things perfume, makeup, and odd ways of twisting ones hair to postpone complaining about it, until exactly 1 hour after leaving the house! ;) I personally own a nice set of Purdy paint brushes that could really expedite our departure, but i digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These come in a nice storage box, that slides open. I thought that was neat.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, i open the box, game the brush heads a little tug to see if they popped off. They didn&#x27;t. Pass them to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it has only been a week she has made her way through some of them, and she says that to her they seem every bit as good as her expensive brushes. And she was glad to throw some of her older used ones away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i am getting this right, she says &amp;#34;The big ones spread the base layers well as they should, and the small ones flow smooth and feel good to the face, causing no clumps or blemishes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know she is relatively picky on her products, so to have 5 stars given on this is a great sign. Any issues that would happen to come up after more use i will update, but for now, they are great 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my reviews help you, please click on the little help link at that bottom, so i know i am hitting what you need to hear. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were provided to me as a sample for a fair and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the brush&#x27;s they thick and soft and it comes with a little book to tell which brush is used for what for a person that know nothing about brushes. I will order more thing from them if they going to be this great. I really like them. I am makeup artists and I use makeup daily and I need some good brushes.</li>
            <li> Came really fast, they are good quality, it works for me I&#x27;m starting to do my make up so they work for me I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Usually you would expect that this price would be terrible but these are amazing!!! I have a 48 dollar IT brush and these are almost as good. I still use these along with my expensice brush. Sooo soft and the bristles dont shed at all.</li>
            <li> Before you even get to the brushes, you see this nice purple/gold box with a picture of a bow on it. This instantly makes this item a great gift, especially if you aren&#x27;t looking for a gift that you&#x27;d have to wrap. The box is a drawer-style, so if you wanted to you could easily use this box to store either your brushes, or other little things. All in all, it&#x27;s just a very cool, well designed box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brushes -&lt;br /&gt;They are a lot higher quality than I was expecting for this price. There are ten brushes in total, and each one is very well made and feels like it would last a long time. These brushes are synthetic, which makes them a great option for people with allergies. The brushes are soft, and there isn&#x27;t really any shedding. A few strands came out when I washed them for the first time, but after that they were great. I&#x27;ve used these for both powder and liquid makeup, and they work very well with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel/look of these brushes even before using them is very good. These brushes are very well designed; with the gold writing on the black handle and simply the overall feel of them. They&#x27;re light, but not light enough that they feel cheap. They&#x27;re a great weight to make them feel nice to use without feeling like the brushes are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included instruction manual is also a very nice touch. This manual shows you what each brush&#x27;s intended purpose is, and exactly how to use them. If you are going from one brush to ten, this is a very nice guide to have and it&#x27;s nice that they included it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these brushes are very high quality, they&#x27;re a very good price, and they work very well. I can&#x27;t see having to replace these brushes anytime in the near future, and for this price range, there aren&#x27;t many brush sets that you can say that about.</li>
            <li> Two of the face brushes broke after opening the package. The brushes weren&#x27;t glued properly to the handles so they just popped off. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the rest of them though. They&#x27;re quite soft and dense and it applies my foundation perfectly, same thing goes for the smaller brushes. The handles are not too long and not too short, they&#x27;re very comfortable to handle which makes applying make up very easy.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:e2703f4436bff4784004fd36a4cf823b]] This product comes with 10 individually wrapped makeup brushes each with a different shape for different uses and makeup. The brushes come in a very nice gift box with an instruction manual which gives a picture and description of each type of brush (seen in the video). I gave the brushes as a gift to my sister. The brushes themselves seem very durable and she said they work well with the various types of makeup she uses. They make applying various types of makeup easy and the brush handles are strong and durable.The brush tips themselves are soft but also do not shed when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to be impressed by these brushes, BUT...several of the gold brush tips came unglued from the wooden handles immediately after taking the brushes out of the packaging and washing them. The brush bristles are soft, and I experience zero to very little fallout. These are clearly inexpensive brushes, but they do the job.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They really hold the powder/make-up. Soft but sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my order. These brushes are unbeliveably soft!!! Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I was wondering if the precision brushes can be use to apply eyeshadow?</li>
            <li> Loved my brushes will def buy more from this seller...they r thick and work well</li>
            <li> I have a few Mac brushes, but mostly real techniques brushes. These brushes are amazing. They feel so soft and barely any fallout (you will never not have fallout).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are such a high quality makeup brushes. Such a great value and lasted 3 washes so far with no issues.</li>
            <li> i loved these brushes! they are so soft, feel wonderful when you apply foundation!</li>
