            <li>BEST MENS SCENT I’VE SMELLED SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Love Love it! :)</li>
            <li>Desire begins with a distinctly citrus/floral aroma then mellows into a VERY nice vanilla/musk tone which lasts.</li>
            <li>Great price on the very large bottle.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice smell and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>I was very glad to find it again &amp; know its still available.</li>
            <li>this perfume is my favourite, i love this smell.</li>
            <li>He fell in love with Dunhill Desire but it wasn&#x27;t my fav at the time.</li>
            <li>I found this fragrance on Amazon for a much better deal and bought it for him for Valentines Day.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne</li>
            <li>For me the \\&quot;Desire\\&quot; is an all time favorite</li>
            <li>If you do get your hands on a bottle make sure it says Alfred Dunhill.</li>
            <li>It has always been my favorite on him and one of his favorites as well.  </li>
            <li>He gets so many compliments.</li>
            <li>i have been using this cologne for many year</li>
            <li>and i will wear it for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li>I simply love it..</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Stunning cologne.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>One of my son&#x27;s favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has got to be an all time favorite for me.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is authentic, I will buy from again</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Should be better in parfum, for more durability</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>This perfume I love time and again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unique, like all Dunhill scents, and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the best smelling colognes I have smelled in a long time.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances - not too strong and everyone always asks what are you wearing</li>
            <li>Thinking about buying it off amazon bc I need more but for so cheap</li>
            <li>It lasts, everyone likes how it smells, and, most importantly, I like how it smells.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the whole evening out.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get Alfred Dunhill Desire - the original one.</li>
            <li>The best is you don&#x27;t have to spray too much because it&#x27;s strong and last longer than most colognes.</li>
            <li>i bought a bottle based primarily on being so impressed with a previous Dunhill purchase.  </li>
            <li>shipping was was very quick and in the original package.</li>
            <li>2 days shipping on point and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The cologne I received was great, I only paid a fraction of what it costs at department stores.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this cologne for quite some time, it is a non offending scent that all seem to enjoy.</li>
            <li>The genuine product lasts for DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>trust me when i say fantastic buy.....</li>
            <li>The aroma is sweet and strong, but not over powering.</li>
            <li>Was in Macy&#x27;s trying out different perfumes, and found this to be very nice.</li>
            <li>They made some really nice stuff &#x27;back in the day&#x27; (like belts) and many years ago when I was smoker I had a strong preference for both Dunhill cigarettes and cigars.</li>
            <li>always wanted to try a fragrance Afred Dunhill and there I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and it arrived fast!</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to find it at a much lower price on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>As long as she&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li>Great perfume stay all day long for folks and their ladies who like woody essence.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly as I remember &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; plus my the ladies still love it..</li>
            <li>Except I ordered from Perfumania.com seller and I received \\&quot;Dunhill Desire\\&quot; and not the Original \\&quot;Alfred Dunhill Desire\\&quot; which is in the listing description.</li>
            <li>The smell on this cologne is unique.</li>
            <li>seems that you might have to be lucky whether you get the genuine one or not..</li>
            <li>This cologne isnt very musky like men&#x27;s aftershave type fragrances but rather is very sweet and feminine(could easily be a women&#x27;s perfume).  </li>
            <li>I bought this right away, after it came I quickly bust open the box and sprayed it on lol..</li>
            <li>This cologne is a real turn on, in fact my fiance has wore it many times and I cannot resist him when he wears it.  </li>
            <li>but I KNOW this product and have had dozens of legit bottles, as well as several ok to good fakes and absolutely know the difference.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m a fan of this cologne in general, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase from this company in particular.</li>
            <li>I also want to thank the seller for the honesty and for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>did a quick search and bam..</li>
            <li>The item came in the mail quickly, and it is just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>There is something about the smell that just makes me want him more than I would normally.  </li>
            <li>, you will smell so good all day long</li>
            <li>I was happy to purchase this cologne for my son because he finished his previous bottle.  </li>
            <li>Dunhill is the only item I use, because it&#x27;s funny to see the reaction from women when they come up to you to ask what you are wearing and it makes you feel good.</li>
            <li>This is the only cologne that I absolutely love on my husband!  </li>
            <li>The scent doesnt overpower plus the bottle looks nice, Grab yourself an extra bottle to keep in the car for when you&#x27;re on the move.</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells real strong, almost overpowering when first applied -- you don&#x27;t want to immediately walk into a public setting.</li>
            <li>This Eau De Toilette is most appropriate for those intimate encounters rather than public exposures.</li>
            <li>Unique,fresh and distinct although a bit on the sweeter side.</li>
            <li>Worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>He loved it, and says a bottle lasts him a whole year even using it daily</li>
            <li>Two of my favorites are Salvatore Ferragamo&#x27;s Acqua Essenziale for a &#x27;clean&#x27; scent and the newest Gaultier offering, Le Beau Male for something a bit more enchanted.</li>
            <li>price was right and no shipping charge made this purchase a deal.  </li>
            <li>shipping time was right on target</li>
            <li>and I right away checked out Amazon.......</li>
            <li>In this case, the price was right.</li>
            <li>it just says Dunhill Desire which is fine because the now its made by the P&amp;G group and which is why probably they sort of renamed it or they came out with a new packaging</li>
            <li>I recommend this for older men who want to smell youthful while attracting older women OR to teen boys who enjoy smelling more sweet like roses than musky like men&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I think its VERY strong and smells best lingering on your clothes than full force and freshly sprayed(in which its annoying like old church lady perfume).  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>this is the first time I bought it online</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to this one, absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>A definite must have in my household! :)</li>
            <li>The bottle which i got firstly doesnt say is Alfred Dunhill Desire</li>
            <li>The bottle which i got firstly doesnt say is Alfred Dunhill Desire</li>
            <li>The fragrance seems to be pretty close to the Desire my husband was using.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband as it is MY favorite scent on him and at such an affordable price!!  </li>
            <li>so I actually have more colognes and associated kit than I can count.</li>
            <li>Very good bootleg, but not the real deal.</li>
            <li>The package came a few days early, great service.</li>
            <li>My co-worker who happens to be a smoker told me the smell is so strong that he can even smell it when he smokes outside the building.</li>
            <li>My ex girlfriend was the manager of the perfume section of a large department store</li>
            <li>I owned the original and this one is like its half filled with water.</li>
            <li>really i like it</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS REAL THIS YEAR</li>
            <li>THE REAL BOTTLE WILL SAY DUNHILL DESIRE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE NOT DUNHILL LONDON</li>
            <li>FOR SENDING ME REAL BOTTLE</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>she said she really wanted it.</li>
            <li>It really turns me on</li>
            <li>It lasts for the whole day without changing its core scent.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a very subjective opinion.  </li>
            <li>The smell is much weaker.</li>
            <li>The price is so much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>But if you look at it, it looks real except for some people saying that a real one says Alfred Dunhill Desire instead of Dunhill Desire.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say about the product.</li>
            <li>and that was really something...</li>
            <li>Really like the fragrance -- not over-powering</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much of it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very distinctive.</li>
            <li>Amazon sold this &#x27;craftily&#x27; under the disguise of showing Alfred Dunhill on the image cover while the bottle that came was only Dunhill.</li>
            <li>Not too strong not soft.</li>
            <li>I had the original version of Desire back in 2001-2002</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just such a complex yet beautiful scent.</li>
            <li>This powerful smelling cologne generally turns people off when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>Came fast and new.</li>
            <li>(this is only my 3rd bottle in 10 years if that&#x27;s any indication but is my favorite).  </li>
            <li>what does this have to do with Dunhill Desire?&amp;#34; Well my friends, of all the many colognes I have and have had, the only one I&#x27;ve actually continued to buy for myself is this Dunhill.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>its strong enough to last but sweet enough to draw her closer...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like a legit version of the Dunhill Desire I normally wear.</li>
            <li>I found it and was able to have it delivered in a few days.  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance bought it for my boyfriend and he wears it everyday to go to work and aftera</li>
            <li>I had another almost full bottle left, so I used up the old bottle before opening the new one.</li>
            <li>Not that I am not going to buy Dunhill Desire in the future, however, I will unwrap the box right away.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to look for a new cologne or stick with this one.</li>
            <li>where I live this sells for over 50.00 bucks so, I just had to buy this.</li>
            <li>Turn over your bottle and look for the made in France it is not you have the new version.</li>
            <li>had a feeling that it&#x27;s gonna be a fake, but I loved the originalk version so much, so I desiced to take a risk</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving this scent since 1998, and although the smell is (almost) dead on, it only lasts for 30 minutes tops!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very masculine for my taste...</li>
            <li>This is not fake, unfortunately it is no longer from the French manufacturer so the sent is not the same.</li>
            <li>so much different than many other scents I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>Dunhill desire is an imitation of the originally designed version.</li>
            <li>my original impression of the cologne, upon first spray, was one of disappointment, but that quickly changed!  </li>
            <li>youthfully masculine and</li>
            <li>I should buy direct from Alfred dunhill?</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised and dissapointed and have no ideas why its the way it is.</li>
            <li>Ironically the picture shown here is of the old bottle.</li>
            <li>is the real deal, according to my boyfriend who has been religiously (only) using this product for over 5 years.</li>
            <li>My son got this for Xmas, I said wow</li>
            <li>You have to reapply it all the time, whereas a smaller bottle of the genuine product would take only one or two sprays to last for days, so</li>
            <li>Just here to say, if u own this cologne, keep it a secret.</li>
            <li>once I figured I was getting a good fake</li>
            <li>Desire used to be very long lasting  and strong but this time I think it is not up to that standard.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet and has a little bit of vanilla undertone.</li>
            <li>It runs the gamut from various &#x27;high end&#x27; offerings from the likes of Gaultier, Armani, Miyake and the like to your run of the mill</li>
            <li>The label at the bottom of the new bottle is somehow different from the old one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s DEFINITELY not as powerful or distinct as it should be.</li>
            <li>my little secret lol</li>
            <li>True the smell is overpowering initially but give it some time to settle down.</li>
            <li>AT ALL BARELY</li>
            <li>it last long my whole day even next day morning</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first time i feel dissapointed with Amazon since the last 10 odd years</li>
            <li>Soft and not over powering smell, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Smells great,very masculine and it lasts a long time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> BEST MENS SCENT I’VE SMELLED SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Love Love it! :)</li>
            <li> Desire begins with a distinctly citrus/floral aroma then mellows into a VERY nice vanilla/musk tone which lasts.</li>
            <li> Great price on the very large bottle.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice smell and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> I was very glad to find it again &amp; know its still available.</li>
            <li> this perfume is my favourite, i love this smell.</li>
            <li> He fell in love with Dunhill Desire but it wasn&#x27;t my fav at the time.</li>
            <li> I found this fragrance on Amazon for a much better deal and bought it for him for Valentines Day.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne</li>
            <li> For me the \\&quot;Desire\\&quot; is an all time favorite</li>
            <li> If you do get your hands on a bottle make sure it says Alfred Dunhill.</li>
            <li> It has always been my favorite on him and one of his favorites as well.  </li>
            <li> He gets so many compliments.</li>
            <li> i have been using this cologne for many year</li>
            <li> and i will wear it for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li> I simply love it..</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Stunning cologne.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> One of my son&#x27;s favorite scents.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has got to be an all time favorite for me.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is authentic, I will buy from again</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Should be better in parfum, for more durability</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> This perfume I love time and again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unique, like all Dunhill scents, and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best smelling colognes I have smelled in a long time.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances - not too strong and everyone always asks what are you wearing</li>
            <li> Thinking about buying it off amazon bc I need more but for so cheap</li>
            <li> It lasts, everyone likes how it smells, and, most importantly, I like how it smells.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good for the whole evening out.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you get Alfred Dunhill Desire - the original one.</li>
            <li> The best is you don&#x27;t have to spray too much because it&#x27;s strong and last longer than most colognes.</li>
            <li> i bought a bottle based primarily on being so impressed with a previous Dunhill purchase.  </li>
            <li> shipping was was very quick and in the original package.</li>
            <li> 2 days shipping on point and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The cologne I received was great, I only paid a fraction of what it costs at department stores.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for quite some time, it is a non offending scent that all seem to enjoy.</li>
            <li> The genuine product lasts for DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> trust me when i say fantastic buy.....</li>
            <li> The aroma is sweet and strong, but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Was in Macy&#x27;s trying out different perfumes, and found this to be very nice.</li>
            <li> They made some really nice stuff &#x27;back in the day&#x27; (like belts) and many years ago when I was smoker I had a strong preference for both Dunhill cigarettes and cigars.</li>
            <li> always wanted to try a fragrance Afred Dunhill and there I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and it arrived fast!</li>
            <li> so I was pleased to find it at a much lower price on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> As long as she&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li> Great perfume stay all day long for folks and their ladies who like woody essence.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly as I remember &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; plus my the ladies still love it..</li>
            <li> Except I ordered from Perfumania.com seller and I received \\&quot;Dunhill Desire\\&quot; and not the Original \\&quot;Alfred Dunhill Desire\\&quot; which is in the listing description.</li>
            <li> The smell on this cologne is unique.</li>
            <li> seems that you might have to be lucky whether you get the genuine one or not..</li>
            <li> This cologne isnt very musky like men&#x27;s aftershave type fragrances but rather is very sweet and feminine(could easily be a women&#x27;s perfume).  </li>
            <li> I bought this right away, after it came I quickly bust open the box and sprayed it on lol..</li>
            <li> This cologne is a real turn on, in fact my fiance has wore it many times and I cannot resist him when he wears it.  </li>
            <li> but I KNOW this product and have had dozens of legit bottles, as well as several ok to good fakes and absolutely know the difference.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a fan of this cologne in general, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase from this company in particular.</li>
            <li> I also want to thank the seller for the honesty and for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> did a quick search and bam..</li>
            <li> The item came in the mail quickly, and it is just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> There is something about the smell that just makes me want him more than I would normally.  </li>
            <li> , you will smell so good all day long</li>
            <li> I was happy to purchase this cologne for my son because he finished his previous bottle.  </li>
            <li> Dunhill is the only item I use, because it&#x27;s funny to see the reaction from women when they come up to you to ask what you are wearing and it makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne that I absolutely love on my husband!  </li>
            <li> The scent doesnt overpower plus the bottle looks nice, Grab yourself an extra bottle to keep in the car for when you&#x27;re on the move.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells real strong, almost overpowering when first applied -- you don&#x27;t want to immediately walk into a public setting.</li>
            <li> This Eau De Toilette is most appropriate for those intimate encounters rather than public exposures.</li>
            <li> Unique,fresh and distinct although a bit on the sweeter side.</li>
            <li> Worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> He loved it, and says a bottle lasts him a whole year even using it daily</li>
            <li> Two of my favorites are Salvatore Ferragamo&#x27;s Acqua Essenziale for a &#x27;clean&#x27; scent and the newest Gaultier offering, Le Beau Male for something a bit more enchanted.</li>
            <li> price was right and no shipping charge made this purchase a deal.  </li>
            <li> shipping time was right on target</li>
            <li> and I right away checked out Amazon.......</li>
            <li> In this case, the price was right.</li>
            <li> it just says Dunhill Desire which is fine because the now its made by the P&amp;G group and which is why probably they sort of renamed it or they came out with a new packaging</li>
            <li> I recommend this for older men who want to smell youthful while attracting older women OR to teen boys who enjoy smelling more sweet like roses than musky like men&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I think its VERY strong and smells best lingering on your clothes than full force and freshly sprayed(in which its annoying like old church lady perfume).  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> this is the first time I bought it online</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to this one, absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> A definite must have in my household! :)</li>
            <li> The bottle which i got firstly doesnt say is Alfred Dunhill Desire</li>
            <li> The bottle which i got firstly doesnt say is Alfred Dunhill Desire</li>
            <li> The fragrance seems to be pretty close to the Desire my husband was using.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as it is MY favorite scent on him and at such an affordable price!!  </li>
            <li> so I actually have more colognes and associated kit than I can count.</li>
            <li> Very good bootleg, but not the real deal.</li>
            <li> The package came a few days early, great service.</li>
            <li> My co-worker who happens to be a smoker told me the smell is so strong that he can even smell it when he smokes outside the building.</li>
            <li> My ex girlfriend was the manager of the perfume section of a large department store</li>
            <li> I owned the original and this one is like its half filled with water.</li>
            <li> really i like it</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS REAL THIS YEAR</li>
            <li> THE REAL BOTTLE WILL SAY DUNHILL DESIRE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE NOT DUNHILL LONDON</li>
            <li> FOR SENDING ME REAL BOTTLE</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> she said she really wanted it.</li>
            <li> It really turns me on</li>
            <li> It lasts for the whole day without changing its core scent.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a very subjective opinion.  </li>
            <li> The smell is much weaker.</li>
            <li> The price is so much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> But if you look at it, it looks real except for some people saying that a real one says Alfred Dunhill Desire instead of Dunhill Desire.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about the product.</li>
            <li> and that was really something...</li>
            <li> Really like the fragrance -- not over-powering</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use much of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very distinctive.</li>
            <li> Amazon sold this &#x27;craftily&#x27; under the disguise of showing Alfred Dunhill on the image cover while the bottle that came was only Dunhill.</li>
            <li> Not too strong not soft.</li>
            <li> I had the original version of Desire back in 2001-2002</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just such a complex yet beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> This powerful smelling cologne generally turns people off when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> Came fast and new.</li>
            <li> (this is only my 3rd bottle in 10 years if that&#x27;s any indication but is my favorite).  </li>
            <li> what does this have to do with Dunhill Desire?&amp;#34; Well my friends, of all the many colognes I have and have had, the only one I&#x27;ve actually continued to buy for myself is this Dunhill.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> its strong enough to last but sweet enough to draw her closer...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like a legit version of the Dunhill Desire I normally wear.</li>
            <li> I found it and was able to have it delivered in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Love this fragrance bought it for my boyfriend and he wears it everyday to go to work and aftera</li>
            <li> I had another almost full bottle left, so I used up the old bottle before opening the new one.</li>
            <li> Not that I am not going to buy Dunhill Desire in the future, however, I will unwrap the box right away.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to look for a new cologne or stick with this one.</li>
            <li> where I live this sells for over 50.00 bucks so, I just had to buy this.</li>
            <li> Turn over your bottle and look for the made in France it is not you have the new version.</li>
            <li> had a feeling that it&#x27;s gonna be a fake, but I loved the originalk version so much, so I desiced to take a risk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this scent since 1998, and although the smell is (almost) dead on, it only lasts for 30 minutes tops!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very masculine for my taste...</li>
            <li> This is not fake, unfortunately it is no longer from the French manufacturer so the sent is not the same.</li>
            <li> so much different than many other scents I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Dunhill desire is an imitation of the originally designed version.</li>
            <li> my original impression of the cologne, upon first spray, was one of disappointment, but that quickly changed!  </li>
            <li> youthfully masculine and</li>
            <li> I should buy direct from Alfred dunhill?</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised and dissapointed and have no ideas why its the way it is.</li>
            <li> Ironically the picture shown here is of the old bottle.</li>
            <li> is the real deal, according to my boyfriend who has been religiously (only) using this product for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> My son got this for Xmas, I said wow</li>
            <li> You have to reapply it all the time, whereas a smaller bottle of the genuine product would take only one or two sprays to last for days, so</li>
            <li> Just here to say, if u own this cologne, keep it a secret.</li>
            <li> once I figured I was getting a good fake</li>
            <li> Desire used to be very long lasting  and strong but this time I think it is not up to that standard.</li>
            <li> It smells sweet and has a little bit of vanilla undertone.</li>
            <li> It runs the gamut from various &#x27;high end&#x27; offerings from the likes of Gaultier, Armani, Miyake and the like to your run of the mill</li>
            <li> The label at the bottom of the new bottle is somehow different from the old one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s DEFINITELY not as powerful or distinct as it should be.</li>
            <li> my little secret lol</li>
            <li> True the smell is overpowering initially but give it some time to settle down.</li>
            <li> AT ALL BARELY</li>
            <li> it last long my whole day even next day morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first time i feel dissapointed with Amazon since the last 10 odd years</li>
            <li> Soft and not over powering smell, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells great,very masculine and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Does not last as long as the blue one.</li>
            <li> long lasting and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> The original has &#x27;Alfred Dunhill Desire&#x27; written on the red box and the fake one has only &#x27;Dunhill Desire&#x27; on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE PREVIOUS BOTTLE  MY HUSBAND HAD WAS MANUFACTURED IN France, so I was surprised to see that the one I purchased through Amazon was manufactured in the USA.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is one third empty.</li>
            <li> long day hr comes home smelling like he just sprayed it on in the morning</li>
            <li> I received it almost on time and the scent of the cologne lasts as long as I like.</li>
            <li> it does&#x27;t go away like other do during an entire day of activities.</li>
            <li> fun)...I personally use this cologne on weekends when I only plan on going to a few stores or working out.  </li>
            <li> The price makes it that much better, being it&#x27;s less expensive than other brand name colognes.</li>
            <li> This cologne is DEFINITELY a watered down version of what it should be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no Anglophile by any stretch, but for some reason I do quite oddly find myself attracted to British style time to time.</li>
            <li> Fake, the smell makes me dizzy , it&#x27;s not the real DESIRE RED.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good only for killing a laundry scent or spray in the bathroom to kill nasty smelling bacterias.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have no issues with it wearing off too soon like some of the other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> so please do not generalize with other products sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, THIS IS A FAKE DUNHILL DESIRE.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT STRONG</li>
            <li> This will be the last time I buy a colgne from amazon because 2 times I bought colgne from Amazon and they were both FAKE</li>
            <li> Fake , doesnt smell the same as the origina which I have to compare.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in late May 2013</li>
            <li> but I opened it in late October.</li>
            <li> For me at least.</li>
            <li> It seems weird to smell this on all other age groups(including myself...</li>
            <li> but i noticed that the strength of the fragrance was weak infact very weak compared to the previous bottle that i had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m scared it&#x27;s a bootleg xD</li>
            <li> this is so frustrating and dissapointing.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it for about 20 years, and never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> Very weak and smells like the air when passing by Macy&#x27;s perfume and cologne department</li>
            <li> and I feel weird as the smell doesnt match my style</li>
            <li> A FAKE BOTTLE</li>
            <li> The fake stuff, didn&#x27;t know I could get scammed like this.</li>
            <li> It is fake indeed and the ones you find at a store are fake as well.</li>
            <li> I was worried after purchasing this product that this may be the fake one (from reading the reviews).&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with Dunhill Desire, the aroma and stability very weak</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I bought fake one !</li>
            <li> and.... boom, I got a bloody fake.</li>
            <li> but i was disappointed with what i bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in that respect.  </li>
            <li> &quot; - it&#x27;s a crap.</li>
            <li> THEN I ORDER AGAIN AND SENDING FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> This IS A FAKE!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I was disappointed with Dunhill Desire, the aroma and stability very weak&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I bought fake one !</li>
            <li> Just here to say, if u own this cologne, keep it a secret. I have been followed out of places, like a classroom, by men and women to ask me what I&#x27;m wearing lol. Thinking about buying it off amazon bc I need more but for so cheap I&#x27;m scared it&#x27;s a bootleg xD</li>
            <li> Fake, the smell makes me dizzy , it&#x27;s not the real DESIRE RED. This will be the last time I buy a colgne from amazon because 2 times I bought colgne from Amazon and they were both FAKE</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances - not too strong and everyone always asks what are you wearing</li>
            <li> Excellente product, very nice vanilla..</li>
            <li> This is my nighttime cologne. I use X-Centric by Dunhill during daytime excursions. This has a scent that grabs you. It&#x27;s very unique, like all Dunhill scents, and I just love it. My daughter LOVES when I wear it, and ladies want to get closer to me when they smell me. It&#x27;s just good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great scent, great price, great gift!</li>
            <li> This powerful smelling cologne generally turns people off when I wear it.  My co-worker who happens to be a smoker told me the smell is so strong that he can even smell it when he smokes outside the building. From deduction, it must be a colonge for smokers only.</li>
            <li> always wanted to try a fragrance Afred Dunhill and there I was not disappointed at all. I am very happy. I recommend this perfume  Fritz</li>
            <li> Was in Macy&#x27;s trying out different perfumes, and found this to be very nice. Just sent one today via [...] to my friend all the way in Dubai!</li>
            <li> This cologne isnt very musky like men&#x27;s aftershave type fragrances but rather is very sweet and feminine(could easily be a women&#x27;s perfume).  I think its VERY strong and smells best lingering on your clothes than full force and freshly sprayed(in which its annoying like old church lady perfume).  Women tend to like this smell but not in the way men want women to like it(older women like it alot).  Like I said, lingering on the clothes it smells a bit different(more youthfully masculine and fun)...I personally use this cologne on weekends when I only plan on going to a few stores or working out.  I dont regret buying it...it was fairly inexpensive and they give you ALOT.  I recommend this for older men who want to smell youthful while attracting older women OR to teen boys who enjoy smelling more sweet like roses than musky like men&#x27;s aftershave.  It seems weird to smell this on all other age groups(including myself...im 25 and I feel weird as the smell doesnt match my style but oh well, weird is ok sometimes).</li>
            <li> this perfume is my favourite, i love this smell.This product is original!!  I also want to thank the seller for the honesty and for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and it arrived fast!</li>
            <li> This Fragnance is awesome. it last long my whole day even next day morning if i wear sameshirt i get smell from the shirt. really i like it</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband he loves it😍😍😍😍😍😍😍</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I were at the mall and I asked him to pick something out he liked from a pricy perfume specialty store. He fell in love with Dunhill Desire but it wasn&#x27;t my fav at the time. I found this fragrance on Amazon for a much better deal and bought it for him for Valentines Day. I will say it smells AMAZING on him! Love Love it! :) Don&#x27;t prejudge it. Let it absorb into your fella&#x27;s skin. Yum! ;)</li>
            <li> bought this item for my grown son. price was right and no shipping charge made this purchase a deal.  shipping time was right on target and i received a coupon for 15% off next purchase from perfume store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne since 2005, everyone always asks what it is.  It&#x27;s the perfect smell for any man who wants to stand out, wonderful conversation starter lol.</li>
            <li> This cologne is DEFINITELY a watered down version of what it should be. I&#x27;ve been wearing this product for years and this is the first time I bought it online and it&#x27;s DEFINITELY not as powerful or distinct as it should be. I spray it on and within a minute it&#x27;s as if I never sprayed myself with it. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a legit version of the Dunhill Desire I normally wear.</li>
            <li> This IS A FAKE!!!!!!!!! I HAVE WORN THIS FOR 7 YEARS NOW AND LAST YEAR I ORDERD AND IT WAS REAL THIS YEAR THEY SENT ME A FAKE BOTTLE THE REAL BOTTLE WILL SAY DUNHILL DESIRE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE NOT DUNHILL LONDON ON THE FRONT!!!!!SHAME ON YOU FOR SENDING ME REAL BOTTLE THEN I ORDER AGAIN AND SENDING FAKE!!! THIS IS NOT STRONG AT ALL BARELY LAST A HOUR!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> great stuff, its my girlfriends favorite!! its strong enough to last but sweet enough to draw her closer...</li>
            <li> Ive been using this since 2006, girls routinely tell me i smell good.The scent doesnt overpower plus the bottle looks nice, Grab yourself an extra bottle to keep in the car for when you&#x27;re on the move. 5 stars</li>
            <li> I was happy to purchase this cologne for my son because he finished his previous bottle.  He discovered and purchased this cologne at a fancy mall counter, so I was pleased to find it at a much lower price on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I really love it. The size, the smell, the color is so good. I buy this for a gift to my husband and he said waoo is excellent.</li>
            <li> Desire used to be very long lasting  and strong but this time I think it is not up to that standard. I have no idea, may be I should buy direct from Alfred dunhill?</li>
            <li> i just recieve this perfume and also 6 more i was so happy about it box looked great bottle also but at the time that i tried na na!!! smells like water with alcohol! this is so frustrating and dissapointing.</li>
            <li> Great, I love it, caint get it here anymore. I was very glad to find it again &amp; know its still available. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a real turn on, in fact my fiance has wore it many times and I cannot resist him when he wears it.  There is something about the smell that just makes me want him more than I would normally.  I think this is one of the best smelling colognes I have smelled in a long time.  Nothing compares to this one, absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> This has gotten me laid so many times!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister she said she really wanted it. I gave it to her &amp; she&#x27;s very pleased with it. I personally don&#x27;t like the smell. As long as she&#x27;s happy that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne that I absolutely love on my husband!  It really turns me on and I just can&#x27;t get enough of him when he&#x27;s wearing it!!!  When he runs out and buys another in the meantime, it just isn&#x27;t the same.  A definite must have in my household! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff will never go out of style like some colognes. It was never a fad and just has a great high-end scent. It lasts for the whole day without changing its core scent.</li>
            <li> i read several, admittedly mixed, reviews about this scent and made several unsuccessful attempts at finding a \\&quot;brick and mortar\\&quot; store with a tester.  i bought a bottle based primarily on being so impressed with a previous Dunhill purchase.  my original impression of the cologne, upon first spray, was one of disappointment, but that quickly changed!  Desire begins with a distinctly citrus/floral aroma then mellows into a VERY nice vanilla/musk tone which lasts. (10+ hours)  i will DEFINITELY purchase this cologne again!</li>
            <li> The fake stuff, didn&#x27;t know I could get scammed like this. I owned the original and this one is like its half filled with water.</li>
            <li> 2 days shipping on point and the smell is fantastic. Not too strong not soft. Perfect for day and evening! You won&#x27;t get better for this price!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne it does&#x27;t go away like other do during an entire day of activities. 5 Starts Great</li>
            <li> Fake , doesnt smell the same as the origina which I have to compare.</li>
            <li> People this is as good as it gets. It is fake indeed and the ones you find at a store are fake as well. The scent isn&#x27;t the same and the duration isn&#x27;t the same but it&#x27;s similar. You&#x27;ll have to look for a new cologne or stick with this one.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells real strong, almost overpowering when first applied -- you don&#x27;t want to immediately walk into a public setting. It smells wonderful after an airing. Really a great scent at this point. However, it&#x27;s lifespan is relatively short. I am disapointed, in that, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger longer. This Eau De Toilette is most appropriate for those intimate encounters rather than public exposures.</li>
            <li> The bottle which i got firstly doesnt say is Alfred Dunhill Desire it just says Dunhill Desire. the fragrance does not last longer.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my future husband... each time i smell it on him... i wanna jump on him.  It&#x27;s very masculine for my taste... but that&#x27;s a very subjective opinion.  I do recommend!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my son he likes the cologne it was packed great.</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear this cologne....both men and women compliment me on the nice and attractive smell and where I found it... my little secret lol</li>
            <li> I bought this product in late May 2013 but I opened it in late October. I had another almost full bottle left, so I used up the old bottle before opening the new one. Well I opened it today. I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw. The bottle is one third empty. The smell is much weaker. In fact it doesn&#x27;t even come close to what I had before. The label at the bottom of the new bottle is somehow different from the old one. To make a long story short, THIS IS A FAKE DUNHILL DESIRE. Next time I am going to open the package as son as I receive it. I should mention that the package was in tact with the cellophane paper wrapping. Not that I am not going to buy Dunhill Desire in the future, however, I will unwrap the box right away.</li>
            <li> My son loved it!  Thx!</li>
            <li> The bottle opens like flask. It smells sweet and has a little bit of vanilla undertone. A little goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Unique,fresh and distinct although a bit on the sweeter side. True the smell is overpowering initially but give it some time to settle down.For me the \\&quot;Desire\\&quot; is an all time favorite but i was disappointed with what i bought from Amazon. The bottle which i got firstly doesnt say is Alfred Dunhill Desire it just says Dunhill Desire which is fine because the now its made by the P&amp;G group and which is why probably they sort of renamed it or they came out with a new packaging but i noticed that the strength of the fragrance was weak infact very weak compared to the previous bottle that i had. I was a bit surprised and dissapointed and have no ideas why its the way it is.Ironically the picture shown here is of the old bottle.If you do get your hands on a bottle make sure it says Alfred Dunhill.</li>
            <li> Good summer scent. The best is you don&#x27;t have to spray too much because it&#x27;s strong and last longer than most colognes.</li>
            <li> How do I know this is a knock off, I have tried this scent from around the world but this one only lasts for five minutes and than it fades.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume I&#x27;ve been wearing for years! shipping was was very quick and in the original package. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My husband was thrilled to receive this again this year.  It has always been my favorite on him and one of his favorites as well.  Extremely quick shipping, great packaging.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my Fiance. He loves it and so do I. He gets so many compliments. This is the second bottle that I have bought from Amazon. The price is so much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for always staying competitive!</li>
            <li> This smells like the cheapest cologne you can get. Very weak and smells like the air when passing by Macy&#x27;s perfume and cologne department what ever you call that place. I&#x27;m guessing, there is a cartel somewhere in the world that produce knockoffs like this one. But if you look at it, it looks real except for some people saying that a real one says Alfred Dunhill Desire instead of Dunhill Desire. Whatever, never again will I buy colognes from any seller here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great product and seller</li>
            <li> i have been using this cologne for many year and i recommend  for all people to try , you will smell so good all day long</li>
            <li> i simply love this its the best ever and i will wear it for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my husband!</li>
            <li> Have been using this perfume for almost 10 years now...I simply love it..and so do girls around me..a must have</li>
            <li> Not bad but the fragrance is lighter than what it used to be. My fav.</li>
            <li> THE PREVIOUS BOTTLE  MY HUSBAND HAD WAS MANUFACTURED IN France, so I was surprised to see that the one I purchased through Amazon was manufactured in the USA.  I was disappointed in that respect.  The fragrance seems to be pretty close to the Desire my husband was using.</li>
            <li> Bought this after I complemented an employee at a hospital..Soft and not over powering smell, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Really good... Love the smell. Always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> The Best..... Believe me... fan of this 1 since last 4 years....</li>
            <li> Great price on the very large bottle.</li>
            <li> this made a great gift. its cheaper then at the stores and it smells great. will be buying future orders from here.</li>
            <li> What can I say, another great smelling toilette spray for men. Dunhill is the only item I use, because it&#x27;s funny to see the reaction from women when they come up to you to ask what you are wearing and it makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dunhill Desire for years. Best Men&#x27;s cologne on the market. Amazon sells it a great price. Accept no substitutes!</li>
            <li> would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great perfume stay all day long for folks and their ladies who like woody essence.</li>
            <li> I remember my mom buying this brand for me when I was in middle school and I loved the smell plus so did the girls.. After reminiscing about my childhood I remembered this cologne so I got on Amazon did a quick search and bam.. There it is.. I bought this right away, after it came I quickly bust open the box and sprayed it on lol.. It smells exactly as I remember &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; plus my the ladies still love it.. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> The cologne I received was great, I only paid a fraction of what it costs at department stores. The package came a few days early, great service.</li>
            <li> where I live this sells for over 50.00 bucks so, I just had to buy this. I really like this and I get lots of compliments on the fragrance awesome deal I think..</li>
            <li> My most favorite and the best one.</li>
            <li> I was worried after purchasing this product that this may be the fake one (from reading the reviews).&lt;br /&gt;It seems that you might have to be lucky whether you get the genuine one or not..&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal, according to my boyfriend who has been religiously (only) using this product for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for any male, any time, and any where. Definitely a keeper had it for years now!</li>
            <li> Girls, if u want your man to smell great ?? Get this cologne. My son got this for Xmas, I said wow u smell good . What is it ? He told me and I right away checked out Amazon....... and there it was. Very good price. Worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I have been wearing it for about 20 years, and never get tired of it. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I think this is the third bottle I&#x27;ve bought as a gift for my Dad. He just loves it. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about the product. Except I ordered from Perfumania.com seller and I received \\&quot;Dunhill Desire\\&quot; and not the Original \\&quot;Alfred Dunhill Desire\\&quot; which is in the listing description. Dunhill desire is an imitation of the originally designed version. I had it before, bought it for $15 on Canal St. and it&#x27;s good only for killing a laundry scent or spray in the bathroom to kill nasty smelling bacterias. I had the original version of Desire back in 2001-2002 and that was really something... Stunning cologne. When I saw the image I kinda had a feeling that it&#x27;s gonna be a fake, but I loved the originalk version so much, so I desiced to take a risk and.... boom, I got a bloody fake. Do not buy \\&quot;Dunhill Desire\\&quot; - it&#x27;s a crap. Make sure you get Alfred Dunhill Desire - the original one.</li>
            <li> Really like the fragrance -- not over-powering</li>
            <li> Smells great,very masculine and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrance. I gifted it to my husband and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff .i have use this for quite some time now .. I like the perfume , I&#x27;ve ordered it a couple of times now</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne. Came fast and new.</li>
            <li> The item came in the mail quickly, and it is just what I wanted.  No problems here at all.  This is the best way to shop.  No hassles.</li>
            <li> The smell on this cologne is unique. I get lots of compliments when I wear it. Love this cologne!!</li>
            <li> A client of mine had been looking for this discontinued scent for sometime.  I found it and was able to have it delivered in a few days.  Talk about HAPPY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for quite some time, it is a non offending scent that all seem to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I heard they discontinued this sku.  Can anybody confirm?  One of my fav scents, haven&#x27;t found them in stores recently.</li>
            <li> My wife got this for me and I receive compliments on it all the time. The aroma is sweet and strong, but not over powering. The price makes it that much better, being it&#x27;s less expensive than other brand name colognes. I&#x27;m going to try the other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and service</li>
            <li> awesome,spectacular smelling!!!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance bought it for my boyfriend and he wears it everyday to go to work and aftera long day hr comes home smelling like he just sprayed it on in the morning</li>
            <li> My husband loves his cologne. Desire by Alfred Dunhill for Men Eau De Toilette spray is one of his favorites.</li>
            <li> My summer scent! Excellent purchase!</li>
            <li> Brought this for my son-in law for Christmas and he loved it. It has a very nice smell and the price was right.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for about 10 years now.  It works well with my body chemistry.  I don&#x27;t need to use much of it (this is only my 3rd bottle in 10 years if that&#x27;s any indication but is my favorite).  For me, the tiniest of spritz and I&#x27;m good for the whole evening out.  It lasts, everyone likes how it smells, and, most importantly, I like how it smells.  I have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> One of my son&#x27;s favorite scents.  He was happy, so I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;I check with Amazon to compare prices.  In this case, the price was right.</li>
            <li> The product have been discontinued from the store and the fact that i found it here was awesome ! !</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as it is MY favorite scent on him and at such an affordable price!!  I will definitely by again!</li>
            <li> My ex girlfriend was the manager of the perfume section of a large department store so I actually have more colognes and associated kit than I can count. I literally have nearly 30 different bottles of cologne and that doesn&#x27;t include the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used up or given away. It runs the gamut from various &#x27;high end&#x27; offerings from the likes of Gaultier, Armani, Miyake and the like to your run of the mill (&#x27;lower end&#x27;) CK, Claiborne Nautica, etc types. Two of my favorites are Salvatore Ferragamo&#x27;s Acqua Essenziale for a &#x27;clean&#x27; scent and the newest Gaultier offering, Le Beau Male for something a bit more enchanted. You&#x27;re probably thinking, &amp;#34;that&#x27;s great and all, but what does this have to do with Dunhill Desire?&amp;#34; Well my friends, of all the many colognes I have and have had, the only one I&#x27;ve actually continued to buy for myself is this Dunhill. This stuff has got to be an all time favorite for me. It&#x27;s just such a complex yet beautiful scent. I love it. It&#x27;s very distinctive. I&#x27;m no Anglophile by any stretch, but for some reason I do quite oddly find myself attracted to British style time to time. And Dunhill happens to be a brand I have known and loved for quite some time.. They made some really nice stuff &#x27;back in the day&#x27; (like belts) and many years ago when I was smoker I had a strong preference for both Dunhill cigarettes and cigars. They were the best smokes. ever. Just like this scent is the best ever. For me at least.</li>
            <li> i smell great! long lasting and not overbearing. There is no difference from the bottle I bought from a box store as some reviewers have said. It is authentic, I will buy from again</li>
            <li> BEST MENS SCENT I’VE SMELLED SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Desire by Dunhill. The scent of this cologne is awesome. It&#x27;s distinctive but not overpowering.  Love it and it&#x27;s a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great buy. I have no issues with it wearing off too soon like some of the other reviews stated. I&#x27;m definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very good bootleg, but not the real deal. I&#x27;ve been loving this scent since 1998, and although the smell is (almost) dead on, it only lasts for 30 minutes tops! The genuine product lasts for DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose at this price for the 3.4 once I figured I was getting a good fake and that&#x27;s what I got. You have to reapply it all the time, whereas a smaller bottle of the genuine product would take only one or two sprays to last for days, so it about equals out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say what you will, but I KNOW this product and have had dozens of legit bottles, as well as several ok to good fakes and absolutely know the difference.</li>
            <li> Should be better in parfum, for more durability</li>
            <li> nice fragrance,most women seem to like it !!</li>
            <li> Smells great all the ladies love it..... trust me when i say fantastic buy..... gonna definitely buy again</li>
            <li> muy buen producto llegó sin problemas y sin defectos, el empaque fue apropiado y no tenia problemas visibles, en lo personal lo recomiento 100%</li>
            <li> A Christmas gift for my dear brother. He loved it, and says a bottle lasts him a whole year even using it daily</li>
            <li> This is not fake, unfortunately it is no longer from the French manufacturer so the sent is not the same. Turn over your bottle and look for the made in France it is not you have the new version.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. so much different than many other scents I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I never repeat any perfume that i purchased before, the only exception being Alfred Dunhill Desire. This perfume I love time and again. Amazon sold this &#x27;craftily&#x27; under the disguise of showing Alfred Dunhill on the image cover while the bottle that came was only Dunhill. So if you want this super perfume which will give you great compliments any season then visit your favourite store and buy it. The original has &#x27;Alfred Dunhill Desire&#x27; written on the red box and the fake one has only &#x27;Dunhill Desire&#x27; on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time i feel dissapointed with Amazon since the last 10 odd years so please do not generalize with other products sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Woman&#x27;s perfume? Smells like it.</li>
            <li> gift for son who loves it!</li>
            <li> Received on time and a good price.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a fan of this cologne in general, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase from this company in particular. I received it almost on time and the scent of the cologne lasts as long as I like.</li>
            <li> Does not last as long as the blue one. It had to be applied multiple times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very good. Has a lightness I desire</li>
