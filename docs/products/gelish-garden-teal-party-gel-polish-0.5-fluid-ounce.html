            <li>The coverage is good, two coats</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>but it really is nice.  </li>
            <li>Really beautiful with Grand Jewel on top or Water Field (my two favorite glitter polishes).</li>
            <li>It is a true creamy teal color with great coverage in just two coats.  </li>
            <li>and I love putting that over the top of this one!</li>
            <li>Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li>Love love love this color!</li>
            <li>Love this color</li>
            <li>I am in love with this color.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Gelish polish.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was a bit more aqua</li>
            <li>I love this color...</li>
            <li>I love this teal color.</li>
            <li>tone and I really think this would be good in the fall as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and striking.</li>
            <li>but the color is a true teal</li>
            <li>This color is very pretty on and probably a new favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and solid so it takes like 2 coats.  </li>
            <li>This looks exactly like the label.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great teal, but NOT bright.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really complain when it&#x27;s in the name.  </li>
            <li>It wore really well (2 weeks)</li>
            <li>I had some doubts because the pic does not show the real colors some times...</li>
            <li>It goes in nice &amp; solid too so 2 coats is enough.</li>
            <li>It was necessary for me to quickly paint one nail and cure immediately.</li>
            <li>When I opened it it leaked all over my hands and counter top and in having a hard time getting it off.</li>
            <li>It seems like it would be a wild color to wear on your nails</li>
            <li>After retrying several times, I just took it off and got a new color.</li>
            <li>and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>

            <li> This color is great! It&#x27;s nice and solid so it takes like 2 coats.  I also have the oocha coocha...really long named gelish color (it&#x27;s a teal glitter) and I love putting that over the top of this one! So gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Item just as described, no surprises.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage.  I always receive compliments on this color. It is a true creamy teal color with great coverage in just two coats.  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> Love this color it&#x27;s great .</li>
            <li> Love love love this color! I get compliments every time I wear it. It goes in nice &amp; solid too so 2 coats is enough.</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this color.  Check out all swatches on the chickettes website if you want to see the actual color as it is much different than it appears.  It seems like it would be a wild color to wear on your nails but it really is nice.  Came quickly, no issues.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it came in the mail today. When I opened it it leaked all over my hands and counter top and in having a hard time getting it off. Wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty on and probably a new favorite.  I like to pair this polish with an accent nail of sheek white gelish topped with candy shop gelish trends collection.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Gelish polish. I was hoping this was a bit more aqua but the color is a true teal so you can&#x27;t really complain when it&#x27;s in the name.  I&#x27;m not that fond of flat opaque color, so I will be using an overlay of another sheer shimmer polish to enhance it.</li>
            <li> This looks exactly like the label.  It&#x27;s a great teal, but NOT bright.  It&#x27;s not a super &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; tone and I really think this would be good in the fall as well.  It wore really well (2 weeks) and I got a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I love this color... I had some doubts because the pic does not show the real colors some times... this was the color I was looking for...</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. Love this color! It is a nice turquoise - great for figures and toes for spring/summer.</li>

            <li> This color is AWESOME, and should easily transition thru all seasons. I&#x27;m especially looking forward to trying it with my MATTE TIO.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the not-so-good.... the application is awful. The coverage is good, two coats and it is opaque. However, it applied like a regular polish, and began to &amp;quot;dry&amp;quot; during application.  It was necessary for me to quickly paint one nail and cure immediately. The second coat was no better.  I was wondering if I just got a bad bottle, but I do have one other Gelish polish ( He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not)  that had the same issue.</li>
            <li> I love this teal color. It&#x27;s rich and striking. Really beautiful with Grand Jewel on top or Water Field (my two favorite glitter polishes).</li>
