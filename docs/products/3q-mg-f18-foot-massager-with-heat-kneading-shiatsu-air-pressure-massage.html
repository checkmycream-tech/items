            <li>After using this my feet feel amazing!</li>
            <li>If you like a strong foot massage, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I work at a stand up desk and put most of my weight on my heels so that would be ideal to have something work on that area...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and the pressure of the air bags are really good</li>
            <li>she loved it</li>
            <li>massage is really good</li>
            <li>I had also gone to Brookstone and loved the foot massager but couldn&#x27;t afford it.  </li>
            <li>The pressure feels so good on the arthritis.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels good after session.</li>
            <li>a good machine</li>
            <li>As a bonus having it adjust to lighter (i.e. away from the bottom of the foot) would be good too.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>: The Return Process was very easy, painless, many kudos for excellent customer service, which is so good to find.</li>
            <li>I love the operation and feel of this I am diabetic and this thing make my feet feel great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I purchased from this vendor.  </li>
            <li>Sounds like for many people it works great, not for me though.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>Also the air pressure feels great on the top of your feet.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;squeezy&amp;#34; part!</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed my foot massager!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>really love this!</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job on the bottoms of your feet, except the heel.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice treat when just sitting on the couch, watching television.</li>
            <li>The heat is nice and comfy during the winter months.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>: Feels good for a while, better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly if they just combined the pressure with vibration they would earn 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li>honestly.</li>
            <li>This is a nice massager.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as Brookstone but much better price.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a foot messager that really gets with it with some power then this is your best bet</li>
            <li>My feet fit in this perfectly (size 8 1/2) and the different options feel wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Its nice that you can adjust the heat, pressure and kneading setting to what you like.</li>
            <li>and hopefully I can get many years of good use out of it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good quality, works great for the price.</li>
            <li>This foot massager is definitely my new best friend.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The condition of machine was very good and was working very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge, but gives a really good massage.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love love love this massager!</li>
            <li>It does a nice job and has become a favorite of many family members.  </li>
            <li>This is a great device, which really helps the peripheral neuropathy in my feet!</li>
            <li>Separately, my wife with womenâ€™s size 7 feet had no problem with the massager and enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>With better heat I would rate this 5-star.</li>
            <li>Love that this is a kneading and squeezing machine, not just the vibrate that most massagers are.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m detail oriented and satisfied with the build</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love it and use it almost every day.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I fell in love w/ the brookstone version.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>We love it</li>
            <li>It seem to be massaging all around it, and for me, my arch is my problem area where I need most help.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s better than most of the massage practitioners I have paid to massage my feet.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>More control should be given to the operator.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed my foot massager, use it every night before bed time.</li>
            <li>Works as we&#x27;ll a units that cost much more money.</li>
            <li>IF YOU IT TOO OFTEN OR TOO MANY TIMES CLOSE TOGETHER</li>
            <li>Love the machine.  </li>
            <li>How many companies do you say this of?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know these are not trivial engineering changes but having the kneader hit a tender spot over and over (especially with pressure on) can spoil the otherwise excellent experience.</li>
            <li>It has mechanical rollers for the bottom of your feet, air pressure from the top pushing your feet against the rollers and a heating function.</li>
            <li>I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>in fact I have to get to it before the other family members do because it&#x27;s become quite popular, lol!  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the air pressure that makes this feel pretty good, like your foot is being held and squeezed while it is massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to get used to its strong actions.</li>
            <li>They have instilled me with a strong sense of buyer confidence.  </li>
            <li>Strong massage with air pressure and rollers and squeezing.  </li>
            <li>Strong and sturdy built.</li>
            <li>Works very well, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>felt good on your feet--but mine smelled very hot when using and the cord was too hot to touch to unplug at times--seller did respond to my return of this item with no problem of getting a refund.</li>
            <li>and it fits fine...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine without using that.</li>
            <li>She wears a women&#x27;s size 9 and it fits her feet just fine.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the air filled pressure and rollers on the bottom of my foot.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this foot massager.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that their customer service is terrific!  </li>
            <li>Adjustable settings for light rubbing or make you cry kneading.</li>
            <li>My husband and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>My feet fit and there is still room.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the foot massage this gadget gives.  </li>
            <li>So far so good since bought about a year ago.</li>
            <li>son is so happy after a long day</li>
            <li>No masseuse/husband/wife will be able to massage you so often, for do long, and while you are casually enjoying TV show and glass of wine :)</li>
            <li>the foot kneading is a little too strong, hurts more then feels good.</li>
            <li>This little machine impressed me for the first five minutes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that it feels best after a hard day on your feet, and after you&#x27;ve soaked your feet for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure you want it, or she wants it and won&#x27;t hurt.your feet like my wifes foot because it cost a lot to return .sorry</li>
            <li>BUT with a thick pair of Wool Sox and a glass of wine this Foot Massager is PERFECT !</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Next best thing to having an actual person rub your feet for you.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the &amp;#34;auto&amp;#34; function cycle that it defaults to when first turned on best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For that matter it would be nice to be able to turn the heat on and off while still using any combination of the other features.</li>
            <li>Had 5 friends try this and all loved it, but all expressed that initially the kneading was very intense.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite thing.</li>
            <li>Worth every dime.....</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Delivered in a timely fashion gave it to my sister as a gift thought it would more massaging action</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Nice, but unit does same motion over &amp; over.</li>
            <li>The pressure is just right.</li>
            <li>it is nice a little to strong for my wife</li>
            <li>One thing that seems consistent with every model I looked at:  they do nothing for your heels - this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll probably take it to band camp and charge a fee  ;)</li>
            <li>first time I used it, I used it for about 30 minutes and the bottoms of my feet became sore/unpleasant</li>
            <li>It looks like they should each be individually controllable, but for most features it&#x27;s all of them or none.</li>
            <li>wonderful cheaper alternative to expensive Brookstone model.</li>
            <li>This is almost exactly like it.</li>
            <li>That being said, it doesn&#x27;t quite put enough pressure on my arches, even so, I love it.</li>
            <li>I tried it and you can control exactly what part of your feet are massaged by moving them in or our of the foot pocket.</li>
            <li>I am grateful for the warning in the Instrucitons to not wear it a lot at first, because I probably would have done just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>needed to use their customer service due to my own fault.  </li>
            <li>Wish the heat was more intense , but overall, this exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li>First one stopped working after first night but 3Q customer service was very responsive and sent another immediately after getting the details of my return request.  </li>
            <li>Good looking, massages as described but little noticeable heat, even on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>Unit has the right mixture of compression and massage to soothe the dogs after a day in high heels</li>
            <li>I certainly can&#x27;t make my feet feel that way by doing the massage myself.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Good for me, but others say it squeezes too hard.</li>
            <li>Well if you&#x27;ve been married for so long that your husband no longer feels the need to rub your feet to keep you around, here is a fairly cheap alternative.</li>
            <li>the massage is very arch-heavy</li>
            <li>this really pinched my feet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about a $100 foot massager really.</li>
            <li>great for tired feet.........</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t get to the arch very well.</li>
            <li>The pressure on yhe joints really helps to releave some of the pain.</li>
            <li>I just leave it in the TV room and whoever wants to use it, can.</li>
            <li>Some of the firmer settings can be a bit much, but this machine really does the job.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Nice product - the squeezing is pretty hard, but I like it.</li>
            <li>The only caveat is you should have users wear clean socks when using it.  </li>
            <li>not enough / no action on the bottom of feet, nice looking machine but not for me.</li>
            <li>The heat even on high isn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li>I can still use it, but it would be better for someone with an average sized foot.</li>
            <li>I bought this item based on the good reviews, but found the product would not fit my feet properly.  </li>
            <li>The shiatsu motion of the rollers underneath the feet tends to get old - I&#x27;m wishing the rollers would move in different patterns or maybe offer some light pinching -</li>
            <li>I bought this particular model after doing a lot of review comparisons.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent product</li>
            <li>but I just move my feet around as I want &amp; get those portions (particularly the heels) as needed.  </li>
            <li>Highly applaud this company and recommend them and this product.</li>
            <li>Or u got abnormally high arch.  </li>
            <li>Cuz u cant insert all the way if you have foot with high arch</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s just not enough variety in the massage to offer something worth considering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, and there&#x27;s several different nub motions going on at the same time, too.  </li>
            <li>The airbag squeezing pressure is pretty substantial on the high setting, but you can select medium or low also.  </li>
            <li>and they sent me a new one via UPS.  </li>
            <li>HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT THIS WONDER FOOT MASSAGER.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like wearing a strapped shoe with the strap pulled very tight across the top while the bottom of your foot is being pushed up into the strap.  </li>
            <li>If the foot is high or fat from near the leg joint, 2 to 3 inches from toes than the foot does not reach fully in the machine.</li>
            <li>This thing offers two levels of heat and I felt nothing on either level.</li>
            <li>and I thought, WOW.</li>
            <li>The massager only does one thing really,  besides the air inflation.  </li>
            <li>Message action on this thing will almost crush you feet if you are not use to it.</li>
            <li>MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVES IT AS</li>
            <li>Because users have different feet sizes and shapes the kneaders should be capable of being shifted forward or backward.  </li>
            <li>The surprising factor is that I do not like massages of any types, and yet, I decided to try this and is it possible to be addicted to a foot massager because I use this every night, sometimes through 2 or 3 cycles.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my significant other and am currently in the hero category.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this one after researching a lot of different models.</li>
            <li>The air pressure can be set to off, low, medium or high and the heat can be set to off, low and high.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want one of those cheap little vibration models, I wanted something that actually felt like my foot was being held and manipulated.</li>
            <li>It was worth every second and every penny i spent.</li>
            <li>Better have tough feet...</li>
            <li>I already sent this back and the problem was fixed.</li>
            <li>Reading other &#x27;REVIEWS&#x27; was very helpful to me in making my purchase choice.  </li>
            <li>The massaging (rolling) motion on the bottom of your feet is the same thing over and over with no other options.  </li>
            <li>ALMOST a little bit much even on the lightest setting, but that is what we like about it.</li>

            <li> This is a nice treat when just sitting on the couch, watching television.</li>
            <li> The heat is nice and comfy during the winter months.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> : Feels good for a while, better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly if they just combined the pressure with vibration they would earn 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> honestly.</li>
            <li> This is a nice massager.</li>
            <li> Almost as good as Brookstone but much better price.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a foot messager that really gets with it with some power then this is your best bet</li>
            <li> My feet fit in this perfectly (size 8 1/2) and the different options feel wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Its nice that you can adjust the heat, pressure and kneading setting to what you like.</li>
            <li> and hopefully I can get many years of good use out of it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good quality, works great for the price.</li>
            <li> This foot massager is definitely my new best friend.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The condition of machine was very good and was working very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge, but gives a really good massage.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love this massager!</li>
            <li> It does a nice job and has become a favorite of many family members.  </li>
            <li> This is a great device, which really helps the peripheral neuropathy in my feet!</li>
            <li> Separately, my wife with womenâ€™s size 7 feet had no problem with the massager and enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> With better heat I would rate this 5-star.</li>
            <li> Love that this is a kneading and squeezing machine, not just the vibrate that most massagers are.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m detail oriented and satisfied with the build</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love it and use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I fell in love w/ the brookstone version.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> We love it</li>
            <li> It seem to be massaging all around it, and for me, my arch is my problem area where I need most help.</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s better than most of the massage practitioners I have paid to massage my feet.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> More control should be given to the operator.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed my foot massager, use it every night before bed time.</li>
            <li> Works as we&#x27;ll a units that cost much more money.</li>
            <li> IF YOU IT TOO OFTEN OR TOO MANY TIMES CLOSE TOGETHER</li>
            <li> Love the machine.  </li>
            <li> How many companies do you say this of?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know these are not trivial engineering changes but having the kneader hit a tender spot over and over (especially with pressure on) can spoil the otherwise excellent experience.</li>
            <li> It has mechanical rollers for the bottom of your feet, air pressure from the top pushing your feet against the rollers and a heating function.</li>
            <li> I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> in fact I have to get to it before the other family members do because it&#x27;s become quite popular, lol!  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the air pressure that makes this feel pretty good, like your foot is being held and squeezed while it is massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to get used to its strong actions.</li>
            <li> They have instilled me with a strong sense of buyer confidence.  </li>
            <li> Strong massage with air pressure and rollers and squeezing.  </li>
            <li> Strong and sturdy built.</li>
            <li> Works very well, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> felt good on your feet--but mine smelled very hot when using and the cord was too hot to touch to unplug at times--seller did respond to my return of this item with no problem of getting a refund.</li>
            <li> and it fits fine...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine without using that.</li>
            <li> She wears a women&#x27;s size 9 and it fits her feet just fine.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the air filled pressure and rollers on the bottom of my foot.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this foot massager.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that their customer service is terrific!  </li>
            <li> Adjustable settings for light rubbing or make you cry kneading.</li>
            <li> My husband and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> My feet fit and there is still room.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the foot massage this gadget gives.  </li>
            <li> So far so good since bought about a year ago.</li>
            <li> son is so happy after a long day</li>
            <li> No masseuse/husband/wife will be able to massage you so often, for do long, and while you are casually enjoying TV show and glass of wine :)</li>
            <li> the foot kneading is a little too strong, hurts more then feels good.</li>
            <li> This little machine impressed me for the first five minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that it feels best after a hard day on your feet, and after you&#x27;ve soaked your feet for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure you want it, or she wants it and won&#x27;t hurt.your feet like my wifes foot because it cost a lot to return .sorry</li>
            <li> BUT with a thick pair of Wool Sox and a glass of wine this Foot Massager is PERFECT !</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Next best thing to having an actual person rub your feet for you.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the &amp;#34;auto&amp;#34; function cycle that it defaults to when first turned on best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For that matter it would be nice to be able to turn the heat on and off while still using any combination of the other features.</li>
            <li> Had 5 friends try this and all loved it, but all expressed that initially the kneading was very intense.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite thing.</li>
            <li> Worth every dime.....</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Delivered in a timely fashion gave it to my sister as a gift thought it would more massaging action</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Nice, but unit does same motion over &amp; over.</li>
            <li> The pressure is just right.</li>
            <li> it is nice a little to strong for my wife</li>
            <li> One thing that seems consistent with every model I looked at:  they do nothing for your heels - this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll probably take it to band camp and charge a fee  ;)</li>
            <li> first time I used it, I used it for about 30 minutes and the bottoms of my feet became sore/unpleasant</li>
            <li> It looks like they should each be individually controllable, but for most features it&#x27;s all of them or none.</li>
            <li> wonderful cheaper alternative to expensive Brookstone model.</li>
            <li> This is almost exactly like it.</li>
            <li> That being said, it doesn&#x27;t quite put enough pressure on my arches, even so, I love it.</li>
            <li> I tried it and you can control exactly what part of your feet are massaged by moving them in or our of the foot pocket.</li>
            <li> I am grateful for the warning in the Instrucitons to not wear it a lot at first, because I probably would have done just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> needed to use their customer service due to my own fault.  </li>
            <li> Wish the heat was more intense , but overall, this exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> First one stopped working after first night but 3Q customer service was very responsive and sent another immediately after getting the details of my return request.  </li>
            <li> Good looking, massages as described but little noticeable heat, even on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> Unit has the right mixture of compression and massage to soothe the dogs after a day in high heels</li>
            <li> I certainly can&#x27;t make my feet feel that way by doing the massage myself.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Good for me, but others say it squeezes too hard.</li>
            <li> Well if you&#x27;ve been married for so long that your husband no longer feels the need to rub your feet to keep you around, here is a fairly cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> the massage is very arch-heavy</li>
            <li> this really pinched my feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about a $100 foot massager really.</li>
            <li> great for tired feet.........</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t get to the arch very well.</li>
            <li> The pressure on yhe joints really helps to releave some of the pain.</li>
            <li> I just leave it in the TV room and whoever wants to use it, can.</li>
            <li> Some of the firmer settings can be a bit much, but this machine really does the job.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> Nice product - the squeezing is pretty hard, but I like it.</li>
            <li> The only caveat is you should have users wear clean socks when using it.  </li>
            <li> not enough / no action on the bottom of feet, nice looking machine but not for me.</li>
            <li> The heat even on high isn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li> I can still use it, but it would be better for someone with an average sized foot.</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on the good reviews, but found the product would not fit my feet properly.  </li>
            <li> The shiatsu motion of the rollers underneath the feet tends to get old - I&#x27;m wishing the rollers would move in different patterns or maybe offer some light pinching -</li>
            <li> I bought this particular model after doing a lot of review comparisons.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent product</li>
            <li> but I just move my feet around as I want &amp; get those portions (particularly the heels) as needed.  </li>
            <li> Highly applaud this company and recommend them and this product.</li>
            <li> Or u got abnormally high arch.  </li>
            <li> Cuz u cant insert all the way if you have foot with high arch</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s just not enough variety in the massage to offer something worth considering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, and there&#x27;s several different nub motions going on at the same time, too.  </li>
            <li> The airbag squeezing pressure is pretty substantial on the high setting, but you can select medium or low also.  </li>
            <li> and they sent me a new one via UPS.  </li>
            <li> HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT THIS WONDER FOOT MASSAGER.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like wearing a strapped shoe with the strap pulled very tight across the top while the bottom of your foot is being pushed up into the strap.  </li>
            <li> If the foot is high or fat from near the leg joint, 2 to 3 inches from toes than the foot does not reach fully in the machine.</li>
            <li> This thing offers two levels of heat and I felt nothing on either level.</li>
            <li> and I thought, WOW.</li>
            <li> The massager only does one thing really,  besides the air inflation.  </li>
            <li> Message action on this thing will almost crush you feet if you are not use to it.</li>
            <li> MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVES IT AS</li>
            <li> Because users have different feet sizes and shapes the kneaders should be capable of being shifted forward or backward.  </li>
            <li> The surprising factor is that I do not like massages of any types, and yet, I decided to try this and is it possible to be addicted to a foot massager because I use this every night, sometimes through 2 or 3 cycles.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my significant other and am currently in the hero category.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this one after researching a lot of different models.</li>
            <li> The air pressure can be set to off, low, medium or high and the heat can be set to off, low and high.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want one of those cheap little vibration models, I wanted something that actually felt like my foot was being held and manipulated.</li>
            <li> It was worth every second and every penny i spent.</li>
            <li> Better have tough feet...</li>
            <li> I already sent this back and the problem was fixed.</li>
            <li> Reading other &#x27;REVIEWS&#x27; was very helpful to me in making my purchase choice.  </li>
            <li> The massaging (rolling) motion on the bottom of your feet is the same thing over and over with no other options.  </li>
            <li> ALMOST a little bit much even on the lightest setting, but that is what we like about it.</li>
            <li> It still helps after a long day, but I have to put it on the couch and lay down to get an angle that doesn&#x27;t hurt to much to use it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much to relieve my foot pain and has become a pretty expensive paper weight.</li>
            <li> The only problem I can foresee is that it will probably burn out before too long -- it is used constantly!</li>
            <li> If it feels a little strong ion your feet, just wear thick wool or nappy socks when you use it.  </li>
            <li> It took a few sessions for feet to get use to the intensity, but everyone&#x27;s feet did adjust and now I can crank this up to the high level without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my arches tend to get sensitive from all the pressure while all the other areas needing attention go unaffected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little skeptical at how a machine could actually be effective in massaging my feet.</li>
            <li> I have oddly shaped feet, short, high arched and very wide.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only about one or two nubs for the bottom center of your heel, and none for the side of your heel.  </li>
            <li> Just got ut, waited 2 long days.</li>
            <li> I spent several hours reading and re-reading the reviews and feel like I found a winner.</li>
            <li> , I was a bit slow in getting it to them and they were very patient and understanding, promptly answering my questions to emails.  </li>
            <li> The controls are on the top of the machine and it was difficult for me to bend down to floor level and adjust.</li>
            <li> Wish it were a different color like black or white.</li>
            <li> When the airbags are off, there is enough room that you can lift your feet up slightly to reduce the amount of pressure the nubs are putting on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a size 8 in female shoe and it isn&#x27;t too big and defiantly not too small.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way to only use it for one cycle at a time, or feet will be sore the next day!</li>
            <li> Overall, I have a few complaints on this device - 1)  </li>
            <li> My initial use of this device forced me to position and reposition my feet in different ways to have the repeating rollers on the arch affect the areas I needed.</li>
            <li> Overall it seems a little pricey for what it does, but then again, we haven&#x27;t found any other foot massagers in this price range that work at all.</li>
            <li> I tried to send it back for a refund but the seller would not do it as I was 3 weeks past the 30 day return period.  </li>
            <li> The heat is pretty much useless, and 2.)When the compression and massage are at the highest, it hurts.</li>
            <li> It gets to a point where it&#x27;s like a blunt object jabbing you hard in the same place again and again.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Could never live without this product!!!!</li>
            <li> It has a constant roller motion just behind the ball of the foot, and a bumpy little roller that goes up and down between the toes.</li>
            <li> but heat is weak and the heal of your foot doesn&#x27;t get massaged enough</li>
            <li> Almost all of the little fingers nub things (maybe about 12 per side) are for the bottom of your foot (the ball and arch areas).  </li>
            <li> Also, if you want it to focus on your toes, ball of your feet, etc., just pull your feet a little ways out.</li>
            <li> My unit broke a few months after I received it.  </li>
            <li> Even lowest setting killed the bones in my feet.</li>
            <li> I work on my feet all day everyday and this has been a god send.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday since I got it and already notice the difference it has made.  </li>
            <li> Really missing it when traveling.</li>
            <li> Painful right away.</li>
            <li> The foot base should swivel with one&#x27;s posture instead of having to sit military straight.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen problems with this for the past year or so.</li>
            <li> but I wear a ladies 13 shoe which is equivalent to a mens 11 and my heel is slightly past the massaging part.</li>
            <li> I have small feet and can&#x27;t imagine someone with larger feet not being uncomfortable when this occurs.</li>
            <li> Truly this turned a potential very bad customer relation into one of complete satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, that is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> The heel motion is hardly felt at all.</li>
            <li> but it is still too hard on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from constant foot aches.</li>
            <li> Repetitive motion, gets boring quick</li>
            <li> it a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> The area was extremely painful to have rubbed back and forth by rollers.  </li>
            <li> It does squeeze hard!  </li>
            <li> DOES NOT MASSAGE HEEL, GIVES VERY HARD SQUEEZE TO THE FEET</li>
            <li> The nerve damage to my feet has gotten worse and the pain couldn&#x27;t be relieved.  </li>
            <li> This machine is too expensive for what it claims to offer but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s visually annoying and unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> The air pressure was painful, as were the rollers to the bottom of my foot.</li>
            <li> The pressure feature is heaven, but the massage part is not padded and when combined with the pressure it is painful.</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The rollers are brutal and hurt.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderfull!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My son is so happy after a long day</li>
            <li> actually hurt my feet</li>
            <li> I love the operation and feel of this I am diabetic and this thing make my feet feel great.</li>
            <li> I am on my feet all day for work. This is a nice treat when just sitting on the couch, watching television. I enjoy the air filled pressure and rollers on the bottom of my foot. The heat is nice and comfy during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Great combo of heat &amp; massage!</li>
            <li> If you like a strong foot massage, this is perfect. Instant plantar relief. Best one in the market for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on the good reviews, but found the product would not fit my feet properly.  I have menâ€™s size 12 feet and the rollers for the bottom of the feet would roll back and forth where my arch meets the balls of my feet.  The area was extremely painful to have rubbed back and forth by rollers.  No amount of maneuvering could get rollers onto my arch.  Separately, my wife with womenâ€™s size 7 feet had no problem with the massager and enjoyed it.  I would say that if you have larger than menâ€™s size 11 1/2 feet, this is probably not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Good looking, massages as described but little noticeable heat, even on the high setting.  It&#x27;s possible that the element may not work.  With better heat I would rate this 5-star.</li>
            <li> the foot kneading is a little too strong, hurts more then feels good.</li>
            <li> This made an awesome gift!</li>
            <li> This massager is great!</li>
            <li> Fits both my size 8 foot and my husband&#x27;s size 13.  Love that this is a kneading and squeezing machine, not just the vibrate that most massagers are.  Had 5 friends try this and all loved it, but all expressed that initially the kneading was very intense. It took a few sessions for feet to get use to the intensity, but everyone&#x27;s feet did adjust and now I can crank this up to the high level without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially this machine was fairly quiet.  After ~10+ hours of use, it started to make a louder noise.  Will need to assess if the noise is permanent or a function of the feet or surface it was on at the time.</li>
            <li> I already sent this back and the problem was fixed.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my significant other and am currently in the hero category.  Unit has the right mixture of compression and massage to soothe the dogs after a day in high heels</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this one after researching a lot of different models. One thing that seems consistent with every model I looked at:  they do nothing for your heels - this one is no exception. I work at a stand up desk and put most of my weight on my heels so that would be ideal to have something work on that area...no such luck here.  My initial use of this device forced me to position and reposition my feet in different ways to have the repeating rollers on the arch affect the areas I needed. Overall, I have a few complaints on this device - 1)  I detected NO heat what so ever. This thing offers two levels of heat and I felt nothing on either level. 2) The shiatsu motion of the rollers underneath the feet tends to get old - I&#x27;m wishing the rollers would move in different patterns or maybe offer some light pinching - the massage is very arch-heavy so my arches tend to get sensitive from all the pressure while all the other areas needing attention go unaffected.  It gets to a point where it&#x27;s like a blunt object jabbing you hard in the same place again and again. 3) For some reason, the red LED power indicator continuously blinks when the unit is off. I have no idea why they chose to have that happen but it&#x27;s visually annoying and unnecessary.  This machine is too expensive for what it claims to offer but doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s well made and the pressure of the air bags are really good but there&#x27;s just not enough variety in the massage to offer something worth considering.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this foot massager.  Very high quality. If it feels a little strong ion your feet, just wear thick wool or nappy socks when you use it.  It&#x27;s feels fabulous!  Very easy to use.  I enjoy the &amp;#34;auto&amp;#34; function cycle that it defaults to when first turned on best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service if absolutely wonderful.  My unit broke a few months after I received it.  I contacted the seller and they immediately responded, said to ship it back, and that they would repair or replace the unit.  It was such a short time, maybe a week and they sent me a new one via UPS.  Not only that, I was a bit slow in getting it to them and they were very patient and understanding, promptly answering my questions to emails.  Highly applaud this company and recommend them and this product.</li>
            <li> she loved it so I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Sent back immediately. It felt as if my feet were locked in. Not relaxing feeling at all. Even lowest setting killed the bones in my feet. Painful right away.</li>
            <li> Worth every dime.....still running great since Christmas</li>
            <li> massage is really good but heat is weak and the heal of your foot doesn&#x27;t get massaged enough</li>
            <li> felt good on your feet--but mine smelled very hot when using and the cord was too hot to touch to unplug at times--seller did respond to my return of this item with no problem of getting a refund.</li>
            <li> Great for massaging feet.  It&#x27;s huge, but gives a really good massage.  Wish it were a different color like black or white.</li>
            <li> So far so good since bought about a year ago. Not used often. It takes a while to get used to its strong actions.</li>
            <li> I had also gone to Brookstone and loved the foot massager but couldn&#x27;t afford it.  I have pain all over, including my feet.  This one does a great job.  And I&#x27;ll probably take it to band camp and charge a fee  ;)</li>
            <li> i wear size 13 EE this really pinched my feet so I returned it</li>
            <li> Shipped immediately ....and I love it! I&#x27;m on my feet 80% of my day and this is just what I need.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular model after doing a lot of review comparisons.  My feedback is this...  It does an amazing job on the bottoms of your feet, except the heel.  Almost all of the little fingers nub things (maybe about 12 per side) are for the bottom of your foot (the ball and arch areas).  There&#x27;s only about one or two nubs for the bottom center of your heel, and none for the side of your heel.  It does rub the inside fronts of your feet (but not the outer sides of your feet at all), and the area in front of the ball, between your toes (on the bottom of your foot).  It&#x27;s nice, and there&#x27;s several different nub motions going on at the same time, too.  Despite not doing a few parts of your foot, it is still very pleasing.  The airbag squeezing pressure is pretty substantial on the high setting, but you can select medium or low also.  When the airbags are off, there is enough room that you can lift your feet up slightly to reduce the amount of pressure the nubs are putting on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I used it for about 30 minutes and the bottoms of my feet became sore/unpleasant, I think it bruised the bottoms of my feet, but that was my fault.  I&#x27;ve got to let the soreness go away (it doesn&#x27;t affect walking, I just can&#x27;t use the massager for a couple days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a quality built device... nothing is substandard quality.  I&#x27;m detail oriented and satisfied with the build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mens&#x27; size 10 feet and it fits fine... there&#x27;s even room for a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit 6/20/14**&lt;br /&gt;I needed to use their customer service due to my own fault.  I&#x27;m happy to say that their customer service is terrific!  Very courteous and prompt.  I&#x27;m very glad I purchased from this vendor.  They have instilled me with a strong sense of buyer confidence.  In my experience, that is hard to find.  Excellent customer experience, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  A++</li>
            <li> I have oddly shaped feet, short, high arched and very wide. The air pressure was painful, as were the rollers to the bottom of my foot. The controls are on the top of the machine and it was difficult for me to bend down to floor level and adjust. Ouch. Sounds like for many people it works great, not for me though.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The Return Process was very easy, painless, many kudos for excellent customer service, which is so good to find.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality, works great for the price. I haven&#x27;t seen problems with this for the past year or so. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Well if you&#x27;ve been married for so long that your husband no longer feels the need to rub your feet to keep you around, here is a fairly cheap alternative. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical at how a machine could actually be effective in massaging my feet. I didn&#x27;t want one of those cheap little vibration models, I wanted something that actually felt like my foot was being held and manipulated. This little machine impressed me for the first five minutes I stuck my feet into it and I thought, WOW. But after that, it starts getting somewhat repetitious. It has a constant roller motion just behind the ball of the foot, and a bumpy little roller that goes up and down between the toes. The heel motion is hardly felt at all. But it&#x27;s the air pressure that makes this feel pretty good, like your foot is being held and squeezed while it is massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Feels good for a while, better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Repetitive motion, gets boring quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I wear a size 9. I&#x27;ve also found that it feels best after a hard day on your feet, and after you&#x27;ve soaked your feet for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping my foot massager. And all in all, it&#x27;s alright but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price. It&#x27;s about a $100 foot massager really.</li>
            <li> Works great. Next best thing to having an actual person rub your feet for you.</li>
            <li> Strong massage with air pressure and rollers and squeezing.  ALMOST a little bit much even on the lightest setting, but that is what we like about it. Sturdy piece of equipment.  This is not for anyone with delicate/tender feet.  Seems like it is built to last, a solid piece of equipment.  I learned the hard way to only use it for one cycle at a time, or feet will be sore the next day!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT MASSAGE HEEL, GIVES VERY HARD SQUEEZE TO THE FEET</li>
            <li> This is a decent product but I wear a ladies 13 shoe which is equivalent to a mens 11 and my heel is slightly past the massaging part. I can still use it, but it would be better for someone with an average sized foot. I didn&#x27;t care for the air pressure regardless of the setting but it&#x27;s fine without using that.</li>
            <li> great for tired feet.........</li>
            <li> Better have tough feet...this item will work you over. Works for me...some may think it&#x27;s to aggressive.</li>
            <li> The pressure feature is heaven, but the massage part is not padded and when combined with the pressure it is painful. I wish they could be controlled separately. For that matter it would be nice to be able to turn the heat on and off while still using any combination of the other features. It looks like they should each be individually controllable, but for most features it&#x27;s all of them or none. Honestly if they just combined the pressure with vibration they would earn 5 stars from me. It still helps after a long day, but I have to put it on the couch and lay down to get an angle that doesn&#x27;t hurt to much to use it. My husband can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I use it every night and my feet are very happy...in fact I have to get to it before the other family members do because it&#x27;s become quite popular, lol!  Doesn&#x27;t reach all parts of my feet (I wear sz 7) at the same time but I just move my feet around as I want &amp; get those portions (particularly the heels) as needed.  Love the &amp;#34;squeezy&amp;#34; part!</li>
            <li> wonderful cheaper alternative to expensive Brookstone model. I love it and use it almost every day. No problems whatsoever. Adjustable settings for light rubbing or make you cry kneading. If you&#x27;re on the fence of the Brookstone model cuz of price, just buy this one. honestly. done and done.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I fell in love w/ the brookstone version. This is almost exactly like it. I can&#x27;t tell the difference and it a lot less expensive. It was worth the price. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything for the bottom of my heels. The massager only does one thing really,  besides the air inflation.  The massaging (rolling) motion on the bottom of your feet is the same thing over and over with no other options.  I tried to send it back for a refund but the seller would not do it as I was 3 weeks past the 30 day return period.  It doesn&#x27;t do much to relieve my foot pain and has become a pretty expensive paper weight.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. The pressure is just right. The heat even on high isn&#x27;t too much. I have a size 8 in female shoe and it isn&#x27;t too big and defiantly not too small. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed my foot massager!</li>
            <li> Great foot massager. We love it</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite thing. I work on my feet all day everyday and this has been a god send. That being said, it doesn&#x27;t quite put enough pressure on my arches, even so, I love it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She wears a women&#x27;s size 9 and it fits her feet just fine. She loves the rollers that massage the soles of the feet. The pneumatic massager that applies pressure works well too, though it makes quite a racket and I worry about how durable it is. I wish we could extend the 15 minute timer; is that supposed to be a safety feature so you don&#x27;t fall asleep with it on, or is the machine not engineered to operate for an extended period of time? I wonder. Overall it seems a little pricey for what it does, but then again, we haven&#x27;t found any other foot massagers in this price range that work at all.</li>
            <li> Hurts feet. This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice massager. My husband and I enjoy it. However, it doesn&#x27;t get to the arch very well. It seem to be massaging all around it, and for me, my arch is my problem area where I need most help.</li>
            <li> not enough / no action on the bottom of feet, nice looking machine but not for me.</li>
            <li> Works well to relieve aching when on ones feet a lot.</li>
            <li> Just got ut, waited 2 long days. It was worth every second and every penny i spent. Love it! The pressure feels so good on the arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;My hands also suffer from arthritis so i thought i would try my hand, and it is a two for one. The pressure on yhe joints really helps to releave some of the pain.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  Arrived faster than est dated. Do not recommend if ur foot is bigger than 9 inch. Or u got abnormally high arch.  Cuz u cant insert all the way if you have foot with high arch feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels good after session. 4 stars</li>
            <li> My wife uses it every day and loves it. We&#x27;ve recommended it to our friends.</li>
            <li> Product works great...love it!</li>
            <li> Not bad. I certainly can&#x27;t make my feet feel that way by doing the massage myself. Well worth the money. Really, it&#x27;s better than most of the massage practitioners I have paid to massage my feet.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from constant foot aches. This has been a godsend. Works very well, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have 2 issues with this product. 1.) The heat is pretty much useless, and 2.)When the compression and massage are at the highest, it hurts. I have small feet and can&#x27;t imagine someone with larger feet not being uncomfortable when this occurs. It&#x27;s like wearing a strapped shoe with the strap pulled very tight across the top while the bottom of your foot is being pushed up into the strap.  However, that being said I still give it 4 stars because I have had relief.</li>
            <li> It is all I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Delivered in a timely fashion gave it to my sister as a gift thought it would more massaging action</li>
            <li> It does a nice job and has become a favorite of many family members.  I just leave it in the TV room and whoever wants to use it, can. The only caveat is you should have users wear clean socks when using it.  Also, if you want it to focus on your toes, ball of your feet, etc., just pull your feet a little ways out.</li>
            <li> Everyone who has walked into my house has tried this and asked where did I get this.  I love it.  Almost as good as Brookstone but much better price.</li>
            <li> Design should be a prototype only because it is so basic and lacks versatility. The foot base should swivel with one&#x27;s posture instead of having to sit military straight. The rollers are brutal and hurt. More control should be given to the operator. The best feature is the contraction and relaxation of the bellows but it times off. Once again, the designer pushed the easiest design and left the product severely lacking.</li>
            <li> Nice product - the squeezing is pretty hard, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed my foot massager, use it every night before bed time.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money.  Works as we&#x27;ll a units that cost much more money.</li>
            <li> Wish the heat was more intense , but overall, this exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift. The only problem I can foresee is that it will probably burn out before too long -- it is used constantly! My daughter loves it. I tried it and you can control exactly what part of your feet are massaged by moving them in or our of the foot pocket. Also the air pressure feels great on the top of your feet. I spent several hours reading and re-reading the reviews and feel like I found a winner.</li>
            <li> If you return it  cost me $38.21to ship back!!!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you want it, or she wants it and won&#x27;t hurt.your feet like my wifes foot because it cost a lot to return .sorry I even purchased it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. The surprising factor is that I do not like massages of any types, and yet, I decided to try this and is it possible to be addicted to a foot massager because I use this every night, sometimes through 2 or 3 cycles. It&#x27;s so relaxing. Some of the firmer settings can be a bit much, but this machine really does the job.</li>
            <li> Strong and sturdy built. Message action on this thing will almost crush you feet if you are not use to it. If you are looking for a foot messager that really gets with it with some power then this is your best bet</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but definitely worth the money.  the value is why I gave it 4 stars versus 5.  It&#x27;s an excellent machine.  My feet fit and there is still room.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my feet ache. It exceeded my expectations....the air pressure setting has 3 settings which is excellent. The rollers on the bottom are great for aching feet....buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews before buying this, but have not had any of the problems that I read about.  The nerve damage to my feet has gotten worse and the pain couldn&#x27;t be relieved.  My feet fit in this perfectly (size 8 1/2) and the different options feel wonderful!  No increased pain after using this, which was something I was worried about.  I have even used all the options at once.  I am grateful for the warning in the Instrucitons to not wear it a lot at first, because I probably would have done just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this!</li>
            <li> I bought 3Q and received it in the same week. The condition of machine was very good and was working very well. I bought this for my husband and we were sad as his feet size is 10 and his foot was not fully fitting in the machine. If the foot is high or fat from near the leg joint, 2 to 3 inches from toes than the foot does not reach fully in the machine. After trying couple of time he gave up as his foot was hurting.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good machine but pls buy checking your foot size.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love this massager! I have problems with my feet and at the end of the day I&#x27;m in pain. After using this my feet feel amazing! Its nice that you can adjust the heat, pressure and kneading setting to what you like.</li>
            <li> HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT THIS WONDER FOOT MASSAGER.  MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVES IT AS WELL....iT IS SO RELAXING AND MY FEET FEEL SO REFRESED AFTER i USE IT.  i HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MY FEET BEING SORE4 AND SWELLING....THIS MASSAGER HAS MADE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT ...BUT, DO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. IF YOU IT TOO OFTEN OR TOO MANY TIMES CLOSE TOGETHER IT CAN CAUSE YOUR FEET TO FEEL OVER MASSAGED AND SORE.</li>
            <li> This is a great device, which really helps the peripheral neuropathy in my feet!</li>
            <li> Love the machine.  First one stopped working after first night but 3Q customer service was very responsive and sent another immediately after getting the details of my return request.  Truly this turned a potential very bad customer relation into one of complete satisfaction.  How many companies do you say this of?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because I feel it could use one improvement - some user adjustment of the kneading.  Because users have different feet sizes and shapes the kneaders should be capable of being shifted forward or backward.  As a bonus having it adjust to lighter (i.e. away from the bottom of the foot) would be good too.  I know these are not trivial engineering changes but having the kneader hit a tender spot over and over (especially with pressure on) can spoil the otherwise excellent experience.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the foot massage this gadget gives.  It has mechanical rollers for the bottom of your feet, air pressure from the top pushing your feet against the rollers and a heating function. You can have just the kneading function without the air pressure or heat.  The air pressure can be set to off, low, medium or high and the heat can be set to off, low and high. It also has 2 auto massage settings.  Each massage session lasts for 15 minutes.  I&#x27;ve been using this everyday since I got it and already notice the difference it has made.  It seems to well built and hopefully I can get many years of good use out of it.  Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Good for me, but others say it squeezes too hard. It does squeeze hard!  There is an adjustment but it is still too hard on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> This is a great foot massager. There are different settings for massages and for heat ( I cannot feel the heat even at the highest setting).</li>
            <li> it is nice a little to strong for my wife</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped. Nice, but unit does same motion over &amp; over. I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Could never live without this product!!!! Very strong!!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised...using it daily and it really works.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of yoga and my feet take a beating.  This foot massager is definitely my new best friend.  I use it in the evening for just 30 minutes and all the aches and pains are gone when I&#x27;m finished</li>
            <li> I Luv this &#x27;machine&#x27;.  It was delivered very quickly.  Reading other &#x27;REVIEWS&#x27; was very helpful to me in making my purchase choice.  Every &#x27;review&#x27; was helpful so I suggest that you take the time to do so.  BUT with a thick pair of Wool Sox and a glass of wine this Foot Massager is PERFECT !</li>
            <li> Could not set a constant massage.</li>
            <li> Bought it almost 6 months ago, and use it almost every day. Really missing it when traveling. No masseuse/husband/wife will be able to massage you so often, for do long, and while you are casually enjoying TV show and glass of wine :)</li>
