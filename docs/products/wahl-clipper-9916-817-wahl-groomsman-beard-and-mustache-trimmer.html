            <li>The  best grooming set available</li>
            <li>i had this unit to do beard trimming and for me was good, but the problem was the nickel-cadmium batter stopped taking a charge after a while so that became a pain.  </li>

            <li>Nice trimmer</li>

            <li>Spend a bit more for something good.</li>
            <li>Also comes with a travel bag which is nice.</li>
            <li>On thing I really liked about this is that it works on the charger</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>This trimmer is nice and gives a nice cut.  </li>
            <li>and I already own Wahl Clippers</li>
            <li>The photo in the advertised item shows the kind of trimmer attachment I have been trying to replace.  </li>
            <li>I just charge it up and then put all the charger and stand away and leave this handy in the bathroom and use it once a week or so.</li>
            <li>He really likes it, very nice!</li>
            <li>Very nice razor and very powerful</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve tried others but this particular wahl trimmer is the best.</li>
            <li>Not much of a negative for this excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it again and at such a good price!  </li>
            <li>Great item, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>His beard looks amazing, too :)</li>
            <li>More trim length options would be nice.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I have owned so far.</li>
            <li>I tried it on his head hair because that&#x27;s very fine hair.</li>
            <li>it is a great little trimmer and priced perfect.  </li>
            <li>, clean trim.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Quality build/good feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer works great and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>At first it was great.</li>
            <li>I use this product regularly, Wahl makes a good product I feel I can count on and feel good about the pruchase !</li>
            <li>Used to trim with scissors, but this thing is very precise</li>
            <li>/&gt;Several attachments come in a handy pouch for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The three different sized grooming tools are perfect for anything that I need.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It was one of his favorite Christmas gifts</li>
            <li>Works great but is real noisy.</li>
            <li>In fact, this trimmer gave me a more even trim than I&#x27;ve even gotten with razors.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I trim my beard, collarline and around a prominent mole on my chin safely.</li>
            <li>What more do you need??</li>
            <li>Is fully function able and stylish.</li>
            <li>but I was eventually able to get rid of the sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps you can get a better one for more money but for price performance I&#x27;ll stick with this one.</li>
            <li>more can I</li>
            <li>The rechargeable trimmer is okay.  </li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s pro-grade, couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li>- I like it better tham others I have used</li>
            <li>Why spend more money when this trimmer does it all well.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on his mustache thinking it might work better on that thickness of hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I&#x27;ve owned Wahl products that have lasted decades, and the size seemed more appropriate for beard trimming than my aging Color Pro.</li>
            <li>I just prefer fewer moving parts, and a fixed 1/2&amp;#34; attachment would have been ideal.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>The product looked like good quality based on the pictures, but when it arrived, the quality was clear.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy, powerful motor, hasn&#x27;t needed recharging after 6 weeks of trims.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My boyfriend had a Wahl trimmer for many years.  </li>
            <li>Seems to cut okay.</li>
            <li>so far so good , my husband doesnt grow much hair on his face , so its perfect for his needs..</li>
            <li>This is one of my all times favorites and i will gladly recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>More ever it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>The charge holds forever on this thing, and the movement is extremely fast so it makes for a great beard and stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li>There probably are too many attachments.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any others i have used.  </li>
            <li>It has everything you want from a trimmer with the exception of the overwhelming noise it produces.</li>
            <li>Have purchased items on Amazon before and have always been pleased with products and service.</li>
            <li>It is not the most fancy or heavyweight item but in a pinch this helps to keep a neat face.</li>
            <li>Would work better if she would be still. :-)</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll do better research this time and go buy another trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li>Husband says it pulls on the hair more then trimming it..</li>
            <li>and so does my girlfriend, so what could be better?</li>
            <li>So we wont be able to try till</li>
            <li>Most suck and pull hair, or the guard falls off and you end up as patch Adams...</li>
            <li>so glad his straggly hairs are gone.</li>
            <li>He had a Wahl many years ago and it finally wore out , he bought another brand and all it did was pull his beard, and I did research and bought another Wahl for he , he is very happy</li>
            <li>But like most things they do wear out over time.</li>
            <li>Buy it and you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Trust me, this will give you a better trim than most others.</li>
            <li>On time delivery and better quality than expexted.</li>
            <li>I would definitely say great quality!</li>
            <li>I have been trimming with this for a while now and have had very clean results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent seller I am satisfied with the purchase , it is what I expected</li>
            <li>Works great so far!</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that I haven&#x27;t observed any problems, it is sharp and has a good variety of clip-ons.</li>
            <li>The product works great for an old bald guy with mustach and bead.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, it hurts.</li>
            <li>While the old trimmer did an acceptable job this one does an excellent one, I could see the difference with the first trim.  </li>
            <li>I wish the attachments fit better.</li>
            <li>Lighter, more ergonomic in the hand, but the build quality seems cheap compared to the 8 year-old Wahl Groomsman it replaced.  </li>
            <li>A good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Still, it does a good job, and you really don&#x27;t need to remove the piece.</li>
            <li>very smooth dosnt pull the hair clean cut and has lots of power</li>
            <li>As other reviews have pointed out, the plastic attachments for this aren&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li>just added a star because I remember the price and at that cost I&#x27;m getting more than my money&#x27;s worth out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>women said I look better clean shaved with no rash...</li>
            <li>It has a variety of trimmings attachments making it easy to get the look you want.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li>this is an easy to use trimmer.</li>
            <li>Compact design makes it easy to guide around beard and mustache&lt;</li>
            <li>but i found if you get it off from the side its easy...</li>
            <li>Its does not detach from plug easily</li>
            <li>So easy to do that</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Take it easy and be patient.  </li>
            <li>Works amazingly easy.  </li>
            <li>many pieces-parts don&#x27;t fit in the holder well, nor is it easy to figure out how they were intended to fit.</li>
            <li>The accompanying &amp;#34;trimming lengths&amp;#34; wont&#x27;t be that easy to put in and remove.</li>
            <li>I used the 6 to 1 guide attachment and it adjusts easily</li>
            <li>It is a real good buy, I have had a few and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li>Rusted very quickly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy with Groomsman Beard and Mustache.</li>
            <li>Would recommend strongly to invest in a better/heavier duty trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is a good trimmer with nice range of attachments for various trimming lengths.</li>
            <li>Good enough trimmers - nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>The newer motor is not as strong.</li>
            <li>Son is thrilled with this--it was VERY reasonable.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t also make me wealthy, good looking, better at sports, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>The attachments are all still intact and working just fine...</li>
            <li>The guards click on easily and stay securely in place, allowing for a worry-free trim.</li>
            <li>Everything else is fine.  </li>
            <li>Fine product indeed.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to throw into your luggage for trips and vacation.</li>
            <li>First off I thought it felt kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>Does a fine job at trimming my beard and side burns.</li>
            <li>Use of the trimmer has been  fine in meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li>Quick Delivery too!</li>
            <li>Great, but super loud.</li>
            <li>This little guy is perfect.</li>
            <li>This Wahl Trimmer was not as good as the professional ones I had used but for the price, it trims fine.  </li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li>The item shipped on time and the product I received was accurate to the manufacturer&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li>THe accessories are cheap.</li>
            <li>Does not feel cheap and battery</li>
            <li>My son said it works great for his facial hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read complaints of them being too cheap, but if they were sturdier (thicker) they would not work as well.  </li>
            <li>: For the short period that it did work, it worked great.</li>
            <li>If one should, they are available from Wahl for five bucks a set.    </li>
            <li>1/16&amp;#34; guard was so warped that it didn&#x27;t fit and broke upon installation.</li>
            <li>Hold&#x27;s up great, will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t built cheap razors, but I guarntee my work for the lifetime of my customers at my expense.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my current purchase, performs as good as the old one.  </li>
            <li>Feels solid, cuts great and holds charge</li>
            <li>The plastic guide IS cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually, which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped.</li>
            <li>Cheap stand.</li>
            <li>Now I have a primary and backup trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer, which I use once a week, does not hold a charge but for two trimmings of a light beard.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade.</li>
            <li>clipper add tons are cheap and break easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two plastic tabs meant to secure it in place</li>
            <li>I complain about cheap quality of the accesories, almost break the multiposition accessory trying to put in machine.</li>
            <li>Great for a low end shaver</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It does not stay securely  in the on position.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER - I dropped it and the head internals broke since it was cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Never buying another cheap Wahl.</li>
            <li>Plastic piece won&#x27;t fit over the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Attachments are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday, best brand out there</li>
            <li>Somewhat cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Instead, I got some cheap battery operated version.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean and packs well for traveling</li>
            <li>Works great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, and it trimmed my face hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect item, could not have asked for anything more kit comes with everything needed to keep a clear appearance daily</li>
            <li>AND IT WORKS FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But it was cheap, and it does work, with a bit of effort.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of power and the battery life so far has been good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED the trimmer compared to an old Remington trimmer that I had.</li>
            <li>This photograph resembles the one that I used to have, but nothing about it is anywhere near as good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Good product...just loud.</li>
            <li>The price was right, It should give me many years of use.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard clean but feels cheap in my hands.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Have used many Wahl products over last 25 years &amp; this exact Groomsman Beard for many years &amp; have always been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be a haply returning Wahl customer as I&#x27;ve owned my first Wahl hair clipper set I received as a Christmas gift..</li>
            <li>raised the stars rating from 2 to 4, because this thing has lasted in almost original condition for about three years.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the first</li>
            <li>Although the stand is space friendly, the attachments keep popping out every time when I take out the razor.</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far</li>
            <li>Had the first for many years; so, I got my money out of that one.</li>
            <li>Just keep the blades clean and oil them as you should.</li>
            <li>clean shaved....SORRY.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s better than the old one that cost more.</li>
            <li>I use it to keep goatee trimmed and clean.  </li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t give a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is supper easy to get your beard or mustache the right</li>
            <li>The way it trims and cuts, there&#x27;s nothin special about it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I am doing right now!</li>
            <li>Very good results with just a few passes over my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to win any power contests, but you just need a small motor for most</li>
            <li>--  good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I own a 9916, a 9918 and two old 9620&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Only guard that fit properly was the all-in-one adjustable one that clipped on perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the Wahl trimmers, The last one lasted 13 years.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use and more power.  </li>
            <li>Now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom, or finding a razor that can survive real world use.    </li>
            <li>Clipper is kind of loud and hair goes flying.</li>
            <li>Husband is completely satisfied (and he is very picky).  </li>
            <li>I love it, very practical.</li>
            <li>It grew blunt and then died after two years which is fair enough for the price I suppose.</li>
            <li>gave it a full charge before I started using it and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it yet</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I had a real impression of it.</li>
            <li>Trimmer works well, have gone from keeping full beard trimmed and neat to maintaining stuble.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is so totally cool.</li>
            <li>I eventually got a different trimmer, but it wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Customer service says no bad batch of product &amp; offer no assistance that matters.</li>
            <li>Battery is still going strong, months after my first charge.  </li>
            <li>attachments are just adequate.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly for a gift.</li>
            <li>I suspect this will last me many more</li>
            <li>I would not buy one again and I will find a replacement quickly.</li>
            <li>This one sits in the charger and I just grab it for a quick trim.</li>
            <li>Now I can get it done and over with quickly.</li>
            <li>The 6-position guide is super flimsy and again, non-intuitive.  </li>
            <li>After using it regularly all this time, I give it excellent marks for durability, ease of use, and overall value.</li>
            <li>have not tried those other products, so it&#x27;s possible they are really excellent as well, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me worth it to pay twice as much for the name</li>
            <li>I could not get some of the attachments to fit but the main trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li>has a good charger and can be used after its charged;  came promptly as promised ;  it has a full set of attachements to allow triming longer hair to a constant length ; works good but the attachments are hard to get off and put on but not impossible; would order again for sure.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a Christmas present for my partner, and he is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It has all the same features as the older model and works great.</li>
            <li>Works better than new.</li>
            <li>was going to return it before even giving it a try as it felt like it came out of a Cracker Jack box, but I decided to give it a shot, to my suprise it actually worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer head depth heads, which were better than the new ones even fit !</li>
            <li>The 6 position trimmer guide allows you to keep it nice and tight or a more on the lengthy side.</li>
            <li>Great Little razor.  </li>
            <li>If your like me and have a beard that isn&#x27;t super thick and just want to trim it up, good grab!</li>
            <li>a cheap trimmer that works great for personal use but would not hold up to commercial use.</li>
            <li>Definately a great price this was the same cost as a cheap 1 at the local department stores.</li>
            <li>Also very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel like the cheaper trimmers available on the market.</li>
            <li>I honestly wish I could find a set of beard and mustache trimmers that will actually work.</li>
            <li>Using the internet to sift through all of the choices was worth a lot of time going throught stores that did not have all of the choices.  </li>
            <li>This product was well worth the money paid for it.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Well worth it IMHO.  </li>
            <li>this trimmer has much more power than my old one.</li>
            <li>If not for the battery life alone, it is worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Nice price, quality product, cheaper than the big box store</li>
            <li>It is powerful.</li>
            <li>If this lasts for awhile then this beard trimmer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love this beard trimmer - it&#x27;s simple, sturdy, cheap, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The blade guards fit very well, and the adjustable guard has a very positive catch at each setting.</li>
            <li>However, this is perfect if you just want to trim yourself down to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look like myself using the bare trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the change because the Whal preforms much better then the other brand.</li>
            <li>Other then that its been useful and a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>The batteries are still good, still holding a decent charge - I charge it up only when it needs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other Wahl products and found them to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li>I wrestled it out of its packaging and plugged it in right away.</li>
            <li>Just do it in the shower right before I take a bath.</li>
            <li>Opened it up and found the right setting right off the bat.</li>
            <li>Works great, just as described and pictured, I&#x27;ve been using WAHL products for about 30 years and as usual they got it right</li>
            <li>Great battery life, small and portable</li>
            <li>One of the best things is the battery which holds a charge extremely well meaning the trimmers can be used without the cord for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>Awesome little shaver if you want to keep facial hair tirned to a mangable length</li>
            <li>I have used this little trimmer extensively, and have found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li>A great quality trimmer/groomer, I have had this piece for 2 years and it still holds a charge and powers through coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Runs at a fast speed to get the trimming done quickly.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and super efficient.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>so I bought another bigger, all in one cordless trimmer that I love and  use just fine for my beard and  fits all my other needs better.</li>
            <li>It is replacing a battery powered Wahl unit that was over 15 years old and still working fine until the switch broke.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, very sharp blades, the chrome top is sculpted in front of the trimming edge to hold cut hair until you deposit it in the sink or on a towel, it has a nice rubberly grip, it&#x27;s not too loud, charges fast and holds a good charge for a long time so I don&#x27;t have to keep it plugged in or on the charger (makes my bathroom sink neater) and the red LED confirms it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good little trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looked good at first but started getting a little</li>
            <li>Powerful and precise, feels great in my hand, and leaves the scruff looking tough!</li>
            <li>All around great little trimmer especially for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>My husband never got to use this beard trimmer, as the clip-on thing broke first try.  </li>
            <li>I thought the smaller, narrower blade of the Groomsman would make it easier for me to get the contours around and under my jaw line, but no, the big hair clippers do an *infinitely* better (cleaner, faster, more thorough) job.    </li>
            <li>After the over night of charging and many dreams of a well kept face rug I finally got to using it.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was attach the adjustable length attachment.</li>
            <li>I was pretty unhappy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>This Wahl beard trimmer provides an even and consistent trim with comfort and ease.</li>
            <li>The first blade guard he tried to use wouldn&#x27;t attach to the trimmer.</li>
            <li>When I received the trimmer &amp; took it out of the box, the first thing I noticed were a lot of scratches in the paint.  </li>
            <li>It is charging now for it&#x27;s first trial run.    </li>
            <li>It wont last more than 2 shaves..</li>
            <li>This trimmer may not last 10 years, but for $15 I will gladly buy one every year.  </li>
            <li>fact that I returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift to replace the same exact model that was used for many years, but just doesn&#x27;t hold the charge.  </li>
            <li>(Remington most recently, but I prefer this Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>This broke the first time he used it.  </li>
            <li>â™¦ The trimmer is pretty light--being almost all plastic, but it fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely scraping my skin more than any trimmer should and a couple of times it has even drawn pinpricks of blood.</li>
            <li>opened the package up plugged it in went back an hour later and cut a years worth of beard off, - works good.</li>
            <li>The grade 3 on this seems pretty short; possibly OK for beards</li>
            <li>So using some simple web research, I was able to replace them using aftermarket cells.  </li>
            <li>Is working and exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expect it to do.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve grown a mustache/goatee in 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Just wanted a simple mustache trimmer, this was much more involved than I wanted or needed</li>
            <li>It needs to be oiled at first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if they sent exactly one unit off to China and said</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% sure that will not survive daily removal and re-installation --</li>
            <li>I broke one first time putting it on</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for,</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that amazon sells it.</li>
            <li>That won&#x27;t happen any more which is terrific.</li>
            <li>My first trimmer lasted for about four years, could have lasted longer if it did not fall in water.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product because I travel a lot</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for longevity then go more commercial.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a loud, cheaply made, piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>In trying to replace the first one, he many different kinds.</li>
            <li>the convenience of trimming at home or on the go is stellar-</li>
            <li>Wahl Groomsman trimmed it down to a nice, neat length - once i figured out which setting was right.</li>
            <li>Blades were sharp, held a nice charge (at first), the attachments stayed on and didn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so unless you&#x27;re really good with electronics, not easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li>The new product works great, just like the old one, except the on/off switch does not stay in the on position without being extremely careful not to touch it.  </li>
            <li>It doesnot clean it completely..</li>
            <li>After having a good go with this thing for about 10 minutes, I gave up and went back to using the big Wahl haircut clippers that I was using before.</li>
            <li>Having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916,  which i felt gave me a good trim, i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon.     </li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product that I pretty much use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d just head right out there and fix their problems and offer them refund or free future services.  </li>
            <li>It has 6 positive trim positions rather then 4 friction positions.</li>
            <li>Blades are nice and sharp and cuts really evenly without any pulling or anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great trimmer, only draw back is how loud it is</li>
            <li>So far it is just as good as my other one.</li>
            <li>this groomer is fair but the cutting head is narrower than my old norelco and the guides are not as good as the norelco.</li>
            <li>This new product does not reflect the good quality of previous models.</li>
            <li>havent let me down yet nice close shaves</li>
            <li>I use it on my head only, does a great job of trimming the hair very close and seems to be a bit easier to hold than the other.</li>
            <li>There are multiple parts that make it easy to use as well</li>
            <li>Cleaning easy with a simple knock on the sink while using.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-This is SUPER loud.</li>
            <li>Really solid unit that feels well built and is pretty comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>This product started off strong and worked well initially.    </li>
            <li>the years a large portion lot of the faux chrome has worn off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly inexpensive --</li>
            <li>Better to just fold it loosely when you put it away.</li>
            <li>The 3rd one seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, bought another Wahl razor with a lithium battery (model 9854) which worked on an initial test, just running it but not using it, which worked fine.  </li>
            <li>In case you haven&#x27;t read other reviews, it is rumored to have excellent battery life as well, but I haven&#x27;t had the trimmer long enough to test this myself.</li>
            <li>safety button on the on/off switch is a nice feature if this ends up in the hands of a little one.</li>
            <li>Does a great job even on my tough beard.</li>
            <li>good product but hard to get used too</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic shaver, but cheap clip-on trimmers don&#x27;t quite fit, so the tiny little clip breaks when you try to get it on the device.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great for a few months then simply stopped.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times but seems to work great for me.</li>
            <li>Very noisy.  </li>
            <li>After much debate, deliberation, and scraggly bearded-ness</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The motor runs quietly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Very noisy, but works.</li>
            <li>They are available from Wahl for ten bucks.    </li>
            <li>Works better than expected</li>
            <li>For the price this trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>This product really works</li>
            <li>Still could have spent $20 better.  </li>
            <li>The on/off switch felt cheap from day 1, 3 months later</li>
            <li>Wahl really lives up to their reputation.</li>
            <li>You really need the attachments.</li>
            <li>the one i received was much cheaper in quality.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain much.  </li>
            <li>I have used the trimmer only once, but it cut smooth and didn&#x27;t pull any hairs.  </li>
            <li>However, my husband complains that when he uses the trimmer, it pulls at his beard hair and rips out almost as much as it trims.</li>
            <li>My son got this for a Christmas gift and has really like it.</li>
            <li>and I was unsure about this purchase, since I don&#x27;t  know much about groomers and trimmers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s versatile, takes so much abuse and works very well.</li>
            <li>so when you disconnect the whole thing comes of the table the holder and the pieces in the holder.</li>
            <li>It comes with pieces that allow you to really customize you shaving experience.</li>
            <li>On those occasions when I do need to charge it up, it doesn&#x27;t take very</li>
            <li>Son really likes this item and would recommend this item to friends and relatives who do not like to shave.</li>
            <li>This Wahl pulls my beard hair (it is short) and my cheap Norelco never did, and still doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave much</li>
            <li>It simply broke because of cheap build quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always ready</li>
            <li>It works very well and he likes that it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>and I really canâ€™t recommend.</li>
            <li>Cuts well, but is really noisy.</li>
            <li>Almost to much power.</li>
            <li>Fast Service.  </li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I found this to be flimsy and the on&#x27;/off switch doesn&#x27;t stay on unless I have my finger on it pushing it up the whole time.</li>
            <li>I expected better</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get very close to skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I use the kit to trim my goatee and side burns and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t shave a cat with this thing because it would be too much hair</li>
            <li>Also holds a charge well and is very durable.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge very well and runs over two months on one charge when used once per week.</li>
            <li>came 1 day later than expected, but it was still a good purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not even anywhere near the commercial grade used in barber shops.  </li>
            <li>This has been used for three years for both beard and hair (crew cut every few months) and is reliable and effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It got the second star because it had lots of pieces I was able to plunder for the old Remington.</li>
            <li>I find this is very powerful for its size, does a multiple of things, use it on my mustache, keep my goatee trim and really works well for removal of any hair you don&#x27;t want there like neck hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own.</li>
            <li>They are very useful for personal trimming for females.</li>
            <li>I could have just have ordered a new charger however the cost to buy a whole new Groomsman was only two dollars more.</li>
            <li>I have actually had about 4 or 5 other trimmers after this one and none of them were as good.</li>
            <li>This one is simple, yet superior to any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>After reading all these positive reviews  I&#x27;m really looking forward to using my new  Wahl 9916-817 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer...</li>
            <li>Chaifs more than other Wahl&#x27;s I have owned.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the pre-installed adjustable guard, so I cannot say how well the other attachments work.  </li>
            <li>It cuts better than my other beard trimmer ever did.</li>
            <li>Solid, well-made, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have been very careful to make sure that the guards are attached correctly</li>
            <li>Until now I filled my expectations when well charged battery very powerful and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I looked for a replacement and it wasn&#x27;t much if any cheaper that buying a whole new trimmer, so I opted to buy the whole package.  </li>
            <li>Replacing an older Wahl that was much quieter.</li>
            <li>Keep it clean and keep it oiled and it should last you for years.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has a great feature where the on/off switch won&#x27;t come on unless you press a small button in the middle of the switch.</li>
            <li>â™¦ The thing that surprised me the most is how long it stays charged.  </li>
            <li>I read previous reviews about the battery life; most owners had good experiences but one cited a negative experience.</li>
            <li>I expected the same great performance, from this trimmer cause this was my second trimmer that i have purchased.  </li>
            <li>If you want a nice stubbly look, sort of a lazy bum in college,</li>
            <li>Target (as of Aug 20, 2006) has this exact razor (complete set) for $17.99 in the store.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any complaints from my husband so it must be working exactly as the company claims.  </li>
            <li>And, as others have said, it&#x27;s pretty loud.</li>
            <li>Not a bad piece of hardware for the price, but not meant to last.</li>
            <li>it is more than I expected!!</li>
            <li>I expected it to cut a little closer than it does though...not great for edging</li>
            <li>A PROBLEM, SNAP ON A NEW GUIDE GET AFTER IT  !</li>
            <li>This little guy packs some power, the issue I had was the guide easily moves which caused a quick trim up one side resulting in a complete removal</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a previous Wahl product - that had been dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li>The trimmer feels cheap too, and as others have noted, it&#x27;s quite loud (although the volume wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me if the thing actually did what it&#x27;s supposed to do).    </li>
            <li>Spend an extra 10 bucks and get something better and perhaps think about a different brand.  </li>
            <li>By the way, the older 9620&#x27;s have been relegated to our dog trimming duties.</li>
            <li>It does cut hair decently well though.</li>
            <li>Overall an adequate trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li>Works well, lacks refinement, decent value.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t trim particularly well.</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy which has paid for itself a few times over.</li>
            <li>I owned an older version of this razor that died after 8 years after I dropped it on a tiled floor.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t spend your money on this, look for something more expensive and of better quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This replaced an older model that I had for years.</li>
            <li>Its a great little powerful razor but its just too small.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer and amazon prime.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend product and vendor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had Wahl animal hair clippers before, and thought highly of the brand.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend both this item and the seller.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have researched this product a little more.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works fine and does a good job, but we found the slide-on head attachment very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>Little hesitant on how long it will perform, but good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this beard trimmer as a gift for my husband and unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t been great.</li>
            <li>First time I grow a beard, it does a great job cutting and trimming.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great shaver with all accessories person even fails to timely Venezuela but hundred percent and recommended d</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t loud and it trims very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The plastic blade covers are of the very cheapest quality, and the performance of the trimmer is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>It probably had another few years of life in it, on top of the two years I already got out of it.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and compact yet powerful as if it was the larger version.  </li>
            <li>This is a clear example of cheap product that is just not worth buying, because you&#x27;d end up buying another, higher quality</li>
            <li>A bit heavy, but mostly because it&#x27;s durable and well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:</li>
            <li>The actual grooming is fine, particularly the array of lengths that are possible.</li>
            <li>Repaired clipper now only pulls some hair out of my face while shaving instead of trying to rip my enitre face off out right.  </li>
            <li>Motor never worked right and it literally grabbed my beard and pulled it out in several places.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this latest one for a few months now, and it works just as well as all the previous Wahl&#x27;s - no tugging at the hairs, changes settings easily, I&#x27;m done in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>I personally like a nice tight beard and this thing holds a charge like no tomorrow.</li>
            <li>A little loud, but ok.</li>
            <li>Needed a new one.</li>
            <li>When it came time to replace them however the cost averaged around $18 (with S/H) for new blades.  </li>
            <li>It was supposed to be new, but it seemed as if it was refurbished.  </li>
            <li>but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I will not be getting a new one.</li>
            <li>I just replaced an 18 year Wahl 9916 for this new silver and shiny Wahl 9916-817.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without one now.</li>
            <li>The reason I needed a new one was the charger cord insulation broke where the cord entered the head of the charger plug and the wires were exposed.</li>
            <li>So rather than sending it in to Wahl for a battery replacement I decide to just get a new one.  </li>
            <li>Never used one before (new beard)</li>
            <li>It is very loud.</li>
            <li>and it was only a few dollars more to get the whole new set.</li>
            <li>This one is almost too sharp on the edges to get away with not having a guide - I still do it from time to time, but it&#x27;s not as comfortable as my old one.  </li>
            <li>I have only had to charge it once and it trims with better precision than other ones I have owned.</li>
            <li>My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works well and keeps my beard from getting too wild!</li>
            <li>In fact the last trimmer I had was exactly this one.  </li>
            <li>I considered, but declined to buy other more expense, name-brand trimmers such as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>went and bought another exact same model.</li>
            <li>Still not sure how to use most of the accessories, but I guess I just don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and off the back while trimming my facial hair most especially on my neck, this thing would rip into my skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the elegant design fool you--this is not a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>Yes of course, but it is not very precise and it is made of cheap parts.  </li>
            <li>but if I do, this should work just fine and last as long as I need it..  </li>
            <li>but it gets the job done... if you are looking for a completely clean look, this is not your product, but for the careless beard look it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really maintained a beard before, but I am very satisfied with this little</li>
            <li>Hubby&#x27;s old trimmer broke and needed a new one.</li>
            <li>â™¦ The sound is moderate--not quiet, but not loud.</li>
            <li>The first and only time I attached one, it didn&#x27;t even completely attach.    </li>
            <li>Excennent Trimmer, i use it for mustache &amp; hair trimming, thid is my second one, i tried others, and this one has the best Blade, the Batteries went bad in the first one, i kept the Blade for a back up.</li>
            <li>It is super loud, and it will &amp;#34;get you&amp;#34; every now and then if you use it on your neck (not enough to draw blood, but it&#x27;ll leave a red mark for a while.)</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this I figured it had more than enough positive reviews to outweigh the negative, but I was so,</li>
            <li>The accessories are a little flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li>plastic stand is a little cheap.  </li>
            <li>Very clean cutting and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and they are still working and cutting great...</li>
            <li>Use them nearly every day with no trouble.</li>
            <li>This is a direct replacement for an identical groomer.</li>
            <li>I just wish I hadn&#x27;t lost the charger for my old one.</li>
            <li>He has an old Wahl trimmer with slip-on trimmer guides, and we will just keep using that.  </li>
            <li>I used to use my old one without the guides on my face for that in between shaved and not shaved look.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer was on the fritz</li>
            <li>He looks neat and professional.</li>
            <li>We bought this trimmer for our son, he really likes it, Especially the beard comb.</li>
            <li>No rust yet, nothing needing fixed.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had to recharge after about a month.</li>
            <li>I moved and lost my old trimmer to movers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I should have to pay shipping for repairs for anything under 1 year old.  </li>
            <li>I developed a rash in my trimming areas...</li>
            <li>Loud.</li>
            <li>I also shave my head frequently</li>
            <li>Fast and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>(box has it marked as a 9916-4301 rather than 9916-817) from a brick and mortar retailer.</li>
            <li>and I expect it to go for 18-20 years just like the old one.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer is loud and pulls on the beard hairs.</li>
            <li>Once battery is used up, it will not run directly from the wall until the battery is recharged.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old cheapo Norelco that I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Each pass is at a snails pace compared to my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I have an old bathroom with no electrical outlets.</li>
            <li>I brought my Wahl beard trimmer at AMAZON, after my old one, not a Wahl, died of old age.  </li>
            <li>I used it once a week for nearly two months on the charge out of the box.</li>
            <li>Just the basic adjustable beard thinning head and the straight trimming edge without any plastic head attached has met all my needs.  </li>
            <li>Recommended to anyone who wants an inexpensive, basic, reliable beard trimmer that holds a battery charge well.</li>
            <li>you plan to use it with one of the fixed guides or without a guide</li>
            <li>Bought to replace my old wahl,piece of junk,looking for something else.combs are so flimsy</li>
            <li>I have an old one from about 8 years bought it at Sears, until stop working</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>Getting used to all the settings, as his old trimmer died, and was 6 years old.</li>
            <li>My old Conair unit required a recharge every week or two. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m scared to put this trimmer near my face.</li>
            <li>--old one was 12 yrs old</li>
            <li>I have been trimming my beard about once per week for nearly 40 years now.  </li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement for another battery powered Wahl that was 20 years old.</li>
            <li>but is 3 times as loud as my old one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done the job so far.</li>
            <li>He had an old Wahl trimmer that he had for over 20 years until it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I had an old one ,sameish model, it broke after 15 years, so i am replacing it.</li>
            <li>It cuts, but has to go over the hair several times before really working, and it has the tendancy to pull hair every now and then.</li>
            <li>Runs faster than my old battery operated one.  </li>
            <li>I have had no problems with the item so far nor do I expect to.</li>
            <li>We should be able rate these without being forced ot write something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Wahl trimmer for over 20 years &amp; it finnally wore out this new one is sleakly styled, much sharper with long battery life</li>
            <li>That usually happens when it&#x27;s pretty long and my old cheap trimmer couldn&#x27;t handle it or hold a charge anymore.</li>
            <li>I use it for little trims to clean up a bit around mustache.  </li>
            <li>Remind them that a little more plastic goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li>an extra star for being able to run either corded or cordless, small size..</li>
            <li>The newer version does not have the same quality of manufacturing as the older model.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for a gift or personal use.</li>
            <li>Disappointed does line very good</li>
            <li>Major Inconvenience!  </li>
            <li>PRODUCT HAS A CHEAP SWITCH THAT HAS TO BE CONTINUALLY PUSHED FORWARD IS TO SMALL AND MUST BE HELD TO CONTINUE RUNNING.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is solid and great quality, but the attachments are difficult to attach and detach, feel flimsy, and takeaway from the overall quality.</li>
            <li>I normally keep very short beard through out the year.</li>
            <li>The attachments fit very firmly.</li>
            <li>Only reason I needed a new one was I lost the charger in a move</li>
            <li>attachments are good, but my usual &amp;#34;size&amp;#34; tended to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; my beard, so I went to a small size and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was a little higher than I had figured, but it is something I can live with.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>so the brand itself was a major attraction to me, as well as the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that I nearly broke it trying to get it on, and now it&#x27;s on there like glue, and I&#x27;m afraid taking it off the first time</li>
            <li>They last and last and perform like new every time!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect this one to last that long, but it&#x27;s still a reasonable replacement and value.</li>
            <li>Loses charge pretty fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sitting here waiting on my old set to take a charge because it only works for 5 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>As far as the various combs are concerned, I&#x27;ve never had one of them break on me.</li>
            <li>This is my second one, The first lasted a long time and then I bought a different one when it quit and what POS that was.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok in a pinch if he&#x27;s desperate, but we will definitely need to purchase a higher quality trimmer for frequent use.</li>
            <li>Same pulling action.</li>
            <li>Same pulling action.</li>
            <li>Barely cuts anything.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets purchasing this.</li>
            <li>I have had the unit for three months and have only recharged it once so far.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Conair rechargeable that finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>I hate to sound like an old guy, but this is one of those many products that gets cheaper and flimsier over time.  </li>
            <li>The pieces don&#x27;t allow for very precise trimming and overall, I&#x27;m just not very impressed.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, but it does not work in certain directions.</li>
            <li>I typically just use it for a few minutes at a time, so I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in; nevertheless, it still stays charged for many days.</li>
            <li>Buying a new one costs less then having a new battery put in.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time, the trimmer is exact, but there are really no directions about how to use this.  </li>
            <li>The only shortcoming with this trimmer in my experience so far is that the instructions don&#x27;t provide examples or directions for using the various attachments and their intended use is unclear to me.  </li>
            <li>was interested in this trimmer because it has blades you can replace instead of purchasing a new trimmer when it becomes dull.  </li>
            <li>But my experience with the Wahl 817 beard and moustache trimmer over the past eight months - from initial trimming of a new beard to preparing to shave it off for the summer - has been quite positive.    </li>
            <li>If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li>After 7 months, and a couple of months off because I had my beard &amp; mustache professionally trimmed, it would not work, no matter how long I charged it up.  </li>
            <li>I tried using once and found it lacking, the head is not wide enough for my taste.</li>
            <li>The only negative I can think of is that you need to be careful when you remove and replace the head to make sure that you haven&#x27;t inadvertently changed the setting that controls the length of the cut.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not amazing.</li>
            <li>This unit is much louder in operation than the previous one was.</li>
            <li>The blade teeth are TINY, and I could barely make it through one beard trim without immediately stopping and putting it back in the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only major draw back that I personally found was the noise level.</li>
            <li>My beard is probably about average in terms of thickness, and all this thing really did was push the hairs around and just glide over them, only clipping the occasional patch here and there.</li>
            <li>you hold it in some bad direction, and/or use more pressure than needed, it can easily hurt your face or neck&#x27;s skin, leaving little scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Razors are really irritating to my skin but using this trimmer without any attachments felt fine.    </li>
            <li>Mainly use it to trim up my beard or trim down neck hair.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy pulled hair and very slow trimming, this is the trimmer for you.  </li>
            <li>the 3 single length attachments were just right but not fit the mustache trimmer  </li>

            <li> The photo in the advertised item shows the kind of trimmer attachment I have been trying to replace.  </li>
            <li> I just charge it up and then put all the charger and stand away and leave this handy in the bathroom and use it once a week or so.</li>
            <li> He really likes it, very nice!</li>
            <li> Very nice razor and very powerful</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve tried others but this particular wahl trimmer is the best.</li>
            <li> Not much of a negative for this excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it again and at such a good price!  </li>
            <li> Great item, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> His beard looks amazing, too :)</li>
            <li> More trim length options would be nice.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have owned so far.</li>
            <li> I tried it on his head hair because that&#x27;s very fine hair.</li>
            <li> it is a great little trimmer and priced perfect.  </li>
            <li> , clean trim.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Quality build/good feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works great and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works great and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> At first it was great.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly, Wahl makes a good product I feel I can count on and feel good about the pruchase !</li>
            <li> Used to trim with scissors, but this thing is very precise</li>
            <li> /&gt;Several attachments come in a handy pouch for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The three different sized grooming tools are perfect for anything that I need.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It was one of his favorite Christmas gifts</li>
            <li> Works great but is real noisy.</li>
            <li> In fact, this trimmer gave me a more even trim than I&#x27;ve even gotten with razors.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> I trim my beard, collarline and around a prominent mole on my chin safely.</li>
            <li> What more do you need??</li>
            <li> Is fully function able and stylish.</li>
            <li> but I was eventually able to get rid of the sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps you can get a better one for more money but for price performance I&#x27;ll stick with this one.</li>
            <li> more can I</li>
            <li> The rechargeable trimmer is okay.  </li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s pro-grade, couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li> - I like it better tham others I have used</li>
            <li> Why spend more money when this trimmer does it all well.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on his mustache thinking it might work better on that thickness of hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I&#x27;ve owned Wahl products that have lasted decades, and the size seemed more appropriate for beard trimming than my aging Color Pro.</li>
            <li> I just prefer fewer moving parts, and a fixed 1/2&amp;#34; attachment would have been ideal.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> The product looked like good quality based on the pictures, but when it arrived, the quality was clear.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy, powerful motor, hasn&#x27;t needed recharging after 6 weeks of trims.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had a Wahl trimmer for many years.  </li>
            <li> Seems to cut okay.</li>
            <li> so far so good , my husband doesnt grow much hair on his face , so its perfect for his needs..</li>
            <li> This is one of my all times favorites and i will gladly recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> More ever it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> The charge holds forever on this thing, and the movement is extremely fast so it makes for a great beard and stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> There probably are too many attachments.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any others i have used.  </li>
            <li> It has everything you want from a trimmer with the exception of the overwhelming noise it produces.</li>
            <li> Have purchased items on Amazon before and have always been pleased with products and service.</li>
            <li> It is not the most fancy or heavyweight item but in a pinch this helps to keep a neat face.</li>
            <li> Would work better if she would be still. :-)</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll do better research this time and go buy another trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li> Husband says it pulls on the hair more then trimming it..</li>
            <li> and so does my girlfriend, so what could be better?</li>
            <li> So we wont be able to try till</li>
            <li> Most suck and pull hair, or the guard falls off and you end up as patch Adams...</li>
            <li> so glad his straggly hairs are gone.</li>
            <li> He had a Wahl many years ago and it finally wore out , he bought another brand and all it did was pull his beard, and I did research and bought another Wahl for he , he is very happy</li>
            <li> But like most things they do wear out over time.</li>
            <li> Buy it and you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Trust me, this will give you a better trim than most others.</li>
            <li> On time delivery and better quality than expexted.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say great quality!</li>
            <li> I have been trimming with this for a while now and have had very clean results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent seller I am satisfied with the purchase , it is what I expected</li>
            <li> Works great so far!</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I haven&#x27;t observed any problems, it is sharp and has a good variety of clip-ons.</li>
            <li> The product works great for an old bald guy with mustach and bead.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, it hurts.</li>
            <li> While the old trimmer did an acceptable job this one does an excellent one, I could see the difference with the first trim.  </li>
            <li> I wish the attachments fit better.</li>
            <li> Lighter, more ergonomic in the hand, but the build quality seems cheap compared to the 8 year-old Wahl Groomsman it replaced.  </li>
            <li> A good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Still, it does a good job, and you really don&#x27;t need to remove the piece.</li>
            <li> very smooth dosnt pull the hair clean cut and has lots of power</li>
            <li> As other reviews have pointed out, the plastic attachments for this aren&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li> just added a star because I remember the price and at that cost I&#x27;m getting more than my money&#x27;s worth out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> women said I look better clean shaved with no rash...</li>
            <li> It has a variety of trimmings attachments making it easy to get the look you want.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li> this is an easy to use trimmer.</li>
            <li> Compact design makes it easy to guide around beard and mustache&lt;</li>
            <li> but i found if you get it off from the side its easy...</li>
            <li> Its does not detach from plug easily</li>
            <li> So easy to do that</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Take it easy and be patient.  </li>
            <li> Works amazingly easy.  </li>
            <li> many pieces-parts don&#x27;t fit in the holder well, nor is it easy to figure out how they were intended to fit.</li>
            <li> The accompanying &amp;#34;trimming lengths&amp;#34; wont&#x27;t be that easy to put in and remove.</li>
            <li> I used the 6 to 1 guide attachment and it adjusts easily</li>
            <li> It is a real good buy, I have had a few and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li> Rusted very quickly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy with Groomsman Beard and Mustache.</li>
            <li> Would recommend strongly to invest in a better/heavier duty trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer with nice range of attachments for various trimming lengths.</li>
            <li> Good enough trimmers - nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> The newer motor is not as strong.</li>
            <li> Son is thrilled with this--it was VERY reasonable.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t also make me wealthy, good looking, better at sports, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The attachments are all still intact and working just fine...</li>
            <li> The guards click on easily and stay securely in place, allowing for a worry-free trim.</li>
            <li> Everything else is fine.  </li>
            <li> Fine product indeed.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to throw into your luggage for trips and vacation.</li>
            <li> First off I thought it felt kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job at trimming my beard and side burns.</li>
            <li> Use of the trimmer has been  fine in meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery too!</li>
            <li> Great, but super loud.</li>
            <li> This little guy is perfect.</li>
            <li> This Wahl Trimmer was not as good as the professional ones I had used but for the price, it trims fine.  </li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li> The item shipped on time and the product I received was accurate to the manufacturer&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li> THe accessories are cheap.</li>
            <li> Does not feel cheap and battery</li>
            <li> My son said it works great for his facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read complaints of them being too cheap, but if they were sturdier (thicker) they would not work as well.  </li>
            <li> : For the short period that it did work, it worked great.</li>
            <li> If one should, they are available from Wahl for five bucks a set.    </li>
            <li> 1/16&amp;#34; guard was so warped that it didn&#x27;t fit and broke upon installation.</li>
            <li> Hold&#x27;s up great, will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t built cheap razors, but I guarntee my work for the lifetime of my customers at my expense.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my current purchase, performs as good as the old one.  </li>
            <li> Feels solid, cuts great and holds charge</li>
            <li> The plastic guide IS cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually, which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped.</li>
            <li> Cheap stand.</li>
            <li> Now I have a primary and backup trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer, which I use once a week, does not hold a charge but for two trimmings of a light beard.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade.</li>
            <li> clipper add tons are cheap and break easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two plastic tabs meant to secure it in place</li>
            <li> I complain about cheap quality of the accesories, almost break the multiposition accessory trying to put in machine.</li>
            <li> Great for a low end shaver</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It does not stay securely  in the on position.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER - I dropped it and the head internals broke since it was cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Never buying another cheap Wahl.</li>
            <li> Plastic piece won&#x27;t fit over the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Attachments are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, best brand out there</li>
            <li> Somewhat cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Instead, I got some cheap battery operated version.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean and packs well for traveling</li>
            <li> Works great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, and it trimmed my face hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect item, could not have asked for anything more kit comes with everything needed to keep a clear appearance daily</li>
            <li> AND IT WORKS FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> But it was cheap, and it does work, with a bit of effort.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of power and the battery life so far has been good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I LOVED the trimmer compared to an old Remington trimmer that I had.</li>
            <li> This photograph resembles the one that I used to have, but nothing about it is anywhere near as good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good product...just loud.</li>
            <li> The price was right, It should give me many years of use.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard clean but feels cheap in my hands.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Have used many Wahl products over last 25 years &amp; this exact Groomsman Beard for many years &amp; have always been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be a haply returning Wahl customer as I&#x27;ve owned my first Wahl hair clipper set I received as a Christmas gift..</li>
            <li> raised the stars rating from 2 to 4, because this thing has lasted in almost original condition for about three years.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the first</li>
            <li> Although the stand is space friendly, the attachments keep popping out every time when I take out the razor.</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far</li>
            <li> Had the first for many years; so, I got my money out of that one.</li>
            <li> Just keep the blades clean and oil them as you should.</li>
            <li> clean shaved....SORRY.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s better than the old one that cost more.</li>
            <li> I use it to keep goatee trimmed and clean.  </li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t give a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is supper easy to get your beard or mustache the right</li>
            <li> The way it trims and cuts, there&#x27;s nothin special about it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I am doing right now!</li>
            <li> Very good results with just a few passes over my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to win any power contests, but you just need a small motor for most</li>
            <li> --  good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I own a 9916, a 9918 and two old 9620&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Only guard that fit properly was the all-in-one adjustable one that clipped on perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the Wahl trimmers, The last one lasted 13 years.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use and more power.  </li>
            <li> Now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom, or finding a razor that can survive real world use.    </li>
            <li> Clipper is kind of loud and hair goes flying.</li>
            <li> Husband is completely satisfied (and he is very picky).  </li>
            <li> I love it, very practical.</li>
            <li> It grew blunt and then died after two years which is fair enough for the price I suppose.</li>
            <li> gave it a full charge before I started using it and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it yet</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure I had a real impression of it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well, have gone from keeping full beard trimmed and neat to maintaining stuble.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so totally cool.</li>
            <li> I eventually got a different trimmer, but it wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> Customer service says no bad batch of product &amp; offer no assistance that matters.</li>
            <li> Battery is still going strong, months after my first charge.  </li>
            <li> attachments are just adequate.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly for a gift.</li>
            <li> I suspect this will last me many more</li>
            <li> I would not buy one again and I will find a replacement quickly.</li>
            <li> This one sits in the charger and I just grab it for a quick trim.</li>
            <li> Now I can get it done and over with quickly.</li>
            <li> The 6-position guide is super flimsy and again, non-intuitive.  </li>
            <li> After using it regularly all this time, I give it excellent marks for durability, ease of use, and overall value.</li>
            <li> have not tried those other products, so it&#x27;s possible they are really excellent as well, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me worth it to pay twice as much for the name</li>
            <li> I could not get some of the attachments to fit but the main trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li> has a good charger and can be used after its charged;  came promptly as promised ;  it has a full set of attachements to allow triming longer hair to a constant length ; works good but the attachments are hard to get off and put on but not impossible; would order again for sure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present for my partner, and he is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It has all the same features as the older model and works great.</li>
            <li> Works better than new.</li>
            <li> was going to return it before even giving it a try as it felt like it came out of a Cracker Jack box, but I decided to give it a shot, to my suprise it actually worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer head depth heads, which were better than the new ones even fit !</li>
            <li> The 6 position trimmer guide allows you to keep it nice and tight or a more on the lengthy side.</li>
            <li> Great Little razor.  </li>
            <li> If your like me and have a beard that isn&#x27;t super thick and just want to trim it up, good grab!</li>
            <li> a cheap trimmer that works great for personal use but would not hold up to commercial use.</li>
            <li> Definately a great price this was the same cost as a cheap 1 at the local department stores.</li>
            <li> Also very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel like the cheaper trimmers available on the market.</li>
            <li> I honestly wish I could find a set of beard and mustache trimmers that will actually work.</li>
            <li> Using the internet to sift through all of the choices was worth a lot of time going throught stores that did not have all of the choices.  </li>
            <li> This product was well worth the money paid for it.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Well worth it IMHO.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer has much more power than my old one.</li>
            <li> If not for the battery life alone, it is worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice price, quality product, cheaper than the big box store</li>
            <li> It is powerful.</li>
            <li> If this lasts for awhile then this beard trimmer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this beard trimmer - it&#x27;s simple, sturdy, cheap, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The blade guards fit very well, and the adjustable guard has a very positive catch at each setting.</li>
            <li> However, this is perfect if you just want to trim yourself down to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look like myself using the bare trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the change because the Whal preforms much better then the other brand.</li>
            <li> Other then that its been useful and a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> The batteries are still good, still holding a decent charge - I charge it up only when it needs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Wahl products and found them to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li> I wrestled it out of its packaging and plugged it in right away.</li>
            <li> Just do it in the shower right before I take a bath.</li>
            <li> Opened it up and found the right setting right off the bat.</li>
            <li> Works great, just as described and pictured, I&#x27;ve been using WAHL products for about 30 years and as usual they got it right</li>
            <li> Great battery life, small and portable</li>
            <li> One of the best things is the battery which holds a charge extremely well meaning the trimmers can be used without the cord for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Awesome little shaver if you want to keep facial hair tirned to a mangable length</li>
            <li> I have used this little trimmer extensively, and have found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li> A great quality trimmer/groomer, I have had this piece for 2 years and it still holds a charge and powers through coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Runs at a fast speed to get the trimming done quickly.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and super efficient.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> so I bought another bigger, all in one cordless trimmer that I love and  use just fine for my beard and  fits all my other needs better.</li>
            <li> It is replacing a battery powered Wahl unit that was over 15 years old and still working fine until the switch broke.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, very sharp blades, the chrome top is sculpted in front of the trimming edge to hold cut hair until you deposit it in the sink or on a towel, it has a nice rubberly grip, it&#x27;s not too loud, charges fast and holds a good charge for a long time so I don&#x27;t have to keep it plugged in or on the charger (makes my bathroom sink neater) and the red LED confirms it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good little trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looked good at first but started getting a little</li>
            <li> Powerful and precise, feels great in my hand, and leaves the scruff looking tough!</li>
            <li> All around great little trimmer especially for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> My husband never got to use this beard trimmer, as the clip-on thing broke first try.  </li>
            <li> I thought the smaller, narrower blade of the Groomsman would make it easier for me to get the contours around and under my jaw line, but no, the big hair clippers do an *infinitely* better (cleaner, faster, more thorough) job.    </li>
            <li> After the over night of charging and many dreams of a well kept face rug I finally got to using it.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was attach the adjustable length attachment.</li>
            <li> I was pretty unhappy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> This Wahl beard trimmer provides an even and consistent trim with comfort and ease.</li>
            <li> The first blade guard he tried to use wouldn&#x27;t attach to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> When I received the trimmer &amp; took it out of the box, the first thing I noticed were a lot of scratches in the paint.  </li>
            <li> It is charging now for it&#x27;s first trial run.    </li>
            <li> It wont last more than 2 shaves..</li>
            <li> This trimmer may not last 10 years, but for $15 I will gladly buy one every year.  </li>
            <li> fact that I returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift to replace the same exact model that was used for many years, but just doesn&#x27;t hold the charge.  </li>
            <li> (Remington most recently, but I prefer this Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> This broke the first time he used it.  </li>
            <li> â™¦ The trimmer is pretty light--being almost all plastic, but it fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely scraping my skin more than any trimmer should and a couple of times it has even drawn pinpricks of blood.</li>
            <li> opened the package up plugged it in went back an hour later and cut a years worth of beard off, - works good.</li>
            <li> The grade 3 on this seems pretty short; possibly OK for beards</li>
            <li> So using some simple web research, I was able to replace them using aftermarket cells.  </li>
            <li> Is working and exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expect it to do.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve grown a mustache/goatee in 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Just wanted a simple mustache trimmer, this was much more involved than I wanted or needed</li>
            <li> It needs to be oiled at first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if they sent exactly one unit off to China and said</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% sure that will not survive daily removal and re-installation --</li>
            <li> I broke one first time putting it on</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for,</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> That won&#x27;t happen any more which is terrific.</li>
            <li> My first trimmer lasted for about four years, could have lasted longer if it did not fall in water.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product because I travel a lot</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for longevity then go more commercial.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a loud, cheaply made, piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> In trying to replace the first one, he many different kinds.</li>
            <li> the convenience of trimming at home or on the go is stellar-</li>
            <li> Wahl Groomsman trimmed it down to a nice, neat length - once i figured out which setting was right.</li>
            <li> Blades were sharp, held a nice charge (at first), the attachments stayed on and didn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so unless you&#x27;re really good with electronics, not easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li> The new product works great, just like the old one, except the on/off switch does not stay in the on position without being extremely careful not to touch it.  </li>
            <li> It doesnot clean it completely..</li>
            <li> After having a good go with this thing for about 10 minutes, I gave up and went back to using the big Wahl haircut clippers that I was using before.</li>
            <li> Having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916,  which i felt gave me a good trim, i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon.     </li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product that I pretty much use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d just head right out there and fix their problems and offer them refund or free future services.  </li>
            <li> It has 6 positive trim positions rather then 4 friction positions.</li>
            <li> Blades are nice and sharp and cuts really evenly without any pulling or anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer, only draw back is how loud it is</li>
            <li> So far it is just as good as my other one.</li>
            <li> this groomer is fair but the cutting head is narrower than my old norelco and the guides are not as good as the norelco.</li>
            <li> This new product does not reflect the good quality of previous models.</li>
            <li> havent let me down yet nice close shaves</li>
            <li> I use it on my head only, does a great job of trimming the hair very close and seems to be a bit easier to hold than the other.</li>
            <li> There are multiple parts that make it easy to use as well</li>
            <li> Cleaning easy with a simple knock on the sink while using.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-This is SUPER loud.</li>
            <li> Really solid unit that feels well built and is pretty comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> This product started off strong and worked well initially.    </li>
            <li> the years a large portion lot of the faux chrome has worn off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly inexpensive --</li>
            <li> Better to just fold it loosely when you put it away.</li>
            <li> The 3rd one seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, bought another Wahl razor with a lithium battery (model 9854) which worked on an initial test, just running it but not using it, which worked fine.  </li>
            <li> In case you haven&#x27;t read other reviews, it is rumored to have excellent battery life as well, but I haven&#x27;t had the trimmer long enough to test this myself.</li>
            <li> safety button on the on/off switch is a nice feature if this ends up in the hands of a little one.</li>
            <li> Does a great job even on my tough beard.</li>
            <li> good product but hard to get used too</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaver, but cheap clip-on trimmers don&#x27;t quite fit, so the tiny little clip breaks when you try to get it on the device.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great for a few months then simply stopped.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but seems to work great for me.</li>
            <li> Very noisy.  </li>
            <li> After much debate, deliberation, and scraggly bearded-ness</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The motor runs quietly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Very noisy, but works.</li>
            <li> They are available from Wahl for ten bucks.    </li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> For the price this trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> This product really works</li>
            <li> Still could have spent $20 better.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch felt cheap from day 1, 3 months later</li>
            <li> Wahl really lives up to their reputation.</li>
            <li> You really need the attachments.</li>
            <li> the one i received was much cheaper in quality.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t complain much.  </li>
            <li> I have used the trimmer only once, but it cut smooth and didn&#x27;t pull any hairs.  </li>
            <li> However, my husband complains that when he uses the trimmer, it pulls at his beard hair and rips out almost as much as it trims.</li>
            <li> My son got this for a Christmas gift and has really like it.</li>
            <li> and I was unsure about this purchase, since I don&#x27;t  know much about groomers and trimmers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s versatile, takes so much abuse and works very well.</li>
            <li> so when you disconnect the whole thing comes of the table the holder and the pieces in the holder.</li>
            <li> It comes with pieces that allow you to really customize you shaving experience.</li>
            <li> On those occasions when I do need to charge it up, it doesn&#x27;t take very</li>
            <li> Son really likes this item and would recommend this item to friends and relatives who do not like to shave.</li>
            <li> This Wahl pulls my beard hair (it is short) and my cheap Norelco never did, and still doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave much</li>
            <li> It simply broke because of cheap build quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always ready</li>
            <li> It works very well and he likes that it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> and I really canâ€™t recommend.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, but is really noisy.</li>
            <li> Almost to much power.</li>
            <li> Fast Service.  </li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I found this to be flimsy and the on&#x27;/off switch doesn&#x27;t stay on unless I have my finger on it pushing it up the whole time.</li>
            <li> I expected better</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very close to skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I use the kit to trim my goatee and side burns and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t shave a cat with this thing because it would be too much hair</li>
            <li> Also holds a charge well and is very durable.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge very well and runs over two months on one charge when used once per week.</li>
            <li> came 1 day later than expected, but it was still a good purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not even anywhere near the commercial grade used in barber shops.  </li>
            <li> This has been used for three years for both beard and hair (crew cut every few months) and is reliable and effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got the second star because it had lots of pieces I was able to plunder for the old Remington.</li>
            <li> I find this is very powerful for its size, does a multiple of things, use it on my mustache, keep my goatee trim and really works well for removal of any hair you don&#x27;t want there like neck hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own.</li>
            <li> They are very useful for personal trimming for females.</li>
            <li> I could have just have ordered a new charger however the cost to buy a whole new Groomsman was only two dollars more.</li>
            <li> I have actually had about 4 or 5 other trimmers after this one and none of them were as good.</li>
            <li> This one is simple, yet superior to any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> After reading all these positive reviews  I&#x27;m really looking forward to using my new  Wahl 9916-817 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer...</li>
            <li> Chaifs more than other Wahl&#x27;s I have owned.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the pre-installed adjustable guard, so I cannot say how well the other attachments work.  </li>
            <li> It cuts better than my other beard trimmer ever did.</li>
            <li> Solid, well-made, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have been very careful to make sure that the guards are attached correctly</li>
            <li> Until now I filled my expectations when well charged battery very powerful and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I looked for a replacement and it wasn&#x27;t much if any cheaper that buying a whole new trimmer, so I opted to buy the whole package.  </li>
            <li> Replacing an older Wahl that was much quieter.</li>
            <li> Keep it clean and keep it oiled and it should last you for years.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a great feature where the on/off switch won&#x27;t come on unless you press a small button in the middle of the switch.</li>
            <li> â™¦ The thing that surprised me the most is how long it stays charged.  </li>
            <li> I read previous reviews about the battery life; most owners had good experiences but one cited a negative experience.</li>
            <li> I expected the same great performance, from this trimmer cause this was my second trimmer that i have purchased.  </li>
            <li> If you want a nice stubbly look, sort of a lazy bum in college,</li>
            <li> Target (as of Aug 20, 2006) has this exact razor (complete set) for $17.99 in the store.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any complaints from my husband so it must be working exactly as the company claims.  </li>
            <li> And, as others have said, it&#x27;s pretty loud.</li>
            <li> Not a bad piece of hardware for the price, but not meant to last.</li>
            <li> it is more than I expected!!</li>
            <li> I expected it to cut a little closer than it does though...not great for edging</li>
            <li> A PROBLEM, SNAP ON A NEW GUIDE GET AFTER IT  !</li>
            <li> This little guy packs some power, the issue I had was the guide easily moves which caused a quick trim up one side resulting in a complete removal</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a previous Wahl product - that had been dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li> The trimmer feels cheap too, and as others have noted, it&#x27;s quite loud (although the volume wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me if the thing actually did what it&#x27;s supposed to do).    </li>
            <li> Spend an extra 10 bucks and get something better and perhaps think about a different brand.  </li>
            <li> By the way, the older 9620&#x27;s have been relegated to our dog trimming duties.</li>
            <li> It does cut hair decently well though.</li>
            <li> Overall an adequate trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well, lacks refinement, decent value.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim particularly well.</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy which has paid for itself a few times over.</li>
            <li> I owned an older version of this razor that died after 8 years after I dropped it on a tiled floor.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t spend your money on this, look for something more expensive and of better quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This replaced an older model that I had for years.</li>
            <li> Its a great little powerful razor but its just too small.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer and amazon prime.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product and vendor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had Wahl animal hair clippers before, and thought highly of the brand.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend both this item and the seller.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have researched this product a little more.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works fine and does a good job, but we found the slide-on head attachment very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Little hesitant on how long it will perform, but good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this beard trimmer as a gift for my husband and unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t been great.</li>
            <li> First time I grow a beard, it does a great job cutting and trimming.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great shaver with all accessories person even fails to timely Venezuela but hundred percent and recommended d</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t loud and it trims very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic blade covers are of the very cheapest quality, and the performance of the trimmer is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> It probably had another few years of life in it, on top of the two years I already got out of it.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and compact yet powerful as if it was the larger version.  </li>
            <li> This is a clear example of cheap product that is just not worth buying, because you&#x27;d end up buying another, higher quality</li>
            <li> A bit heavy, but mostly because it&#x27;s durable and well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:</li>
            <li> The actual grooming is fine, particularly the array of lengths that are possible.</li>
            <li> Repaired clipper now only pulls some hair out of my face while shaving instead of trying to rip my enitre face off out right.  </li>
            <li> Motor never worked right and it literally grabbed my beard and pulled it out in several places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this latest one for a few months now, and it works just as well as all the previous Wahl&#x27;s - no tugging at the hairs, changes settings easily, I&#x27;m done in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> I personally like a nice tight beard and this thing holds a charge like no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> A little loud, but ok.</li>
            <li> Needed a new one.</li>
            <li> When it came time to replace them however the cost averaged around $18 (with S/H) for new blades.  </li>
            <li> It was supposed to be new, but it seemed as if it was refurbished.  </li>
            <li> but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I will not be getting a new one.</li>
            <li> I just replaced an 18 year Wahl 9916 for this new silver and shiny Wahl 9916-817.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without one now.</li>
            <li> The reason I needed a new one was the charger cord insulation broke where the cord entered the head of the charger plug and the wires were exposed.</li>
            <li> So rather than sending it in to Wahl for a battery replacement I decide to just get a new one.  </li>
            <li> Never used one before (new beard)</li>
            <li> It is very loud.</li>
            <li> and it was only a few dollars more to get the whole new set.</li>
            <li> This one is almost too sharp on the edges to get away with not having a guide - I still do it from time to time, but it&#x27;s not as comfortable as my old one.  </li>
            <li> I have only had to charge it once and it trims with better precision than other ones I have owned.</li>
            <li> My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well and keeps my beard from getting too wild!</li>
            <li> In fact the last trimmer I had was exactly this one.  </li>
            <li> I considered, but declined to buy other more expense, name-brand trimmers such as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> went and bought another exact same model.</li>
            <li> Still not sure how to use most of the accessories, but I guess I just don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and off the back while trimming my facial hair most especially on my neck, this thing would rip into my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the elegant design fool you--this is not a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> Yes of course, but it is not very precise and it is made of cheap parts.  </li>
            <li> but if I do, this should work just fine and last as long as I need it..  </li>
            <li> but it gets the job done... if you are looking for a completely clean look, this is not your product, but for the careless beard look it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really maintained a beard before, but I am very satisfied with this little</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s old trimmer broke and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> â™¦ The sound is moderate--not quiet, but not loud.</li>
            <li> The first and only time I attached one, it didn&#x27;t even completely attach.    </li>
            <li> Excennent Trimmer, i use it for mustache &amp; hair trimming, thid is my second one, i tried others, and this one has the best Blade, the Batteries went bad in the first one, i kept the Blade for a back up.</li>
            <li> It is super loud, and it will &amp;#34;get you&amp;#34; every now and then if you use it on your neck (not enough to draw blood, but it&#x27;ll leave a red mark for a while.)</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I figured it had more than enough positive reviews to outweigh the negative, but I was so,</li>
            <li> The accessories are a little flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li> plastic stand is a little cheap.  </li>
            <li> Very clean cutting and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and they are still working and cutting great...</li>
            <li> Use them nearly every day with no trouble.</li>
            <li> This is a direct replacement for an identical groomer.</li>
            <li> I just wish I hadn&#x27;t lost the charger for my old one.</li>
            <li> He has an old Wahl trimmer with slip-on trimmer guides, and we will just keep using that.  </li>
            <li> I used to use my old one without the guides on my face for that in between shaved and not shaved look.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer was on the fritz</li>
            <li> He looks neat and professional.</li>
            <li> We bought this trimmer for our son, he really likes it, Especially the beard comb.</li>
            <li> No rust yet, nothing needing fixed.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had to recharge after about a month.</li>
            <li> I moved and lost my old trimmer to movers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I should have to pay shipping for repairs for anything under 1 year old.  </li>
            <li> I developed a rash in my trimming areas...</li>
            <li> Loud.</li>
            <li> I also shave my head frequently</li>
            <li> Fast and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> (box has it marked as a 9916-4301 rather than 9916-817) from a brick and mortar retailer.</li>
            <li> and I expect it to go for 18-20 years just like the old one.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is loud and pulls on the beard hairs.</li>
            <li> Once battery is used up, it will not run directly from the wall until the battery is recharged.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old cheapo Norelco that I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Each pass is at a snails pace compared to my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have an old bathroom with no electrical outlets.</li>
            <li> I brought my Wahl beard trimmer at AMAZON, after my old one, not a Wahl, died of old age.  </li>
            <li> I used it once a week for nearly two months on the charge out of the box.</li>
            <li> Just the basic adjustable beard thinning head and the straight trimming edge without any plastic head attached has met all my needs.  </li>
            <li> Recommended to anyone who wants an inexpensive, basic, reliable beard trimmer that holds a battery charge well.</li>
            <li> you plan to use it with one of the fixed guides or without a guide</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my old wahl,piece of junk,looking for something else.combs are so flimsy</li>
            <li> I have an old one from about 8 years bought it at Sears, until stop working</li>
            <li> Arrived early.</li>
            <li> Getting used to all the settings, as his old trimmer died, and was 6 years old.</li>
            <li> My old Conair unit required a recharge every week or two. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m scared to put this trimmer near my face.</li>
            <li> --old one was 12 yrs old</li>
            <li> I have been trimming my beard about once per week for nearly 40 years now.  </li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for another battery powered Wahl that was 20 years old.</li>
            <li> but is 3 times as loud as my old one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done the job so far.</li>
            <li> He had an old Wahl trimmer that he had for over 20 years until it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I had an old one ,sameish model, it broke after 15 years, so i am replacing it.</li>
            <li> It cuts, but has to go over the hair several times before really working, and it has the tendancy to pull hair every now and then.</li>
            <li> Runs faster than my old battery operated one.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems with the item so far nor do I expect to.</li>
            <li> We should be able rate these without being forced ot write something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Wahl trimmer for over 20 years &amp; it finnally wore out this new one is sleakly styled, much sharper with long battery life</li>
            <li> That usually happens when it&#x27;s pretty long and my old cheap trimmer couldn&#x27;t handle it or hold a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> I use it for little trims to clean up a bit around mustache.  </li>
            <li> Remind them that a little more plastic goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> an extra star for being able to run either corded or cordless, small size..</li>
            <li> The newer version does not have the same quality of manufacturing as the older model.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for a gift or personal use.</li>
            <li> Disappointed does line very good</li>
            <li> Major Inconvenience!  </li>
            <li> PRODUCT HAS A CHEAP SWITCH THAT HAS TO BE CONTINUALLY PUSHED FORWARD IS TO SMALL AND MUST BE HELD TO CONTINUE RUNNING.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is solid and great quality, but the attachments are difficult to attach and detach, feel flimsy, and takeaway from the overall quality.</li>
            <li> I normally keep very short beard through out the year.</li>
            <li> The attachments fit very firmly.</li>
            <li> Only reason I needed a new one was I lost the charger in a move</li>
            <li> attachments are good, but my usual &amp;#34;size&amp;#34; tended to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; my beard, so I went to a small size and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was a little higher than I had figured, but it is something I can live with.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> so the brand itself was a major attraction to me, as well as the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that I nearly broke it trying to get it on, and now it&#x27;s on there like glue, and I&#x27;m afraid taking it off the first time</li>
            <li> They last and last and perform like new every time!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this one to last that long, but it&#x27;s still a reasonable replacement and value.</li>
            <li> Loses charge pretty fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sitting here waiting on my old set to take a charge because it only works for 5 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> As far as the various combs are concerned, I&#x27;ve never had one of them break on me.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, The first lasted a long time and then I bought a different one when it quit and what POS that was.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok in a pinch if he&#x27;s desperate, but we will definitely need to purchase a higher quality trimmer for frequent use.</li>
            <li> Same pulling action.</li>
            <li> Same pulling action.</li>
            <li> Barely cuts anything.</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I have had the unit for three months and have only recharged it once so far.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Conair rechargeable that finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> I hate to sound like an old guy, but this is one of those many products that gets cheaper and flimsier over time.  </li>
            <li> The pieces don&#x27;t allow for very precise trimming and overall, I&#x27;m just not very impressed.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, but it does not work in certain directions.</li>
            <li> I typically just use it for a few minutes at a time, so I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in; nevertheless, it still stays charged for many days.</li>
            <li> Buying a new one costs less then having a new battery put in.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time, the trimmer is exact, but there are really no directions about how to use this.  </li>
            <li> The only shortcoming with this trimmer in my experience so far is that the instructions don&#x27;t provide examples or directions for using the various attachments and their intended use is unclear to me.  </li>
            <li> was interested in this trimmer because it has blades you can replace instead of purchasing a new trimmer when it becomes dull.  </li>
            <li> But my experience with the Wahl 817 beard and moustache trimmer over the past eight months - from initial trimming of a new beard to preparing to shave it off for the summer - has been quite positive.    </li>
            <li> If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> After 7 months, and a couple of months off because I had my beard &amp; mustache professionally trimmed, it would not work, no matter how long I charged it up.  </li>
            <li> I tried using once and found it lacking, the head is not wide enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that you need to be careful when you remove and replace the head to make sure that you haven&#x27;t inadvertently changed the setting that controls the length of the cut.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not amazing.</li>
            <li> This unit is much louder in operation than the previous one was.</li>
            <li> The blade teeth are TINY, and I could barely make it through one beard trim without immediately stopping and putting it back in the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only major draw back that I personally found was the noise level.</li>
            <li> My beard is probably about average in terms of thickness, and all this thing really did was push the hairs around and just glide over them, only clipping the occasional patch here and there.</li>
            <li> you hold it in some bad direction, and/or use more pressure than needed, it can easily hurt your face or neck&#x27;s skin, leaving little scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razors are really irritating to my skin but using this trimmer without any attachments felt fine.    </li>
            <li> Mainly use it to trim up my beard or trim down neck hair.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy pulled hair and very slow trimming, this is the trimmer for you.  </li>
            <li> the 3 single length attachments were just right but not fit the mustache trimmer  </li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult if not impossible to buy this groomer with the older style trimmer attachments.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to figure out how to use the slider on the main plastic trimmer cover guide to get different hair length heights.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had the vacuum the Norelco has.</li>
            <li> The base that you use will charging is also very nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> but if you want to use just the trimmer, it is very sharp and tough on your skin - especially throat and such where the skin is more tender.</li>
            <li> Keep the trimmer oiled (only if you use it often) around once a month and this device should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for a long, long time, and this little trimmer has stuck with me for nearly all those years ever since I dropped and damaged my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had small beards and large beards, and this trimmer keeps on ticking despite my irregular cleaning and maintenance of it.  </li>
            <li> i use it when im too lazy or dont have the time to use my straight edge.</li>
            <li> The charge does last long so you won&#x27;t have to keep charging the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of power, long lasting charge, will not break the bank.</li>
            <li> plus is that the batteries hold their charge a long time which allows the trimmer to be taken on trips without the hassle of carrying - and potentially losing - the recharging device.    </li>
            <li> They last for a very long time</li>
            <li> The battery once it&#x27;s charged seems to last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Some people complain the plastic attachments are difficult to put on and remove and break easily.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my facial hair is thicker than average, but the blades constantly snagged before breaking, after only two months of use.</li>
            <li> I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    </li>
            <li> Charge is very weak, blades feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little patience for the first few uses.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is fantastic but be wary of the attachments.</li>
            <li> But in the long run, it works for all I need.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the extra $7 to mail it to them for repairs.  </li>
            <li> I know they will break long before the trimmer wears</li>
            <li> It pulls my hubby&#x27;s mustache and beard and it doesn&#x27;t have to be long in order for the trimmer to pull...</li>
            <li> Charge has held up with long periods of sitting (weeks).</li>
            <li> The battery finally gave up, which really is not user replaceable.  </li>
            <li> Charge keeps quite long.</li>
            <li> It stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> but I dont need it for long amount of usage.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Operation of the unit (head down with trimming) is very different from my last trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Without an attachment it is very sharp and the edges cut you if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> This is not a very high quality piece of machinery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands only to return them</li>
            <li> I waited to write a review due to the mixed reviews on the product.</li>
            <li> a very long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Once charged, the battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> The anticipation of the next painful pull does not make for a enjoyable trimming experience.    </li>
            <li> Aside from the base and attachments feeling somewhat cheap, this beard trimmer really cuts well.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is very loud and not real happy with the quality.  </li>
            <li> Attachments are a little hard to get on and off at first, but loosen up.</li>
            <li> Felt like you were going to snap them in half when you put them on, or possibly the clipper blades too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this product today, probably opting for either a Wahl Peanut (the black one with the larger motor) or an Oster 76023-510.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had it less than two weeks and an internal piece</li>
            <li> Does not cut as closely as a product I owned previously, that finally went out, but does the job for the price.</li>
            <li> &gt;â™¦ Cutting power is fine.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary of this model - I have a beard that I wear at about 1/2&amp;#34; all around, and that is the longest this model can handle, and then only with an adjustable attachment..</li>
            <li> but I have bought it as a little present for others and everybody loves them.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time.!!!</li>
            <li> Trimmer pulls and pinches even when cutting light swatche of beard.  </li>
            <li> The small size of the head on this trimmer would make a routine trim twice as long as that with a larger trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Really cant go wrong with this if you are looking for something simple that will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Stuck it on the charger and the next day it ran for about 5 minutes, then the speed dropped and I ended up snagging a few hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it appeared to be missing the release tab to remove the guide.  </li>
            <li> It does the job that I expected</li>
            <li> Be careful on ordering this one.</li>
            <li> Handy base store all accessories</li>
            <li> The lubricating oil is a nice addition to maintain the groomer and the base piece keeps all the accessories organized well.  </li>
            <li> The charging base is nice and has a place for the cord to run underneath</li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts as long as my previous one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Internal battery not easily replaced (I have a couple of years before I will need to address</li>
            <li> Extremely noisy and the head disconnect is not easy to put back on.</li>
            <li> The other negative is the last 6 months no matter how long i&#x27;ve charged it, the battery does not hold the charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it Wahl or all of them, but I have yet to find a set that actually lasts and works for longer than a year.</li>
            <li> He travels a lot due to his job.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use around your ears due to noise volume.</li>
            <li> So I kept it, up until it broke the other week</li>
            <li> Hope Remington, Panasonic or any other razor manufacturer makes a quality product.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t vouche for the other attachments or features.</li>
            <li> I cannot exchange it or get a refund due to the seller&#x27;s return policy.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> used this almost every other day to trim my beard,  </li>
            <li> Do not use other then your face or you will cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various trimmers in the past 20 years</li>
            <li> â™¦ Blades are plenty sharp.</li>
            <li> the length guard slips settings during use so one side of the beard could be shorter than the other.</li>
            <li> He has only been buying Wahl products for the past 5 years&#x3D;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as sharp as I thought they&#x27;d be for lining up my beard</li>
            <li> But, again, most guys probably will just use the basic head to thin beard growth and the cutting edge to keep their moustache edge neat.    </li>
            <li> But always been sharp and do the work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are returning the product to Amazon and looking for other options.</li>
            <li> Threw  the  other  one  in  the  garbage,.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews that knock for the trim guards falling off during use.</li>
            <li> Blades not too sharp, pulls on your hair.</li>
            <li> So I use this trimmer every other day.</li>
            <li> As expected!  </li>
            <li> The other complaint was taking the adjustable regulator off and putting it back on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go over the same strip with this thing dozens of times and it still left behind a patchy mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine how this beard trimmer could actually work on anyone.    </li>
            <li> Never sharpened and I&#x27;ve been using them at least twice a week for the last decade</li>
            <li> It was also difficult to adjust the pre-attached guide, as it seemed very sticky.  </li>
            <li> it does what it should do, trimming is done clearly, but some cons are:&lt;br /&gt;-the material used in this device seem to be of poor quality</li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have that problem of losing the charge (or at least isn&#x27;t as likely to)</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it has a plastic body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic pieces are clumsy and fragile.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t broken one yet.</li>
            <li> but I do have a thick coarse beard.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer without the guides to bring my beard down to use a razor.  </li>
            <li> Updated as of 2/18  Had to bump it down from 5 stars to 3.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault.</li>
            <li> My previous one worked well like that.  </li>
            <li> Within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached.</li>
            <li> So I typically just place the trimmer, by itself, under the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not super functional.</li>
            <li> I had one than ran about half speed to this one</li>
            <li> My previous Wahl would turn on when traveling</li>
            <li> Typical Wahl product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> trimmer works just the way my previous one did----but----the plastic pieces that come with</li>
            <li> When I received it the battery was half charged already so I can test it out.</li>
            <li> Further the base/stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories - very poorly designed, Wahl should be embararssed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove, the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that I would have given it no stars</li>
            <li> This came from winding the cord around the charger head to tightly.</li>
            <li> not only stinks from an operational standpoint, but you also get the added bonus of major skin irritation and rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The individual blade guards are much too short for the beard length that I like to keep, so I used the adjustable guard, which, in addition to being flimsily made, fits over the blades in a weird way that forces you to hold the trimmer at an awkward angle in relation to your face in order for it to trim any of the hairs.</li>
            <li> It is true that for hair it&#x27;s a bit slow going because of the size of the cutting head/teeth</li>
            <li> Definitely not a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Has a little stand that holds all the pieces</li>
            <li> Then I organized its charging dock, which aside from being a little flimsy, holds all the pieces well.</li>
            <li> a little narrow.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned trimmers from other companies in the past.  </li>
            <li> For those concerned about attachments that break, just handle with care and you should get years of service from this little gem.</li>
            <li> and I still think this razor is too little.</li>
            <li> Notice the little ergonomic raised portions on the case.</li>
            <li> â™¦ I use the little rubber blade cover when I&#x27;m not using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Hell, I have needed another of the little oil things for 16 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts a little longer.</li>
            <li> switch seems a little weak/cheap.  </li>
            <li> My old unit required the base for recharging which was extra item to bring when traveling for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is dead.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days, but somehow it is well kept look, then I would get this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Well I thought &amp;#34;heh, who has trouble with attachments?&amp;#34; ... as it turns out &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> Its waste of money..</li>
            <li> dont broke and is not too heavy, also bring his owm pack to carry</li>
            <li> Used this well over a year now, everyday.  </li>
            <li> A few tweeks</li>
            <li> no worries about trimming unevenly.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers harshly criticize this product and if I&#x27;d read their reviews before buying the Wahl 817 I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d arrive with dead batteries.</li>
            <li> With the undependable charge length, I did bring it with a few times.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used it for a few months now and he loves it.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer after the flimsy plastic from another brand broke after just a few months.  </li>
            <li> The base is cheap and so is the case.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave everyday</li>
            <li> and I have not had any trouble with it.</li>
            <li> Keeping it properly oiled, I have not experienced any pulling.</li>
            <li> and I dont hear ouch every few minutes when he is shaving</li>
            <li> I have been through a few of these over the years.</li>
            <li> Cost less than Walmart!  </li>
            <li> Usually lasts me a week and half to two weeks.</li>
            <li> Also, as numerous other reviewers mentioned, the Groomsman will occasionally pull your hair, too, as a slightly painful little bonus!    </li>
            <li> Six position trimmer attachment not easily removed</li>
            <li> I have other products from Wahl that perform exactly as expected, so I was surprised and disappointed at this</li>
            <li> After my last trimmer failed on me, my groin region became a hairy mess as well as my sideburns.</li>
            <li> Just the raw trimmer.      </li>
            <li> The negative is it does not cut my beard (a black man&#x27;s beard) as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to have some poor guy lose his beard or mustache because of cheap trimmer attachments!</li>
            <li> i used two clips my 1st time and they are a little hard to get off</li>
            <li> trimmer isn&#x27;t really designed to be user serviceable, so when it goes bad, that&#x27;s the end.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I did it by trying to attach it to the trimmer or if it can like this, either way</li>
            <li> I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings.</li>
            <li> The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the trimmers size is relatively small, so it may take longer than usual to shorten your beard</li>
            <li> No more scruffy look...,stay</li>
            <li> The husband wanted one item to do the job that usually takes 2 or 3</li>
            <li> I have a small face</li>
            <li> Not sure whether this was in the description.</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl products in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried to sharpen them (and not sure you can, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just replaced my last Wahl trimmer, battery failed, after using for the past 6 years, with the one I just purchased.  </li>
            <li> Cause its useless ; Buy a Remington ; I&#x27;m returing &amp;#34;TheWahl&amp;#34; with its 30 day money back Guarantee ;Doe&#x27;s not ever rate one Star</li>
            <li> Like others, I have used a Wahl beard trimmer in the past.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if is the charger of what.</li>
            <li> Bought it to use on the &#x27;touchy&#x27; areas of my small dog.  </li>
            <li> Rather it had the newer style attachments which don&#x27;t have the small stubble size that I sought.  </li>
            <li> My beard  grows in very unevenly, and this is the tool to fix that.</li>
            <li> Tax is usually less than S/H, so be cautious of the prices you find!!</li>
            <li> Upon looking at the other attachments, we discovered two of them cannot be used because this plastic &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; was broken.</li>
            <li> My displeasure is due to how poorly everything fits together in the stand.  </li>
            <li> I chose the wall-charging version over a similar product battery-powered version I saw at Walgreens, simply because I hate dealing with batteries.</li>
            <li> The cheap-ass adjustable guide broke off while I was trimming, ruining my beard and forcing me to shave it down considerably to not look like a crazy person.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is small and I often had beard hairs get snagged in the blades, even when going slowly</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut very well :(</li>
            <li> My husbands previous one got broken with airport rummaging, so he ordered this one to replace it.</li>
            <li> are dull to begin with</li>
            <li> are they&lt;br /&gt;Become dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s happened to me (it adjusted to a shorter length while pressing too hard on my face).</li>
            <li> It pulls a little when trimming, but not too bad, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I mean that it&#x27;s hard to take on and off, hard to use, and does not seem to work well.  </li>
            <li> Power cord isn&#x27;t attached to base which is flimsy and cheap making recharging not practical.&lt;br /&gt;Could have bought a corded trimmer and been done with the useless extras.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard that I prefer to trim to stubble.  </li>
            <li> And by that I mean I tried to attach it.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to get the razor after reading some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I am seriously dissappointed with the trimmer and its attachments.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m a little sad</li>
            <li> Recharge directly to trimmer rather than the base.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s suprisingly loud and thus annoying to use.  </li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that the pieces are not very good quality and the adjustable piece is hard to change the height on.</li>
            <li> The  cutting  head  feels  sharp  </li>
            <li> On this trimmer the blade attachments are very hard to get on and off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tough to get out  b)</li>
            <li> Just an all around poorly thought out design.    </li>
            <li> The piece was already broken.</li>
            <li> The plastic &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; which attaches it to the trimmer blade was broken.</li>
            <li> The instruction pamphlet was poorly written and not helpful.  </li>
            <li> They will loosen up a bit and none of mine have broken in almost a year.  </li>
            <li> I had one broken during my experimentation</li>
            <li> This unit only has a plug which is not tied to the base.</li>
            <li> : Poor.  </li>
            <li> not ideal for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> other than this utterly worthless piece of you-know-what.</li>
            <li> The trimmer by itself deserves 5 stars, but the base brought it down.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend it to a friend, and if I get careless again with this one I will buy</li>
            <li> so, so wrong.    </li>
            <li> Wahl&#x27;s Groomsman Beard Trimmer is a useless piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I followed all the factory instructions and it still failed.</li>
            <li> This one is now in a bag under my sink with 5 others that have failed.</li>
            <li> I fail to understand the problems that people appear to be having with this product.    </li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to put the adjustable shaving head on and off.  </li>
            <li> They probed me wrong.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  </li>
            <li> Still worried that the plastic attachments will fail at the slot where they clip in.</li>
            <li> you can buy it with all the blind eyes.</li>
            <li> The six position trimmer is a bit difficult to remove, but practice has made it a snap (</li>
            <li> sorry -- had to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry Wahl, but I couldn&#x27;t go 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Sad to say the product was bubble gum machine quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult fiddling with the attachments, but once you do it once or twice you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> But I was way too wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not impressive.  </li>
            <li> or you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> Changing trim settings is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Mechanically I&#x27;ve never had one fail.</li>
            <li> Also it you bump the base to hard all the accessories go everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I could overlook that, but it also does a very poor job of cutting my beard.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality.pulls hair out instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> do&amp;#34;, trust the reviews that say the attachments are crazy to use.  </li>
            <li> and I was always afraid I was going to break it</li>
            <li> Pulls beard like crazy.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, even when used slowly, it tends to grab and pull hair.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is nothing but bad quality.</li>
            <li> Injuring me just as bad as if i had cut myself with a razor.</li>
            <li> I have to say i am disappointed,</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The charging cord is connected to the trimmer and not to the base as it should be.  </li>
            <li> When you pick up the trimmer from the base, the cord comes with it and you must remove it before you use it.  </li>
            <li> Base is not a charger.</li>
            <li> That said, clipper fits in base while plugged in.</li>
            <li> The plug that chargers the clipper, does not stay attached well to the base</li>
            <li> Go have a chat with your design team that made the base.  </li>
            <li> Also the power connector does not mount in the base.  </li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t have to plug it into the trimmer and then set it in the base.  </li>
            <li> worthless.  </li>
            <li> It is now completely worthless and I can&#x27;t even return it as the return window with Amazon expired.</li>
            <li> The base looks like it&#x27;s a drop-in charger, but it isn&#x27;t -- not in the budget I guess.</li>
            <li> units have a nicer base.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when the product arrived as it did not have the stubble attachments as shown.  </li>
            <li> These are the worst clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The battery is horrible..</li>
            <li> Worst trimmer ever.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible product.</li>

            <li> Worst trimmer in 20 years of using one.</li>
            <li> Caused nasty razor burn!</li>
            <li> Worst thing Ive ever bought from Amazon.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Use them nearly every day with no trouble.</li>
            <li> Very noisy.  Replacing an older Wahl that was much quieter.</li>
            <li> This is a direct replacement for an identical groomer. If that doesn&#x27;t tell you what I think of it, then nothing will. The blade guards fit very well, and the adjustable guard has a very positive catch at each setting. I just wish I hadn&#x27;t lost the charger for my old one. It probably had another few years of life in it, on top of the two years I already got out of it. Keep it clean and keep it oiled and it should last you for years. Yes, I would recommend it to a friend, and if I get careless again with this one I will buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT to update. The trimmer is dead. The battery fails to hold a charge for more than 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware!  This is a fantastic shaver, but cheap clip-on trimmers don&#x27;t quite fit, so the tiny little clip breaks when you try to get it on the device.  My husband never got to use this beard trimmer, as the clip-on thing broke first try.  He has an old Wahl trimmer with slip-on trimmer guides, and we will just keep using that.  Like everything that works well, it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Pulls hair. It hurts. Have stopped using. Buy a different shaver.</li>
            <li> I used to use my old one without the guides on my face for that in between shaved and not shaved look.  My previous one worked well like that.  This one is almost too sharp on the edges to get away with not having a guide - I still do it from time to time, but it&#x27;s not as comfortable as my old one.  Also, this unit needs to be recharged after every use or it will die mid way through the 2nd use.</li>
            <li> This little guy is perfect. Has a little stand that holds all the pieces so they don&#x27;t get lost, and it cuts well. It pulls a little when trimming, but not too bad, especially for the price. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This product is good for a wireless trimmer. The blades are sharp, but it does not work in certain directions. THe accessories are cheap.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I figured it had more than enough positive reviews to outweigh the negative, but I was so, so, so wrong.    Wahl&#x27;s Groomsman Beard Trimmer is a useless piece of garbage. My beard is probably about average in terms of thickness, and all this thing really did was push the hairs around and just glide over them, only clipping the occasional patch here and there. I&#x27;d go over the same strip with this thing dozens of times and it still left behind a patchy mess. Also, as numerous other reviewers mentioned, the Groomsman will occasionally pull your hair, too, as a slightly painful little bonus!    The individual blade guards are much too short for the beard length that I like to keep, so I used the adjustable guard, which, in addition to being flimsily made, fits over the blades in a weird way that forces you to hold the trimmer at an awkward angle in relation to your face in order for it to trim any of the hairs. Just an all around poorly thought out design.    The trimmer feels cheap too, and as others have noted, it&#x27;s quite loud (although the volume wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me if the thing actually did what it&#x27;s supposed to do).    After having a good go with this thing for about 10 minutes, I gave up and went back to using the big Wahl haircut clippers that I was using before. I thought the smaller, narrower blade of the Groomsman would make it easier for me to get the contours around and under my jaw line, but no, the big hair clippers do an *infinitely* better (cleaner, faster, more thorough) job.    It&#x27;s hard to imagine how this beard trimmer could actually work on anyone.    So, please, please, please heed my advice and buy something (anything!) other than this utterly worthless piece of you-know-what. And if you do buy it, hold on to your receipt!</li>
            <li> I have had a beard or goatee for over 25 years and have used every sort of trimmer but this trimmer is really great. It is light weight, very sharp blades, the chrome top is sculpted in front of the trimming edge to hold cut hair until you deposit it in the sink or on a towel, it has a nice rubberly grip, it&#x27;s not too loud, charges fast and holds a good charge for a long time so I don&#x27;t have to keep it plugged in or on the charger (makes my bathroom sink neater) and the red LED confirms it&#x27;s charging. The guard is adjustable so I don&#x27;t have to change guards to get different lengths. I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> About 6 weeks ago I decided to grow a beard. then about 3 weeks ago I decided I needed a trim. My old trimmer was on the fritz so I started scouring Amazon for the best deal on one. After much debate, deliberation, and scraggly bearded-ness I settled on this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it got here I wrestled it out of its packaging and plugged it in right away. Then I organized its charging dock, which aside from being a little flimsy, holds all the pieces well. After the over night of charging and many dreams of a well kept face rug I finally got to using it. The first thing I did was attach the adjustable length attachment. And by that I mean I tried to attach it. The piece was already broken. I&#x27;m not sure if I did it by trying to attach it to the trimmer or if it can like this, either way I was pretty unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky for Wahl that I only needed the stand alone attachments. The three different sized grooming tools are perfect for anything that I need. Overall I am satisfied with the trimmer. I have only had to charge it once and it trims with better precision than other ones I have owned. It is unfortunate that the pieces are not very good quality and the adjustable piece is hard to change the height on. But in the long run, it works for all I need. If you want a nice stubbly look, sort of a lazy bum in college, haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days, but somehow it is well kept look, then I would get this.</li>
            <li> Does not feel cheap and battery last forever compared to the Remington that I replaced.</li>
            <li> My son said it works great for his facial hair. He looks neat and professional.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product. Needed a new one. Hope this one lasts as long as my previous one. Ten years!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really maintained a beard before, but I am very satisfied with this little trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice, clean trim.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Quality build/good feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;I like the rubberized grips.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little narrow.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself seems dependable, but I can see myself breaking an attachment eventually.</li>
            <li> I already have owned this trimmer and have had it for years and it treated me well.  Only reason I needed a new one was I lost the charger in a move and it was only a few dollars more to get the whole new set.</li>
            <li> A little loud, but ok.</li>
            <li> Works perfect just wish there were more attachments</li>
            <li> Chaifs more than other Wahl&#x27;s I have owned.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer without the guides to bring my beard down to use a razor.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands only to return them becuase they simply wont get as close.  The precision is that good.  Keep your receipt, however, my blades dulled in under a year using it about every two weeks.  I do however replace the guide to protect the blades when not in use.  the removal of the guides are difficult but became simpler with more use.  I&#x27;ve read complaints of them being too cheap, but if they were sturdier (thicker) they would not work as well.  It just takes a little patience for the first few uses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was interested in this trimmer because it has blades you can replace instead of purchasing a new trimmer when it becomes dull.  When it came time to replace them however the cost averaged around $18 (with S/H) for new blades.  Target (as of Aug 20, 2006) has this exact razor (complete set) for $17.99 in the store.  Tax is usually less than S/H, so be cautious of the prices you find!!</li>
            <li> We gave this to our son.  He said Thanks, it works great!  --  good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer. My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years. I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings. I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    Deciding to give Wahl one last chance. I purchased the \\&quot;All-in-One Trimmer Kit,\\&quot; given that it had a 5-year warranty. The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage. Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault. However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own. If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later. If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li> I honestly wish I could find a set of beard and mustache trimmers that will actually work. I am fed up with garbage like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: For the short period that it did work, it worked great. Blades were sharp, held a nice charge (at first), the attachments stayed on and didn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The battery stopped taking a charge. At all. This was only after 1 month of use. At first it was great. The batter would last for hours. Stuck it on the charger and the next day it ran for about 5 minutes, then the speed dropped and I ended up snagging a few hairs on my face. Any guy can tell you that doesn&#x27;t feel too great. I had never dropped or misused the device. I followed all the factory instructions and it still failed. I&#x27;m not sure if it Wahl or all of them, but I have yet to find a set that actually lasts and works for longer than a year. This one is now in a bag under my sink with 5 others that have failed. I&#x27;m sitting here waiting on my old set to take a charge because it only works for 5 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> Works well, does the job for the price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even shave his face.</li>
            <li> Gave a nice close shave!</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. it is more than I expected!! Holds a charge for a long time.!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer. It came with everything I needed and it was charged. I haven&#x27;t even had to charge it yet. Love it.</li>
            <li> After reading all these positive reviews  I&#x27;m really looking forward to using my new  Wahl 9916-817 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer...I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be a haply returning Wahl customer as I&#x27;ve owned my first Wahl hair clipper set I received as a Christmas gift..for now going on 20yrs and they are still working and cutting great...Never sharpened and I&#x27;ve been using them at least twice a week for the last decade plus..Oh Yeah ..And as an added bonus..The attachments are all still intact and working just fine...Just sayin</li>
            <li> This Wahl beard trimmer provides an even and consistent trim with comfort and ease. The guards click on easily and stay securely in place, allowing for a worry-free trim. It comes with a stand that keeps the trimmer docked in an easy-to-reach position and also holds the charger in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several attachments come in a handy pouch for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I hold the trimmer, it feels like quality. The motor runs quietly and smoothly. The head is compact to hit those hard-to-reach places with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If great price, quality and ease of use are what you seek, this is the finest quality trimmer available. It comes with my highest reccomendation.</li>
            <li> My husbands previous one got broken with airport rummaging, so he ordered this one to replace it. He loves it. Very clean cutting and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is not a very high quality piece of machinery.  Will it shave/trim your hair?  Yes of course, but it is not very precise and it is made of cheap parts.  When you pick it up in your hand you will understand.  Also after a short period of time it will require being plugged in all the time and during use to work.  I rate it a \\&quot;don&#x27;t buy.\\&quot;  Spend an extra 10 bucks and get something better and perhaps think about a different brand.  That&#x27;s what I am doing right now!</li>
            <li> We bought this trimmer for our son, he really likes it, Especially the beard comb. It was one of his favorite Christmas gifts He travels a lot due to his job. This trimmer is perfect for him.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well. Came out of the package with all of its parts and I don&#x27;t really detect any durability issues that a few people here have talked about. Extremely good value for the price.  Updated as of 2/18  Had to bump it down from 5 stars to 3. After about a month, the head started to rust. The pieces don&#x27;t allow for very precise trimming and overall, I&#x27;m just not very impressed.</li>
            <li> came 1 day later than expected, but it was still a good purchase</li>
            <li> Very noisy, but works. Can&#x27;t use around your ears due to noise volume.</li>
            <li> This product started off strong and worked well initially.    After 7 months, and a couple of months off because I had my beard &amp; mustache professionally trimmed, it would not work, no matter how long I charged it up.  Now it is basically a paperweight.    I recommend you buy something else.</li>
            <li> I fail to understand the problems that people appear to be having with this product.    I own a 9916, a 9918 and two old 9620&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any of them.    Yes, batteries eventually wear out and must be replaced. Not a problem. They are available from Wahl for ten bucks.    As far as the various combs are concerned, I&#x27;ve never had one of them break on me. If one should, they are available from Wahl for five bucks a set.    This clipper beats everything on the market.    By the way, the older 9620&#x27;s have been relegated to our dog trimming duties. I also own a Wahl hair trimming set and a Wahl animal (horse) trimmer. Never had a problem. Just keep the blades clean and oil them as you should.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk... 1/8&amp;#34; guard was warped and will not fit on trimmer head squarely, but still fits crooked. 1/16&amp;#34; guard was so warped that it didn&#x27;t fit and broke upon installation. Only guard that fit properly was the all-in-one adjustable one that clipped on perfectly. Would not recommend and have already returned.</li>
            <li> Works great but is real noisy.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> These are the worst clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. They don&#x27;t cut hair. You have to go over the same spot 7 or 8 time before all the hair is cut. Don&#x27;t buy these no matter how low the price is.</li>
            <li> Works great so far! I think I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months and only had to charge it twice. No rust yet, nothing needing fixed. Seems solid.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift. The trimmer itself is very good quality and I have no complaints there. The issue is with the attachments. The first blade guard he tried to use wouldn&#x27;t attach to the trimmer. The plastic &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; which attaches it to the trimmer blade was broken. Upon looking at the other attachments, we discovered two of them cannot be used because this plastic &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; was broken. The trimmer itself is fantastic but be wary of the attachments. I&#x27;d hate to have some poor guy lose his beard or mustache because of cheap trimmer attachments!</li>
            <li> After my last trimmer failed on me, my groin region became a hairy mess as well as my sideburns. Cuts great and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Excellent, just what I was looking for that I couldn&#x27;t find in the stores!  Delivered promptly and in excellent condition!</li>
            <li> I received the Wahl 9916-817 yesterday, I have to tell all men that has a beard that this trimmer is awesome. I have always loved the Wahl trimmers, The last one lasted 13 years. It broke and I bought this one, So far it is just as good as my other one. It works well for also trimming ear hair and the back of the neck, I like the fact that it is rechargeable. The price was right, It should give me many years of use.</li>
            <li> For the price this trimmer works very well. It doesn&#x27;t nick the face and the battery lasts quite a while without recharging</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had to recharge after about a month. Recharge directly to trimmer rather than the base.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s alright. It is super loud, and it will &amp;#34;get you&amp;#34; every now and then if you use it on your neck (not enough to draw blood, but it&#x27;ll leave a red mark for a while.) The guards are too short for my liking. If I were to guess, the longest is prob a 3 mm. It does cut hair decently well though.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Cost less than Walmart!  I went to three stores to pick out the trimmer I wanted and bought two and returned.  Using the internet to sift through all of the choices was worth a lot of time going throught stores that did not have all of the choices.  The product works great for an old bald guy with mustach and bead.  I trim all of the hair on my head with this every week and save 10 to 20 bucks per week on haircuts!</li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to put the adjustable shaving head on and off.  Operation of the unit (head down with trimming) is very different from my last trimmer.  Seemed to pinch at times when trimming.  Overall an adequate trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> When I received the trimmer &amp; took it out of the box, the first thing I noticed were a lot of scratches in the paint.  Secondly, it appeared to be missing the release tab to remove the guide.  It was also difficult to adjust the pre-attached guide, as it seemed very sticky.  The instruction pamphlet was poorly written and not helpful.  This trimmer was inexpensive, and it showed.  I never bothered trying to use it, since it didn&#x27;t have the release tab as shown in the diagram.  It was supposed to be new, but it seemed as if it was refurbished.  I sent the item back immediately.</li>
            <li> Excennent Trimmer, i use it for mustache &amp; hair trimming, thid is my second one, i tried others, and this one has the best Blade, the Batteries went bad in the first one, i kept the Blade for a back up.</li>
            <li> Received item in perfect condition.  It is charging now for it&#x27;s first trial run.    Thank you.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have pointed out, the plastic attachments for this aren&#x27;t the greatest. The first and only time I attached one, it didn&#x27;t even completely attach.    However, this is perfect if you just want to trim yourself down to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look like myself using the bare trimmer. In fact, this trimmer gave me a more even trim than I&#x27;ve even gotten with razors. Razors are really irritating to my skin but using this trimmer without any attachments felt fine.    Personally, I didn&#x27;t *want* a ton of attachments because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use them. Making this trimmer perfect for me. In case you haven&#x27;t read other reviews, it is rumored to have excellent battery life as well, but I haven&#x27;t had the trimmer long enough to test this myself.</li>
            <li> Its ok. It doesnt trim close enough and it pulls often. You get what you pay for. i use it when im too lazy or dont have the time to use my straight edge.</li>
            <li> Extremely noisy and the head disconnect is not easy to put back on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought the Wahl brand was considered a good brand.  Not so for this trimmer.  The charging cord is connected to the trimmer and not to the base as it should be.  When you pick up the trimmer from the base, the cord comes with it and you must remove it before you use it.  Major Inconvenience!  I could overlook that, but it also does a very poor job of cutting my beard.  I tried it once, I&#x27;m looking for a different one now.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend as a gift. He likes it a lot. His beard looks amazing, too :)</li>
            <li> the bf loves it, so that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
            <li> This product was well worth the money paid for it. It actually exceeded my expectations.  It has plenty of power and the battery life so far has been good.</li>
            <li> This product really works well it&#x27;s my second one in 10 years.  Hold&#x27;s up great, will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Does the job, Good Price. I expected it to cut a little closer than it does though...not great for edging</li>
            <li> I moved and lost my old trimmer to movers.  This trimmer is inexpensive, but durable and a workhorse.  I trim my beard, collarline and around a prominent mole on my chin safely.</li>
            <li> *****UPDATE*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received my repaired unit today in the mail from WAHL.  Repaired clipper now only pulls some hair out of my face while shaving instead of trying to rip my enitre face off out right.  I guess I&#x27;d call that imporovement.  Still could have spent $20 better.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the extra $7 to mail it to them for repairs.  I don&#x27;t think I should have to pay shipping for repairs for anything under 1 year old.  I don&#x27;t built cheap razors, but I guarntee my work for the lifetime of my customers at my expense.  I don&#x27;t make them pay for me to come to their house and check out how I F$%@!ED up, I&#x27;d just head right out there and fix their problems and offer them refund or free future services.  But oh well lession learned, just buy from anyone but WAHL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl I thought was a good quality company.  They probed me wrong.  Clipper came with ultra flimsy feeling snap on attchments for adjusting length.  Felt like you were going to snap them in half when you put them on, or possibly the clipper blades too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to return it before even giving it a try as it felt like it came out of a Cracker Jack box, but I decided to give it a shot, to my suprise it actually worked pretty good.  So I kept it, up until it broke the other week I would have given it 3.5-4 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy if you want it to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned trimmers from other companies in the past.  I saw this one advertised and realized it&#x27;s the same brand my barber has.  I&#x27;ve now been using it for a few months.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not even anywhere near the commercial grade used in barber shops.  However, it outperforms any trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present for my partner, and he is very pleased with it. I would highly recommend this product for a gift or personal use.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had it for three weeks now. it does what it should do, trimming is done clearly, but some cons are:&lt;br /&gt;-the material used in this device seem to be of poor quality&lt;br /&gt;-the trimmers size is relatively small, so it may take longer than usual to shorten your beard&lt;br /&gt;-if you hold it in some bad direction, and/or use more pressure than needed, it can easily hurt your face or neck&#x27;s skin, leaving little scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I raised the stars rating from 2 to 4, because this thing has lasted in almost original condition for about three years. I have recently switched to a more expensive trimmer from Andis, but this trimmer still works.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> The on/off switch felt cheap from day 1, 3 months later &amp; it&#x27;s messed up, hope I can find the receipt!</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine and the price was great.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to keep the beard (maintenance and funny feeling) but if I do, this should work just fine and last as long as I need it..  Well made.</li>
            <li> Trimmer pulls and pinches even when cutting light swatche of beard.  The anticipation of the next painful pull does not make for a enjoyable trimming experience.    Would recommend strongly to invest in a better/heavier duty trimmer.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, I had been using another Wahl for quite a while and it would not hold a charge for any time. I use it on my head only, does a great job of trimming the hair very close and seems to be a bit easier to hold than the other.</li>
            <li> Well I thought &amp;#34;heh, who has trouble with attachments?&amp;#34; ... as it turns out &amp;#34;I do&amp;#34;, trust the reviews that say the attachments are crazy to use.  I managed to get on the one attachment for the length of beard I&#x27;m happy with and there it stays- until I want to use it as a trimmer, then trust my short term memory for putting the attachment back on.&lt;br /&gt;I just added a star because I remember the price and at that cost I&#x27;m getting more than my money&#x27;s worth out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Imagine that, somele to thing actually working as it was described. We should be able rate these without being forced ot write something.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge forever, it has a polished and attractive look, and it trims my beard with ease.  I have a Norelco before this and the difference between the two is night and day.  Wahl really lives up to their reputation.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a previous Wahl product - that had been dropped one too many times. I am very happy with it. works great.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect beard trimmer for anyone who doesn&#x27;t know how to trim a beard. The 6 position trimmer guide allows you to keep it nice and tight or a more on the lengthy side. I personally like a nice tight beard and this thing holds a charge like no tomorrow. I tend to trim every third or fourth day and can go a week or two without having to charge it. Simple and effective. What more do you need??</li>
            <li> It doesnot clean it completely.. Every time, you have to watch closely and trim your beard.. The battery is horrible.. It wont last more than 2 shaves.. Having it is a pain.. Its waste of money..</li>
            <li> I replaced a battery powered one with this.  Much easier to use and more power.  Great value.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t miss</li>
            <li> I developed a rash in my trimming areas...and doctor said.....No more scruffy look...,stay clean shaved....SORRY.&lt;br /&gt;The women said I look better clean shaved with no rash...</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. My third or fourth of these. Don&#x27;t last the longest but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl trimmer.  I&#x27;m happy with my current purchase, performs as good as the old one.  Would recommend this model of trimmer.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this trimmer for the price...it&#x27;s well made and works great.  Hands down I would order another one.</li>
            <li> This Wahl Trimmer was not as good as the professional ones I had used but for the price, it trims fine.  The charge does last long so you won&#x27;t have to keep charging the trimmer.  Hair tends to stick to the blades so you&#x27;ll need to brush them off after every used.  Keep the trimmer oiled (only if you use it often) around once a month and this device should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is excellent! Feels solid, cuts great and holds charge a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are just adequate. They feel flimsy and I know they will break long before the trimmer wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the trimmer 5 stars and the attachements 2 stars. You really need the attachments.But what do you expect for 24 bucks.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well and keeps my beard from getting too wild!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband two months ago and he loves it!  Great quality and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is very loud and not real happy with the quality.  Not worth the price</li>
            <li> I have to say i am disappointed, Having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916,  which i felt gave me a good trim, i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon.     the one i received was much cheaper in quality. The plastic guide IS cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually, which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped. The guide shattered. There is no replacement for the 5-position guide for the 9916 I can find.    Now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom, or finding a razor that can survive real world use.    On the plus side, the battery life on this razor is incredible.</li>
            <li> Loud. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, The first lasted a long time and then I bought a different one when it quit and what POS that was.  Happy to have found this one again</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend as one of his Christmas gifts and he loved it. He said it worked well on his gotee.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even assemble the product, and there were no instructions on how to do so.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, good quality at a good price. I bought this Whal&#x27;s trimmer to replace a Whal&#x27;s trimmer that I have used for over 15 years. That alone speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> It came fast and works great! Is fully function able and stylish. There are multiple parts that make it easy to use as well</li>
            <li> Have used many Wahl products over last 25 years &amp; this exact Groomsman Beard for many years &amp; have always been very satisfied.  However now have recently purchased 2 of these razors &amp; they have stopped working within 2 weeks.  Battery no longer takes a charge.  The 3rd one seems to work fine.  Seller has taken them back each time but Wahl customer service (Michelle) doesn&#x27;t care &amp; or their corporate policy is to tell you to \\&quot;send it back to them &amp; they will look at it.\\&quot;  So I have to spend money to send it back &amp; be without a razor. Customer service says no bad batch of product &amp; offer no assistance that matters. Furthermore, bought another Wahl razor with a lithium battery (model 9854) which worked on an initial test, just running it but not using it, which worked fine.  Went to actually use it &amp; stopped working.  Won&#x27;t take a charge.  Wahl, these products I have purchased &amp; customer service are inferior.  Will never buy another Wahl product.  Hope Remington, Panasonic or any other razor manufacturer makes a quality product.  Wahl has permanently lost an excellent customer.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance with the variety to adjust beard settings. Holds a good charge, and I have no concerns at all</li>
            <li> Son is thrilled with this--it was VERY reasonable.  My son said it is the perfect tool for his grooming needs. It has a variety of trimmings attachments making it easy to get the look you want.  HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great. Stays charged for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This works great for that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I use it for that a couple of times a week for that and haven&#x27;t recharged it yet so not worried about pluggin in the charger all the time. Cheap stand. Can&#x27;t vouche for the other attachments or features. Wish it had the vacuum the Norelco has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard continuously for decades now and I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different trimmers.  I seem to always come back to Wahl.  It works well and lasts almost for ever.  In fact the last trimmer I had was exactly this one.  I only had two complaints about the last one.  One of them was that the handle became sticky over time.  I cleaned it with alcohol.  It took a while but I was eventually able to get rid of the sticky feeling.  The other complaint was taking the adjustable regulator off and putting it back on.  It isn&#x27;t easy.  You have to play with it and I was always afraid I was going to break it but it did endure.  However, once you get it on it works well so I can&#x27;t complain much.  In fact the reason I needed to replace it was that I dropped it into the sink.  The razor still works but I broke the adjustable regulator.  I looked for a replacement and it wasn&#x27;t much if any cheaper that buying a whole new trimmer, so I opted to buy the whole package.  Now I have a primary and backup trimmer.  You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Perhaps you can get a better one for more money but for price performance I&#x27;ll stick with this one.</li>
            <li> Nothing to dislike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All accessories work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else is there ??</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer off amazon at 6 PM friday night and it was at my door at 9 AM Saturday morning.  The trimmer is very good for the $15 I paid for it.  It was an extra $4 for over night shipping. Well worth it IMHO.  I have used the trimmer only once, but it cut smooth and didn&#x27;t pull any hairs.  This trimmer may not last 10 years, but for $15 I will gladly buy one every year.  I highly recommend this trimmer and amazon prime.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the price and the trimming performance of this trimmer. I am disappointed that when I charge the unit overnight, the red light never goes out to indicate that charging is full. The trimmer, which I use once a week, does not hold a charge but for two trimmings of a light beard.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable trimmer is okay.  Its \\&quot;portability\\&quot; is the most favored feature.  The negative is it does not cut my beard (a black man&#x27;s beard) as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> The husband wanted one item to do the job that usually takes 2 or 3 so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time to charge and then you are off to trimming Nirvana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a cheap trimmer that works great for personal use but would not hold up to commercial use.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY 2ND ONE OF THESE AND THEY ARE GREAT. BEARD AND STASH DIFFERENT LENGHTS NOT A PROBLEM, SNAP ON A NEW GUIDE GET AFTER IT  !</li>
            <li> The  best grooming set available</li>
            <li> I bought this beard trimmer as a gift for my husband and unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t been great. Yes, it comes with different length trimmers, a comb and some maintenance supplies for the razor itself. However, my husband complains that when he uses the trimmer, it pulls at his beard hair and rips out almost as much as it trims. It&#x27;s ok in a pinch if he&#x27;s desperate, but we will definitely need to purchase a higher quality trimmer for frequent use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. I went through two units with the same problem. The trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade. Within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached. Further the base/stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories - very poorly designed, Wahl should be embararssed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove, the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that I would have given it no stars if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth.</li>
            <li> this is an easy to use trimmer. would buy another Wahl trimmer.  would definitely recommend this product to a friend</li>
            <li> i had this unit to do beard trimming and for me was good, but the problem was the nickel-cadmium batter stopped taking a charge after a while so that became a pain.  and, i figured i&#x27;d just replace the battery, but a) it&#x27;s tough to get out  b) they have it soddered it (basically permanently attached) so unless you&#x27;re really good with electronics, not easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you may want to look at the lithium-ion version which i understand doesn&#x27;t have that problem of losing the charge (or at least isn&#x27;t as likely to)</li>
            <li> Works great, just as described and pictured, I&#x27;ve been using WAHL products for about 30 years and as usual they got it right</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Good quality. Good bargain. Would recommend and do business with again.</li>
            <li> My son got this for a Christmas gift and has really like it. Good quality and does the job!</li>
            <li> After 1 1/2 months, it would no longer charge.  I cannot exchange it or get a refund due to the seller&#x27;s return policy.  Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s pro-grade, couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  For those concerned about attachments that break, just handle with care and you should get years of service from this little gem.</li>
            <li> Its a great little powerful razor but its just too small. Why buy a separate razor just for your beard? Its great but I regret my purchase. I have a small face and I still think this razor is too little. I also shave my head frequently so I bought another bigger, all in one cordless trimmer that I love and  use just fine for my beard and  fits all my other needs better. Wahl 9867-300</li>
            <li> Seems to be just as advertised. So far I haven&#x27;t had any complaints from my husband so it must be working exactly as the company claims.  Lightweight and compact yet powerful as if it was the larger version.  Timely delivery. Highly recommend product and vendor.</li>
            <li> this trimmer has much more power than my old one.</li>
            <li> Great battery life, small and portable, I take it when I&#x27;m traveling. Used to trim with scissors, but this thing is very precise and I save a lot of time compared to scissors.</li>
            <li> My last Trimmer finally went bust.  I went on Amazon and looked around and found this Wahl trimmer.  For the price the item works well for me !!</li>
            <li> Does the job well, but is fairly noisy.  cuts well and the battery seem to last quite some time, I go a week or so between trims and I have yet to charge the battery a 2nd time.. 2 months later.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly for a gift. Comes with everything you need,charges easily and does a great job. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer - I like it better tham others I have used and I have had a beard for 30+ years. Still worried that the plastic attachments will fail at the slot where they clip in. Will just have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard that I prefer to trim to stubble.  The small size of the head on this trimmer would make a routine trim twice as long as that with a larger trimmer.  It would take me over 30 minutes to trim my beard because the head would miss a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, that&#x27;s not an issue now because the trimmer has stopped working after only one month.  It no longer holds a charge.  I will not be getting a new one.</li>
            <li> you can buy it with all the blind eyes. dont broke and is not too heavy, also bring his owm pack to carry</li>
            <li> Awesome little shaver if you want to keep facial hair tirned to a mangable length</li>
            <li> Used this well over a year now, everyday.  Cleaning easy with a simple knock on the sink while using.  Oil about every 2 weeks.  Fast and simple to use.  Leave it plugged in if you want, doesn&#x27;t hurt it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and I was unsure about this purchase, since I don&#x27;t  know much about groomers and trimmers.  The recipient was thrilled and said it worked great!  Another great deal !!</li>
            <li> This is a clear example of cheap product that is just not worth buying, because you&#x27;d end up buying another, higher quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is incredibly noisy, the battery runs out in 10 minutes of use and the blades are the not the best ones. Avoid!</li>
            <li> This is everything it is advertised to be. Very well made with a heavy solid feel to it. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good clippers but if you want to use just the trimmer, it is very sharp and tough on your skin - especially throat and such where the skin is more tender.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly, Wahl makes a good product I feel I can count on and feel good about the pruchase !</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift to replace the same exact model that was used for many years, but just doesn&#x27;t hold the charge.  Hoping this one works as well.</li>
            <li> On this trimmer the blade attachments are very hard to get on and off. I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t broken one yet. Without an attachment it is very sharp and the edges cut you if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> The clippers themselves are excellent, the adjustable guard leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> havent let me down yet nice close shaves</li>
            <li> It pulls my hubby&#x27;s mustache and beard and it doesn&#x27;t have to be long in order for the trimmer to pull... Seems to have a defect or the blades are dull to begin with</li>
            <li> The razor itself is very nice and works great.  It holds a charge for a very long time.  The accessories are a little flimsy and cheap.  All-in-all, it is a nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> Best value in a beard trimmer.  Why spend more money when this trimmer does it all well.  Plenty of power, long lasting charge, will not break the bank.</li>
            <li> Bought this to trim my guy&#x27;s eyebrows. It didn&#x27;t work well because it pulled at his eyebrows. I tried it on his mustache thinking it might work better on that thickness of hair. Same pulling action. I tried it on his head hair because that&#x27;s very fine hair. Same pulling action. It&#x27;s totally ineffectual.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good little trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is well priced and comes with a lot of flipper add on for a variety of hair lengths.&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;The clipper add tons are cheap and break easily.&lt;br /&gt;no way to maintain or sharpen the clippers are they&lt;br /&gt;Become dull.</li>
            <li> Base is not a charger. Not sure whether this was in the description. That said, clipper fits in base while plugged in. Clipper is kind of loud and hair goes flying. Works well, lacks refinement, decent value.</li>
            <li> excelente producto lo recibi a tiempo como lo estipulo el vendedor, persona seria de alto compromiso y buen trato, lo recomiendo 100%</li>
            <li> Bought what I think is essentially the same model (box has it marked as a 9916-4301 rather than 9916-817) from a brick and mortar retailer. I bought it because I&#x27;ve owned Wahl products that have lasted decades, and the size seemed more appropriate for beard trimming than my aging Color Pro. I was a little leary of this model - I have a beard that I wear at about 1/2&amp;#34; all around, and that is the longest this model can handle, and then only with an adjustable attachment.. I just prefer fewer moving parts, and a fixed 1/2&amp;#34; attachment would have been ideal. Lo and behold, I never even got a chance to turn it on because the adjustable beard attachment broke when I attached it to the trimmer. The two plastic tabs meant to secure it in place both just disintegrated. I&#x27;m returning this product today, probably opting for either a Wahl Peanut (the black one with the larger motor) or an Oster 76023-510.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;giving it an extra star for being able to run either corded or cordless, small size..</li>
            <li> This is a lower cost beard and mustache trimmer. The unit feels solid and after an overnight charge (instructions) has performed well. The six position trimmer is a bit difficult to remove, but practice has made it a snap (sorry -- had to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Compact design makes it easy to guide around beard and mustache&lt;br /&gt;- Solid feel (metal as opposed to plastic)&lt;br /&gt;- Handy base store all accessories&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used plugged into charger if battery runs low&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Six position trimmer attachment not easily removed&lt;br /&gt;- Internal battery not easily replaced (I have a couple of years before I will need to address that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> excelente. muy buen producto a muy buen precio.&lt;br /&gt;excelente. muy buen producto a muy buen precio.&lt;br /&gt;excelente. muy buen producto a muy buen precio</li>
            <li> A great quality trimmer/groomer, I have had this piece for 2 years and it still holds a charge and powers through coarse facial hair.  The lubricating oil is a nice addition to maintain the groomer and the base piece keeps all the accessories organized well.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a low-cost rechargeable trimmer/groomer that will last.</li>
            <li> works 100% i used two clips my 1st time and they are a little hard to get off but i found if you get it off from the side its easy...love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the money.  The battery lasts a long time, the trimmer is exact, but there are really no directions about how to use this.  It takes a little while to figure out how to use the slider on the main plastic trimmer cover guide to get different hair length heights.  Other than that a great product.  I even bought one for my son-in-law.</li>
            <li> I just replaced an 18 year Wahl 9916 for this new silver and shiny Wahl 9916-817. It works great and I expect it to go for 18-20 years just like the old one.</li>
            <li> Love that thing! Can&#x27;t live without one now. It&#x27;s versatile, takes so much abuse and works very well. You won&#x27;t regret getting one.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for a few months then simply stopped.  Tried the suggestions given to loosen the blades, etc.  This product is junk.</li>
            <li> The plug that chargers the clipper, does not stay attached well to the base so when you disconnect the whole thing comes of the table the holder and the pieces in the holder. Its does not detach from plug easily</li>
            <li> I was in the market for an inexpensive trimmer and this Wahl product meet my needs. I have used Wahl products in the past so the brand itself was a major attraction to me, as well as the price. It comes with pieces that allow you to really customize you shaving experience. The base that you use will charging is also very nice and sturdy. The only major draw back that I personally found was the noise level. It was a little higher than I had figured, but it is something I can live with. Overall this is a good product that I pretty much use on a daily basis. The battery life also seems to be holding out well. Almost a month and have not had the need to recharge. Really cant go wrong with this if you are looking for something simple that will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Shaves and charges excellently.  Only problem is the storage of the accessories.</li>
            <li> Excellente quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> Trimmer itself is great.  Power cord isn&#x27;t attached to base which is flimsy and cheap making recharging not practical.&lt;br /&gt;Could have bought a corded trimmer and been done with the useless extras.</li>
            <li> twice a week grooming thats faster and cleaner than shaving; without the constant blade buying.</li>
            <li> First time I grow a beard, it does a great job cutting and trimming. I complain about cheap quality of the accesories, almost break the multiposition accessory trying to put in machine.</li>
            <li> used this almost every other day to trim my beard,  it is a great little trimmer and priced perfect.  Great buy</li>
            <li> Husband is completely satisfied (and he is very picky).  Works great and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Unit works great.  Adjustable attachment is problematic.  By that I mean that it&#x27;s hard to take on and off, hard to use, and does not seem to work well.  I think the attachment itself needs a manual...I will probably break it in my attempt to adjust it.  Everything else is fine.  Charge has held up with long periods of sitting (weeks).</li>
            <li> The product looked like good quality based on the pictures, but when it arrived, the quality was clear.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy, powerful motor, hasn&#x27;t needed recharging after 6 weeks of trims.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are good, but my usual &amp;#34;size&amp;#34; tended to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; my beard, so I went to a small size and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> If not for the battery life alone, it is worth 5 stars. Powerful and precise, feels great in my hand, and leaves the scruff looking tough!</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying one of these. They are very useful for personal trimming for females. The 5&#x27;oclock shadow guard is perfect for bikini trimming cause you can get the hair low but don&#x27;t have to deal with razor bumps. Usually lasts me a week and half to two weeks. So easy to do that I don&#x27;t mind. Just do it in the shower right before I take a bath. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had a Wahl trimmer for many years.  When it finally stopped charging he bought another. So far, so good.  Wahl makes good stuff. Great price too!  Would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> Charge is very weak, blades feel cheaply made. Would not recommend. Do not use other then your face or you will cut yourself.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer with nice range of attachments for various trimming lengths. I&#x27;ve had various trimmers in the past 20 years (Remington most recently, but I prefer this Wahl trimmer. I read previous reviews about the battery life; most owners had good experiences but one cited a negative experience. Therefore, I read and am following the Wahl instructions to maximize battery life. No issues so far.</li>
            <li> This broke the first time he used it.  It was outside of the return period so I couldn&#x27;t get my money back.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is loud and pulls on the beard hairs. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great for a low end shaver</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great shaver with all accessories person even fails to timely Venezuela but hundred percent and recommended d</li>
            <li> Sorry Wahl, but I couldn&#x27;t go 5 stars.  The trimmer by itself deserves 5 stars, but the base brought it down.  Go have a chat with your design team that made the base.  Remind them that a little more plastic goes a long ways.  Also the power connector does not mount in the base.  I&#x27;ve had this feature in another company&#x27;s trimmer and liked it.  You shouldn&#x27;t have to plug it into the trimmer and then set it in the base.  Also it you bump the base to hard all the accessories go everywhere.  A few tweeks and you can get 5 stars all the time.  That being said, the trimmer was Excellent.  The adjustable head is stable and doesn&#x27;t move unless you change it.  Does a great job even on my tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have used this little trimmer extensively, and have found it to be excellent. I use it for little trims to clean up a bit around mustache.  I considered, but declined to buy other more expense, name-brand trimmers such as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer]] or&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco QT4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 (Packaging May Vary)]] or&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008KEJ1LM Panasonic ER-GB40-S Cordless Moustache &amp; Beard Trimmer Wet/Dry with 19 Adjustable Settings]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried those other products, so it&#x27;s possible they are really excellent as well, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me worth it to pay twice as much for the name brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ The trimmer is pretty light--being almost all plastic, but it fits well in my hand. Notice the little ergonomic raised portions on the case. Nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Measured weight: 4 1/2 oz. Length: 6 1/2 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ The sound is moderate--not quiet, but not loud. Sort of reminded me of being at the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Attractive appearance, but of course, I didn&#x27;t buy it for how IT looks; I bought it to make ME look good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Cutting power is fine. It&#x27;s not going to win any power contests, but you just need a small motor for most trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Blades are plenty sharp. I&#x27;ve never tried to sharpen them (and not sure you can, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ The thing that surprised me the most is how long it stays charged.  I typically just use it for a few minutes at a time, so I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in; nevertheless, it still stays charged for many days. On those occasions when I do need to charge it up, it doesn&#x27;t take very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ I use the little rubber blade cover when I&#x27;m not using the trimmer. The cover has held up fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ I don&#x27;t find the stand convenient--nothing wrong with it, but just don&#x27;t want more clutter on the counter. So I typically just place the trimmer, by itself, under the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product. Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;âˆš Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[for the record, I do NOT work for the manufacturer, or have any relationship with them.]mer, by itself, under the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product.

            <li> Battery life is great gives good clean trim lots of accessories come with if you need them and good price. I use it to trim around ears and some on and off again facial hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-10 minute charge lasted me a week.&lt;br /&gt;-Lots of extra trimming tools&lt;br /&gt;-Small cradle and travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-This is SUPER loud.</li>
            <li> If you want a close shave DO NOT buy this product. I have owned the 9916 for many years now and it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Wahl products and found them to be of good quality.  Not quite as happy with this one.  it&#x27;s suprisingly loud and thus annoying to use.  Seems to cut okay.</li>
            <li> This machine simply doesn&#x27;t do the job. It doesn&#x27;t trim particularly well. More importantly, it hurts. It&#x27;s definitely scraping my skin more than any trimmer should and a couple of times it has even drawn pinpricks of blood.</li>
            <li> opened the package up plugged it in went back an hour later and cut a years worth of beard off, - works good.</li>
            <li> the length guard slips settings during use so one side of the beard could be shorter than the other. Once battery is used up, it will not run directly from the wall until the battery is recharged.</li>
            <li> Son really likes this item and would recommend this item to friends and relatives who do not like to shave.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this Wahl beard and mustache trimmer.  He has only been buying Wahl products for the past 5 years&#x3D;like he says, when it works, don&#x60;t change!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old cheapo Norelco that I had been using.  Well- I went back to the Norelco.  This Wahl pulls my beard hair (it is short) and my cheap Norelco never did, and still doesn&#x27;t.  I am seriously dissappointed with the trimmer and its attachments.  I would not recommend this one to anyone.</li>
            <li> This wireless clipper is a good item and a great value.  Wahl makes barber and beauty products that also work well.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd groomsman. I was pleased with the first and this is basicly the same. The reason I needed a new one was the charger cord insulation broke where the cord entered the head of the charger plug and the wires were exposed. This came from winding the cord around the charger head to tightly. Better to just fold it loosely when you put it away. I could have just have ordered a new charger however the cost to buy a whole new Groomsman was only two dollars more. The wahl is a good unit.</li>
            <li> this replaces the same trimmer we bought 7 years ago.  we&#x27;ve tried others but this particular wahl trimmer is the best.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this model.  It lasted eight (?) years.  The battery finally gave up, which really is not user replaceable.  So rather than sending it in to Wahl for a battery replacement I decide to just get a new one.  It has all the same features as the older model and works great.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. It worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is just as described.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Returned the item immediately. Sad to say the product was bubble gum machine quality.</li>
            <li> I just replaced my last Wahl trimmer, battery failed, after using for the past 6 years, with the one I just purchased.  The new product works great, just like the old one, except the on/off switch does not stay in the on position without being extremely careful not to touch it.  It does not stay securely  in the on position.  This new product does not reflect the good quality of previous models.</li>
            <li> so far so good , my husband doesnt grow much hair on his face , so its perfect for his needs..</li>
            <li> This has been used for three years for both beard and hair (crew cut every few months) and is reliable and effective. It is true that for hair it&#x27;s a bit slow going because of the size of the cutting head/teeth but it still works. One of the best things is the battery which holds a charge extremely well meaning the trimmers can be used without the cord for long periods of time. If I had a criticism it would be that I could do with an adaptor that&#x27;s one longer than &#x27;grade 3&#x27;. The grade 3 on this seems pretty short; possibly OK for beards but could do with one up for hair. There is an adjustable adaptor but it&#x27;s not super functional. Overall a good buy which has paid for itself a few times over.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all times favorites and i will gladly recommend it to all my friends. The product is terrific. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for a long, long time, and this little trimmer has stuck with me for nearly all those years ever since I dropped and damaged my old Norelco.  I&#x27;ve had small beards and large beards, and this trimmer keeps on ticking despite my irregular cleaning and maintenance of it.  The batteries are still good, still holding a decent charge - I charge it up only when it needs it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer isn&#x27;t really designed to be user serviceable, so when it goes bad, that&#x27;s the end.  But of course I am not going to be stopped: After about 7 years of use the battery started to weaken.  So using some simple web research, I was able to replace them using aftermarket cells.  I suspect this will last me many more years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years a large portion lot of the faux chrome has worn off.  A sign of good service.</li>
            <li> Absolute best product for the money. Use it on myself and as a trimmer for my dog. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I love it, very practical. Great buy! More ever it is rechargeable. Easy to use. Fine product indeed. No problem.</li>
            <li> Good enough trimmers - nothing spectacular. They&#x27;re not as sharp as I thought they&#x27;d be for lining up my beard but they can get the job done nonetheless. Solid for the price point, but otherwise unremarkable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my Dad, for Christmas, and he says it works perfectly. The fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable is a great feature.</li>
            <li> Great for the husband. Is working and exactly what he wanted. thank you</li>
            <li> I owned an older version of this razor that died after 8 years after I dropped it on a tiled floor. The newer version does not have the same quality of manufacturing as the older model. The newer motor is not as strong.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy pulled hair and very slow trimming, this is the trimmer for you.  My old trimmer was fantastic.  It lasted 20 years and only died because my wife washed it. I had to do multiple passes on sideburns and beard to get it even.  Each pass is at a snails pace compared to my old trimmer.  Worst of all, even when used slowly, it tends to grab and pull hair.  I would not buy one again and I will find a replacement quickly.</li>
            <li> Purchased one of these at Target in the hopes of trimming my unruly goatee. The cheap-ass adjustable guide broke off while I was trimming, ruining my beard and forcing me to shave it down considerably to not look like a crazy person. DO NOT PURCHASE. Spend a bit more for something good.</li>
            <li> Works like it said it would and I am very happy with the shaver.  Great for mustache and trimming beards!</li>
            <li> Smoke and mirrors, my friends...smoke and mirrors.</li>
            <li> This works great! I don&#x27;t shave much but when I do I like to even everything out. That usually happens when it&#x27;s pretty long and my old cheap trimmer couldn&#x27;t handle it or hold a charge anymore. Definately a great price this was the same cost as a cheap 1 at the local department stores.</li>
            <li> worthless.  Barely cuts anything.</li>
            <li> Love it,  I have had a plug-in Wahl beard trimmer for years, nothing wrong with it, I just do not like having to plug it in. I have an old bathroom with no electrical outlets. This one sits in the charger and I just grab it for a quick trim. It does a great job, it is light and trims well. Exactly what I expect it to do.</li>
            <li> Works great for pets as well as humans!  I use it to trim my toy poodles&#x27; faces &amp; paws.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a battery-powered trimmer I had for about 6 years. This is a great trimmer and I have no regrets purchasing this. I don&#x27;t use any guards as I only use it to line up my hairline and beardline. It isn&#x27;t loud and it trims very well. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic!!  I use it to trim my mustache and beard, and my wife even gives me a &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; with it between haircuts!!  Works fantastically.  Would by it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product.  Working great.</li>
            <li> I brought my Wahl beard trimmer at AMAZON, after my old one, not a Wahl, died of old age.  I&#x27;m glad I made the change because the Whal preforms much better then the other brand. It has 6 positive trim positions rather then 4 friction positions. While the old trimmer did an acceptable job this one does an excellent one, I could see the difference with the first trim.  I&#x27;ve had a beard for forty years and this trimmer gets the job done.</li>
            <li> not ideal for beard trimming. works ok. wish i got somehting a bit more expensive and with an adjusting head rather than replaceable tips. still good.</li>
            <li> muy buen articulo compre desde venezuela saludos</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Wahl trimmer for over 20 years &amp; it finnally wore out this new one is sleakly styled, much sharper with long battery life</li>
            <li> PRODUCT HAS A CHEAP SWITCH THAT HAS TO BE CONTINUALLY PUSHED FORWARD IS TO SMALL AND MUST BE HELD TO CONTINUE RUNNING.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t hold a charge--worked great until the battery died, and the charger doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  Cheap--don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve grown a mustache/goatee in 30 years.  Looked good at first but started getting a little shagey.&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl Groomsman trimmed it down to a nice, neat length - once i figured out which setting was right. Very easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;and no worries about trimming unevenly.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. Attachments are a little hard to get on and off at first, but loosen up.</li>
            <li> Really solid unit that feels well built and is pretty comfortable in your hand. The stand it comes with isn&#x27;t the greatest but it does the trick of keeping everything together and organized which I guess is what counts. Also comes with a travel bag which is nice. Blades are nice and sharp and cuts really evenly without any pulling or anything. All around great little trimmer especially for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> The shaver was received promptly.  I purchased the shaver for my Son.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> This WAS a great trimmer. That is, until I tried to recharge it. I used it once a week for nearly two months on the charge out of the box. But when I tried to recharge it, it simply would not accept a charge. It is now completely worthless and I can&#x27;t even return it as the return window with Amazon expired.</li>
            <li> I LOVED the trimmer compared to an old Remington trimmer that I had. The charge holds forever on this thing, and the movement is extremely fast so it makes for a great beard and stubble trimmer. HOWEVER - I dropped it and the head internals broke since it was cheap plastic. I understand if you drop it, it can break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went and bought another exact same model. I had it less than two weeks and an internal piece (part of the spring head assembly) broke for no reason. No dropping, no water, I babied it. It simply broke because of cheap build quality. Never buying another cheap Wahl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer, only draw back is how loud it is</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always ready cause I keep it pluged in. Runs at a fast speed to get the trimming done quickly. I had one than ran about half speed to this one and it took forever to trim my neck and shape my beard. Now I can get it done and over with quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he uses it all the time. It works very well and he likes that it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Hurts when you use it on a beard. Pulls hair.</li>
            <li> Worst trimmer ever. Plastic piece won&#x27;t fit over the trimmer. It&#x27;s definitely going to break. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Basically, does what you expect it to do.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers harshly criticize this product and if I&#x27;d read their reviews before buying the Wahl 817 I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  But my experience with the Wahl 817 beard and moustache trimmer over the past eight months - from initial trimming of a new beard to preparing to shave it off for the summer - has been quite positive.    The basic trimming functions work well.  Just the basic adjustable beard thinning head and the straight trimming edge without any plastic head attached has met all my needs.  A plus is that the batteries hold their charge a long time which allows the trimmer to be taken on trips without the hassle of carrying - and potentially losing - the recharging device.    Some people complain the plastic attachments are difficult to put on and remove and break easily.  Take it easy and be patient.  They will loosen up a bit and none of mine have broken in almost a year.  There probably are too many attachments.  But so what?  Just use the ones you need.    The only shortcoming with this trimmer in my experience so far is that the instructions don&#x27;t provide examples or directions for using the various attachments and their intended use is unclear to me.  But, again, most guys probably will just use the basic head to thin beard growth and the cutting edge to keep their moustache edge neat.    Recommended to anyone who wants an inexpensive, basic, reliable beard trimmer that holds a battery charge well.</li>
            <li> Great design.  Great function.  I do not use any of the attachments.  Just the raw trimmer.      Works amazingly easy.  Just swipe your stubble every 1-2 days for that constant 5-o&#x27;clock shadow look.  Works better than any others i have used.  Battery is still going strong, months after my first charge.  Amazing.  Light weight and easy to throw into your luggage for trips and vacation. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Disappointed does line very good</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl groomer and if needed i would buy another.  Buying a new one costs less then having a new battery put in.  This cuts my hair and does the trimming without any problems.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Requires multiple attempts to trim hair. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> All good for the price but you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very happy with trimmer</li>
            <li> Just wanted a simple mustache trimmer, this was much more involved than I wanted or needed so I returned it.</li>
            <li> The unit worked great out of the box. It needs to be oiled at first use. the 3 single length attachments were just right but not fit the mustache trimmer  which was a dissapointment</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but seems to work great for me. Mainly use it to trim up my beard or trim down neck hair. Have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> In perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I hate to sound like an old guy, but this is one of those many products that gets cheaper and flimsier over time.  I had one of these before, which served me well, and was finally lost or thrown out between beards and between moves.  This photograph resembles the one that I used to have, but nothing about it is anywhere near as good.  It&#x27;s as if they sent exactly one unit off to China and said&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34;Here: give us a million of these things that we used to make so we can sell them. Budget: $4 max.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The many pieces-parts don&#x27;t fit in the holder well, nor is it easy to figure out how they were intended to fit. (I don&#x27;t know how they could possibly screw this up over time.)  The base looks like it&#x27;s a drop-in charger, but it isn&#x27;t -- not in the budget I guess. The 6-position guide is super flimsy and again, non-intuitive.  I&#x27;m sure that I nearly broke it trying to get it on, and now it&#x27;s on there like glue, and I&#x27;m afraid taking it off the first time will break it.  I&#x27;m 100% sure that will not survive daily removal and re-installation -- no chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to use it with one of the fixed guides or without a guide, I guess you will get some service out of it. It&#x27;s certainly inexpensive -- I guess &amp;#34;too inexpensive to bother returning&amp;#34; is a valid business model.</li>
            <li> It grew blunt and then died after two years which is fair enough for the price I suppose. Cut well for awhile though.</li>
            <li> Cause its useless ; Buy a Remington ; I&#x27;m returing &amp;#34;TheWahl&amp;#34; with its 30 day money back Guarantee ;Doe&#x27;s not ever rate one Star</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my old wahl,piece of junk,looking for something else.combs are so flimsy I broke one first time putting it on</li>
            <li> Like others, I have used a Wahl beard trimmer in the past. What has changed since then, is that the units are made as cheaply as possible. This unit is much louder in operation than the previous one was. I can&#x27;t say yet if the battery life is different. Attachments are cheap plastic. I was a Wahl fan before, but I can&#x27;t in honesty say that now. For now it does the job.</li>
            <li> It has everything you want from a trimmer with the exception of the overwhelming noise it produces. From 4 inches away it reads off at 84 dB! That&#x27;s the equivalent of standing under a moving train in the loop of Chicago. It&#x27;s also difficult fiddling with the attachments, but once you do it once or twice you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. Except you&#x27;ll be deaf if it gets too close to your ear.</li>
            <li> My beard  grows in very unevenly, and this is the tool to fix that. It is supper easy to get your beard or mustache the right length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is cordless and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Wahl 9916-817 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer did not meet my expectations. I tried using once and found it lacking, the head is not wide enough for my taste. It is sitting in my bottom drawer not being used and I really canâ€™t recommend.</li>
            <li> Utterly craptastic. I got this on a whim to replace a batter operated Remington I have had for 17 years. The Remington is back on the counter and this is lost in the under-sink abyss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It not only stinks from an operational standpoint, but you also get the added bonus of major skin irritation and rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got the second star because it had lots of pieces I was able to plunder for the old Remington. Hell, I have needed another of the little oil things for 16 years. And who among us can&#x27;t always find use for a backup eyebrow comb?!?</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for,</li>
            <li> Got hair where you don&#x27;t want it get this it works awesome. Only complaint is that it has a plastic body.&lt;br /&gt;  On thing I really liked about this is that it works on the charger</li>
            <li> I have an old one from about 8 years bought it at Sears, until stop working and I am not sure if is the charger of what. But always been sharp and do the work. I wasn&#x27;t aware that amazon sells it. Very inexpensive and super efficient.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple months now trimming my goatee and mustache, works great keeping the length even and at a nice length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a full charge before I started using it and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it yet, I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a great feature where the on/off switch won&#x27;t come on unless you press a small button in the middle of the switch. My previous Wahl would turn on when traveling and I&#x27;d arrive with dead batteries. That won&#x27;t happen any more which is terrific. The actual grooming is fine, particularly the array of lengths that are possible. And, as others have said, it&#x27;s pretty loud.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, but is really noisy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my trimmer. Almost to much power. Paid twice the price for my last one. Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Fast Service.  Got it in time for Christmas within 2 days. Have purchased items on Amazon before and have always been pleased with products and service.</li>
            <li> This item is great and helps ensure that I am able to remain neatly groomed. It is not the most fancy or heavyweight item but in a pinch this helps to keep a neat face.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer. It works well and feels solid. Still not sure how to use most of the accessories, but I guess I just don&#x27;t need them. The blade guide is a pain in the ass to get on/off, but I may just have a steep learning curve.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. I found this to be flimsy and the on&#x27;/off switch doesn&#x27;t stay on unless I have my finger on it pushing it up the whole time. I expected better</li>
            <li> Great, but super loud.</li>
            <li> Bought it to use on the &#x27;touchy&#x27; areas of my small dog.  Would work better if she would be still. :-)</li>
            <li> For my son and he loves it</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is solid and great quality, but the attachments are difficult to attach and detach, feel flimsy, and takeaway from the overall quality.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, best brand out there</li>
            <li> A bit noisy but it does the job. More trim length options would be nice.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a a Christmas gift. Arrived early. Packed nicely.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it. Getting used to all the settings, as his old trimmer died, and was 6 years old.</li>
            <li> This review is from: Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clippers can&#x27;t be removed and start rusting, even after drying it once it&#x27;s been rinsed after use. Charge keeps quite long. Although the stand is space friendly, the attachments keep popping out every time when I take out the razor. Somewhat cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s old trimmer broke and needed a new one. Price was good and was what he wanted, so I ordered this one. He says it&#x27;s better than the old one that cost more.</li>
            <li> It does the job that I expected and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it in over a month. A good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is small and I often had beard hairs get snagged in the blades, even when going slowly and my beard wasn&#x27;t too over grown. The plastic pieces are clumsy and fragile.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my hair and beard. The accompanying &amp;#34;trimming lengths&amp;#34; wont&#x27;t be that easy to put in and remove. I had one broken during my experimentation but I don&#x27;t bother about it as I&#x27;m not going to use that anyway. This product can best be used with the handset and any one trimming length as per your needs.</li>
            <li> This little guy packs some power, the issue I had was the guide easily moves which caused a quick trim up one side resulting in a complete removal so I had to shave it all off and start over again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very close to skin.</li>
            <li> I expected the same great performance, from this trimmer cause this was my second trimmer that i have purchased.  Its a great shaver for men to have at home.  My first trimmer lasted for about four years, could have lasted longer if it did not fall in water.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> This trimmer is nice and gives a nice cut.  I mostly use the pre-installed adjustable guard, so I cannot say how well the other attachments work.  For the way I use this trimmer, it works great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The battery life is great also.  I use the trimmer on my beard 1-2 times per week.  I have had the unit for three months and have only recharged it once so far.  My old Conair unit required a recharge every week or two. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The safety button on the on/off switch is a nice feature if this ends up in the hands of a little one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The plastic stand is a little cheap.  I keep my trimmer in the cabinet, but personally it is not something I would want to look at every day.  This does not take away from the performance of the trimmer, so I cannot lower my rate because of this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other units have a nicer base.  My old unit required the base for recharging which was extra item to bring when traveling for long periods of time.  With the undependable charge length, I did bring it with a few times.  This unit only has a plug which is not tied to the base.</li>
            <li> the trimmer works well and all the attachments work as advertised. I have had no problems with the battery or anything else. good product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son. He uses it often and seems to be very happy. I&#x27;m happy because he now keeps his beard trimmed and nice!</li>
            <li> I first bought this product because I travel a lot and I already own Wahl Clippers, so I thought the quality would be the same...But I was way too wrong. This trimmer is nothing but bad quality. It only worked once and I couldn&#x27;t get it to charge properly again lasting only 1-2 min battery life. I threw it away...Just don&#x27;t spend your money on this, look for something more expensive and of better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great, saying that I got all my stuff on time and in good conditions.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the product shown in the picture. Instead, I got some cheap battery operated version. Not worth the hassle to return. Be careful on ordering this one.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son for Christmas. He&#x27;s used it for a few months now and he loves it. Easy to use and clean and packs well for traveling and the prices was great. I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
            <li> Typical Wahl product, works as advertised. It is replacing a battery powered Wahl unit that was over 15 years old and still working fine until the switch broke.</li>
            <li> My displeasure is due to how poorly everything fits together in the stand.  It&#x27;s not impressive.  The trimmer works great though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it! The different tops give him a variety of ways to wear his beard!</li>
            <li> perfect works great and i use it every day</li>
            <li> I guess I should have researched this product a little more. I had an old Conair rechargeable that finally gave up the ghost. This Wahl is like a torture chamber. I never had to worry about my Conair pulling my whiskers out by the root. Well, that&#x27;s all changed. Gone are the days of just trimming your beard without worry. I&#x27;m scared to put this trimmer near my face. I guess I&#x27;ll do better research this time and go buy another trimmer. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice price, quality product, cheaper than the big box store</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible product. The blade teeth are TINY, and I could barely make it through one beard trim without immediately stopping and putting it back in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic blade covers are of the very cheapest quality, and the performance of the trimmer is completely unacceptable. I have other products from Wahl that perform exactly as expected, so I was surprised and disappointed at this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are returning the product to Amazon and looking for other options. I&#x27;d advise you to avoid purchasing this trimmer.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Opened it up and found the right setting right off the bat. Good ergo and lightweight. I love that it&#x27;s cordless. Very pleased so far</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift for my Son. He reports it works well for him.</li>
            <li> It is powerful. Keep it oiled or you will be sorry. It is very loud. I wish the attachments fit better.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This  trimmer  is  noisy.  The  cutting  head  feels  sharp  and  actually  hurts  somewhat  when  trimming  your  mustache.  I  have  now  purchased  the  Wahl  Lithium  Ion.  Very  happy  with  this  trimmer.  Threw  the  other  one  in  the  garbage,.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer after the flimsy plastic from another brand broke after just a few months.  I knew Wahl had a good reputation, so I gave this one a try.  I have been trimming with this for a while now and have had very clean results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery: Good.  I have not had to charge it at all yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight: Medium.  A bit heavy, but mostly because it&#x27;s durable and well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: Great.  Very good results with just a few passes over my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments: Many choices!  I have only used the variable length attachment, which rattles a bit, but there is a stubble attachment and a longer length one for sideburns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand: Poor.  The stand is a flimsy piece of plastic that is not a charging station.  I prefer to keep my attachments in my drawer, so I have already tossed the stand.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor and very powerful</li>
            <li> Husband says it pulls on the hair more then trimming it..</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Gave as gift to my bro, he says he likes it</li>
            <li> The attachments fit very firmly. I used the 6 to 1 guide attachment and it adjusts easily I will use the stubble attachment and it trims great. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t write this review as soon as I got it. I wanted to make sure I had a real impression of it. First off I thought it felt kind of cheap. The base is cheap and so is the case. The unit itself felt middle of the road. I don&#x27;t shave everyday but I do have a thick coarse beard. Aside from the base and attachments feeling somewhat cheap, this beard trimmer really cuts well. It stays charged for a long time. Honestly I&#x27;m impressed with it. It cuts better than my other beard trimmer ever did. If this lasts for awhile then this beard trimmer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a great value but there are some negatives. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and off the back while trimming my facial hair most especially on my neck, this thing would rip into my skin. Injuring me just as bad as if i had cut myself with a razor. The other negative is the last 6 months no matter how long i&#x27;ve charged it, the battery does not hold the charge. Other then that its been useful and a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love this beard trimmer - it&#x27;s simple, sturdy, cheap, and it gets the job done. It won&#x27;t give you a close shave, but I like the amount if stubble it leaves and so does my girlfriend, so what could be better?</li>
            <li> Has not been opened yet it is a Christmas.  So we wont be able to try till then looks good though</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. My husband asked for this one and has been very happy with it. He has had no problems with it at all</li>
            <li> I find this is very powerful for its size, does a multiple of things, use it on my mustache, keep my goatee trim and really works well for removal of any hair you don&#x27;t want there like neck hair.  It is a real good buy, I have had a few and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li> Works well. has a good charger and can be used after its charged;  came promptly as promised ;  it has a full set of attachements to allow triming longer hair to a constant length ; works good but the attachments are hard to get off and put on but not impossible; would order again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is my third Wahl product and I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another brand!  They last and last and perform like new every time!</li>
            <li> I had one already! had to buy another one --old one was 12 yrs old but it didn&#x27;t hold a charge any more!</li>
            <li> ... it works about the same.  Lighter, more ergonomic in the hand, but the build quality seems cheap compared to the 8 year-old Wahl Groomsman it replaced.  I don&#x27;t expect this one to last that long, but it&#x27;s still a reasonable replacement and value.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for about 11 months. I waited to write a review due to the mixed reviews on the product. After using it regularly all this time, I give it excellent marks for durability, ease of use, and overall value. Once charged, the battery lasts a very long time. The adjustable (for beard length) head works well once you read the instructions and get the hang of removing it to define the edge of your beard. The only negative I can think of is that you need to be careful when you remove and replace the head to make sure that you haven&#x27;t inadvertently changed the setting that controls the length of the cut. Not much of a negative for this excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li> this groomer is fair but the cutting head is narrower than my old norelco and the guides are not as good as the norelco.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works fine and does a good job, but we found the slide-on head attachment very difficult to remove. Still, it does a good job, and you really don&#x27;t need to remove the piece.</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult if not impossible to buy this groomer with the older style trimmer attachments.  The photo in the advertised item shows the kind of trimmer attachment I have been trying to replace.  So I ordered it.  I was very disappointed when the product arrived as it did not have the stubble attachments as shown.  Rather it had the newer style attachments which don&#x27;t have the small stubble size that I sought.  Sent it back for refund with no problem.</li>
            <li> Already been delivered!</li>
            <li> Does everything I would expect a trimmer to do at a great price. The item shipped on time and the product I received was accurate to the manufacturer&#x27;s description. I chose the wall-charging version over a similar product battery-powered version I saw at Walgreens, simply because I hate dealing with batteries. I am happy to report that I haven&#x27;t observed any problems, it is sharp and has a good variety of clip-ons.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job at trimming my beard and side burns. Also very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel like the cheaper trimmers available on the market. It being wireless makes it quite convenient.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve  owned. Had the first for many years; so, I got my money out of that one. Very pleased with this product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I needed a clipper for my mustache and soul patch!  This clipper works just as good as others for triple the price!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut very well :(</li>
            <li> Husband sent it back for repairs. Did not grab any hair with or without attachments. Waiting for it to return to see what the problem was.</li>
            <li> I have been trimming my beard about once per week for nearly 40 years now.  This is the fourth inexpensive Wahl I have purchased in that time.  I do no maintenance or care-taking of the machines.  I&#x27;ve had this latest one for a few months now, and it works just as well as all the previous Wahl&#x27;s - no tugging at the hairs, changes settings easily, I&#x27;m done in a hurry.  I tried changing brands about ten years ago and threw the darned thing out.  Wahl makes the ideal product.</li>
            <li> I  like the Wahl brand. Trimming is what i bought it for, I don&#x27;t cut my husband&#x27;s  hair with it&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted a trimmer. I like the recharagable battery, no cords to get in the way. When I need to I would buy it again..</li>
            <li> This kit is a great value. I had read other reviews that knock for the trim guards falling off during use. I have been very careful to make sure that the guards are attached correctly and I have not had any trouble with it. I use the kit to trim my goatee and side burns and it works very well. Keeping it properly oiled, I have not experienced any pulling.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for another battery powered Wahl that was 20 years old. My old trimmer head depth heads, which were better than the new ones even fit ! It trims well but is 3 times as loud as my old one.</li>
            <li> Rusted very quickly. No nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th one I buy. They last for a very long time but I have bought it as a little present for others and everybody loves them. My two teenagers use it for a shave (close enough) too.</li>
            <li> trimmer works just the way my previous one did----but----the plastic pieces that come with it have a life span of 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The battery once it&#x27;s charged seems to last for a very long time. I just charge it up and then put all the charger and stand away and leave this handy in the bathroom and use it once a week or so. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves his trimmer he loves the way it feels and the shape of it and how it works his beard and mustache look great now!!</li>
            <li> Until now I filled my expectations when well charged battery very powerful and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, and it trimmed my face hair. Isn&#x27;t that why we all bought this thing? I guess I&#x27;m a little sad it didn&#x27;t also make me wealthy, good looking, better at sports, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Wouldn&#x27;t hold a charger I wouldn&#x27;t shave a cat with this thing because it would be too much hair</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Definitely not a clean cut. Blades not too sharp, pulls on your hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect item, could not have asked for anything more kit comes with everything needed to keep a clear appearance daily</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well, have gone from keeping full beard trimmed and neat to maintaining stuble. Only gripe is taking the attachments/guides on/off is a bit of a pain.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Works perfect. It&#x27;s a entry level product that is priced fairly. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a basic trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for trimming your mustache and beard.  The one I was using before I purchased this one had three &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; batteries I had to replace every four or five months.  This one has a rechargeable battery and I&#x27;ve already used it over a dozen times without having to recharge it.</li>
            <li> This was hand picked by my son for me to give to him on his birthday.  He really likes it, very nice!</li>
            <li> Once battery is charged, it stays charged for a while. I last charged mine about 3-4 weeks ago. The way it trims and cuts, there&#x27;s nothin special about it. It just works.</li>
            <li> functions well, guards work well and charges quickly, very happy</li>
            <li> excellent product. it was what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Not a bad piece of hardware for the price, but not meant to last. If you are looking for longevity then go more commercial.</li>
            <li> ...functionality and quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a $50 unit from target and this thing beats the pants off of it.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, love the way it feels and works. Don&#x27;t use all the attachments, but it has what I need. Also holds a charge well and is very durable. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> THIS KIT IT IS TINNY AND I LOVE IT! BECAUSE DOESN&#x27;T TAKE A BIG SPACE IN THE SINK OF THE BATHROOM, PLUS MY HUSBAND LOVES IT. HE ALREADY TRIED IT AND IT WORKS FANTASTIC. HE HAD THIS BRAND FOR 10 YEARS!!!AND NOW HE  REPLACES IT BECAUSE THEY DISCONTINUED THE BLADES, BUT I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS BRAND!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have owned so far. Most suck and pull hair, or the guard falls off and you end up as patch Adams...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self sharpening, cant be beat.</li>
            <li> Worst ever. Takes 10 minutes to replace trimmer length adapter once removed....and then it works erradiclly ... Worst trimmer in 20 years of using one.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband since his trimmer broke on thanksgiving Im so glad his straggly hairs are gone.</li>
            <li> He had a Wahl many years ago and it finally wore out , he bought another brand and all it did was pull his beard, and I did research and bought another Wahl for he , he is very happy and I dont hear ouch every few minutes when he is shaving</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to get the razor after reading some of the negative reviews. When I received it the battery was half charged already so I can test it out. I&#x27;ve owned a wahl razor before, but the motor wore out. I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts a little longer. It&#x27;s done the job so far. Little hesitant on how long it will perform, but good product for the price. If you have a coarse beard and need interchangeable blades, this product isn&#x27;t for you. If your like me and have a beard that isn&#x27;t super thick and just want to trim it up, good grab!</li>
            <li> I threw it away.  It&#x27;s a loud, cheaply made, piece of junk.  Changing trim settings is difficult.  I&#x27;d had Wahl animal hair clippers before, and thought highly of the brand.  This experience changed my mind.</li>
            <li> Works great. Holds charge. Looks good.</li>
            <li> My husband bought one like this years ago that finally wore out.  In trying to replace the first one, he many different kinds. Nothing cut his hair to his satisfaction except one.</li>
            <li> the convenience of trimming at home or on the go is stellar- now I do not have to make an appointment at the barber shop</li>
            <li> Pulls beard like crazy.</li>
            <li> No review for now, thank you.</li>
            <li> Does not cut as closely as a product I owned previously, that finally went out, but does the job for the price.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, works great!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer. He had an old Wahl trimmer that he had for over 20 years until it stopped working. This is a perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> great works like a charm very smooth dosnt pull the hair clean cut and has lots of power</li>
            <li> As advertised and depicted.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> good product but hard to get used too</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works great and is easy to clean. The charging base is nice and has a place for the cord to run underneath so it can sit level. It comes with blade oil. I could not get some of the attachments to fit but the main trimmer works fine. I use it to keep goatee trimmed and clean.  I also use it without trimmer for shaving my chin and neck.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not amazing. Keeps my beard clean but feels cheap in my hands.</li>
            <li> Caused nasty razor burn!</li>
            <li> Good product...just loud.</li>
            <li> I have been through a few of these over the years. I have always had good luck with Whal products. I normally keep very short beard through out the year. So I use this trimmer every other day. Mechanically I&#x27;ve never had one fail. But like most things they do wear out over time. For the money and durability this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> This one got stolen, see my comment on the replacement one!</li>
            <li> My son uses this often, item as described, great seller!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so totally cool. Never used one before (new beard) and it&#x27;s so easy with Groomsman Beard and Mustache. A number of head attachments let you select the length of beard or mustache you want. I use it every day now.</li>
            <li> Solid, well-made, worth every penny! Wish I had had it all my moustache career! Buy it and you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Loses charge pretty fast but I dont need it for long amount of usage.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son&#x27;s Christmas present.... He loves it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Instructions could be clearer.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this to trim his mustache and beard.  He also uses it to trim sideburns and to trim the hair off of his neck.  He is very pleased with this trimmer and uses it often.</li>
            <li> Works well but on/off switch seems a little weak/cheap.  Hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller I am satisfied with the purchase , it is what I expected</li>
            <li> Thank you good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as great as advertised but it gets the job done... if you are looking for a completely clean look, this is not your product, but for the careless beard look it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a</li>
            <li> I had an old one ,sameish model, it broke after 15 years, so i am replacing it. Works better than new.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this beard trimmer. It arrived in perfect condition already charged for use!</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. I had one of these years ago and it lasted a long time. I eventually got a different trimmer, but it wasn&#x27;t as good. I have actually had about 4 or 5 other trimmers after this one and none of them were as good. I just recently bought this one again, and I will probably never switch again. This one is simple, yet superior to any other I have tried. The guide combs are perfect and don&#x27;t adjust. You switch them out for different lengths. This is a good thing, because the adjustable ones can adjust while you&#x27;re trimming. It&#x27;s happened to me (it adjusted to a shorter length while pressing too hard on my face). Trust me, this will give you a better trim than most others.</li>
            <li> Worst thing Ive ever bought from Amazon.  Motor never worked right and it literally grabbed my beard and pulled it out in several places.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this thing. It works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Ouch !!!! Very poor quality.pulls hair out instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> Excellent buying experience! The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely. The price was also the best on the internet, too. Great item, exactly what I wanted! Highly recommend both this item and the seller. Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> Perhaps my facial hair is thicker than average, but the blades constantly snagged before breaking, after only two months of use. Don&#x27;t let the elegant design fool you--this is not a worthwhile purchase. I&#x27;d recommend a trimmer from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> On time delivery and better quality than expexted. I would definitely say great quality! I use to be a barber.... I would know.</li>
            <li> It cuts, but has to go over the hair several times before really working, and it has the tendancy to pull hair every now and then. But it was cheap, and it does work, with a bit of effort.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great.  Runs faster than my old battery operated one.  Holds a charge very well and runs over two months on one charge when used once per week.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t give a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Great Little razor.  I bought the same razor 15 years ago and it only just quit.  I was happy to find it again and at such a good price!  Quick Delivery too!</li>
            <li> This replaced an older model that I had for years. I have had no problems with the item so far nor do I expect to.</li>
            <li> SHAVING MACHINE GOOD RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I had a Wahl for 20 years (battery operated) and replaced it with newer model that is rechargable. Charge lasts for weeks. Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> I m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> As expected!  I inadvertently over ordered, 2 units instead of 1, and vendor accommodated return of excess in a pleasant and effective manner. Use of the trimmer has been  fine in meeting my expectations.</li>
