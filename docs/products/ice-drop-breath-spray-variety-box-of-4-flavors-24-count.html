            <li>Love all the mint flavors.</li>
            <li>The Cinnamon is okay, not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>They have a lot of flavor and better than a mint.  </li>
            <li>There were many breath sprays, I didn&#x27;t have time to count all of them.  </li>
            <li>price for so many of them.</li>
            <li>I cannot get most of my bottles to spray.</li>
            <li>Really enjoying this package of spray.</li>
            <li>order was a great Price , Thanks</li>
            <li>These work great for an &#x27;in the pocket&#x27; or on the desk fast breath fixer.</li>
            <li>Love the flavors.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to see 6 of each flavor  in this box, but all and all a great product and I definitely  recommend this</li>
            <li>The product do the job as it says it leaves fresh taste at your mouth and it has nice flavor</li>
            <li>The rest were IcyMint and Spearmint - which is fine.  </li>
            <li>Easily fit in the pocket.</li>
            <li>But what the heck, they&#x27;re cheap as dirt.</li>
            <li>Pros: perfect size, fits in any small pockets or purses.</li>
            <li>It is a lot for one person but nevertheless very appetizing!</li>
            <li>Only a few cinnamon flavors in the box, which happens to be the best flavor.</li>
            <li>The actual use of theses breath sprays is ok, I&#x27;d just be cautious of the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Fresh breath lasts s reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>That is everyone&#x27;s favorite in my house so if you aren&#x27;t the one to open the box when it gets here</li>
            <li>My favorite is CinnaMint, of which there were only two.  </li>
            <li>My package seemed to have a pretty even assortment of flavors.  </li>
            <li>Evidently there is a required number of words, so this is the end of my review.</li>
            <li>I actually preferred it at that way because I like minty ones more.</li>
            <li>These all taste good and even though theres a few of some it doesnt matter to me.</li>
            <li>Too many spearmint which is our least favorite.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really much matter to me, but,</li>
            <li>AS DESCRIBED, THANKS,  ART</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this breath spray; just wish they gave as much, or even more Cinnamon flavored breath spray as they do the other flavors.</li>
            <li>Rarely do I get one that doesn&#x27;t spray properly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a spray, not those new sheets that melt in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The only thing was that I received less cinnamint than any others and those are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Very good for bad breath.</li>
            <li>So far all but one has sprayed well when I have used them.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful, seems to last just about like any of the other breath sprays out there.  </li>
            <li>These little guys fit in your pocket or purse and last surprisingly long.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint really is if you have only one with you, brand new from the box, it might not work.</li>

            <li> My only complaint really is if you have only one with you, brand new from the box, it might not work.</li>
            <li> The little containers are clear so you can see just how much is left.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should have counted to make sure that there were 24, but the package was rewrapped in a mess, making it rather difficult to open again and recount.  </li>
            <li> The product came how I expected the sizes, the flavors, and properly counted.</li>
            <li> Like the previous reviewer said, there were only 3 cinnamon  and 2 wintergreen.  </li>
            <li> I probably only have half or less that actually work.</li>
            <li> I did notice however, that there were a minimal amount of cinnamint flavored Ice drops.  </li>
            <li> The problem like other reviewers stated is that you get a bunch of spearmint which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> The spray bottles are small enough for pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated, this is not an even Mix.  </li>
            <li> the only negative for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found an average of 4-7 per box where the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It leaks in my purse &amp; half the time I can&#x27;t get it to even spray.</li>
            <li> After a few sprays, it just does not spray anymore even though there is still plenty of liquid inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> I would say 1 out of 5 do not spray which is another negative.</li>
            <li> know some people were disappointed that there aren&#x27;t enough Cinnamon ones.</li>
            <li> The one has a broken spring and had to be pitched.</li>
            <li> It looks like the spray part is broken.</li>
            <li> I trust amazon, so hopefully nothing is too wrong.  </li>
            <li> just NOT good!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s highly awkward when I need it in an emergency</li>
            <li> With a plan to package these in sets I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work on 40% of the bottles, which is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The flavors are just horrible tasting...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Item was a bargain at under $16.00 for 24 count box.  Like the previous reviewer said, there were only 3 cinnamon  and 2 wintergreen.  I would have liked to see 6 of each flavor  in this box, but all and all a great product and I definitely  recommend this and I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I really like this breath spray; just wish they gave as much, or even more Cinnamon flavored breath spray as they do the other flavors.</li>
            <li> Love all the mint flavors. The Cinnamon is okay, not my favorite.  These are great to have for purses, the car, travel, etc.  They have a lot of flavor and better than a mint.  So far all but one has sprayed well when I have used them.  The one has a broken spring and had to be pitched.</li>
            <li> The product itself it very good.  We have found consistantly that 2-4 bottles will not spray. Only count on getting 20 working bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, however...the shipment of this item seemed to be an open resealed box.?  There were many breath sprays, I didn&#x27;t have time to count all of them.  I did notice however, that there were a minimal amount of cinnamint flavored Ice drops.  The actual use of theses breath sprays is ok, I&#x27;d just be cautious of the packaging.  It seems like it was an open box sort of thing.  I trust amazon, so hopefully nothing is too wrong.  Maybe I should have counted to make sure that there were 24, but the package was rewrapped in a mess, making it rather difficult to open again and recount.  The price however, is a great deal.  Hope others don&#x27;t run into the repackagingproblems as I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The product do the job as it says it leaves fresh taste at your mouth and it has nice flavor the only negative for me it is that it has only 3 of cinnamon sprays and I like cinnamon flavor.that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Easily fit in the pocket. I use them at home and in the office.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for so many of them.</li>
            <li> I like the cinnamint and icymint.  The problem like other reviewers stated is that you get a bunch of spearmint which I don&#x27;t like.  Item works well for freshening breath. I would say 1 out of 5 do not spray which is another negative.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a spray, not those new sheets that melt in your mouth.  Sometimes I just want a tiny bit of freshener.  Just thought I&#x27;d mention this since the ingredients are not listed on the website, they contain glycerin and sodium saccharin.  Great taste.  Very powerful, seems to last just about like any of the other breath sprays out there.  There were only 3 Cinnamint in the box, and 2 Wintergreen.  The rest were IcyMint and Spearmint - which is fine.  They are all great flavors at a great price!  The little containers are clear so you can see just how much is left.  Doesn&#x27;t really much matter to me, but, yes - they are non-aerosol.</li>
            <li> These all taste good and even though theres a few of some it doesnt matter to me. I always carry one on me just so when i finish eating or sumthing i just spray it to freshen up a bit. Overall i would recommend this.</li>
            <li> The spray bottles are small enough for pocket or purse. Rarely do I get one that doesn&#x27;t spray properly. One or two sprays is plenty. Fresh breath lasts s reasonable amount of time. Big issue here is that there aren&#x27;t an even number of each flavor. There&#x27;s maybe only three cinnamint ones. That is everyone&#x27;s favorite in my house so if you aren&#x27;t the one to open the box when it gets here you&#x27;re SoL. Too many spearmint which is our least favorite.</li>
            <li> I cannot get most of my bottles to spray. It looks like the spray part is broken. I probably only have half or less that actually work.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this package of spray. It is a lot for one person but nevertheless very appetizing! I would definitely recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated, this is not an even Mix.  My favorite is CinnaMint, of which there were only two.  There were also only two WinterMint.  Therefore 20 out of 24 were IcyMint or SpearMint!  I would have just gotten basic mint if that&#x27;s all I had wanted.  Otherwise, the spray is very good.</li>
            <li> Very good for bad breath.</li>
            <li> These are exactally what I ordered , I have been using this&lt;br /&gt;mouth spray for over 4 years and they are the Best!&lt;br /&gt;This order was a great Price , Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been happy with these breath sprays.  My package seemed to have a pretty even assortment of flavors.  would buy again</li>
            <li> These are kind of chemically tasting.  Stick with Binanca.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED ON TIME &amp; AS DESCRIBED, THANKS,  ART</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. The product came how I expected the sizes, the flavors, and properly counted. The only thing was that I received less cinnamint than any others and those are my favorite. When I finish those 24 I will buy more because I believe it&#x27;s a great deal because of the price.</li>
            <li> The flavors are just horrible tasting...chemically...off...just NOT good!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this product regardless of the price. Evidently there is a required number of words, so this is the end of my review.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use at my family reunion to give away in the bags I made and everyone loved it and they taste great !</li>
            <li> It leaks in my purse &amp; half the time I can&#x27;t get it to even spray. Would never buy this again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think throwing two containers of two of the flavors qualifies. With a plan to package these in sets I&#x27;m disappointed. That I can make only TWO sets of four flavors.</li>
            <li> Pros: perfect size, fits in any small pockets or purses. It is nice if you do not like chewing gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Some of them don&#x27;t work. After a few sprays, it just does not spray anymore even though there is still plenty of liquid inside the bottle. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s clogged up but it&#x27;s highly awkward when I need it in an emergency and I am trying to huff and puff the thing to get a spray!&lt;br /&gt;I know some people were disappointed that there aren&#x27;t enough Cinnamon ones. I actually preferred it at that way because I like minty ones more. I think there were 4 Cinnamon and the rest are the minty variety.</li>
            <li> I have one of these all over the place; in my car, at work, at home, and gave some to friends since you get 24 of them. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Only a few cinnamon flavors in the box, which happens to be the best flavor. The pump doesn&#x27;t work on 40% of the bottles, which is very disappointing. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so oily on the surface of the bottles, and I don&#x27;t like the taste. I have to throw all of them.</li>
            <li> These work great for an &#x27;in the pocket&#x27; or on the desk fast breath fixer. My only complaint really is if you have only one with you, brand new from the box, it might not work. I&#x27;ve found an average of 4-7 per box where the pump doesn&#x27;t work. The case is sealed so all you can do it toss it in the trash. But what the heck, they&#x27;re cheap as dirt. Just so you know, you&#x27;re gonna throw away about 15-25% of each box from manufacturing defective pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to spend the time to try to remove the pumps to save the contents and pour them into ones where the pump does work.</li>
            <li> Love the flavors. These little guys fit in your pocket or purse and last surprisingly long.  These also made great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> this arrived as described! 14 icymint, 6 wintermint, and 4 cinnamint. i wanted it for the wintermint and cinna mint as you cant seem to buy those ones individually.</li>
            <li> I like it. 24 counts will last for a while. Just don&#x27;t get use to Cinnamint flavor. Over all I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I was expecting. Thank you so much.</li>
    </ol>
