            <li>(and I am a super picky when it comes to my hair); this worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li>But it was great to have a way to style my hair while still packing very light.</li>
            <li>and she was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The idea is great but execution is ok.</li>
            <li>Great for travel :).</li>

            <li>I should have read the description better!  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I use it as a wand and consistently get perfect beachy waves.  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly well for those travel touch-ups.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>it being my own fault.  </li>
            <li>You could bring your own curling iron from home.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my travel case and I like the cloth bag for it.</li>
            <li>It gets warm.</li>
            <li>cheap, cheap, cheap!!!!!</li>
            <li>in all, nice product in a convenient size.</li>

            <li>It heats really quickly which is amazing and does a great job curling my hair.</li>
            <li>I love my Travel Smart (Conair) perfect for my bands  </li>
            <li>Great product, very convenient to travel, good size and the heat is good, easy to carry on your purse</li>
            <li>Honestly, read the size description better.  </li>
            <li>Great little curling iron - perfect for travel</li>
            <li>I have a great adapter that lets me plug in my appliances to European outlets, it works great.</li>
            <li>barrel is very smooth, and my very fine hair - even with a coating of hairspray to add texture - would slip out</li>
            <li>this is perfect, works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size.</li>
            <li>Despite my fine hair, this keeps my hair curly throughout the day!  </li>
            <li>My hair looked great every day, easy to use, better then my full size one.  </li>
            <li>We travel a lot and try to pack very lightly.  </li>
            <li>It also looks very cheap</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and she was thrilled to receive it.</li>
            <li>The case is nice and makes it easy to store the cord.</li>
            <li>I have no problems fitting my hair in between the barrel and clamp.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just warning you to check it out more thoroughly than I did and learn from my mistake.</li>
            <li>This Iron is so cute.</li>
            <li>Ackward, but otherwise okay.</li>
            <li>It is compact, has its own heat-resistant pouch and will fit into any corner in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>and I really do love the idea.</li>
            <li>I have short-ish hair, so it might be better for people with longer hair.</li>
            <li>I bought two more</li>
            <li>One star for the dual voltage, one because it&#x27;s purse sized; one because it&#x27;s cute.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly, cute case, dual voltage.</li>
            <li>Love the size for storage</li>
            <li>A perfect product would be this same design, with just an extended barrel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D;short barrel, probably works best for short hair</li>
            <li>I was able to use this curling iron to \\&quot;tame\\&quot; my hair into the look that I wanted.  </li>
            <li>3 inches would be better</li>
            <li>It was okay....</li>
            <li>Having said this, if all you want is to curl your bangs, or you have short hair, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>I love the size and performance of this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>more curls.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly in South Africa--no need to make any adjustments to work on different voltage.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and it still was able to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t find many in this price range.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I also burn my fingers more often.</li>
            <li>and I was easily able to curl my hair with it.  </li>
            <li>I guess it would be ok.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my travel curler.</li>
            <li>I read reviews and thought I would be able to work with it but couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>You just need to allow more time if you plan to use it.  </li>
            <li>Love my mini curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I found this item satisfied my hair needs.</li>
            <li>It comes with a sleeve to allow you to pack it while still warm which is, for me, very useful.  </li>
            <li>Although if you have long hair and a good amount of dexterity it is a great travel option because it is so compact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this because it fits in most medium sized bags, and heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact size I was hoping to find, but my hair for some reason kept sliding through it - the barrel just couldn&#x27;t get a good grip on my hair.</li>
            <li>It folds up nicely and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s great for touch ups.</li>
            <li>its great but its kind of for long hair,  </li>
            <li>For my travel needs, it is perfect -- small, and easy to pack with its own travel pouch.</li>
            <li>Yeah, this is the right thing for nice curls</li>
            <li>I like the compact size for travelling, it fits easily in handbag or carry-on</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Fits easily in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Too easy to slip off the hair</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The tension between the clip part and the barrel was just right, so it was very easy to control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess it would be fine for finer, shorter hair.</li>
            <li>This product works just fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>My travel hair dryer works fine.</li>
            <li>The dual-current feature works just fine</li>
            <li>Still it worked great, heated up fast and hot.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, packs conveniently, and makes adorable curls.  </li>
            <li>I almost got burned because I&#x27;m used to my large non-travel curling iron, it produced really nice curls.  </li>
            <li>One temp - VERY, VERY HOT!  </li>
            <li>The little zebra-striped case it came with is ideal, too - it even fits into my purse, so I have used it more often than I</li>
            <li>The curling iron AND its cord fit into its 3.5\\&quot; x 8.0\\&quot; carrying case.</li>
            <li>And if your hair is short, I think it would be great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I don&#x27;t have to carry a bigger one on my trips anymore.</li>
            <li>This is light and works.</li>
            <li>Smooth operation - does not snag or pull out hair.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit in the pouch with the cord -</li>
            <li>nice product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Perfect size for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It gets a bit hotter than I would like for every day use but for a few curls on the road, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>That said, as far as these things go, this one was good.</li>
            <li>Great size -- incredibly light and small, perfect for trips -- and only took a bit of time to learn how to use well.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Compact size was appealing at first, however, I will return to longer models with temp control and both ends that do not heat up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great on my long hair...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>The small size and heatproof sleeve that comes with the iron make it perfect for packing.</li>
            <li>I love that you can slide it into its pouch while still hot and throw it into your bag.</li>
            <li>originally intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was so excited when my husband ordered this for me as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>: tiny, cute case, cheap, heats up to good hot temperature&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re super - fit in your purse or a drawer at work for &amp;#34;those days&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and works surprisingly well for it&#x27;s size especially.</li>
            <li>/&gt;probably good for fine, short hair … and work quickly before the thumb lever gets hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
            <li>It curls quickly and is amazingly small - perfect for packing.</li>
            <li>It comes with a protective cover, but you will need to cool it off before storing it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think it took longer than with a full size curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The price was more than reasonable comparied to others.  </li>
            <li>probably good for short hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced it with a full size iron, but I&#x27;m holding on to it for weekenders.</li>
            <li>At home, I would choose my full size curling iron instead to curl all my hair, but this will work well on the road.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11 year old because she wanted her own curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Super for a vacation curling iron, small to pack, gives a great curl, hope to use it for many trips to come.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up very quickly but there is no temperature regulator and the tip gets EXTREMELY hot which poses a safety hazard.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried yet, but have other Conair products happy with.  </li>
            <li>Very small - but great for traveling!</li>
            <li>but it was good for adding some curl to the ends and a few top curls here and there.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and its compact.  </li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, curled my hair, and then was slipped into the heat-proof bag that came with it.  </li>
            <li>QUICK HEAT UP.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and takes up almost no space in travel bag.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and curls quite a bit of hair.</li>
            <li>I get frizzy hair in the humidity and this smoothed it right out producing better curls than I get with my large iron and didn&#x27;t overheat it.  </li>
            <li>It worked great but be sure allow for more time as you can only put so much hair around the tiny barrel.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and is a convenient size to pack when travelling.</li>
            <li>I brought this to work for quick touchups.  </li>
            <li>It works great for me because I only curl my bangs and don&#x27;t have to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li>It gets quite hot, which is great for my long mane of hair.  </li>
            <li>Super item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, easy to use and will be great for travel.</li>
            <li>It traveled well but had just one heat setting, very hot.  </li>
            <li>This one was ideal for my chin length, fine, wavy hair - I used it for both a traditional curling iron type of curl and also used it to get the effect of a flat iron for my bangs.</li>
            <li>quality, nice compact mini hair curler, just right for fluffing up short hair fuller with larger curls, good price</li>
            <li>I am very cautious not to touch the barrel when hot as I&#x27;m sure it would cause a hekova burn.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dangerously hot!</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of hair to curl, this is probably not your best choice, simply because it will take a very long time.</li>
            <li>After dithering a bit after reading both positive and negative reviews I bought this curling iron, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It worked fine, it heated up fast, it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Great little curling iron.</li>
            <li>Great little travel curling iron.</li>
            <li>Great little curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Great little iron for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for little touch-ups, too.</li>
            <li>Great little tool.</li>
            <li>I tried it a few times and it works great.</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s  worth the money</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the instant ringlets it produced.  </li>
            <li>But it is kind of to short for me.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, very fast.  </li>
            <li>This iron will leave more room for other items in my pack:).</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly and was hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and remains hot for duration of use.</li>
            <li>She had another  110v one before, and tried using it with a converter....burned the converter right up.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>And supposedly the pouch is heat-resistant so you can pack it up right after using it.  </li>
            <li>This could be a little bigger, but it packs great in its own case and heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this if you are trying to pack light for Europe and want a curling iron that is duel-voltage.</li>
            <li>This is a great small iron.</li>
            <li>Small size but great for touch-ups--just what I needed.</li>
            <li>(I did need a plug adapter) and the small size is great</li>
            <li>great for traveling Just have to get use to the small size.</li>
            <li>The small size is great for traveling</li>
            <li>The curling iron works great on my thick hair - gets very hot; I use it primarly for my bangs.  </li>
            <li>Not bad - didn&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li>Took me a little while to get used to the smaller curling iron, but it did an excellent job on our trip.  </li>
            <li>I can do my whole head very quickly and it heats fast and stays hot.</li>
            <li>It works great but the barrel length is just so short that you can only curl about 1&amp;#34; width of your hair at a time.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot very fast...</li>
            <li>It did heat up very fast, so I don&#x27;t have to sit around waiting for it to get hot.</li>
            <li>Did exactly as I wanted it to do while on vacation.</li>
            <li>I just love this tiny curling iron.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted a compact styler that could curl under the ends of my shoulder length straight hair (which insists on flipping up!)</li>
            <li>This fulfilled my requirements, and it worked well on the first trip I took it on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fussy about how they look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fussy about how they look.</li>
            <li>Since it has built-in dual voltage, the only thing I need is an adaptor (of which I have many).  </li>
            <li>Would be great on very short hair, but not for long hair.  </li>
            <li>the exactly size what I need it.</li>
            <li>It also gets really hot, so after I was done I had to add serum to the tips of my hair because it looked so singed when I was done.</li>
            <li>Tip gets as hot as the metal part</li>
            <li>Burned my wife the first time she used it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about taking it with me overseas next week, but it&#x27;s getting packed.</li>
            <li>It may be tiny, but it&#x27;s mighty!</li>
            <li>but it gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>The Quince does not use a US plug, so the first time I traveled</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D;has pouch to store even when iron still hot</li>
            <li>You should be aware that the purpose of the case is not to store the curling iron AND the power cord.  </li>
            <li>The purpose of the case is to store the hot curling iron, when finished curling your hair.  </li>
            <li>However, with more practice using it before a trip, it could work for someone for whom packing space is really critical.</li>
            <li>this is more nitpicking than an actual flaw, but I don&#x27;t like the tip -</li>
            <li>The hot part is about 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, it may be an ordeal to use, and (2) it gets HOT - and yes, a curling iron should,</li>
            <li>Even with these two nit-picky potential drawbacks, I am really pleased with this purchase ...</li>
            <li>Good product but def not for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I ended up just using the flat iron only, but I think if I had more patience and used this cute mini curling iron, it would&#x27;ve done the job.</li>
            <li>This gets hot fast and states hot while in use.</li>
            <li>but it got really hot and worked really well for what it is.</li>
            <li>I would have returned it, but the shipping was as much as I paid for it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot quickly and in spite of the short barrel, it does the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I thought, but easy to take</li>
            <li>I use this instead of my large curling iron.  </li>
            <li>This Travel Smart curling iron works well for me.  </li>
            <li>Some people thought that the barrel was too short, but for me it was just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have short fine hair</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this small one, although I wish the barrel was about 1 inch longer, as the short length makes it a bit more challenging to do much curling and that is why I only gave it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>This little guy is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a nice little case.</li>
            <li>Handy little tool, doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of heat.</li>
            <li>Gets pretty hot quickly and takes a bit to cool down.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if you prefer a very high heat, you should let it &#x27;warm up&#x27; a few minutes before using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it worked really well on bathroom surfaces for me, but in one instance all I had was a wooden furniture surface available</li>
            <li>It heated up fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really into small, pretty cosmetic bags, the kind you get at department makeup counters in a gift with purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really into small, pretty cosmetic bags, the kind you get at department makeup counters in a gift with purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I know it was my fault in not reading more carefully, but you should.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work out well at all for me, since I have arthritis.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt weigh too much so it can be packed in a carryon and used anywhere.</li>
            <li>- it would take forever to do a whole head with this.</li>
            <li>Compact design doesn&#x27;t take up much space</li>
            <li>This is one of those items that make life so much simpler.</li>
            <li>I normally use a 1 1/4 inch Hot Tools curling iron at home, but don&#x27;t like to carry it around with me for air travel.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really like the curl it gave.</li>
            <li>I used this twice on a trip, couldn&#x27;t really get the hang of it</li>
            <li>This works really well, but I am giving it three stars because it is supposed to be for travel and not just touch ups.  </li>
            <li>To the contrary, it heats up very well</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get too much hair wrapped around the curling iron because of</li>
            <li>The pros of this is, it heats up really fast and in the future, I can fit it into any bag without it taking to much room.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It heats up wicked fast.  </li>
            <li>This is indeed a compact curling iron that heats up very well.  </li>
            <li>But it does heat up fast and curl.  </li>
            <li>Just as described and fast delivery</li>
            <li>This iron is very convenient to take while traveling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Curling heats up fast and works well.  </li>
            <li>that was very convenient in Italy.</li>
            <li>I wish someone made a 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel, but the 1&amp;#34; seems to be the only size available.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D;temperature: not too hot, maybe less than 300 degrees, probably better for hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Upside: Small, lightweight, cute, heats up quickly, packs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get curl all the way up the shaft of my hair and the barrel was hot enough to curl the hair close to the barrel as well as hair layered on top (due to short length of barrel).  </li>
            <li>This iron got way too hot (and I did burn myself though being careful); the barrel is just too short to effectively handle.</li>
            <li>Hair glides so smoothly over the barrel that I&#x27;m going to use it as both a flat iron and a curling iron when I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small and good for curling the tips of the hair.  </li>
            <li>This little guy heats up super fast and its compatibility was a huge benefit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve brought it everywhere and its great for international travel and inside a small locker at the gym</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>This iron heats up fast, stows in it&#x27;s cute heatproof zebra patterned pouch &amp; weighs half of the &#x27;home&#x27; models.</li>
            <li>The carry pouch that comes with it, allows you to carry it when you don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to cool even though it cools down quickly.</li>
            <li>The curls actually lasted longer than they do with my HotTools full size curling iron at home.  </li>
            <li>Of course it can&#x27;t hold as much hair as a normal curling iron -</li>
            <li>Very little but ok ;-)</li>
            <li>It uses much less space than curlers and works more rapidly.</li>
            <li>I would never have bought a curling iron for travel, even a short one, if the lever you press to open the clamp stuck out at an angle, the way it does with most curling irons.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea but the curling wand is so short that my thick hair would not stay on the wand.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a travel curling iron, but have used it almost daily as it is more convenient to use than my regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Since unable to locate in local stores, very happy to find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plenty big to do a quick curl or 10.</li>
            <li>It gets hot quick, has a tip on the end to hold, and a little resting stub on the bottom so that the hot iron part doesn&#x27;t lay against the countertop.</li>
            <li>have long hair, and I was surprised at how easy this was to use given the length of the barrel on it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you want a travel curling iron.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for a purse size or travel accessory.</li>
            <li>Case is a little snug but works ok.</li>
            <li>A little plastic foot keeps it from touching on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I love this little curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I wish the clamp was adjustable, or a little more snug.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and was able to curl my entire head with this.  </li>
            <li>and I regretted not bringing my normal curling iron.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it might expand, but it doesn&#x27;t and is simply too short and not so easy to use</li>
            <li>The iron is SMALL and unless you have short, fine hair it won&#x27;t be effective on long hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel, but yes very small for my long hair.</li>
            <li>I guess this is okay if you are travelling, but be aware it is very small.  </li>
            <li>All my stuff, other than my purse/tote, has to fit in my carry-on suitcase.</li>
            <li>With the 1 inch barrel and the limit to how hot it gets, you can barely get any hair in and what you do does not get hot enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li>This little curling iron heats up fast and makes smooth, long-lasting curls.  </li>
            <li>which is why she needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>Love this little guy!</li>
            <li>So, it really only works if you are a truly committed light packer with limited space in your bag for the real thing.</li>
            <li>The carrying case that came with this curling iron is pretty enough I would have sought it out as a makeup GWP.</li>
            <li>The carrying case that came with this curling iron is pretty enough I would have sought it out as a makeup GWP.</li>
            <li>, it worked the first 2 places in France that I used it but blew out the 3rd time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Last year on my trip overseas, my curling iron was ruined because I didn&#x27;t have a converter and it required a higher voltage.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be hot enough, so maybe it&#x27;s my hair type?</li>
            <li>My only concern is it gets too too hot.  </li>
            <li>It has a rest, the clamp worked fine, and it has the little cap on the end to keep you from burning your fingers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D;temperature: not too hot, maybe less than 300 degrees, does not hold curl as well as higher temperature</li>
            <li>it is tiny and you have to use less hair but better than not having a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I had to be patient in curling it and making sure it was completely dry because the barrel of this curling is pretty small</li>
            <li>and I have American appliances, like a travel blow dryer and smart phone chargers.</li>
            <li>My hair is a little below shoulder length, so a larger barrel would work better for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the carrying case was super helpful in keeping the cord organized</li>
            <li>Only having one heat setting doesn&#x27;t bother me, either - I always use my regular curling iron on a pretty high heat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So do steer clear of this item.</li>
            <li>I tried the curling iron a couple of times but concluded that the barrel is much too short to do all of my hair in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Finally I bought this product after reading reviews and much consideration.</li>
            <li>Who wants to pay extra baggage fees when you can get by with a carry-on?</li>
            <li>It works well as far as the heating, etc.</li>
            <li>Perfect solution to needing a small, packable curling iron for travel, when you only need small touch-ups such as curling bangs.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be important that it had dual voltage and a voltage transformer (only the adapter) was not needed, but it ended up not being enough of a big deal</li>
            <li>I really could only curl my bangs with this.</li>
            <li>I still have it, but have replaced it with a similar model with much easier handling.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>Getting ready for a South American trip, I had to find a curling iron with 220 Volts.  </li>
            <li>This is very small and actually works great and keeps me from having to travel with an actual converter which I was having to do before with just a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Just be extra careful when using it - the whole device is much smaller including the cool plastic grip tip</li>
            <li>Its OKAY but very very very small.</li>
            <li>The clamp does not open wide enough to easily grab a section of hair.</li>
            <li>I usually just use it to give some lift to my bangs, and it works fine for that.  </li>
            <li>It takes a modified technique and extra time to curl my hair over a standard curling iron, so I wouldn&#x27;t exactly use this all the time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you want a travel curling iron.big enough for me to prevent burning myself when maneuvering the barrel.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine, straight hair and bought this for an extended trip through Europe.&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My standard curling irons seem to hold a steady temperature, whereas I actually unplugged this once halfway through to let it cool down a bit.  </li>
            <li>It does take slightly longer to curl all of my hair because of the size, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I initially had a little trouble using it, but got better with practice and ended up really liking the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>When you open the clamp, the opening is too small to easily guide in a section of hair.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, so I can curl my long, thick hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Worked for me because only needed a little at the top and bangs but be careful of tip.  </li>
            <li>works well and is small enough to fit in purse.  </li>
            <li>It is supposed to automatically convert to the correct voltage but, for whatever reason, apparently didn&#x27;t that time.  </li>
            <li>only con that I have with it so far is because I have a lot of hair, it takes a while to curl</li>
            <li>I have long, normal volume hair., and found the grip was non-existent, so I couldn&#x27;t pull it to get my ends under the grip nor roll it.</li>
            <li>First off, I do agree with other purchasers that the very short barrel does make hair styling difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>it heats up fast and curls my hard to curl straight hair.</li>
            <li>but, especially since it doesn&#x27;t have a support to hold it up when you set it down, you can easily damage a surface if you are not extra careful</li>
            <li>No regulation on the temp, and it gets Extremely Hot, so be careful when using not to hold on your hair too long.</li>
            <li>I wanted a travel curling iron, but alas the wand is sooo short that it&#x27;s meant for touching up your curls, not giving you curls.</li>
            <li>However, since it&#x27;s so small, I could definitely see throwing this in my gym bag for quick touchups even when I&#x27;m not traveling.  </li>
            <li>and I had no trouble curling long bunches of hair in seconds.</li>
            <li>I have long fine thick hair.</li>
            <li>When you put in down on the table or bathroom sink, the hot barrel lies directly on the surface and could damage the surface if you use it anywhere other than in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is my hair is pretty short, and I find the clamp is not very strong, so my short hair sort of slides out of it.</li>
            <li>I had previously ordered a much more expensive folding curling iron for travel and it never got hot enough to actually curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it is small and easy to store for travel, but not worth the purchase since I don&#x27;t use it anyway.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Working with a large pair of scissors, it took over 5 minutes to get this curling iron out of its heavy plastic packaging.  </li>
            <li>One of the prongs that goes into the wall/adapter outlet is too large and simply will not fit.</li>

            <li> Worked perfectly for my fine hair to curl the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mini curling iron for over a year, and I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li> Good for those with bangs</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m on the road, I still want to have my hair look good at times</li>

            <li> good grip</li>
            <li> This fit the bill perfectly.  </li>

            <li> Loved the insulated zebra-striped case.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a good travel curling iron that would have dual voltage on it</li>
            <li> (and I am a super picky when it comes to my hair); this worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li> But it was great to have a way to style my hair while still packing very light.</li>
            <li> and she was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The idea is great but execution is ok.</li>
            <li> Great for travel :).</li>
            <li> Great for travel, I could not ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> The size was great for fitting in my luggage..</li>
            <li> She was very pleased with it also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken two trips with it so for and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> good news is that it comes with a zebra print case, which will look nice as another dust-collecting item in my apartment.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, nice small size, great heat proof pouch and best of all, the wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I should have read the description better!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I use it as a wand and consistently get perfect beachy waves.  </li>
            <li> It works amazingly well for those travel touch-ups.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> it being my own fault.  </li>
            <li> You could bring your own curling iron from home.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my travel case and I like the cloth bag for it.</li>
            <li> It gets warm.</li>
            <li> cheap, cheap, cheap!!!!!</li>
            <li> in all, nice product in a convenient size.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be nice for travel</li>
            <li> It will travel so nicely and with arthritis in my hands</li>
            <li> It heats really quickly which is amazing and does a great job curling my hair.</li>
            <li> I love my Travel Smart (Conair) perfect for my bands  </li>
            <li> Great product, very convenient to travel, good size and the heat is good, easy to carry on your purse</li>
            <li> Honestly, read the size description better.  </li>
            <li> Great little curling iron - perfect for travel</li>
            <li> I have a great adapter that lets me plug in my appliances to European outlets, it works great.</li>
            <li> barrel is very smooth, and my very fine hair - even with a coating of hairspray to add texture - would slip out</li>
            <li> this is perfect, works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size.</li>
            <li> Despite my fine hair, this keeps my hair curly throughout the day!  </li>
            <li> My hair looked great every day, easy to use, better then my full size one.  </li>
            <li> We travel a lot and try to pack very lightly.  </li>
            <li> It also looks very cheap</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and she was thrilled to receive it.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and makes it easy to store the cord.</li>
            <li> I have no problems fitting my hair in between the barrel and clamp.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just warning you to check it out more thoroughly than I did and learn from my mistake.</li>
            <li> This Iron is so cute.</li>
            <li> Ackward, but otherwise okay.</li>
            <li> It is compact, has its own heat-resistant pouch and will fit into any corner in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> and I really do love the idea.</li>
            <li> I have short-ish hair, so it might be better for people with longer hair.</li>
            <li> I bought two more</li>
            <li> One star for the dual voltage, one because it&#x27;s purse sized; one because it&#x27;s cute.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly, cute case, dual voltage.</li>
            <li> Love the size for storage</li>
            <li> A perfect product would be this same design, with just an extended barrel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;short barrel, probably works best for short hair</li>
            <li> I was able to use this curling iron to \\&quot;tame\\&quot; my hair into the look that I wanted.  </li>
            <li> 3 inches would be better</li>
            <li> It was okay....</li>
            <li> Having said this, if all you want is to curl your bangs, or you have short hair, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I love the size and performance of this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> more curls.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in South Africa--no need to make any adjustments to work on different voltage.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> and it still was able to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t find many in this price range.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I also burn my fingers more often.</li>
            <li> and I was easily able to curl my hair with it.  </li>
            <li> I guess it would be ok.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my travel curler.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and thought I would be able to work with it but couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> You just need to allow more time if you plan to use it.  </li>
            <li> Love my mini curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I found this item satisfied my hair needs.</li>
            <li> It comes with a sleeve to allow you to pack it while still warm which is, for me, very useful.  </li>
            <li> Although if you have long hair and a good amount of dexterity it is a great travel option because it is so compact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this because it fits in most medium sized bags, and heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact size I was hoping to find, but my hair for some reason kept sliding through it - the barrel just couldn&#x27;t get a good grip on my hair.</li>
            <li> It folds up nicely and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s great for touch ups.</li>
            <li> its great but its kind of for long hair,  </li>
            <li> For my travel needs, it is perfect -- small, and easy to pack with its own travel pouch.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this is the right thing for nice curls</li>
            <li> I like the compact size for travelling, it fits easily in handbag or carry-on</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Fits easily in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Too easy to slip off the hair</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> The tension between the clip part and the barrel was just right, so it was very easy to control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess it would be fine for finer, shorter hair.</li>
            <li> This product works just fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> My travel hair dryer works fine.</li>
            <li> The dual-current feature works just fine</li>
            <li> Still it worked great, heated up fast and hot.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, packs conveniently, and makes adorable curls.  </li>
            <li> I almost got burned because I&#x27;m used to my large non-travel curling iron, it produced really nice curls.  </li>
            <li> One temp - VERY, VERY HOT!  </li>
            <li> The little zebra-striped case it came with is ideal, too - it even fits into my purse, so I have used it more often than I</li>
            <li> The curling iron AND its cord fit into its 3.5\\&quot; x 8.0\\&quot; carrying case.</li>
            <li> And if your hair is short, I think it would be great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I don&#x27;t have to carry a bigger one on my trips anymore.</li>
            <li> This is light and works.</li>
            <li> Smooth operation - does not snag or pull out hair.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit in the pouch with the cord -</li>
            <li> nice product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Perfect size for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It gets a bit hotter than I would like for every day use but for a few curls on the road, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> That said, as far as these things go, this one was good.</li>
            <li> Great size -- incredibly light and small, perfect for trips -- and only took a bit of time to learn how to use well.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Compact size was appealing at first, however, I will return to longer models with temp control and both ends that do not heat up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great on my long hair...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> The small size and heatproof sleeve that comes with the iron make it perfect for packing.</li>
            <li> I love that you can slide it into its pouch while still hot and throw it into your bag.</li>
            <li> originally intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was so excited when my husband ordered this for me as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> : tiny, cute case, cheap, heats up to good hot temperature&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re super - fit in your purse or a drawer at work for &amp;#34;those days&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and works surprisingly well for it&#x27;s size especially.</li>
            <li> /&gt;probably good for fine, short hair … and work quickly before the thumb lever gets hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
            <li> It curls quickly and is amazingly small - perfect for packing.</li>
            <li> It comes with a protective cover, but you will need to cool it off before storing it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think it took longer than with a full size curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The price was more than reasonable comparied to others.  </li>
            <li> probably good for short hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced it with a full size iron, but I&#x27;m holding on to it for weekenders.</li>
            <li> At home, I would choose my full size curling iron instead to curl all my hair, but this will work well on the road.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old because she wanted her own curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Super for a vacation curling iron, small to pack, gives a great curl, hope to use it for many trips to come.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up very quickly but there is no temperature regulator and the tip gets EXTREMELY hot which poses a safety hazard.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried yet, but have other Conair products happy with.  </li>
            <li> Very small - but great for traveling!</li>
            <li> but it was good for adding some curl to the ends and a few top curls here and there.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and its compact.  </li>
            <li> It heated up quickly, curled my hair, and then was slipped into the heat-proof bag that came with it.  </li>
            <li> QUICK HEAT UP.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and takes up almost no space in travel bag.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and curls quite a bit of hair.</li>
            <li> I get frizzy hair in the humidity and this smoothed it right out producing better curls than I get with my large iron and didn&#x27;t overheat it.  </li>
            <li> It worked great but be sure allow for more time as you can only put so much hair around the tiny barrel.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and is a convenient size to pack when travelling.</li>
            <li> I brought this to work for quick touchups.  </li>
            <li> It works great for me because I only curl my bangs and don&#x27;t have to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li> It gets quite hot, which is great for my long mane of hair.  </li>
            <li> Super item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, easy to use and will be great for travel.</li>
            <li> It traveled well but had just one heat setting, very hot.  </li>
            <li> This one was ideal for my chin length, fine, wavy hair - I used it for both a traditional curling iron type of curl and also used it to get the effect of a flat iron for my bangs.</li>
            <li> quality, nice compact mini hair curler, just right for fluffing up short hair fuller with larger curls, good price</li>
            <li> I am very cautious not to touch the barrel when hot as I&#x27;m sure it would cause a hekova burn.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dangerously hot!</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair to curl, this is probably not your best choice, simply because it will take a very long time.</li>
            <li> After dithering a bit after reading both positive and negative reviews I bought this curling iron, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It worked fine, it heated up fast, it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Great little curling iron.</li>
            <li> Great little travel curling iron.</li>
            <li> Great little curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Great little iron for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for little touch-ups, too.</li>
            <li> Great little tool.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times and it works great.</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s  worth the money</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the instant ringlets it produced.  </li>
            <li> But it is kind of to short for me.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot, very fast.  </li>
            <li> This iron will leave more room for other items in my pack:).</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly and was hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and remains hot for duration of use.</li>
            <li> She had another  110v one before, and tried using it with a converter....burned the converter right up.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size.</li>
            <li> And supposedly the pouch is heat-resistant so you can pack it up right after using it.  </li>
            <li> This could be a little bigger, but it packs great in its own case and heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you are trying to pack light for Europe and want a curling iron that is duel-voltage.</li>
            <li> This is a great small iron.</li>
            <li> Small size but great for touch-ups--just what I needed.</li>
            <li> (I did need a plug adapter) and the small size is great</li>
            <li> great for traveling Just have to get use to the small size.</li>
            <li> The small size is great for traveling</li>
            <li> The curling iron works great on my thick hair - gets very hot; I use it primarly for my bangs.  </li>
            <li> Not bad - didn&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li> Took me a little while to get used to the smaller curling iron, but it did an excellent job on our trip.  </li>
            <li> I can do my whole head very quickly and it heats fast and stays hot.</li>
            <li> It works great but the barrel length is just so short that you can only curl about 1&amp;#34; width of your hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot very fast...</li>
            <li> It did heat up very fast, so I don&#x27;t have to sit around waiting for it to get hot.</li>
            <li> Did exactly as I wanted it to do while on vacation.</li>
            <li> I just love this tiny curling iron.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted a compact styler that could curl under the ends of my shoulder length straight hair (which insists on flipping up!)</li>
            <li> This fulfilled my requirements, and it worked well on the first trip I took it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fussy about how they look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fussy about how they look.</li>
            <li> Since it has built-in dual voltage, the only thing I need is an adaptor (of which I have many).  </li>
            <li> Would be great on very short hair, but not for long hair.  </li>
            <li> the exactly size what I need it.</li>
            <li> It also gets really hot, so after I was done I had to add serum to the tips of my hair because it looked so singed when I was done.</li>
            <li> Tip gets as hot as the metal part</li>
            <li> Burned my wife the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about taking it with me overseas next week, but it&#x27;s getting packed.</li>
            <li> It may be tiny, but it&#x27;s mighty!</li>
            <li> but it gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> The Quince does not use a US plug, so the first time I traveled</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;has pouch to store even when iron still hot</li>
            <li> You should be aware that the purpose of the case is not to store the curling iron AND the power cord.  </li>
            <li> The purpose of the case is to store the hot curling iron, when finished curling your hair.  </li>
            <li> However, with more practice using it before a trip, it could work for someone for whom packing space is really critical.</li>
            <li> this is more nitpicking than an actual flaw, but I don&#x27;t like the tip -</li>
            <li> The hot part is about 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , it may be an ordeal to use, and (2) it gets HOT - and yes, a curling iron should,</li>
            <li> Even with these two nit-picky potential drawbacks, I am really pleased with this purchase ...</li>
            <li> Good product but def not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I ended up just using the flat iron only, but I think if I had more patience and used this cute mini curling iron, it would&#x27;ve done the job.</li>
            <li> This gets hot fast and states hot while in use.</li>
            <li> but it got really hot and worked really well for what it is.</li>
            <li> I would have returned it, but the shipping was as much as I paid for it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot quickly and in spite of the short barrel, it does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought, but easy to take</li>
            <li> I use this instead of my large curling iron.  </li>
            <li> This Travel Smart curling iron works well for me.  </li>
            <li> Some people thought that the barrel was too short, but for me it was just fine.  </li>
            <li> I have short fine hair</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this small one, although I wish the barrel was about 1 inch longer, as the short length makes it a bit more challenging to do much curling and that is why I only gave it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> This little guy is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a nice little case.</li>
            <li> Handy little tool, doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of heat.</li>
            <li> Gets pretty hot quickly and takes a bit to cool down.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you prefer a very high heat, you should let it &#x27;warm up&#x27; a few minutes before using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it worked really well on bathroom surfaces for me, but in one instance all I had was a wooden furniture surface available</li>
            <li> It heated up fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really into small, pretty cosmetic bags, the kind you get at department makeup counters in a gift with purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really into small, pretty cosmetic bags, the kind you get at department makeup counters in a gift with purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I know it was my fault in not reading more carefully, but you should.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work out well at all for me, since I have arthritis.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt weigh too much so it can be packed in a carryon and used anywhere.</li>
            <li> - it would take forever to do a whole head with this.</li>
            <li> Compact design doesn&#x27;t take up much space</li>
            <li> This is one of those items that make life so much simpler.</li>
            <li> I normally use a 1 1/4 inch Hot Tools curling iron at home, but don&#x27;t like to carry it around with me for air travel.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really like the curl it gave.</li>
            <li> I used this twice on a trip, couldn&#x27;t really get the hang of it</li>
            <li> This works really well, but I am giving it three stars because it is supposed to be for travel and not just touch ups.  </li>
            <li> To the contrary, it heats up very well</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get too much hair wrapped around the curling iron because of</li>
            <li> The pros of this is, it heats up really fast and in the future, I can fit it into any bag without it taking to much room.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It heats up wicked fast.  </li>
            <li> This is indeed a compact curling iron that heats up very well.  </li>
            <li> But it does heat up fast and curl.  </li>
            <li> Just as described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This iron is very convenient to take while traveling.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Curling heats up fast and works well.  </li>
            <li> that was very convenient in Italy.</li>
            <li> I wish someone made a 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel, but the 1&amp;#34; seems to be the only size available.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;temperature: not too hot, maybe less than 300 degrees, probably better for hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Upside: Small, lightweight, cute, heats up quickly, packs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get curl all the way up the shaft of my hair and the barrel was hot enough to curl the hair close to the barrel as well as hair layered on top (due to short length of barrel).  </li>
            <li> This iron got way too hot (and I did burn myself though being careful); the barrel is just too short to effectively handle.</li>
            <li> Hair glides so smoothly over the barrel that I&#x27;m going to use it as both a flat iron and a curling iron when I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and good for curling the tips of the hair.  </li>
            <li> This little guy heats up super fast and its compatibility was a huge benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brought it everywhere and its great for international travel and inside a small locker at the gym</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li> This iron heats up fast, stows in it&#x27;s cute heatproof zebra patterned pouch &amp; weighs half of the &#x27;home&#x27; models.</li>
            <li> The carry pouch that comes with it, allows you to carry it when you don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to cool even though it cools down quickly.</li>
            <li> The curls actually lasted longer than they do with my HotTools full size curling iron at home.  </li>
            <li> Of course it can&#x27;t hold as much hair as a normal curling iron -</li>
            <li> Very little but ok ;-)</li>
            <li> It uses much less space than curlers and works more rapidly.</li>
            <li> I would never have bought a curling iron for travel, even a short one, if the lever you press to open the clamp stuck out at an angle, the way it does with most curling irons.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea but the curling wand is so short that my thick hair would not stay on the wand.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a travel curling iron, but have used it almost daily as it is more convenient to use than my regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Since unable to locate in local stores, very happy to find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plenty big to do a quick curl or 10.</li>
            <li> It gets hot quick, has a tip on the end to hold, and a little resting stub on the bottom so that the hot iron part doesn&#x27;t lay against the countertop.</li>
            <li> have long hair, and I was surprised at how easy this was to use given the length of the barrel on it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you want a travel curling iron.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for a purse size or travel accessory.</li>
            <li> Case is a little snug but works ok.</li>
            <li> A little plastic foot keeps it from touching on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I love this little curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I wish the clamp was adjustable, or a little more snug.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and was able to curl my entire head with this.  </li>
            <li> and I regretted not bringing my normal curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it might expand, but it doesn&#x27;t and is simply too short and not so easy to use</li>
            <li> The iron is SMALL and unless you have short, fine hair it won&#x27;t be effective on long hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for travel, but yes very small for my long hair.</li>
            <li> I guess this is okay if you are travelling, but be aware it is very small.  </li>
            <li> All my stuff, other than my purse/tote, has to fit in my carry-on suitcase.</li>
            <li> With the 1 inch barrel and the limit to how hot it gets, you can barely get any hair in and what you do does not get hot enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> This little curling iron heats up fast and makes smooth, long-lasting curls.  </li>
            <li> which is why she needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> Love this little guy!</li>
            <li> So, it really only works if you are a truly committed light packer with limited space in your bag for the real thing.</li>
            <li> The carrying case that came with this curling iron is pretty enough I would have sought it out as a makeup GWP.</li>
            <li> The carrying case that came with this curling iron is pretty enough I would have sought it out as a makeup GWP.</li>
            <li> , it worked the first 2 places in France that I used it but blew out the 3rd time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Last year on my trip overseas, my curling iron was ruined because I didn&#x27;t have a converter and it required a higher voltage.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be hot enough, so maybe it&#x27;s my hair type?</li>
            <li> My only concern is it gets too too hot.  </li>
            <li> It has a rest, the clamp worked fine, and it has the little cap on the end to keep you from burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;temperature: not too hot, maybe less than 300 degrees, does not hold curl as well as higher temperature</li>
            <li> it is tiny and you have to use less hair but better than not having a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I had to be patient in curling it and making sure it was completely dry because the barrel of this curling is pretty small</li>
            <li> and I have American appliances, like a travel blow dryer and smart phone chargers.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little below shoulder length, so a larger barrel would work better for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the carrying case was super helpful in keeping the cord organized</li>
            <li> Only having one heat setting doesn&#x27;t bother me, either - I always use my regular curling iron on a pretty high heat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So do steer clear of this item.</li>
            <li> I tried the curling iron a couple of times but concluded that the barrel is much too short to do all of my hair in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Finally I bought this product after reading reviews and much consideration.</li>
            <li> Who wants to pay extra baggage fees when you can get by with a carry-on?</li>
            <li> It works well as far as the heating, etc.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution to needing a small, packable curling iron for travel, when you only need small touch-ups such as curling bangs.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be important that it had dual voltage and a voltage transformer (only the adapter) was not needed, but it ended up not being enough of a big deal</li>
            <li> I really could only curl my bangs with this.</li>
            <li> I still have it, but have replaced it with a similar model with much easier handling.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> Getting ready for a South American trip, I had to find a curling iron with 220 Volts.  </li>
            <li> This is very small and actually works great and keeps me from having to travel with an actual converter which I was having to do before with just a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Just be extra careful when using it - the whole device is much smaller including the cool plastic grip tip</li>
            <li> Its OKAY but very very very small.</li>
            <li> The clamp does not open wide enough to easily grab a section of hair.</li>
            <li> I usually just use it to give some lift to my bangs, and it works fine for that.  </li>
            <li> It takes a modified technique and extra time to curl my hair over a standard curling iron, so I wouldn&#x27;t exactly use this all the time.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you want a travel curling iron.big enough for me to prevent burning myself when maneuvering the barrel.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, straight hair and bought this for an extended trip through Europe.&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My standard curling irons seem to hold a steady temperature, whereas I actually unplugged this once halfway through to let it cool down a bit.  </li>
            <li> It does take slightly longer to curl all of my hair because of the size, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I initially had a little trouble using it, but got better with practice and ended up really liking the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> When you open the clamp, the opening is too small to easily guide in a section of hair.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot, so I can curl my long, thick hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Worked for me because only needed a little at the top and bangs but be careful of tip.  </li>
            <li> works well and is small enough to fit in purse.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to automatically convert to the correct voltage but, for whatever reason, apparently didn&#x27;t that time.  </li>
            <li> only con that I have with it so far is because I have a lot of hair, it takes a while to curl</li>
            <li> I have long, normal volume hair., and found the grip was non-existent, so I couldn&#x27;t pull it to get my ends under the grip nor roll it.</li>
            <li> First off, I do agree with other purchasers that the very short barrel does make hair styling difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> it heats up fast and curls my hard to curl straight hair.</li>
            <li> but, especially since it doesn&#x27;t have a support to hold it up when you set it down, you can easily damage a surface if you are not extra careful</li>
            <li> No regulation on the temp, and it gets Extremely Hot, so be careful when using not to hold on your hair too long.</li>
            <li> I wanted a travel curling iron, but alas the wand is sooo short that it&#x27;s meant for touching up your curls, not giving you curls.</li>
            <li> However, since it&#x27;s so small, I could definitely see throwing this in my gym bag for quick touchups even when I&#x27;m not traveling.  </li>
            <li> and I had no trouble curling long bunches of hair in seconds.</li>
            <li> I have long fine thick hair.</li>
            <li> When you put in down on the table or bathroom sink, the hot barrel lies directly on the surface and could damage the surface if you use it anywhere other than in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is my hair is pretty short, and I find the clamp is not very strong, so my short hair sort of slides out of it.</li>
            <li> I had previously ordered a much more expensive folding curling iron for travel and it never got hot enough to actually curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it is small and easy to store for travel, but not worth the purchase since I don&#x27;t use it anyway.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Working with a large pair of scissors, it took over 5 minutes to get this curling iron out of its heavy plastic packaging.  </li>
            <li> One of the prongs that goes into the wall/adapter outlet is too large and simply will not fit.</li>
            <li> thing that prevents the hot barrel from resting directly on the counter is a small plastic wedge on the other side of the barrel from the tab that operates the clamp.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling to Europe, thinking it would be lighter and take up less space than a normal size curling iron.</li>
            <li> Being used to longer curling irons which hold more hair each time, I find using the mini one very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and have to do little sections at a time, but I think it is better than carting around a regular sized curling iron when I travel!</li>
            <li> This contradicts one of the other reviews that said the barrel rests directly on the counter surface.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to curl my bangs, since I use a flat iron for the rest of my hair, but didn&#x27;t want to pack my regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The only other mini curling iron I had attempted to use a while back (note - not a Conair) really let me down.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of using it for travel as your only styler and you have a full head of hair it is going to be frustrating.  </li>
            <li> (usually it&#x27;s about 2 large suitcases</li>
            <li> flat iron was ridiculously tiny--that got packed right back up for return.</li>
            <li> If you look at the side view, you see the tab that operates the clamp on top, and a thin black piece sticking out at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Usually I curl my hair using not so much heat</li>
            <li> I really like how small it is though.</li>
            <li> Barrel of the curling iron is too small and you cannot wrap too much hair at one time.</li>
            <li> The problem is, it may actually be too small to get anything accomplished on long or voluminous hair.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is agreement with other reviewers - if it were exactly the same but 1 inch longer, it would still be tiny but would be a lot easier to use, and you could curl larger chunks of hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaints with this are due to the fact that it&#x27;s travel-sized; you&#x27;d have the same problem with any curler that has such a short barrel.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the mini pro flat iron and the curling iron and gave them a test run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the barrel stand prevents it from damaging flat surfaces</li>
            <li> It probably takes me about four times as long to do my hair with this curling iron versus my regular sized 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> lt does get very hot and works well for its size so if your hair is short or thin, it may work well for you.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have trouble with it getting too hot as other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> Cute as a button, but too small to realistically use for anything but a nape-of-neck or bangs touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;I am mystified by anyone claiming to find it a breeze for long, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> The barely is as described (one inch) but unless you just want it to touch up your bangs or other spot touch ups</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with packing light, and I had given up on curling irons for travel until I saw this Conair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with packing light, and I had given up on curling irons for travel until I saw this Conair.</li>
            <li> but it is A LOT smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it tangles with this iron.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long hair and it curls it with no problem.</li>
            <li> Was going to use for on long hari for travel with 220v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s travel sized, it takes a long time to curl all my hair.</li>
            <li> But, my hair is growing out, so that won&#x27;t be a problem for long.</li>
            <li> The handle is not quite long enough and the very tiny grip on the opposite end is way too small</li>
            <li> I will not send it back due to</li>
            <li> As noted in other reviews, barrel is VERY short</li>
            <li> I had no idea such a thing existed, but now that I see how little space it takes up compared to a regular curling iron, I&#x27;m going to order one for myself as well!</li>
            <li> Takes a very long time to do your hair.</li>
            <li> I am returning this product because the barrel is very short - it works for short hair but anything longer than that would not fit on the roller.  </li>
            <li> This is small enough that it barely takes up any room in my carry on suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Too small, not enough barrel length to wrap my hair around, and the clip that opens and holds the hair in place does not even open wide enough to wrap the hair.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t open up very wide</li>
            <li> is suitcase space is limited.</li>
            <li> I like loose, wavy curls, so I put largish chunks of hair in there, without problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, the barrel is short, and you can only curl a small amount of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> Clamp is weak, holds a thicker clump of hair better than a thin one.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a try before a recent trip, and ended up packing the standard size curling iron because this was too limited to efficiently style my shoulder length thick hair.</li>
            <li> It does heat up, so I suppose it could work for little or short hair.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a little larger.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this little guy enough!  </li>
            <li> , I try to keep my hair away from it, which means the little barrel has a tiny usable area.  </li>
            <li> Will try before packing, as being shorter than my regular curling iron, it could be little challenge</li>
            <li> so you have to do smaller sections of hair, which takes a little longer.</li>
            <li> It is not really practical even for travel.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money, since I had to buy a regular size wide-barrel curling iron.</li>
            <li> She will have to be careful so nit to burn her fingers, though.</li>
            <li> yes, I expected a mini, but this is truly \\&quot;MINI\\&quot; - depending on the hair style and thickness of your hair</li>
            <li> but you do have to be careful when using it</li>
            <li> black plastic tip is small but big enough for me to prevent burning myself when maneuvering the barrel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be hard to curl a full head of hair – personally I got bored – </li>
            <li> This means it takes no longer to style my long thick hair than it does at home with a regular iron.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick, long hair it may not be for you, but I have rather short hair</li>
            <li> and I could not easily put it down without potentially damaging the wood.)</li>
            <li> This contradicts one of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of power for such a small device.</li>
            <li> Only small amount of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t take big wads of hair and attempt to curl, but taking small amounts to give some bounce is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Packs extremely compactly.</li>
            <li> I used to like Conair, until they conned me calling this a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; hair curler; it&#x27;s small and only works in America.</li>
            <li> but it only gives small curls.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is extremely lightweight.</li>
            <li> I needed a small, lightweight, dual voltage curling iron to take on an international trip.  </li>
            <li> I needed something small enough to stuff into my carry-on bag for travel, but I also needed it to do the job</li>
            <li> This is hard to use, especially if your hair is not super long.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful not to burn your hand while using it.  </li>
            <li> its not very good because it is so short.</li>
            <li> On this one, the lever is that small, black plastic tab you see on the blue barrel.</li>
            <li> Heats well and is very portable, only problem is that if you have longer than four or five inch hair, it&#x27;s difficult to use!</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s size, it did take a little longer, but I feel that is something to be expected.  </li>
            <li> but the barrel is so very short that it makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li> long, which means it can hold very little hair at a time.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is a long review for a small, inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too small to be of any use to anyone with medium length or long hair.  </li>
            <li> Used it but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that I could really use it to get curls on my long hair given the small size.  </li>
            <li> Although this is very compact, I found it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t curl past 3 inches from the ends because when I wind it up the heat doesn&#x27;t reach the mid-top section.  </li>
            <li> Watch it so as not to burn your hair or the surface you set it down on while in use.</li>
            <li> The handle bulges slightly toward the end, which helps me grip it.</li>
            <li> The handle bulges slightly toward the end, which helps me grip it.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to have less clutter on my bathroom</li>
            <li> The shaft is small, but by taking small amounts of hair you can definitely get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Not good product if you have long or thick hair verses short, finer hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair</li>
            <li> Then the hair slips out as the clamp doesn&#x27;t hold it, unless you push tightly against the slide mechanism which opens the clamp.</li>
            <li> This little curling iron worked well for me in my travels.</li>
            <li> Extremely little.</li>
            <li> this little size is just what I needed..</li>
            <li> I read all the complaints about this little travel curling iron</li>
            <li> However it is totally un-useable---at least for me!  </li>
            <li> The wand is so wide that you have to have at least shoulder length hair to even derive any benefit.</li>
            <li> After heating up the iron, it took 2 minutes to realize that this device doesn&#x27;t work on my thin, shoulder-length, blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> It works wherever I travel, often in gray weather, where hair goes limp before noon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> the clip opens at  such a narrow angle that it accommodates very little hair; it took 20 min to curl my thin</li>
            <li> This little curling iron is a little bit hard to work with</li>
            <li> Was too small to use, so it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little room in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it, actually.</li>
            <li> Too small for me to handle.  </li>

            <li> I chose this to travel with, but i find it is too small to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> This is so small it looks as if it is for a child to use on her doll.  </li>
            <li> No advantage in buying a small curling iron.</li>
            <li> it is too small.  </li>
            <li> So small I cannot operate it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is a solution to this but its REALLY SMALL.</li>
            <li> Can also use to curl ends, if done in small sections.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small size.</li>
            <li> My hair is well past my shoulders</li>
            <li> It comes with a small carrying case, and it is just about as small as a curling iron could get.  </li>
            <li> Remember it&#x27;s small.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small for travel..</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel to Europe because I needed dual voltage and small size.</li>
            <li> But if you have thick shoulder or longer length hair, unless you have unlimited time to cope with the small barrel and exposed heat, you are going to be in trouble.</li>
            <li> : too small to function, rendering all the \\&quot;pros\\&quot; pointless</li>
            <li> I use it for small jobs - bangs, the end of my pony tail.  </li>

            <li> It is small, lightweight, compact.  </li>
            <li> but it was just too small to control  when trying to  curl your hair.</li>
            <li> In any case, when I look at the carrying case with the curling iron and cord tucked inside, I can hardly believe how small it is.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that this little curling iron might not have a lot of heat and take a long time to get the job done.</li>
            <li> The curling iron balances on the handle and thin black plastic piece.</li>

            <li> It is too fat and hard to use.</li>

            <li> Too Short and awkward to use without burning fingers.</li>
            <li> We are going to Europe and cutting back on our packing weight.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone who has problems with your hands or if you have thick hair.  </li>

            <li> I was a little skeptical when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> So, I had a hard time even curling my hair which was frustrating.</li>
            <li> let me tell you it&#x27;s not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I should have brought it back with me to return but was afraid that the assumption would be made that I&#x27;d used the wrong plug in or something of that</li>
            <li> This item is way too small and difficult to handle.  </li>
            <li> am waffling between a four and a five, but going with the four and here is why: (1) it is really short -</li>
            <li> I have medium length very thick hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awkward to hold and it&#x27;s a little</li>

            <li> Unfortunately the way it&#x27;s packaged in plastic, which has to be cut up to get the curling iron out makes it impossible to repackage and return.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of frying my hair, be cautious.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item was way. Too small, not enough barrel length to wrap my hair around, and the clip that opens and holds the hair in place does not even open wide enough to wrap the hair.  Also it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl the hair.  It&#x27;s an awesome idea if they fix it up a bit.  I returned the item.</li>
            <li> This is hard to use, especially if your hair is not super long. The wand is so wide that you have to have at least shoulder length hair to even derive any benefit. Sorry I bought it, actually. Although if you have long hair and a good amount of dexterity it is a great travel option because it is so compact.</li>
            <li> I like the compact size for travelling, it fits easily in handbag or carry-on&lt;br /&gt;and it heats up fast and curls my hard to curl straight hair.</li>
            <li> Did exactly as I wanted it to do while on vacation. Great buy</li>
            <li> works well and is small enough to fit in purse.  Great for touch ups after working out or to put in a carry on case for a flight.  Gets pretty hot quickly and takes a bit to cool down.  Case is a little snug but works ok.</li>
            <li> Too small for me to handle.  I have medium length very thick hair and this didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  The barely is as described (one inch) but unless you just want it to touch up your bangs or other spot touch ups its not very good because it is so short.</li>
            <li> My only complaints with this are due to the fact that it&#x27;s travel-sized; you&#x27;d have the same problem with any curler that has such a short barrel. That said, as far as these things go, this one was good. It heated up fast. It has a rest, the clamp worked fine, and it has the little cap on the end to keep you from burning your fingers. It&#x27;d be hard to curl a full head of hair – personally I got bored – but it was good for adding some curl to the ends and a few top curls here and there.</li>
            <li> I just love this tiny curling iron.  I used it on a trip and now can use it at home to straighten some curly hairs which bigger curling irons don&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking a trip abroad so I wanted a compact styler that could curl under the ends of my shoulder length straight hair (which insists on flipping up!) I purchased both the mini pro flat iron and the curling iron and gave them a test run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron was ridiculously tiny--that got packed right back up for return. I tried the curling iron a couple of times but concluded that the barrel is much too short to do all of my hair in a timely manner. The barrel is 2 inches log--if it was 3-3 1/2 inches I might have kept it. Also, the travel sleeve that came with it only fits the curling iron--the cord is stored on the outside by an elastic band attached to the sleeve. A travel pouch would have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up very quickly but there is no temperature regulator and the tip gets EXTREMELY hot which poses a safety hazard.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife, she loves it.</li>
            <li> This gets hot fast and states hot while in use. The size is great for travel but I don&#x27;t use it at home.</li>
            <li> Needed a small curling iron that would travel well.  This fulfilled my requirements, and it worked well on the first trip I took it on.  Some people thought that the barrel was too short, but for me it was just fine.  Did what I needed it to do, and wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Arrived damaged, never took it out of the package before I returned it but it is A LOT smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mini curling iron for over a year, and I&#x27;m delighted with it. It gets really hot, so I can curl my long, thick hair quickly. The curling iron AND its cord fit into its 3.5\\&quot; x 8.0\\&quot; carrying case. This contradicts one of the other reviews. Maybe they improved the carrying case before I got mine? In any case, when I look at the carrying case with the curling iron and cord tucked inside, I can hardly believe how small it is. I have no problems fitting my hair in between the barrel and clamp. I like loose, wavy curls, so I put largish chunks of hair in there, without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only do carry-on packing for travel; I never check bags. All my stuff, other than my purse/tote, has to fit in my carry-on suitcase. As anyone who has packed shoes can attest, the irregularly shaped items are the worst for efficient packing. I would never have bought a curling iron for travel, even a short one, if the lever you press to open the clamp stuck out at an angle, the way it does with most curling irons. On this one, the lever is that small, black plastic tab you see on the blue barrel. Pressing that thing levers the clamp up. I mention this because the picture makes it look like you would slide that tab flush with the handle. I puzzled over this before I ordered. Neither the product description nor the photo explained this. I ordered it anyway, figuring there had to be a way to open that clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that prevents the hot barrel from resting directly on the counter is a small plastic wedge on the other side of the barrel from the tab that operates the clamp. If you look at the side view, you see the tab that operates the clamp on top, and a thin black piece sticking out at the bottom. The curling iron balances on the handle and thin black plastic piece. This contradicts one of the other reviews that said the barrel rests directly on the counter surface. Perhaps my curling iron had a later improvement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black plastic tip is small but big enough for me to prevent burning myself when maneuvering the barrel. The cord swivels 360° where it comes out of the handle. The handle bulges slightly toward the end, which helps me grip it. I do have small hands. I could imagine someone with bigger hands disliking the size of the handle, regardless of the ergonomic bulge. This is a tradeoff for travel sized goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron is 5.6 ounces (160 grams) . The carrying case is 1.2 ounces (36 grams).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really into small, pretty cosmetic bags, the kind you get at department makeup counters in a gift with purchase. I&#x27;m pretty fussy about how they look. The carrying case that came with this curling iron is pretty enough I would have sought it out as a makeup GWP. It&#x27;s padded, the lining is a thin, woven nylon, and the outer surface is plastic-coated, like patent leather. My curling iron&#x27;s handle is red. Its carrying case has the same pattern shown in the second product photo. The background color is white, as in the photo, but the pattern is red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a long review for a small, inexpensive product. I&#x27;m obsessed with packing light, and I had given up on curling irons for travel until I saw this Conair. I highly recommend it if you want a travel curling iron.big enough for me to prevent burning myself when maneuvering the barrel. The cord swivels 360° where it comes out of the handle.

            <li> Great little curling iron. It has a lot of power for such a small device. I only wish the barrel was bigger. My hair is a little below shoulder length, so a larger barrel would work better for me. But it is the size that it was advertised to be, so I still gave it 5 stars. It&#x27;s great for touch ups at the office and on the go. And if your hair is short, I think it would be great.</li>
            <li> I chose this to travel with, but i find it is too small to curl my hair. I have long hair and it tangles with this iron. I guess it would be fine for finer, shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any use for this but didn&#x27;t want to return it!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and its compact.  Perfect at home or when traveling.</li>
            <li> Great little travel curling iron. I used it all through Italy and worked great.</li>
            <li> I got several for gifts.. they&#x27;re super - fit in your purse or a drawer at work for &amp;#34;those days&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Hard to use because it will not contain my hair which is thick. Does not work like I had hoped</li>
            <li> I love it!  Great for travel.  Takes up very little room in your suitcase.  I even use it at home</li>
            <li> Finally I bought this product after reading reviews and much consideration. I am glad I got this.  It seems that some reviews were written before someone knowing this product enough. This product works just fine. I am so happy I don&#x27;t have to carry a bigger one on my trips anymore.</li>
            <li> Took me a little while to get used to the smaller curling iron, but it did an excellent job on our trip.  It heated up quickly, curled my hair, and then was slipped into the heat-proof bag that came with it.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great mini curling iron - perfect for touch-ups. Please note, however, that the curling area is only 2&amp;#34; long. I suggest you get a ruler and compare that to your home curling iron. If you have a lot of hair to curl, this is probably not your best choice, simply because it will take a very long time. If, however, you have a stubborn area that you&#x27;d like to touch up throughout the day or before going out after work, this is the perfect curling iron for your purse or desk. It comes with a protective cover, but you will need to cool it off before storing it. Even in its case, it&#x27;s smaller than a folding umbrella. It&#x27;s very compact and lightweight.</li>
            <li> its great but its kind of for long hair,  so I think it&#x27;s  worth the money</li>
            <li> It looks and feels like a toy.  It&#x27;s way too small to be of any use to anyone with medium length or long hair.  It does heat up, so I suppose it could work for little or short hair.</li>
            <li> I should have read the description better!  Buyer beware . . this is ridiculously TINY.  Honestly, read the size description better.  This is so small it looks as if it is for a child to use on her doll.  It is not really practical even for travel.  I know it was my fault in not reading more carefully, but you should.  I will not send it back due to it being my own fault.  I&#x27;m just warning you to check it out more thoroughly than I did and learn from my mistake.</li>
            <li> This item is way too small and difficult to handle.  It didn&#x27;t really work out well at all for me, since I have arthritis.  I would not recommend this to anyone who has problems with your hands or if you have thick hair.  I bought this because it is small and easy to store for travel, but not worth the purchase since I don&#x27;t use it anyway.  It was a waste of money, since I had to buy a regular size wide-barrel curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for travel.  It heated up quickly and was hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair, and I was surprised at how easy this was to use given the length of the barrel on it.  My hair didn&#x27;t take any longer to curl than with standard curling iron. There was no snagging where the clip part attaches to the barrel. The tension between the clip part and the barrel was just right, so it was very easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it had an auto-shutoff feature I&#x27;d probably replace my regular curling iron with it.</li>
            <li> It is too fat and hard to use. I used it once and gave up on it.</li>
            <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t taken this on her trip, yet, but she tried it out and says it works great. She will have to be careful so nit to burn her fingers, though.</li>
            <li> This Iron is so cute. I haven&#x27;t used it yet to curl all of my hair but so far it&#x27;s great for touch ups. It heats up very quickly and gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Doesnt weigh too much so it can be packed in a carryon and used anywhere. Only small amount of hair at a time. I need to bring a curling iron wherever I travel because my hair frizzes. This is light and works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to &#x27;touch up&#x27; my &#x27;do on the road &amp; minimize packing. Who wants to pay extra baggage fees when you can get by with a carry-on? This iron heats up fast, stows in it&#x27;s cute heatproof zebra patterned pouch &amp; weighs half of the &#x27;home&#x27; models. Good for those with bangs/ends to turn under or wavy/curly hair that needs a couple of touch ups - it would take forever to do a whole head with this.</li>
            <li> This was so hard for me to use. It&#x27;s the exact size I was hoping to find, but my hair for some reason kept sliding through it - the barrel just couldn&#x27;t get a good grip on my hair. I tried it a few times and then ended up leaving it behind at one of the hotels I was staying in. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve brought it everywhere and its great for international travel and inside a small locker at the gym</li>
            <li> The size was very small. Used it but not worth the money. You could bring your own curling iron from home. No advantage in buying a small curling iron.</li>
            <li> It works well as far as the heating, etc. but the barrel is so very short that it makes it hard to use. When you open the clamp, the opening is too small to easily guide in a section of hair. Ackward, but otherwise okay.</li>
            <li> it is too small.  With the 1 inch barrel and the limit to how hot it gets, you can barely get any hair in and what you do does not get hot enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron at my wife&#x27;s request for our trip to Spain... and she was very pleased with it. It works on both 110v and 220v...which is why she needed a new one.  She had another  110v one before, and tried using it with a converter....burned the converter right up.  With this one, she used a simple adapter...no problems!</li>
            <li> Found it a bit hard to handle because of the size</li>
            <li> So small I cannot operate it. I threw out my money. I can&#x27;t even get my hair properly around the rod.</li>
            <li> Handy, lite and works well!</li>
            <li> Great little curling iron.  Perfect solution to needing a small, packable curling iron for travel, when you only need small touch-ups such as curling bangs.</li>
            <li> This is perfect. Compact design doesn&#x27;t take up much space so it&#x27;s perfect in my bathroom as well as for travel. It heats really quickly which is amazing and does a great job curling my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple times since I have received it. It works fine. It definitely is MINI though, so I can only do the ends of my hair and I don&#x27;t use the clip or it causes annoying kinks.</li>
            <li> I already have one of these curling irons.  And they are just great for traveling.  I bought this second one for my trips to Europe.  Since it has built-in dual voltage, the only thing I need is an adaptor (of which I have many).  It is compact, has its own heat-resistant pouch and will fit into any corner in my suitcase.  This is one of those items that make life so much simpler.</li>
            <li> The size is convenient fro travel with dual adapter for European travel. I wish the barrel was a bit longer, as it doesn&#x27;t hold enough hair.  Would be great on very short hair, but not for long hair.  It gets very hot, very fast.  I was afraid of frying my hair, be cautious.</li>
            <li> Perfect travel piece.  QUICK HEAT UP. Fits nicely in my travel case and I like the cloth bag for it.</li>
            <li> I love my Travel Smart (Conair) perfect for my bands  the exactly size what I need it.</li>
            <li> this is perfect, works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this because it fits in most medium sized bags, and heats up very quickly.  The carry pouch that comes with it, allows you to carry it when you don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to cool even though it cools down quickly.</li>
            <li> The idea is great but execution is ok. I don&#x27;t know if there is a solution to this but its REALLY SMALL. So, I had a hard time even curling my hair which was frustrating. It also gets really hot, so after I was done I had to add serum to the tips of my hair because it looked so singed when I was done. Other than that, the carrying case was super helpful in keeping the cord organized and I really do love the idea. I have short-ish hair, so it might be better for people with longer hair.</li>
            <li> I already owned one of these.  I love it!  It provides lots of heat and the size is wonderful for traveling.  I bought two more so I will have one for travel and one for home and one for backup in case one bites the dust!!!  It meets all my expectations!!!</li>
            <li> Do not recommed this product.  One temp - VERY, VERY HOT!  Tip gets as hot as the metal part so must operate with one hand making it diffficult to feed hair into the curler and control angle.  Compact size was appealing at first, however, I will return to longer models with temp control and both ends that do not heat up.</li>
            <li> Burned my wife the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to take to Italy and Israel. Worked perfectly for my fine hair to curl the ends. No issues with the dual voltage, only need a plug adapter.</li>
            <li> One star for the dual voltage, one because it&#x27;s purse sized; one because it&#x27;s cute.  That&#x27;s where the galaxy ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working with a large pair of scissors, it took over 5 minutes to get this curling iron out of its heavy plastic packaging.  After heating up the iron, it took 2 minutes to realize that this device doesn&#x27;t work on my thin, shoulder-length, blonde hair.  It didn&#x27;t even curl my bangs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that it comes with a zebra print case, which will look nice as another dust-collecting item in my apartment.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my hair was a little longer than shoulder length, and I was not impressed. I just got my hair chopped into a short, layered bob, and that is what this iron is meant for. Had I done a review for longer hair, it would have been one or two stars - for short hair it&#x27;s a five star product. You can&#x27;t take big wads of hair and attempt to curl, but taking small amounts to give some bounce is the way to go. I wasn&#x27;t sure about taking it with me overseas next week, but it&#x27;s getting packed.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and takes up almost no space in travel bag.  Perfect for straightening my unruly bangs.  Can also use to curl ends, if done in small sections.</li>
            <li> Great for travel :). I&#x27;m going to Brasil in two weeks, can&#x27;t wait to try it!!! It gets hot very fast...</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for a recent trip to Italy.  It worked well on the European voltage and fulfilled her hair needs.</li>
            <li> It may be tiny, but it&#x27;s mighty! This takes up almost no space in my luggage and works great. I&#x27;ve got long hair and it curls it with no problem. It comes in a nice little case. Even though I&#x27;m on the road, I still want to have my hair look good at times and this does it.</li>
            <li> Lousy. What else can I say? It was a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> It works well for what it is.  Being used to longer curling irons which hold more hair each time, I find using the mini one very frustrating.  Even a two inch longer barrel would help.</li>
            <li> First off, I do agree with other purchasers that the very short barrel does make hair styling difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it worked the first 2 places in France that I used it but blew out the 3rd time I used it.  It is supposed to automatically convert to the correct voltage but, for whatever reason, apparently didn&#x27;t that time.  I should have brought it back with me to return but was afraid that the assumption would be made that I&#x27;d used the wrong plug in or something of that nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do steer clear of this item.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, straight hair and bought this for an extended trip through Europe.&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s compact and lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- works well with a plug adapter&lt;br /&gt;- functional case&lt;br /&gt;- the barrel stand prevents it from damaging flat surfaces&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s dangerously hot! I&#x27;ve never burned myself with a curling iron; this one barely brushed my forehead and resulted in a burn that scabbed.&lt;br /&gt;- the clip opens at  such a narrow angle that it accommodates very little hair; it took 20 min to curl my thin, chin length hair&lt;br /&gt;- only practical for touch-ups or very short hair</li>
            <li> Works like a dream. Great for travel, I could not ask for anything better. i would buy it again if I needed one, will reccoment to others.</li>
            <li> Great little iron for travel. Heats quickly, cute case, dual voltage. It does take some practice to get used to because of it&#x27;s small size. All in all a great buy.</li>
            <li> Was too small to use, so it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> As noted in other reviews, barrel is VERY short but it gets extremely hot. Clamp is weak, holds a thicker clump of hair better than a thin one.  This means it takes no longer to style my long thick hair than it does at home with a regular iron.  I was thrilled with the instant ringlets it produced.  I am very cautious not to touch the barrel when hot as I&#x27;m sure it would cause a hekova burn. Packs extremely compactly.</li>
            <li> It traveled well but had just one heat setting, very hot.  Usually I curl my hair using not so much heat so i will just use this while traveling.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea but the curling wand is so short that my thick hair would not stay on the wand.</li>
            <li> Allow me to explain. I&#x27;m in Europe (I&#x27;ve been to 9 E.U. countries this year) and I have American appliances, like a travel blow dryer and smart phone chargers. I have a great adapter that lets me plug in my appliances to European outlets, it works great. The problem? Of my 11 American appliances, this is the ONLY one that does not work with ANY adapter I&#x27;ve found. One of the prongs that goes into the wall/adapter outlet is too large and simply will not fit. My travel hair dryer works fine. All my camera and phone chargers work perfectly. This product does not. It&#x27;s not rocket science, it&#x27;s cr*ppy engineering. I used to like Conair, until they conned me calling this a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; hair curler; it&#x27;s small and only works in America. That leaves a heck of a lot of places you can&#x27;t travel with it.</li>
            <li> I guess this is okay if you are travelling, but be aware it is very small.  I was expecting it to be a little larger.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great.  I was skeptical that I could really use it to get curls on my long hair given the small size.  I normally use a 1 1/4 inch Hot Tools curling iron at home, but don&#x27;t like to carry it around with me for air travel.  I ordered this and the Quince cordless curling iron.  The Quince does not use a US plug, so the first time I traveled I took this guy with me (still skeptical).  I have long hair and was able to curl my entire head with this.  I don&#x27;t even think it took longer than with a full size curling iron.  I was able to get curl all the way up the shaft of my hair and the barrel was hot enough to curl the hair close to the barrel as well as hair layered on top (due to short length of barrel).  The curls actually lasted longer than they do with my HotTools full size curling iron at home.  This is a great buy.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to get this if you need a travel size curling iron.</li>
            <li> Recently took on trip to South Africa.  Love the size for storage but it only gives small curls.  Worked for me because only needed a little at the top and bangs but be careful of tip.  It gets warm.</li>
            <li> This little curling iron worked well for me in my travels. It folds up nicely and heats up quickly.  I have used it all over the world. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Looks like it will be perfect for travel....nice and compact and it curls my hair!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is extremely lightweight. I purchased it for a trip to Europe (it&#x27;s also dual voltage).  I will definitely be bringing this instead of a standard curling iron because it takes up virtually no space in my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it only 4 stars because:&lt;br /&gt;- It seems like once turned on, it just keeps getting hotter and hotter.  My standard curling irons seem to hold a steady temperature, whereas I actually unplugged this once halfway through to let it cool down a bit.  I suppose if you prefer a very high heat, you should let it &#x27;warm up&#x27; a few minutes before using.&lt;br /&gt;- The shorter barrel is sort of annoying.  It takes a modified technique and extra time to curl my hair over a standard curling iron, so I wouldn&#x27;t exactly use this all the time.  However, since it&#x27;s so small, I could definitely see throwing this in my gym bag for quick touchups even when I&#x27;m not traveling.  A perfect product would be this same design, with just an extended barrel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a trip to China where I was only taking a backpack (usually it&#x27;s about 2 large suitcases so this was quite the adventure). It is crazy small but yet works as well as my regular size one. It heats up quickly and curls quite a bit of hair. My hair is well past my shoulders and I had no trouble curling long bunches of hair in seconds. I highly recommend this for a purse size or travel accessory.</li>
            <li> The price was more than reasonable comparied to others.  The curling iron works great on my thick hair - gets very hot; I use it primarly for my bangs.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like -- there was no type of medal anchor when you place the barrel on a table.  When you put in down on the table or bathroom sink, the hot barrel lies directly on the surface and could damage the surface if you use it anywhere other than in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This iron got way too hot (and I did burn myself though being careful); the barrel is just too short to effectively handle. It didn&#x27;t do the job that I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Its OKAY but very very very small.</li>
            <li> Too Short and awkward to use without burning fingers.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I would recommend this to all not just to travellers but all...&lt;br /&gt;It works great on my long hair... just loved it...</li>
            <li> I have long fine thick hair. I had to be patient in curling it and making sure it was completely dry because the barrel of this curling is pretty small but it got really hot and worked really well for what it is.</li>
            <li> Use it every day; not just for travel.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great for travel use, as it&#x27;s intended.  It comes with a small carrying case, and it is just about as small as a curling iron could get.  The problem is, it may actually be too small to get anything accomplished on long or voluminous hair.  It probably takes me about four times as long to do my hair with this curling iron versus my regular sized 1&amp;#34; barrel iron.  So, it really only works if you are a truly committed light packer with limited space in your bag for the real thing.</li>
            <li> It took a moment to realize I don&#x27;t like it... at all.  Was going to use for on long hari for travel with 220v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION:&lt;br /&gt;probably good for fine, short hair … and work quickly before the thumb lever gets hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;great size for travel, short barrel&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;short barrel, probably works best for short hair&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;handle is fat enough to hold… good grip&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;has pouch to store even when iron still hot&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;temperature: not too hot, maybe less than 300 degrees, probably better for hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;thumb lever to open up clip gets hot….&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;thumb lever to open up clip gets hot….&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;barrel is short, sometimes hair couldn&#x27;t get on clip and goes around handle instead - probably good for short hair&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;temperature: not too hot, maybe less than 300 degrees, does not hold curl as well as higher temperature</li>
            <li> I needed a small, lightweight, dual voltage curling iron to take on an international trip.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It is both compact and lightweight.  You will need an adapter, but not a power converter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair.  I was able to use this curling iron to \\&quot;tame\\&quot; my hair into the look that I wanted.  Was it as good as the curling iron that I use every day?  No.  But it fit my needs perfectly.  Yes, the barrel is short, and you can only curl a small amount of hair at a time.  But that&#x27;s the point - purchase this item if you want something compact for traveling.  You should be aware that the purpose of the case is not to store the curling iron AND the power cord.  The purpose of the case is to store the hot curling iron, when finished curling your hair.  You can pack it when still hot/warm.  And the elastic band holds the power cord next to it.  Perfect for a traveler.</li>
            <li> Perfect size when you need to pack light. Gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> 3 inches would be better</li>
            <li> I wanted a travel curling iron, but alas the wand is sooo short that it&#x27;s meant for touching up your curls, not giving you curls.</li>
            <li> This is a great small iron. Loved it.  Now read this&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Learn to use it before diving in... watch your fingers and get the hang of it.  Remember it&#x27;s small.  I almost got burned because I&#x27;m used to my large non-travel curling iron, it produced really nice curls.  I get frizzy hair in the humidity and this smoothed it right out producing better curls than I get with my large iron and didn&#x27;t overheat it.  Yeah, this is the right thing for nice curls and it&#x27;s small for travel..</li>
            <li> This little guy heats up super fast and its compatibility was a huge benefit. I&#x27;m using it now as my regular curling iron. What a space saver... I wish I&#x27;d discovered this years ago lol. A minimalists dream.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling to Europe, thinking it would be lighter and take up less space than a normal size curling iron. It was okay....I thought it would be important that it had dual voltage and a voltage transformer (only the adapter) was not needed, but it ended up not being enough of a big deal and I regretted not bringing my normal curling iron. I really could only curl my bangs with this. I have really long thick hair and it took forever to curl and I didn&#x27;t really like the curl it gave. Having said this, if all you want is to curl your bangs, or you have short hair, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Although this is very compact, I found it difficult to use. The clamp does not open wide enough to easily grab a section of hair. Then the hair slips out as the clamp doesn&#x27;t hold it, unless you push tightly against the slide mechanism which opens the clamp. I should have made room for my standard size curler.However, with more practice using it before a trip, it could work for someone for whom packing space is really critical.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this little guy enough!  I have extremely thick and unruly hair but I often use this INSTEAD of my full-sized curlers!  I use it as a wand and consistently get perfect beachy waves.  I can do my whole head very quickly and it heats fast and stays hot.</li>
            <li> I used this twice on a trip, couldn&#x27;t really get the hang of it (I&#x27;m used to a longer barrel). I purchased it to curl my bangs, since I use a flat iron for the rest of my hair, but didn&#x27;t want to pack my regular curling iron.  I ended up just using the flat iron only, but I think if I had more patience and used this cute mini curling iron, it would&#x27;ve done the job.</li>
            <li> This is very small and actually works great and keeps me from having to travel with an actual converter which I was having to do before with just a regular curling iron.  It works in Europe and the US - for Europe, note you will need an adaptor for the country you are in, just not a converter.</li>
            <li> Super for a vacation curling iron, small to pack, gives a great curl, hope to use it for many trips to come.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel to Europe because I needed dual voltage and small size. It works amazingly well for those travel touch-ups. It gets very hot quickly and in spite of the short barrel, it does the job. Then pop it in its insulated bag and throw it back in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> The size was great for fitting in my luggage.. It worked great but be sure allow for more time as you can only put so much hair around the tiny barrel.</li>
            <li> I love the size and performance of this curling iron.  The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t open up very wide so you have to&lt;br /&gt;create more curls.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travelling light. it suits carry-on luggage, I couldn&#x27;t find it in Canada</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in South Africa--no need to make any adjustments to work on different voltage. Small size but great for touch-ups--just what I needed. Heats up quickly. Loved the insulated zebra-striped case. You can pack it almost as soon as you unplug it. Great for travel!</li>
            <li> Extremely little. Too uncomfortable to use. Next time will travel with regular size.</li>
            <li> Great to put in my bag for work. Heats up wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Excellent curling iron. Heats up quickly and is a convenient size to pack when travelling.</li>
            <li> Great little curling iron - perfect for travel</li>
            <li> quality, nice compact mini hair curler, just right for fluffing up short hair fuller with larger curls, good price</li>
            <li> I suppose that if I were a traveler, I might overlook my issues with this curling iron. I bought it because I only need to add some bend to my bangs and I wanted to have less clutter on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upside: Small, lightweight, cute, heats up quickly, packs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside:&lt;br /&gt;The barrel is very smooth, and my very fine hair - even with a coating of hairspray to add texture - would slip out constantly.&lt;br /&gt;My hair gets caught in the joint where the barrel meets the handle, and I often end up pulling that hair out accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to keep my hair away from that joint, I try to keep my hair away from it, which means the little barrel has a tiny usable area.  So even just curling my bangs takes 8 or 10 passes.&lt;br /&gt;And this is more nitpicking than an actual flaw, but I don&#x27;t like the tip - it&#x27;s awkward to hold and it&#x27;s a little scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced it with a full size iron, but I&#x27;m holding on to it for weekenders.</li>
            <li> Love this. Just the right size. Carry it every time I travel. A friend referred me to this brand and size. She was very pleased with it also. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> This travel curling iron is *tiny*; check the dimensions.  I initially had a little trouble using it, but got better with practice and ended up really liking the curling iron.  The dual-current feature works just fine (I did need a plug adapter) and the small size is great is suitcase space is limited.</li>
            <li> This works really well, but I am giving it three stars because it is supposed to be for travel and not just touch ups.  If you want something for touch ups at work, this is perfect.  If you are thinking of using it for travel as your only styler and you have a full head of hair it is going to be frustrating.  I gave it a try before a recent trip, and ended up packing the standard size curling iron because this was too limited to efficiently style my shoulder length thick hair. lt does get very hot and works well for its size so if your hair is short or thin, it may work well for you.  But if you have thick shoulder or longer length hair, unless you have unlimited time to cope with the small barrel and exposed heat, you are going to be in trouble.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a good travel curling iron that would have dual voltage on it so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about a converter. Last year on my trip overseas, my curling iron was ruined because I didn&#x27;t have a converter and it required a higher voltage. I was afraid that this little curling iron might not have a lot of heat and take a long time to get the job done. To the contrary, it heats up very well and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far. It&#x27;s great for little touch-ups, too.</li>
            <li> Cute as a button, but too small to realistically use for anything but a nape-of-neck or bangs touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;I am mystified by anyone claiming to find it a breeze for long, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: tiny, cute case, cheap, heats up to good hot temperature&lt;br /&gt;Cons: too small to function, rendering all the \\&quot;pros\\&quot; pointless</li>
            <li> This could be a little bigger, but it packs great in its own case and heats up fast.  Perfect for the do before dinner on a trip.</li>
            <li> I have long, normal volume hair., and found the grip was non-existent, so I couldn&#x27;t pull it to get my ends under the grip nor roll it. It seemed to be hot enough, so maybe it&#x27;s my hair type?</li>
            <li> I bought this as a travel curling iron, but have used it almost daily as it is more convenient to use than my regular curling iron.  I use it for small jobs - bangs, the end of my pony tail.  At home, I would choose my full size curling iron instead to curl all my hair, but this will work well on the road.  Heats up very quickly.  Smooth operation - does not snag or pull out hair.  A little plastic foot keeps it from touching on the bathroom counter.  Just be extra careful when using it - the whole device is much smaller including the cool plastic grip tip so it is easier to burn your fingers.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grip my hair well, unfortunately. The barrel is a tad too short, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and good for curling the tips of the hair.  You can&#x27;t get too much hair wrapped around the curling iron because of it&#x27;s small size.  It is lightweight and perfect for travel if you need a touch up.</li>
            <li> The pros of this is, it heats up really fast and in the future, I can fit it into any bag without it taking to much room.&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I have with it so far is because I have a lot of hair, it takes a while to curl</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my trip to Europe. I have really long hair and it still was able to get the job done. I also didn&#x27;t have trouble with it getting too hot as other reviewers stated. I would highly recommend this if you are trying to pack light for Europe and want a curling iron that is duel-voltage. Won&#x27;t find many in this price range.</li>
            <li> I brought this to work for quick touchups.  I love it.  It heats up wicked fast.  No regulation on the temp, and it gets Extremely Hot, so be careful when using not to hold on your hair too long.</li>
            <li> The handle is not quite long enough and the very tiny grip on the opposite end is way too small so I kept burning my fingers on both ends.  I would have returned it, but the shipping was as much as I paid for it in the first place.  I still have it, but have replaced it with a similar model with much easier handling.</li>
            <li> It works wherever I travel, often in gray weather, where hair goes limp before noon. It uses much less space than curlers and works more rapidly.</li>
            <li> cheap, cheap, cheap!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It works great but the barrel length is just so short that you can only curl about 1&amp;#34; width of your hair at a time.  It works great for me because I only curl my bangs and don&#x27;t have to do my whole head.  Heats quickly and remains hot for duration of use.</li>
            <li> Heats great but I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to stay wrapped around the barrel, kept sliding off.</li>
            <li> I bought one to use on an international trip and have been using it since I returned home.  I have short fine hair so it works wonderfully - probably not so great if you have long/thick hair.  The small size and heatproof sleeve that comes with the iron make it perfect for packing.</li>
            <li> I am returning this product because the barrel is very short - it works for short hair but anything longer than that would not fit on the roller.  When I saw the 1\\&quot; designation I thought it meant the circumference of the barrel, not the length.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of my large curling iron.  Despite my fine hair, this keeps my hair curly throughout the day!  It does take slightly longer to curl all of my hair because of the size, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Not bad - didn&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s travel sized, it takes a long time to curl all my hair. I also burn my fingers more often. It works... I just have to give myself a lot of time to do my hair so it&#x27;s not that convenient.</li>
            <li> This Travel Smart curling iron works well for me.  The size is great, because I have been trying to downsize what I take on a trip so I don&#x27;t have to check a bag.  This is small enough that it barely takes up any room in my carry on suitcase.  I have long, fine hair and I was easily able to curl my hair with it.  Because of it&#x27;s size, it did take a little longer, but I feel that is something to be expected.  It did heat up very fast, so I don&#x27;t have to sit around waiting for it to get hot. I have had this for quite some time now and it has held up well.  It&#x27;s a great travel iron.</li>
            <li> This is indeed a compact curling iron that heats up very well.  I had previously ordered a much more expensive folding curling iron for travel and it never got hot enough to actually curl my hair.  I forgot it at a hotel and didn&#x27;t even bother to call and have them mail it back to me.  I am pleased with this small one, although I wish the barrel was about 1 inch longer, as the short length makes it a bit more challenging to do much curling and that is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I usually just use it to give some lift to my bangs, and it works fine for that.  If I had to curl a lot of my hair, I think it would be a time-consuming process.  For my travel needs, it is perfect -- small, and easy to pack with its own travel pouch.</li>
            <li> WAY TOO SMALL.  If one had really short hair I guess it would be ok. Tried using it a home and will not take it on my travels.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful travel curling iron!  It heats up quickly, packs conveniently, and makes adorable curls.  We travel a lot and try to pack very lightly.  This iron will leave more room for other items in my pack:).</li>
            <li> this curling iron  looks great for travel because of it&#x27;s small size.  I was hoping it might expand, but it doesn&#x27;t and is simply too short and not so easy to use if you have short hair.</li>
            <li> It is small.  Be prepared for that.  However, it curled my hair perfectly and I will take it again when weight is a concern in my luggage and I am going to another country.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, nice small size, great heat proof pouch and best of all, the wife loves it. Happy wife, happy life!!</li>
            <li> Very little but ok ;-)</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets it done.  It gets quite hot, which is great for my long mane of hair.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The iron is SMALL and unless you have short, fine hair it won&#x27;t be effective on long hair.  I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t curl past 3 inches from the ends because when I wind it up the heat doesn&#x27;t reach the mid-top section.  But it does heat up fast and curl.  It&#x27;s not the big barrel curl FYI</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my travel curler. I take it everywhere.</li>
            <li> This little curling iron heats up fast and makes smooth, long-lasting curls.  Of course it can&#x27;t hold as much hair as a normal curling iron - it&#x27;s tiny, that&#x27;s the point!  I&#x27;m definitely taking this on my next trip to Europe.  (It&#x27;s dual voltage, of course.)  Hair glides so smoothly over the barrel that I&#x27;m going to use it as both a flat iron and a curling iron when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine doesn&#x27;t fit in the pouch with the cord - but there&#x27;s an elastic strap on the side of the pouch that does hold the cord so it&#x27;s all contained.  And supposedly the pouch is heat-resistant so you can pack it up right after using it.  (I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but that&#x27;s what the user guide says.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, nice product in a convenient size.</li>
            <li> the barrel is way too short</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old because she wanted her own curling iron.  I figured a smaller curling iron would be easier for her to use... nope... Even I had trouble handling it!  We both burnt our fingers several times.  Beware!</li>
            <li> Great product, very convenient to travel, good size and the heat is good, easy to carry on your purse I like it</li>
            <li> After dithering a bit after reading both positive and negative reviews I bought this curling iron, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It curls quickly and is amazingly small - perfect for packing. I love that you can slide it into its pouch while still hot and throw it into your bag. Tucking the cord into the velcro strap outside the pouch doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Only having one heat setting doesn&#x27;t bother me, either - I always use my regular curling iron on a pretty high heat. I&#x27;m great at burning myself with curling irons but have not done so even once with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is agreement with other reviewers - if it were exactly the same but 1 inch longer, it would still be tiny but would be a lot easier to use, and you could curl larger chunks of hair. Maybe Conair will lengthen the barrel someday...</li>
            <li> Too small. Can&#x27;t get hair into the iron.  I returned mine</li>
            <li> nice product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I read reviews and thought I would be able to work with it but couldn&#x27;t.  Burnt my finger after I tried it a couple of times but gave up.  Donated it to Salvation Army when I returned from Europe.  DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
            <li> to small continually burned my hand.  Thought it would be nice for travel but the size was frustrating.  Donated it/</li>
            <li> Just as described and fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> The hot part is about 2&amp;#34; long, which means it can hold very little hair at a time.</li>
            <li> Handy little tool, doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of heat.</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats up well but is really small for curling hair.  You just need to allow more time if you plan to use it.  I really like how small it is though.</li>
            <li> I know that it is mini, but it is very difficult to use, it is just too short. It also looks very cheap</li>
            <li> Heats well and is very portable, only problem is that if you have longer than four or five inch hair, it&#x27;s difficult to use!</li>
            <li> Love my mini curling iron.  Perfect size for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, perfect fit. I love it. It will travel so nicely and with arthritis in my hands this little size is just what I needed..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your prompt service.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I purchased this. I needed something small enough to stuff into my carry-on bag for travel, but I also needed it to do the job well (and I am a super picky when it comes to my hair); this worked out perfectly! The only other mini curling iron I had attempted to use a while back (note - not a Conair) really let me down. This one was ideal for my chin length, fine, wavy hair - I used it for both a traditional curling iron type of curl and also used it to get the effect of a flat iron for my bangs. The little zebra-striped case it came with is ideal, too - it even fits into my purse, so I have used it more often than I originally intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am waffling between a four and a five, but going with the four and here is why: (1) it is really short - yes, I expected a mini, but this is truly \\&quot;MINI\\&quot; - depending on the hair style and thickness of your hair, it may be an ordeal to use, and (2) it gets HOT - and yes, a curling iron should, but, especially since it doesn&#x27;t have a support to hold it up when you set it down, you can easily damage a surface if you are not extra careful (it worked really well on bathroom surfaces for me, but in one instance all I had was a wooden furniture surface available and I could not easily put it down without potentially damaging the wood.) Even with these two nit-picky potential drawbacks, I am really pleased with this purchase ... I would definitely recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> I have short hair so usaully I don not concern about the lengs of irons. This iron is very convenient to take while traveling.But it is kind of to short for me.</li>
            <li> I love this little curling iron.  I have taken it with me on overseas travel.  If you have thick, long hair it may not be for you, but I have rather short hair and it is perfect for me.  It packs in its small, heart resistant case.  Great little tool.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is my hair is pretty short, and I find the clamp is not very strong, so my short hair sort of slides out of it. I wish the clamp was adjustable, or a little more snug. But, my hair is growing out, so that won&#x27;t be a problem for long. It&#x27;s small, easy to use and will be great for travel.</li>
            <li> This was the smallest curling iron I could find.  It comes with a sleeve to allow you to pack it while still warm which is, for me, very useful.  It gets a bit hotter than I would like for every day use but for a few curls on the road, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> My daughter in law included this on her Christmas wish list and I ordered from Amazon at the very last minute. It arrived very quickly and she was thrilled to receive it. I had no idea such a thing existed, but now that I see how little space it takes up compared to a regular curling iron, I&#x27;m going to order one for myself as well!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried yet, but have other Conair products happy with.  Since unable to locate in local stores, very happy to find on Amazon.  Looking forward to using when traveling.  Will try before packing, as being shorter than my regular curling iron, it could be little challenge</li>
            <li> Perfect size and seems well built.  Great for travel.  My only concern is it gets too too hot.  Watch it so as not to burn your hair or the surface you set it down on while in use.</li>
            <li> great for traveling Just have to get use to the small size. it works great however.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy! We are going to Europe and cutting back on our packing weight. I tried it a few times and it works great. Granted it is tiny and you have to use less hair but better than not having a curling iron. With an adapter plug the voltage will switch automatically.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all, didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> I read all the complaints about this little travel curling iron and I almost didn&#x27;t buy it. So glad I decided to give it a try. It gets hot quick, has a tip on the end to hold, and a little resting stub on the bottom so that the hot iron part doesn&#x27;t lay against the countertop. It&#x27;s plenty big to do a quick curl or 10. The case is nice and makes it easy to store the cord. Fits easily in my makeup bag. It goes on all my trips now!</li>
            <li> Worked well in France, but I wish it came with an inch-and- a-half width barrel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought, but easy to take</li>
            <li> no shield to protect fingers from burns.</li>
            <li> Good product but def not for everyday use. Very small - but great for traveling! Not good product if you have long or thick hair verses short, finer hair.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, but yes very small for my long hair. Still it worked great, heated up fast and hot.</li>
            <li> I found this item satisfied my hair needs. It worked fine, it heated up fast, it&#x27;s size was not a problem and anytime I can reduce space and weight in my travels I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;ve taken two trips with it so for and was very satisfied.So I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Barrel of the curling iron is too small and you cannot wrap too much hair at one time. Iron is difficult to hold. I don&#x27;t recommend it. Takes a very long time to do your hair. Unfortunately the way it&#x27;s packaged in plastic, which has to be cut up to get the curling iron out makes it impossible to repackage and return.</li>
            <li> Great size -- incredibly light and small, perfect for trips -- and only took a bit of time to learn how to use well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> When they say this MiniPro curling iron is small...believe it!  You have to be very careful not to burn your hand while using it.  I have short hair and I accidentally grabbed the wrong end...let me tell you it&#x27;s not pleasant.  For longer hair its probably perfect...but for shorter hair...hummmmmmm I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend it.  Too easy to slip off the hair and there is no place on the iron to help you turn your hair and the iron like on the larger ones.</li>
            <li> Super item. The size is perfect. It&#x27;s light and works surprisingly well for it&#x27;s size especially.</li>
            <li> This little curling iron is a little bit hard to work with but it definitely serves its purpose. I have very long, thick hair and have to do little sections at a time, but I think it is better than carting around a regular sized curling iron when I travel!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when my husband ordered this for me as a Christmas gift.  However it is totally un-useable---at least for me!  The clip that wraps around your hair is so tiny that I can&#x27;t even get my hair in it.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone can use it unless they have very short hair, maybe.  Very disappointing.  I have yet to find a small, travel sized curling iron.</li>
            <li> Curling heats up fast and works well.  The small size is great for traveling but you do have to be careful when using it so you don&#x27;t accidently burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in your suitcase. Switches voltage automatically- that was very convenient in Italy. The barrel is short so you have to do smaller sections of hair, which takes a little longer. But it was great to have a way to style my hair while still packing very light. I wish someone made a 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel, but the 1&amp;#34; seems to be the only size available.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It is small, lightweight, compact.  It heats up in an instant.  The shaft is small, but by taking small amounts of hair you can definitely get the job done.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was a great idea but it was just too small to control  when trying to  curl your hair. I returned it</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for travel.  Works just fine.  Will take it on all trips from now on. wow</li>
            <li> Getting ready for a South American trip, I had to find a curling iron with 220 Volts.  This little guy is amazing.  My hair looked great every day, easy to use, better then my full size one.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Bought this since I was taking only a carry-on with me on a Europe trip. Works great! Curls stayed quite well throughout the day. Easy to use</li>
