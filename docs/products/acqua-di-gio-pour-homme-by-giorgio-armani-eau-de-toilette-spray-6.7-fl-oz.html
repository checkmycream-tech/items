            <li>Amazon has it at a lot better price than you will get it any where else.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years now and still buy GIO women love</li>
            <li>I love the scent as well.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have more to say, but the system required more.</li>
            <li>I gifted this to my love..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>Seems ok to me.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve bought this product before from a department store, you&#x27;ll be able to immediately tell that it&#x27;s counterfeit.</li>
            <li>Di Gio gets respect from men and the most appropriate term would be appreciation from women.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Because :)\\&quot; and it was not with the package.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this than any I have ever used</li>
            <li>This Giorgio Armani fragrance has been a favorite for my husband.</li>

            <li>My brother love this Gio</li>
            <li>My favorite.  </li>
            <li>The price on amazon is much better than any of the stores I went to.</li>
            <li>You get much more of the cologne for this price than you would at a department store.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>my favorite perfume..</li>

            <li>You are better off ordering from Macy&#x27;s.com.  </li>
            <li>The replacement took one more week to reach me.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite cologne</li>
            <li>The serial number on the box matched the serial number on the bottom of the cologne (which is one of the ways to tell if it is authentic).  </li>
            <li>3.4 Oz at Sam&#x27;s Club was 10$ more than this 6.4 oz from amazon.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I could smell it even after 5-6 hrs, he doesn&#x27;t bathe in it for sure..</li>
            <li>I love The Size &amp; I</li>
            <li>My husband loves this fragrance, and I love it on him.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell get compliment all day.</li>

            <li>Its my favorite.</li>
            <li>Get many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love it, people can&#x27;t stop asking about the  perfume</li>
            <li>It is a sealed box with shrink wrap, a serial number, and smells just like the same wonderful aroma I&#x27;ve come to expect.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, it&#x27;s the original and authentic product!</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This is my first time that I ever buy any perfume of any kind, and I love this!</li>
            <li>BE AWARE !!!</li>
            <li>Excellent experience with professional seller  Package new good condition and in time.looking forward to  do morebusiness.</li>
            <li>but everyone has their own option I&#x27;m into sweet smelling and musk</li>
            <li>I first heard about it in high school psychology class when my teacher was talking about the power of scent and mentioned that this cologne was rated one of the best smelling by females.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as product that I&#x27;ve bought at Dillard&#x27;s, but ok</li>
            <li>Refreshing, but not so strong that is offensive.  </li>
            <li>I was exceedingly happy with this purchase, and my husband was surprised that I bought it for him too!</li>
            <li>Fast friendly and great product</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li>I love the light clean scent of Acqua Di Gio!</li>
            <li>The shipping worked perfectly and arrived on the day expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, lingering and sexy.</li>
            <li>so the ladies can&#x27;t  catch me, nothing like running fast and smelling good</li>
            <li>I loved the price and fast shipping, along with the smell.  </li>
            <li>Great Price super fast delivery</li>
            <li>I got it as a present and the person loved it!</li>
            <li>This cologne is not fake just like many reviews say!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great deal on such an amazing cologne!</li>
            <li>The price might be great on Amazon, but you end up using more to get the same result.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume but recent one received was not that great</li>
            <li>Great and not overpowering for work but still extremely appealing on a date or romantic night out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong of a fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly strong like an Arimis or Polo cologne which every moose up in Cananda can smell if you dab it on in Florida.  </li>
            <li>and it is not too strong or over powering.  </li>
            <li>Liked this very much.  </li>
            <li>This is a consistent amazing scent and a must have in any collection.</li>
            <li>I liked this product because it was priced well and got to my house fast!</li>
            <li>A true timeless gem in the world of creative perfumery.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne, I use no other and really enjoy the pleasant citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>This cologne is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;price is right shipped fast and smooth and smells great .</li>
            <li>Everything went fine, cheers</li>
            <li>Fine and heady manly scent</li>
            <li>Instead, if you can&#x27;t smell the cologne anymore, ask a friend or if you&#x27;re feeling bold, ask a stranger to smell you and they will be able to smell it.</li>
            <li>ARRIVED IN HUGE BOX AND WAS CHARGED SALES TAX COULD OF BOUGHT</li>
            <li>We got the HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li>Plus this bottle is huge...</li>
            <li>This is the perfume I wear always when I am going for important appointments.</li>
            <li>This was a great price on the larger bottle, and this is my go to cologne.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about some of the reviews mentioning that this was not a genuine product, but I don&#x27;t agree at all this product is of excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Love this fresh scent.</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself using a lot more however since the smell wasn&#x27;t as distinct as I remembered</li>
            <li>Plus he smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>This was genuine stuff.</li>
            <li>Genuine, I used colognes for years and  years</li>
            <li>The price I paid for this purchase was shockingly cheap for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>apologized and offered a free replacement.</li>
            <li>never a disappointment for sure</li>
            <li>Great Christmas present</li>
            <li>Fantastic shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great price thanks</li>
            <li>Smells original and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real Acqua Di Gio!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is just clean, fresh and not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a scent specialist or a fragrance expert, but what I smell is mainly a fresh and clean scent with refreshing hints of citrus and grassy</li>
            <li>He was excited to see the huge bottle he received.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a light, pleasant alternative for men to many of the other stuff on the market.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this scent by Sephora and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have used this cologne for the past two years and it is the best ever, every one like it.</li>
            <li>, Acqui Di Gio is for you, if you want something unique to keep people guessing, I&#x27;d keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has always been my go to cologne and has never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Original sealed packaging.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff but remember you have to try it first......</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>At half price from the department stores this is a very good deal.</li>
            <li>Great product and lasts long!</li>
            <li>My wife likes the \\&quot;Clean scent\\</li>
            <li>It smalls so clean.</li>
            <li>To be completely honest, I am no expert, and cannot identify what aroma it releases, but all I can say is that most of the people I have hung out with, especially girls, have complimented me on this cologne, and it does that without overriding your senses!</li>
            <li>And this huge bottle will last me a good while. 5</li>
            <li>My husband likes it because its not too potent but still smells nice and last all day.</li>
            <li>Never had a scent that received more positive compliments from ladies.</li>
            <li>Yet completely suitable for an older gentlemen.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the smell and I love the large bottle.</li>
            <li>GREAT EXTRA LARGE bottle you can buy at about 75% off retail cost!  </li>
            <li>As expected, great price.</li>
            <li>It has light fresh fragrance which is soothing to the senses.</li>
            <li>Cool Water  </li>
            <li>What proof do you have that everything you read is true?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am pleased with this product and would highly recommend this fragrance to anyone!</li>
            <li>For those who like a good perfume, that&#x27;s such an offer for</li>
            <li>good deal on the big size.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than retail, and this is my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It still smells good, but it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li>I have  been using Armani Acqua Di Gio for more than 3 years, and I am very familar with the scent.</li>
            <li>it was about 50 % off, (As I cant bring myself to pay full price for anything) and it arrived 2 days after my order confirmation.</li>
            <li>This item I bought is not the true GIO Product.  </li>
            <li>This item came pretty fast wrapped pretty good</li>
            <li>Full bottle sitting there.  </li>
            <li>I really just love it.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought one from Amazon when my supply ran out.  </li>
            <li>Too good to be true, save your money and buy the smaller bottle from the department store.</li>
            <li>The second time, I called up Amazon and they offered a full refund (which is good).</li>
            <li>I buy the big one 6.7oz for my son he can always smell good for me and his wife truely loves it too...</li>
            <li>in addition to loving the fresh, clean smell of this cologne, it has easily garnered me more compliments than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>I quickly received the package.</li>
            <li>+ Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I must be one of the lucky ones because the one I got seems legit.</li>
            <li>I lucked out when I fell in love with a guy whose favorite cologne is the same as mine!</li>
            <li>I have worn many different colognes but I get more compliments when I wear this.  </li>
            <li>Have to douse myself and it still evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li>I was, candidly, very concerned that I might be buying some kind of knock-off and not the real Acqua Di Gio.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 and have purchased many high end colognes over</li>
            <li>This cologne smells fantastic, and I consistently get compliments when I wear it out.</li>
            <li>This is a subtle scent that women love, and find attractive.</li>
            <li>Amazon has had great prices and less hassle for our shopping.</li>
            <li>If you know the fragrance and want it, this is an economical way to get it quickly.</li>
            <li>Outside it is almost $20.00 more!</li>
            <li>Crisp and clean, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you like Acqua Di Gio, this size is amazing for the price, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on this cologne, my wife loves it, it brings me back to college days</li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite cologne and never gets old to me.</li>
            <li>and it is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I own about 8 - 12 different colognes at any given time.</li>
            <li>Actually larger bottle than expected great price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>has been my favorite I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 16 years old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny you will spend on it.</li>
            <li>it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I Just got another 6oz bottle because it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>and I liked it enough to order it for my husband.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I would say this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth the dollars</li>
            <li>It is pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other, but never receive quite as many compliments as I do on this.  </li>
            <li>Tried many different ones but keep buying a bottle of this for special occasions or even every day use.</li>
            <li>2 yes TWO squirts around my neck this morning, right under my turtleneck underarmor shirt, and after a 12 hour shift working in a warehouse i came home and every time i turn my head I can smell the fragrance</li>
            <li>I told her the name, and that she was right about it.</li>
            <li>He just doesn&#x27;t feel right without it.</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I feel blaming Amazon was not the right thing for me to do.</li>
            <li>All the men (heck, and women!) are huge fans of this particular fragrance, and I ordered this bottle on sale.</li>
            <li>I demand my money back and will gladly pay full price at ultra from now on</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t quite smell the same as my original bottle from a department store at a local mall where I originally tried the fragrance, loved it, and bought a large bottle.  </li>
            <li>True Acqua di Gio smells stronger and lasts much longer when applied to the body.</li>
            <li>My past experience with amazon.com has been great.</li>
            <li>This was a huge bottle and was actually bigger than I had anticipated but that is perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li>It still smells good, just not as strong, and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap trick to attract new customers and even existing customers to try perfumes from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The large 6.7 oz spray bottle lasted me 13 1/2 months!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most fresh smelling and classic scent on the market.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>scent is very masculine, and I think it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>problem with buying it from Amazon is it is very much diluted.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean, and I frequently get complements from wearing it.  </li>
            <li>got Acqua di Gio for a male friend and he claims it proved better than Viagra.</li>
            <li>First, buying perfume through internet is risky.</li>
            <li>Panties will drop ;) ...</li>
            <li>The photograph is for a 3.4 fluid ounce bottle even though the product description at the top of the page states that it is 6.7 ounces.</li>
            <li>so that was the first thing I checked when I received the product.  </li>
            <li>Very recommended!</li>
            <li>By the way , I already gave it to him as a gift ;)</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering, but it lasts the whole night through!</li>
            <li>Looks and smell like one but the fragrance doesnot last more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Came a day early (with prime free 2 day shipping)</li>
            <li>, it is not a fake.</li>
            <li>The first problem is the length the fragrance remains on the body.</li>
            <li>His first cologne</li>
            <li>Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani has been an all-time favorite for me since the last five-six years.</li>
            <li>This is better than any thing else I have tried, been using it for several years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to add that this is my first time purchase on amazon.com</li>
            <li>For the first day or two I thought it was just me</li>
            <li>Shipping was hella fast!</li>
            <li>Dudes actually comment on it more than woman</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Amazon should have this supplier inspected for surely sales of such item will hurt their reputation.</li>
            <li>, I want you - the reader - to be aware that what I received is a counterfeit perfume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, Amazon may or may not be aware of this (presence of counterfeits in their inventory).</li>
            <li>Most definitely will be back for more</li>
            <li>so we know exactly what it should smell like.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy and wear it everyday</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.com for a bit less than if I have to run to the department stores.  </li>
            <li>Super product, a branD new hot item I got fir more than 45% off regular retail price</li>
            <li>The price as right and delivered fast.</li>
            <li>First of all this cologne is top notch and if you have been using it since it came out like I have, you will know that it doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering blast for too long.  </li>
            <li>Always get positive comments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Been a long time favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I just love the smell of the cologne and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this item in the past with good results</li>
            <li>However I am confident that the bottle of Acqua Di Gio is the real thing; I have a bottle that I bought from a local big name retailer and was able to compare that bottle with the one purchased from Amazon and they look identical; I sprayed on some of the new bottle</li>
            <li>The 6.7 oz bottle is pretty huge and has been lasting me forever.  </li>
            <li>When I have purchesed it from the box stores I can only spray two times or it is too strong.  </li>
            <li>This is why you need to get a large bottle of this thing.</li>
            <li>I certainly appreciate the Lower price.</li>
            <li>Shop around online at the large department stores and get a discount code.  </li>
            <li>This is a large size of Eau De Toilette, I like to know I have it on hand and won&#x27;t run out soon.</li>
            <li>The price was close to what I paid for the large bottle at Fragrance.</li>
            <li>it is clean, fresh and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>di Gio is a very well known fragrance,</li>
            <li>very citrus...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!~</li>
            <li>The bottle came and was not broken and it arrived in time for Valentines day.</li>
            <li>Liz Claiborne Sport  D&amp;G Light Blue    </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product</li>
            <li>This is not the real one.</li>
            <li>I consider myself a real mens cologne connoisseur.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>can I say, I have a 2 year supply ... and btw, it ships fast even with prime</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is very fond of this scent.</li>
            <li>You really have to take some of these reviews with a grain of salt.  </li>
            <li>you are getting the real thing and not just some</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather they smell like Armani than Axe.</li>
            <li>Went to see about a return or bottle of real but its a flameable product</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li>I saw some complaints about this product not being the real thing.</li>
            <li>skip the headache and just go to your local Macy&#x27;s and touch, smell and enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is not the real cologne.</li>
            <li>This is not the real cologne.</li>
            <li>, I have bought a 1.7 ounce bottle in the mall for almost as much as the 6.7 ounce bottle I bought off amazon.</li>
            <li>This and D&amp;G Light Blue for Men are on my shelf at the moment.</li>
            <li>what REAL men use.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely a counterfeit cologne.  </li>
            <li>explained very well</li>
            <li>VERY strongly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i gotta say that my cologne is absolutely legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really need to investigate this.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product if you are wanting the REAL thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the real product.</li>
            <li>Very thanks&lt;</li>
            <li>it has no printing on the inside of the box as it should if it were real.</li>
            <li>Now I will go to Macys and buy the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and it looks like the real product (box and bottle)</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I did some research and a lot of fakes are almost identical to real ones.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>I did some research and a lot of fakes are almost identical to real ones.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing</li>
            <li>But after receiving the product, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is instantly recognizable for its cloying, sickly sweet middle tones.  </li>
            <li>Due to some of the comments and reviews I was concerned that this might not be the authentic product.</li>
            <li>The Acqua Di Gio cologne for men by Giorgio Armani has a fresh and crisp scent, is very invigorating when applied, and lasts for the entire work day.</li>
            <li>The price on the other hand is cheap!</li>
            <li>I would say he is more of alkaline than acidic in terms of sweat or other..</li>
            <li>It has anice country fresh smell that easily escapes from tight spaces.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the same size on sale from a reputable department store online, free shipping for LESS than the Amazon price.  </li>
            <li>Scent goes away after an hour its not worth the money, you are better off buying it off the street</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite, nothing beats this fragrance for formal or leisure events.  </li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>The price should come down so I can buy it more often.</li>
            <li>and I usually put more on at night since it only lasted a couple hours, so it ran out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Live this smell on my honey!</li>
            <li>My previous one was ordered from Macy&#x27;s and was much better.  </li>
            <li>Spending another 20 bucks extra at the local store will be much better.</li>
            <li>Timeless classic.</li>
            <li>It smells vaguely similar for a moment and fades extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure most people write these reviews when things go wrong but as of March 2014</li>
            <li>Before I used the same spray many times and the fragrance was very different.</li>
            <li>but apparently after reading the reviews everyone is saying exactly what I was experiencing,  I know gio as do any of the people who have used the real stuff</li>
            <li>This particular bottle size lasted me about two years.  </li>
            <li>This cologne just has this classic smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same quality and he smells so good (for less!).</li>
            <li>When i inquired and read some articles about perfumes being sold for low prices on amazon.com, I heard an interesting fact which is, Amazon usually buy a hell huge of products from the seller years ago and sells them once prices are u in the market.</li>
            <li>Was very surprised at the size of this bottle!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This scent is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Smells cool n sweet which I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long (i.e. a day at work)!</li>
            <li>I bought the large size 6.7oz Acqua Di Gio for men directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and its exactly the same and original product that one would buy at a local retailer.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal, any reviews regarding counterfeit versions are old and before Amazon stepped in and switched their supplier, because what I received in the mail was a scent that gets me complements from everyone, men and women.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t very sweaty but he sweats, he doesn&#x27;t naturally make body odor within a day or 2 of no shower.</li>
            <li>You almost feel obligated to buy the larger bottle just to get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is a fresh scent, but very masculine at the same time.</li>
            <li>You spray this on, and it smells right, but it does not last longer than the car ride to work.</li>
            <li>Not strong or overpowering like many scents can be.</li>
            <li>With my new bottle the scent is gone within the hour.  </li>
            <li>Ran out opened the new bottle today sprayed it on \\&quot;WTF\\</li>
            <li>Live and learn</li>
            <li>Smell like the guy from My New Haircut Video</li>
            <li>It is very big, making it a fantastic value compared to the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>It has the subtle citrus fragrance note that is so popular in colognes today.</li>
            <li>It has alcohol and slight lime scents for a somewhat strong aroma that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>I may be able to maybe find this for a few bucks less someplace, or more likely not,</li>
            <li>sold by amazon puts my mind at rest that it is not a fake from some 3rd party seller.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this for years, and I finally purchased a bottle......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I wanted and exactly the same as if I bought it from the store.</li>
            <li>Was paying for original product, but received a fake perfume priced as the authentic one.</li>
            <li>I know I am supposed to write a review on the actual fragrance, but I cant exactly explain the scent.</li>
            <li>From the first time I bought this cologne years ago, I always try to buy the same one.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne for my husband for the first time on a cruise last year.  </li>
            <li>Thought I was getting ripped off at first, but it actually cheaper than buying at Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Store.</li>
            <li>ou do not buy a car just by looking at the outside without first testing</li>
            <li>- I have bought this from major retailers directly and from Amazon - this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>cannot say that I am 100% sure that it is fake, but I am pretty certain that it is..</li>
            <li>After half an hour or so, the top notes vanished and my wrist was left with somewhat acrid odour -- like propanol or methanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This same bottle from Amazon takes 7-8 sprays just to be able to smell it, and usually needs a few more sprays to freshen the smell up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly aggressive, like lemon pledge gone bad.  </li>
            <li>This purchase has been a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>but i think the scent is a bit too common on many men.</li>
            <li>I think it must be old.</li>
            <li>I ordered the big bottle hoping it would be the real stuff, but I seem to have a knock off as well.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the cologne smelled old as well.</li>
            <li>&quot; it smells simmuler but not quite it and also has a funky alcohol smell when you first apply it also doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real Gio</li>
            <li>The key is to not use too much, like any cologne.</li>
            <li>Recommended if you want action.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy perfume from Amazon, even Amazon direct.  </li>
            <li>it took all of thirty minutes for the fragrance to nearly dissipate from my skin.</li>
            <li>The nozzle is to big for the real bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey to buy all at once, but for how long it lasts it ends up being pretty cost-effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a tip from a young lady 15 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it and getting nothing but compliments since.</li>
            <li>This product looks like the real thing but the smell is completely different.</li>
            <li>was his natural scent.</li>
            <li>Never gets old.</li>
            <li>I always have used this cologne and will continue to buy it until i grow old of it.</li>
            <li>Really does smell like rubbing alcohol &amp;&amp; the smell doesn&#x27;t last longer than 3 hours.</li>
            <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>It is a good fake as the batch numbers do match.</li>
            <li>When we lay down in bed it wasn&#x27;t too strong and definitely didn&#x27;t give off the old \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; smell (which for me, seems too \\&quot;techno\\&quot; or \\&quot;plastic\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>Okay, so much for the dramatic title.</li>
            <li>Girls love this fragrance, you will not go by without a compliment, seriously.</li>
            <li>and all I can say is an instant classic.  </li>
            <li>After reading some reviews on here before reordering, I learned that many people were saying that they got fake ones, even those ordered straight from Amazon (like mine)!  </li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this cologne there weren&#x27;t any issues at all, however, the second time around, I noticed the smell wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic cologne to wear in the summer or when you might work up a little sweat!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since back in high school.</li>
            <li>Large enough bottle to last my boyfriend for 1.5 years</li>
            <li>The second little matter, and probably just as important to durability of scent, is the low price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a very large bottle that I expect will last a very long time!</li>
            <li>Do your neighbors on the subway a major service and stop using this vile product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we expected!</li>
            <li>This was in sharp contrast to what the first CSE explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the advice of a woman at one of the major department stores, she recommended this one to me.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing Acqua Di Gio since it was first launched in 1996 and I have strong reason to believe that this product is fake.</li>
            <li>It was a super value for the size compared to what I paid previously for a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviews that may have involved a seller other than amazon, this Acqua di Gio is unarguably the genuine fragrance, genuine/unopened packaging.</li>
            <li>It doesnt last as long as real acqua di gio does.</li>
            <li>I barely have room on my bathroom sink for all the cologne..</li>
            <li>so i always come back to old faithful.</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s expensive; real men strive to please their ladies and this is one way they do it - they smell good and yes, it costs a few buck to do it.</li>
            <li>When I sprayed first time onto my wrist, I felt something odd.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend just spend the few extra bucks and buy at a mall or real place to get it.  </li>
            <li>Well, even on legitimate bottles, the smell is going to wear off in 10 minutes because your body&#x27;s olfactory nerves, the nerves responsible for smell, will send repeated amounts of sensory information to the brain, which then ignores that piece of sensory information due to the repetition of the smell.</li>
            <li>This product is a valuable addition to any man&#x27;s cologne stock pile as it offers a classy and refined scent that has long lasting effects.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be the price, but at $90.80 (free shipping), Amazon beats the department stores.</li>
            <li>I am sure every one will at least try once just coz of the 30$ difference on this product compared to other stores.</li>
            <li>The scent is slightly different and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as it normally does.</li>
            <li>I mean it is in the sweet smelling cologne its not in the Musk</li>
            <li>It does not last as long as my old bottle.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price as he usually pays this amount for the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>what some differences are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the obvious signs such as &amp;#34;Silver&amp;#34; (more reflective) letters on the front of the bottle checked out, the CLEAR tube instead of the FAKE white tube inside the bottle checked out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would suggest spending a few extra dollars and buying a cologne or perfume in person only after you smell it first.</li>
            <li>So use your common sense and either pay more at the department store or pay less here and trust</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the small bottle - go large!</li>
            <li>and I do not want to buy anything new other than Acqua.</li>
            <li>I did the test suggested by others, putting the Amazon version on on side of my body, on one arm, and the new one on the other.  </li>
            <li>the product is old stock or fake but this much I know for certain that the item has almost no aroma.</li>

            <li> Incredible smell, great deal on the larger size.</li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s perfect scent while passing all the security and  sophistication of an Armani, brings a lighter side of young people when you use.  </li>
            <li> Never found one I liked better.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing without being overwhelming.</li>

            <li> Awesome cologne, definitely my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and amazing cologne!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price!  </li>
            <li> As always, if the price is too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li> Sux too good of a price to be true</li>
            <li> Thought it may be too good to be true and it was.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light, clean smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very light maybe even a Ocean Spray Cologne to me</li>
            <li> Huge bottle of cologne!  </li>
            <li> And this HUGE bottle was a steal!</li>
            <li> I read so many comments about this product.</li>

            <li> 3.4 Oz at Sam&#x27;s Club was 10$ more than this 6.4 oz from amazon.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>

            <li> Thankfully, it&#x27;s the original and authentic product!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first time that I ever buy any perfume of any kind, and I love this!</li>
            <li> BE AWARE !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent experience with professional seller  Package new good condition and in time.looking forward to  do morebusiness.</li>
            <li> but everyone has their own option I&#x27;m into sweet smelling and musk</li>
            <li> I first heard about it in high school psychology class when my teacher was talking about the power of scent and mentioned that this cologne was rated one of the best smelling by females.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as product that I&#x27;ve bought at Dillard&#x27;s, but ok</li>
            <li> Refreshing, but not so strong that is offensive.  </li>
            <li> I was exceedingly happy with this purchase, and my husband was surprised that I bought it for him too!</li>
            <li> Fast friendly and great product</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> I love the light clean scent of Acqua Di Gio!</li>
            <li> The shipping worked perfectly and arrived on the day expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, lingering and sexy.</li>
            <li> so the ladies can&#x27;t  catch me, nothing like running fast and smelling good</li>
            <li> I loved the price and fast shipping, along with the smell.  </li>
            <li> Great Price super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I got it as a present and the person loved it!</li>
            <li> This cologne is not fake just like many reviews say!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great deal on such an amazing cologne!</li>
            <li> The price might be great on Amazon, but you end up using more to get the same result.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but recent one received was not that great</li>
            <li> Great and not overpowering for work but still extremely appealing on a date or romantic night out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly strong like an Arimis or Polo cologne which every moose up in Cananda can smell if you dab it on in Florida.  </li>
            <li> and it is not too strong or over powering.  </li>
            <li> Liked this very much.  </li>
            <li> This is a consistent amazing scent and a must have in any collection.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it was priced well and got to my house fast!</li>
            <li> A true timeless gem in the world of creative perfumery.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne, I use no other and really enjoy the pleasant citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> This cologne is the best hands down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;price is right shipped fast and smooth and smells great .</li>
            <li> Everything went fine, cheers</li>
            <li> Fine and heady manly scent</li>
            <li> Instead, if you can&#x27;t smell the cologne anymore, ask a friend or if you&#x27;re feeling bold, ask a stranger to smell you and they will be able to smell it.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED IN HUGE BOX AND WAS CHARGED SALES TAX COULD OF BOUGHT</li>
            <li> We got the HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li> Plus this bottle is huge...</li>
            <li> This is the perfume I wear always when I am going for important appointments.</li>
            <li> This was a great price on the larger bottle, and this is my go to cologne.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about some of the reviews mentioning that this was not a genuine product, but I don&#x27;t agree at all this product is of excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Love this fresh scent.</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself using a lot more however since the smell wasn&#x27;t as distinct as I remembered</li>
            <li> Plus he smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> This was genuine stuff.</li>
            <li> Genuine, I used colognes for years and  years</li>
            <li> The price I paid for this purchase was shockingly cheap for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> apologized and offered a free replacement.</li>
            <li> never a disappointment for sure</li>
            <li> Great Christmas present</li>
            <li> Fantastic shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great price thanks</li>
            <li> Smells original and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real Acqua Di Gio!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is just clean, fresh and not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a scent specialist or a fragrance expert, but what I smell is mainly a fresh and clean scent with refreshing hints of citrus and grassy</li>
            <li> He was excited to see the huge bottle he received.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a light, pleasant alternative for men to many of the other stuff on the market.  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this scent by Sephora and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for the past two years and it is the best ever, every one like it.</li>
            <li> , Acqui Di Gio is for you, if you want something unique to keep people guessing, I&#x27;d keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has always been my go to cologne and has never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Original sealed packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but remember you have to try it first......</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> At half price from the department stores this is a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Great product and lasts long!</li>
            <li> My wife likes the \\&quot;Clean scent\\</li>
            <li> It smalls so clean.</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, I am no expert, and cannot identify what aroma it releases, but all I can say is that most of the people I have hung out with, especially girls, have complimented me on this cologne, and it does that without overriding your senses!</li>
            <li> And this huge bottle will last me a good while. 5</li>
            <li> My husband likes it because its not too potent but still smells nice and last all day.</li>
            <li> Never had a scent that received more positive compliments from ladies.</li>
            <li> Yet completely suitable for an older gentlemen.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell and I love the large bottle.</li>
            <li> GREAT EXTRA LARGE bottle you can buy at about 75% off retail cost!  </li>
            <li> As expected, great price.</li>
            <li> It has light fresh fragrance which is soothing to the senses.</li>
            <li> Cool Water  </li>
            <li> What proof do you have that everything you read is true?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this product and would highly recommend this fragrance to anyone!</li>
            <li> For those who like a good perfume, that&#x27;s such an offer for</li>
            <li> good deal on the big size.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than retail, and this is my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It still smells good, but it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li> I have  been using Armani Acqua Di Gio for more than 3 years, and I am very familar with the scent.</li>
            <li> it was about 50 % off, (As I cant bring myself to pay full price for anything) and it arrived 2 days after my order confirmation.</li>
            <li> This item I bought is not the true GIO Product.  </li>
            <li> This item came pretty fast wrapped pretty good</li>
            <li> Full bottle sitting there.  </li>
            <li> I really just love it.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought one from Amazon when my supply ran out.  </li>
            <li> Too good to be true, save your money and buy the smaller bottle from the department store.</li>
            <li> The second time, I called up Amazon and they offered a full refund (which is good).</li>
            <li> I buy the big one 6.7oz for my son he can always smell good for me and his wife truely loves it too...</li>
            <li> in addition to loving the fresh, clean smell of this cologne, it has easily garnered me more compliments than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> I quickly received the package.</li>
            <li> + Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I must be one of the lucky ones because the one I got seems legit.</li>
            <li> I lucked out when I fell in love with a guy whose favorite cologne is the same as mine!</li>
            <li> I have worn many different colognes but I get more compliments when I wear this.  </li>
            <li> Have to douse myself and it still evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li> I was, candidly, very concerned that I might be buying some kind of knock-off and not the real Acqua Di Gio.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 and have purchased many high end colognes over</li>
            <li> This cologne smells fantastic, and I consistently get compliments when I wear it out.</li>
            <li> This is a subtle scent that women love, and find attractive.</li>
            <li> Amazon has had great prices and less hassle for our shopping.</li>
            <li> If you know the fragrance and want it, this is an economical way to get it quickly.</li>
            <li> Outside it is almost $20.00 more!</li>
            <li> Crisp and clean, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> If you like Acqua Di Gio, this size is amazing for the price, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on this cologne, my wife loves it, it brings me back to college days</li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite cologne and never gets old to me.</li>
            <li> and it is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I own about 8 - 12 different colognes at any given time.</li>
            <li> Actually larger bottle than expected great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> has been my favorite I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 16 years old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny you will spend on it.</li>
            <li> it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I Just got another 6oz bottle because it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> and I liked it enough to order it for my husband.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I would say this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth the dollars</li>
            <li> It is pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other, but never receive quite as many compliments as I do on this.  </li>
            <li> Tried many different ones but keep buying a bottle of this for special occasions or even every day use.</li>
            <li> 2 yes TWO squirts around my neck this morning, right under my turtleneck underarmor shirt, and after a 12 hour shift working in a warehouse i came home and every time i turn my head I can smell the fragrance</li>
            <li> I told her the name, and that she was right about it.</li>
            <li> He just doesn&#x27;t feel right without it.</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I feel blaming Amazon was not the right thing for me to do.</li>
            <li> All the men (heck, and women!) are huge fans of this particular fragrance, and I ordered this bottle on sale.</li>
            <li> I demand my money back and will gladly pay full price at ultra from now on</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite smell the same as my original bottle from a department store at a local mall where I originally tried the fragrance, loved it, and bought a large bottle.  </li>
            <li> True Acqua di Gio smells stronger and lasts much longer when applied to the body.</li>
            <li> My past experience with amazon.com has been great.</li>
            <li> This was a huge bottle and was actually bigger than I had anticipated but that is perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> It still smells good, just not as strong, and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap trick to attract new customers and even existing customers to try perfumes from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The large 6.7 oz spray bottle lasted me 13 1/2 months!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the most fresh smelling and classic scent on the market.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> scent is very masculine, and I think it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> problem with buying it from Amazon is it is very much diluted.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and clean, and I frequently get complements from wearing it.  </li>
            <li> got Acqua di Gio for a male friend and he claims it proved better than Viagra.</li>
            <li> First, buying perfume through internet is risky.</li>
            <li> Panties will drop ;) ...</li>
            <li> The photograph is for a 3.4 fluid ounce bottle even though the product description at the top of the page states that it is 6.7 ounces.</li>
            <li> so that was the first thing I checked when I received the product.  </li>
            <li> Very recommended!</li>
            <li> By the way , I already gave it to him as a gift ;)</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering, but it lasts the whole night through!</li>
            <li> Looks and smell like one but the fragrance doesnot last more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Came a day early (with prime free 2 day shipping)</li>
            <li> , it is not a fake.</li>
            <li> The first problem is the length the fragrance remains on the body.</li>
            <li> His first cologne</li>
            <li> Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani has been an all-time favorite for me since the last five-six years.</li>
            <li> This is better than any thing else I have tried, been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also like to add that this is my first time purchase on amazon.com</li>
            <li> For the first day or two I thought it was just me</li>
            <li> Shipping was hella fast!</li>
            <li> Dudes actually comment on it more than woman</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Amazon should have this supplier inspected for surely sales of such item will hurt their reputation.</li>
            <li> , I want you - the reader - to be aware that what I received is a counterfeit perfume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, Amazon may or may not be aware of this (presence of counterfeits in their inventory).</li>
            <li> Most definitely will be back for more</li>
            <li> so we know exactly what it should smell like.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy and wear it everyday</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.com for a bit less than if I have to run to the department stores.  </li>
            <li> Super product, a branD new hot item I got fir more than 45% off regular retail price</li>
            <li> The price as right and delivered fast.</li>
            <li> First of all this cologne is top notch and if you have been using it since it came out like I have, you will know that it doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering blast for too long.  </li>
            <li> Always get positive comments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Been a long time favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of the cologne and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item in the past with good results</li>
            <li> However I am confident that the bottle of Acqua Di Gio is the real thing; I have a bottle that I bought from a local big name retailer and was able to compare that bottle with the one purchased from Amazon and they look identical; I sprayed on some of the new bottle</li>
            <li> The 6.7 oz bottle is pretty huge and has been lasting me forever.  </li>
            <li> When I have purchesed it from the box stores I can only spray two times or it is too strong.  </li>
            <li> This is why you need to get a large bottle of this thing.</li>
            <li> I certainly appreciate the Lower price.</li>
            <li> Shop around online at the large department stores and get a discount code.  </li>
            <li> This is a large size of Eau De Toilette, I like to know I have it on hand and won&#x27;t run out soon.</li>
            <li> The price was close to what I paid for the large bottle at Fragrance.</li>
            <li> it is clean, fresh and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> di Gio is a very well known fragrance,</li>
            <li> very citrus...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!~</li>
            <li> The bottle came and was not broken and it arrived in time for Valentines day.</li>
            <li> Liz Claiborne Sport  D&amp;G Light Blue    </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product</li>
            <li> This is not the real one.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a real mens cologne connoisseur.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> can I say, I have a 2 year supply ... and btw, it ships fast even with prime</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very fond of this scent.</li>
            <li> You really have to take some of these reviews with a grain of salt.  </li>
            <li> you are getting the real thing and not just some</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather they smell like Armani than Axe.</li>
            <li> Went to see about a return or bottle of real but its a flameable product</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li> I saw some complaints about this product not being the real thing.</li>
            <li> skip the headache and just go to your local Macy&#x27;s and touch, smell and enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is not the real cologne.</li>
            <li> This is not the real cologne.</li>
            <li> , I have bought a 1.7 ounce bottle in the mall for almost as much as the 6.7 ounce bottle I bought off amazon.</li>
            <li> This and D&amp;G Light Blue for Men are on my shelf at the moment.</li>
            <li> what REAL men use.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely a counterfeit cologne.  </li>
            <li> explained very well</li>
            <li> VERY strongly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i gotta say that my cologne is absolutely legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really need to investigate this.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product if you are wanting the REAL thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the real product.</li>
            <li> Very thanks&lt;</li>
            <li> it has no printing on the inside of the box as it should if it were real.</li>
            <li> Now I will go to Macys and buy the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and it looks like the real product (box and bottle)</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I did some research and a lot of fakes are almost identical to real ones.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> I did some research and a lot of fakes are almost identical to real ones.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing</li>
            <li> But after receiving the product, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> It is instantly recognizable for its cloying, sickly sweet middle tones.  </li>
            <li> Due to some of the comments and reviews I was concerned that this might not be the authentic product.</li>
            <li> The Acqua Di Gio cologne for men by Giorgio Armani has a fresh and crisp scent, is very invigorating when applied, and lasts for the entire work day.</li>
            <li> The price on the other hand is cheap!</li>
            <li> I would say he is more of alkaline than acidic in terms of sweat or other..</li>
            <li> It has anice country fresh smell that easily escapes from tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the same size on sale from a reputable department store online, free shipping for LESS than the Amazon price.  </li>
            <li> Scent goes away after an hour its not worth the money, you are better off buying it off the street</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite, nothing beats this fragrance for formal or leisure events.  </li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> The price should come down so I can buy it more often.</li>
            <li> and I usually put more on at night since it only lasted a couple hours, so it ran out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Live this smell on my honey!</li>
            <li> My previous one was ordered from Macy&#x27;s and was much better.  </li>
            <li> Spending another 20 bucks extra at the local store will be much better.</li>
            <li> Timeless classic.</li>
            <li> It smells vaguely similar for a moment and fades extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure most people write these reviews when things go wrong but as of March 2014</li>
            <li> Before I used the same spray many times and the fragrance was very different.</li>
            <li> but apparently after reading the reviews everyone is saying exactly what I was experiencing,  I know gio as do any of the people who have used the real stuff</li>
            <li> This particular bottle size lasted me about two years.  </li>
            <li> This cologne just has this classic smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same quality and he smells so good (for less!).</li>
            <li> When i inquired and read some articles about perfumes being sold for low prices on amazon.com, I heard an interesting fact which is, Amazon usually buy a hell huge of products from the seller years ago and sells them once prices are u in the market.</li>
            <li> Was very surprised at the size of this bottle!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This scent is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells cool n sweet which I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long (i.e. a day at work)!</li>
            <li> I bought the large size 6.7oz Acqua Di Gio for men directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and its exactly the same and original product that one would buy at a local retailer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal, any reviews regarding counterfeit versions are old and before Amazon stepped in and switched their supplier, because what I received in the mail was a scent that gets me complements from everyone, men and women.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t very sweaty but he sweats, he doesn&#x27;t naturally make body odor within a day or 2 of no shower.</li>
            <li> You almost feel obligated to buy the larger bottle just to get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is a fresh scent, but very masculine at the same time.</li>
            <li> You spray this on, and it smells right, but it does not last longer than the car ride to work.</li>
            <li> Not strong or overpowering like many scents can be.</li>
            <li> With my new bottle the scent is gone within the hour.  </li>
            <li> Ran out opened the new bottle today sprayed it on \\&quot;WTF\\</li>
            <li> Live and learn</li>
            <li> Smell like the guy from My New Haircut Video</li>
            <li> It is very big, making it a fantastic value compared to the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> It has the subtle citrus fragrance note that is so popular in colognes today.</li>
            <li> It has alcohol and slight lime scents for a somewhat strong aroma that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I may be able to maybe find this for a few bucks less someplace, or more likely not,</li>
            <li> sold by amazon puts my mind at rest that it is not a fake from some 3rd party seller.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this for years, and I finally purchased a bottle......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I wanted and exactly the same as if I bought it from the store.</li>
            <li> Was paying for original product, but received a fake perfume priced as the authentic one.</li>
            <li> I know I am supposed to write a review on the actual fragrance, but I cant exactly explain the scent.</li>
            <li> From the first time I bought this cologne years ago, I always try to buy the same one.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for the first time on a cruise last year.  </li>
            <li> Thought I was getting ripped off at first, but it actually cheaper than buying at Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Store.</li>
            <li> ou do not buy a car just by looking at the outside without first testing</li>
            <li> - I have bought this from major retailers directly and from Amazon - this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> cannot say that I am 100% sure that it is fake, but I am pretty certain that it is..</li>
            <li> After half an hour or so, the top notes vanished and my wrist was left with somewhat acrid odour -- like propanol or methanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This same bottle from Amazon takes 7-8 sprays just to be able to smell it, and usually needs a few more sprays to freshen the smell up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly aggressive, like lemon pledge gone bad.  </li>
            <li> This purchase has been a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> but i think the scent is a bit too common on many men.</li>
            <li> I think it must be old.</li>
            <li> I ordered the big bottle hoping it would be the real stuff, but I seem to have a knock off as well.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the cologne smelled old as well.</li>
            <li> &quot; it smells simmuler but not quite it and also has a funky alcohol smell when you first apply it also doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real Gio</li>
            <li> The key is to not use too much, like any cologne.</li>
            <li> Recommended if you want action.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy perfume from Amazon, even Amazon direct.  </li>
            <li> it took all of thirty minutes for the fragrance to nearly dissipate from my skin.</li>
            <li> The nozzle is to big for the real bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey to buy all at once, but for how long it lasts it ends up being pretty cost-effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a tip from a young lady 15 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it and getting nothing but compliments since.</li>
            <li> This product looks like the real thing but the smell is completely different.</li>
            <li> was his natural scent.</li>
            <li> Never gets old.</li>
            <li> I always have used this cologne and will continue to buy it until i grow old of it.</li>
            <li> Really does smell like rubbing alcohol &amp;&amp; the smell doesn&#x27;t last longer than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It is a good fake as the batch numbers do match.</li>
            <li> When we lay down in bed it wasn&#x27;t too strong and definitely didn&#x27;t give off the old \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; smell (which for me, seems too \\&quot;techno\\&quot; or \\&quot;plastic\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> Okay, so much for the dramatic title.</li>
            <li> Girls love this fragrance, you will not go by without a compliment, seriously.</li>
            <li> and all I can say is an instant classic.  </li>
            <li> After reading some reviews on here before reordering, I learned that many people were saying that they got fake ones, even those ordered straight from Amazon (like mine)!  </li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this cologne there weren&#x27;t any issues at all, however, the second time around, I noticed the smell wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic cologne to wear in the summer or when you might work up a little sweat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since back in high school.</li>
            <li> Large enough bottle to last my boyfriend for 1.5 years</li>
            <li> The second little matter, and probably just as important to durability of scent, is the low price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a very large bottle that I expect will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Do your neighbors on the subway a major service and stop using this vile product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we expected!</li>
            <li> This was in sharp contrast to what the first CSE explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the advice of a woman at one of the major department stores, she recommended this one to me.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing Acqua Di Gio since it was first launched in 1996 and I have strong reason to believe that this product is fake.</li>
            <li> It was a super value for the size compared to what I paid previously for a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews that may have involved a seller other than amazon, this Acqua di Gio is unarguably the genuine fragrance, genuine/unopened packaging.</li>
            <li> It doesnt last as long as real acqua di gio does.</li>
            <li> I barely have room on my bathroom sink for all the cologne..</li>
            <li> so i always come back to old faithful.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s expensive; real men strive to please their ladies and this is one way they do it - they smell good and yes, it costs a few buck to do it.</li>
            <li> When I sprayed first time onto my wrist, I felt something odd.</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommend just spend the few extra bucks and buy at a mall or real place to get it.  </li>
            <li> Well, even on legitimate bottles, the smell is going to wear off in 10 minutes because your body&#x27;s olfactory nerves, the nerves responsible for smell, will send repeated amounts of sensory information to the brain, which then ignores that piece of sensory information due to the repetition of the smell.</li>
            <li> This product is a valuable addition to any man&#x27;s cologne stock pile as it offers a classy and refined scent that has long lasting effects.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the price, but at $90.80 (free shipping), Amazon beats the department stores.</li>
            <li> I am sure every one will at least try once just coz of the 30$ difference on this product compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> The scent is slightly different and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as it normally does.</li>
            <li> I mean it is in the sweet smelling cologne its not in the Musk</li>
            <li> It does not last as long as my old bottle.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price as he usually pays this amount for the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> what some differences are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the obvious signs such as &amp;#34;Silver&amp;#34; (more reflective) letters on the front of the bottle checked out, the CLEAR tube instead of the FAKE white tube inside the bottle checked out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest spending a few extra dollars and buying a cologne or perfume in person only after you smell it first.</li>
            <li> So use your common sense and either pay more at the department store or pay less here and trust</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the small bottle - go large!</li>
            <li> and I do not want to buy anything new other than Acqua.</li>
            <li> I did the test suggested by others, putting the Amazon version on on side of my body, on one arm, and the new one on the other.  </li>
            <li> the product is old stock or fake but this much I know for certain that the item has almost no aroma.</li>
            <li> First bottle arrived cracked and half empty, smells like it&#x27;s diluted with alcohol</li>
            <li> I have been using Aqua Di Gio since it first came out in the mid to late 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The smell is somewhat similar but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the one I buy from Macys which makes me believe this is a glorified duplicate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, if sprayed on clothing, don&#x27;t expect it to last long, cologne is for the skin, spraying on the warmer parts of your body like the inner elbows, backs of knees, wrists, neck, and chest</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> 2 spritzes last all day long even after working up a sweat!</li>
            <li> Does not last long!</li>
            <li> The smell last for a really long time!</li>
            <li> When examining the bottle and closely to my old one that was purchased from Macy&#x27;s in Los Angeles, there are slight differences in the quality of the printing and</li>
            <li> I guess the only thing I&#x27;d ask is it me made a bit stronger but not much..</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for a long time now.</li>
            <li> I know this perfume long time ago.</li>
            <li> its manly, but not old man-ish.</li>
            <li> product was on sale for roughly the same price as the 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Well, This was choice of perfume for a long long time now.</li>
            <li> Very watered down!!!  </li>
            <li> I usually pay the same thing for half as much</li>
            <li> I am not sure what some other people are talking about when reviewing this item and calling it not being real.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this \\&quot;Gio\\&quot; or whatever it is when i started getting real low on my other bottle.</li>
            <li> I can not tell if the product is original or fake because in the beginning the smell is the same to my other bottles befor.</li>
            <li> also a bit pricey compared to other similar ones like Euphoria by Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years now and get compliments every single time I wear it.</li>
            <li> If you open the product they will hold you liable for the sellers dishonesty&lt;br /&gt;and not refund you due to opening the product.</li>
            <li> Well I have been very hesitant after reading the fake cologne reviews on this cologne, after all spending almost $100 on cologne ain&#x27;t no joke, so I went ahead and googled fake Acqua Di Gio and the video with most views</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple years ago and still have almost half the bottle left!</li>
            <li> Also, i requested to have the price hidden because it was a gift, and the price was not hidden and the person I got it for even commented on the price, which of course is why it was supposed to be hidden.</li>
            <li> This one is apparently not original, starting with the box.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BE A VICTIM!</li>
            <li> Though nowadays, it is turning out to be very common, especially amongst young adults.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smaller sprayer diameter instead of the fake bottles larger diameter checked out, but make sure you don&#x27;t freak out if you don&#x27;t have a fake one to compare it</li>
            <li> the item I got was not the one I expected.</li>
            <li> Bit on the expensive side but every bit worth the price.</li>
            <li> not very alcoholly</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent $85 and wondering if I could return and get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has no smell at all, not real Acqua Di Gio.</li>
            <li> bought this a few years ago at the department store, and ever since then the online purchases just don&#x27;t hold the same smell, It just fades quickly.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Because I spent $100 on it and it only holds for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Everyone says how tired this scent is, but it is my go to scent for compliments when I mix it with a decent aftershave and a spritz of YSL Opium for men</li>
            <li> It was slightly cheaper than if I had purchased it in a big name dept store, and I got it just a few days after placing the order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the longest lasting scent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper than usual and a bigger quantity as well.</li>
            <li> the worst part is amazon does not do returns with hazardous material!</li>
            <li> It appears to smell correct, so I am assuming the other reviews may have been from before?  </li>
            <li> that work extremely well together.  </li>
            <li> It is not a counterferit product like other revewiers mentioned.</li>
            <li> Unlike other fragrances, it is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> lasting perfume smell goes away is not authentic to me</li>
            <li> all the money spent for this down the drain.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is not right and needs to be examined.</li>
            <li> That one even came with the extra little kit of items like aftershave and shower gel for not much more cash than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was scared about fake cologne, but I got the real deal.</li>
            <li> The downfall, however, is the fact that the 3.4 oz bottle is certainly not worth the price when considering the price of the 6.7 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> and it still was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Such fakes looks common.</li>
            <li> One of my 2 son&#x27;s favorites [other being Play by Givenchy]!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed with my most recent order.  </li>
            <li> I think the 6.7 oz is ridiculous big amount of cologne.</li>
            <li> recommend it because the aroma and evidences the persistence like previous editions he had bought .</li>
            <li> I read a previous review about how he/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid $55 for half the size</li>
            <li> Everything down to serial number stickers appear to be legitimate except for two little issues.</li>
            <li> This stuff I ordered smells like a watered down version and the smell is gone after a few mins..  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;However you are relegated the bad guy if you do so and your claim will ultimately be denied and stuck with the high cost for a counterfeit item.</li>
            <li> so I was a little sketch on this order but figured it was coming from amazon</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for a little over a year</li>
            <li> Read reviews for this product AFTER I had made my order, so I was a little concerned.</li>
            <li> I wanted to file a complaint with amazon&#x27;s customer service, they simply refused to file a complaint against counterfeit perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for a few years.</li>
            <li> So I guess that the parfum is really old or was stored wrong.</li>
            <li> and he wears it nearly everyday.  </li>
            <li> The bottle seems to contain a version which is heavy on alcohol with an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, he was nearly out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched scents a few times and the compliments seem to dissappear</li>
            <li> The only other comparable colognes would be Gucci by Gucci, Gucci Guilty &amp; Pour Homme by Versace.</li>
            <li> Once I looked online and saw the other reviews I realized it likely was a fake.  </li>
            <li> So apparently some people have been receiving fake acqua di gio cologne.</li>
            <li> Not only is the product being sold by Amazon a fake, also check out the photograph on this page and compare it to the product description.</li>
            <li> she received a fake version of the actual stuff</li>
            <li> past the fragrance lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Although you can get away with wearing it year round!</li>
            <li> I showed the perfume at a local perfume store &amp; they did confirm that the one I received is fake.</li>
            <li> that I am not satisfied with.</li>
            <li> I can usually smell him from across the room</li>
            <li> I am not sure weather</li>
            <li> I bought this one from Amazon, not from my usual place (sephora) not for the price difference, but to try how amazon fares in perfumes.</li>
            <li> I usually hunt the sales and wait to get it then.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with a big bottle for the amount of price.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from Macy&#x27;s all the time.</li>
            <li> I suspected this was not genuine as I thought the smell was weak.</li>
            <li> The package is one pound and it is about 2 and a half times the size of the smaller one.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad price either since Macy&#x27;s  charges about 130 for it.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> youd be hard pressed to know i even wore cologne.</li>
            <li> For the first time i ordered a perfume from Amazon which is a serious crap.</li>
            <li> I chose this article because it is a fragrance I&#x27;ve been using at least 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> well at least you wont stink.</li>
            <li> It sucks and</li>
            <li> I was hesitant with some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> read some of the other reviews on Amazon about people getting fake bottles of perfume and cologne they bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I order couple of other perfumes as well from amazon and those are FAKE as well.</li>
            <li> thought it was me, but now I read all these reports of the same thing, it is a fake!  </li>
            <li> This makes me wonder what other products are fake being sold by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I always, I mean always get compliments on this cologne.</li>
            <li> Even after a ridiculous number of spray (6-8)</li>
            <li> The price is considerably less expensive than buying it in a reatil store.</li>
            <li> Product is not good</li>
            <li> Regret wasting my hard earn money on this bottle of junk!</li>
            <li> For people who like the following fragrances, you will not be disappointed in purchasing this one:    </li>
            <li> I wanted to try again with 200ml bottle for this low price and was disappointed once again.</li>
            <li> I thought when I got this it was really weak smelling and lasted like two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have to spray six times and then it is still too weak.  </li>
            <li> I mean literally!</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> The insane, enduring popularity of this cologne absolutely confounds me.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> The plastic on the squirting part of the lid is broken.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it is a fake.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this scent, and I have never met a single lady who didn&#x27;t comment</li>
            <li> People were complaining that their perfume wouldn&#x27;t last, that it was fake, that it was crap...</li>
            <li> It smelled terrible and the packaging was old, I almost felt I bought something used.</li>
            <li> Wow I got a fake product, smell awful.</li>
            <li> Although expensive, this stuff covers the rank smell of my skunk wrestling fetish that I engage in every morning while it&#x27;s still dark.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly but has very weak fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is very weak.  </li>
            <li> you might get bored with it, or it might not match your skin scent...</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it!</li>
            <li> Bought one from Amazon 2 years ago and it was fake one.</li>
            <li> Armani is one brand you can&#x27;t go wrong with</li>
            <li> There are some people out there who purposely say it is fake just so it will scare you away from buying it here and go to the department store and purchase it</li>
            <li> I felt there was something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be fake.</li>
            <li> You can not and will not go wrong wearing this cologne.  </li>
            <li> The perfume they send, is a fake one.</li>
            <li> I decided to ignore my suspicions, though, not wanting to believe it was a fake, and maybe it was my memory</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on fake this fake that... I decided to just buy it.  </li>
            <li> If the numbers dont match it is fake...</li>
            <li> Just expensive, but it always is.</li>
            <li> Can not go wrong with this cologne</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to use this but i think the scent is a bit too common on many men. I got this since my cousin wanted it. He loves it. I think the 6.7 oz is ridiculous big amount of cologne.</li>
            <li> I read so many comments about this product. People were complaining that their perfume wouldn&#x27;t last, that it was fake, that it was crap... I decided to gamble on it and I guess I hit jackpot. I got a great product, great smell that lasts, and it was very affordable too.&lt;br /&gt;Acqua di Gio is a very well known fragrance, very citrus... If you enjoy citrus, this is a good choice. Unless you know for sure that you will love this product (I had used it before), don&#x27;t buy the biggest one. you might get bored with it, or it might not match your skin scent...</li>
            <li> The best cologne I&#x27;ve ever had. Georgio Armani makes an epoch product here. My wife and I both love the scent and it&#x27;s long lasting. My only complaint would be the price, but at $90.80 (free shipping), Amazon beats the department stores. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the other reviews on Amazon about people getting fake bottles of perfume and cologne they bought on Amazon. That concerned me, prompting me to do some research. I found out that authentic bottles of cologne and perfume have a serial number engraved in the bottom of the box and a matching serial number on the bottom of the bottle. So look for that. Also, some of the reviewers said the smell wears off in 10 minutes on their \\&quot;fake\\&quot; bottles. Well, even on legitimate bottles, the smell is going to wear off in 10 minutes because your body&#x27;s olfactory nerves, the nerves responsible for smell, will send repeated amounts of sensory information to the brain, which then ignores that piece of sensory information due to the repetition of the smell. Instead, if you can&#x27;t smell the cologne anymore, ask a friend or if you&#x27;re feeling bold, ask a stranger to smell you and they will be able to smell it. As always, if the price is too good to be true, it probably is. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son, this is all that he will wear and he just loves it.  It&#x27;s not too strong of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this scent for 15+ years and I never get tired of it!</li>
            <li> when  i wear this stuff i have to drink an extra glass of prune juice so the ladies can&#x27;t  catch me, nothing like running fast and smelling good</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great price thanks</li>
            <li> Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 6.7 Ounces Just what I wanted for father&#x27;s day</li>
            <li> Great! Fast shipping, Great price</li>
            <li> got Acqua di Gio for a male friend and he claims it proved better than Viagra. I think he&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> Best smell ever for men&#x27;s perfume! Highly recommend it!~</li>
            <li> Great deal, excellent product, valued Seller, highly recommended A++</li>
            <li> I chose this article because it is a fragrance I&#x27;ve been using at least 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;I love their fragrance and this purchase meets my expectations .&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it because the aroma and evidences the persistence like previous editions he had bought .</li>
            <li> This is the perfume I wear always when I am going for important appointments. It has light fresh fragrance which is soothing to the senses. It is not obstrusive and does not irritate. This is really a wonderful perfume from the house of Armani.</li>
            <li> Received this product and there was yellow crust on the inside of the cap. I think it must be old. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the tester that got from a department store. It still smells good, just not as strong, and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> I did not even know you could get a bottle of 6.7 ounces so I was a little sketch on this order but figured it was coming from amazon and I would get what I paid for.  The bottle came and was not broken and it arrived in time for Valentines day.</li>
            <li> First, buying perfume through internet is risky. Even though there were many sellers offering in Amazon, I ordered the one sold by Amazon LLC. I quickly received the package. when i opened the box, I found the wrap around the perfume box is open at the bottom. Anybody who received in this condition should immediatley return it. I still give it a chance thinking Amazon would not cheat. When I use the perfume, I have the smell only when I put it on. Then gone. I would still buy things from Amazon but would not buy perfume through internet anymore.</li>
            <li> Have used this cologne for years. one of the top fragrances produced. When I wear this cologne I am always being told that it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes, and finding an 8 ounce bottle for $90 was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews that may have involved a seller other than amazon, this Acqua di Gio is unarguably the genuine fragrance, genuine/unopened packaging. I personally recommend the best value 6.7 FL Oz presentation.    For people who like the following fragrances, you will not be disappointed in purchasing this one:    Cool Water  Liz Claiborne Sport  D&amp;G Light Blue    This is a fresh scent, but very masculine at the same time. Girls love this fragrance, you will not go by without a compliment, seriously. This is why you need to get a large bottle of this thing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband. I love it, he loves it, ladies in his office love it.  Not overpowering but smells divine!  I have migraines and can&#x27;t be in the room when my husband sprays it on,  but as the scent mellows on his skin does not cause headaches or nausea.  Yea!  Oh, and did I mention is smells heavenly?</li>
            <li> This is not the real one. I have been using this perfume for a few years. Bought one from Amazon 2 years ago and it was fake one. I stopped buying this perfume online and tried with another online store and it was awesome. Mostly I buy it from perfume stores. I wanted to try again with 200ml bottle for this low price and was disappointed once again. This perfume does not even stay for 2 hours in your body. that&#x27;s  really bad.This time I simply asked them for refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume and I do not want to buy anything new other than Acqua. I will never buy perfume online again. Spending another 20 bucks extra at the local store will be much better.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a real mens cologne connoisseur. I barely have room on my bathroom sink for all the cologne..this is by far my favorite. The smell is just clean, fresh and not too overwhelming. I guess the only thing I&#x27;d ask is it me made a bit stronger but not much..pretty perfect scent. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I too have been had by Amazon.  I ordered the big bottle hoping it would be the real stuff, but I seem to have a knock off as well.  I have been using this cologne for 10 years, and it has always lasted me throughout the day.  With my new bottle the scent is gone within the hour.  Very disappointed, and sick to my stomach over wasting $80.</li>
            <li> A great parfume and  this 6.7 ponces presentation is great,i love it,ill buy it again and again,great for all people</li>
            <li> I felt that I rec&#x27;d a great price on this item.  It was shipped quickly and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> all the money spent for this down the drain.</li>
            <li> Very happy with price and delivery</li>
            <li> ARRIVED IN HUGE BOX AND WAS CHARGED SALES TAX COULD OF BOUGHT IT BUY MY HOME FOR CHEAPER DO NOT BUY NOT WORTTH MONEY</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.  The scent is a light, pleasant alternative for men to many of the other stuff on the market.  I have been happily using Acqua De Gio for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here on Amazon couldn&#x27;t be beat locally.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne. I&#x27;ve been using this since back in high school. Tried many different ones but keep buying a bottle of this for special occasions or even every day use. Panties will drop ;) ... well at least you wont stink.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my father in law, he really love it, he always loved that scent, it will take forever to use it up for him..great gift</li>
            <li> Best fragrance I have used. the price for the quantity is a steal. sold by amazon puts my mind at rest that it is not a fake from some 3rd party seller.</li>
            <li> Love it and a great buy will buy again when needed From the this same seller.&lt;br /&gt;Good good good good good good good good good good Thanks</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat $75.xx for a 200ml bottle of Acqua Di Gio. Anyone who has used this perfume before knows how good it is.</li>
            <li> The product came very fast, and in perfect condition.  It was a super value for the size compared to what I paid previously for a smaller bottle. I was exceedingly happy with this purchase, and my husband was surprised that I bought it for him too!</li>
            <li> Been using GIO for  some time now, Buying smallest bottle which was very expensive at Walgreens Pharmacy. I certainly appreciate the Lower price. will continue to use and buy this item from you.</li>
            <li> We got the HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite cologne. The best price we have found online</li>
            <li> Timeless classic. Armani is one brand you can&#x27;t go wrong with and this is their best yet. No doubt will remain one of the best perfumes there ever was.</li>
            <li> BE AWARE !!! Another fake perfume from AMAZON!! i have order this  because of low price (sold directely from amazon) and when i received perfume it was BIG disappinment !! Smell only last for five minuit compared to the one i bought from Macy&#x27;s it last couple of days. I order couple of other perfumes as well from amazon and those are FAKE as well. i ended up returning to amazon. WAST OF TIME!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne, I use no other and really enjoy the pleasant citrus scent.  Woman love it as well which is why I wear it.  A little expensive but well worth it.  Issey Miyake is close but this is still the leader.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne.  Best price we could find.  Will order it again.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and impressive.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as if it&#x27;s 99% alcohol.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the longest lasting scent.  Get the 6.7 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne, definitely my new favorite. It does wear off a bit quicker than others, but for the price it&#x27;s a great special occasion cologne.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of fake knockoff&#x27;s that lose smell in an hour, there are many that even have an alcohol smell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, I have a 2 year supply ... and btw, it ships fast even with prime, it says it takes a while longer to process ... that is simply because the item comes encased in bubble wrap that could even withstand the 300 LB mailman jumping on it.  (no offense)</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for 7 years now and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne before, and saw a great deal here on amazon. I read the reviews and was scared about fake cologne, but I got the real deal. I was amazed at the size of it for the price. Go to dept store you will pay same price for a third the size of this bottle. Thank you amazon.</li>
            <li> My step dad loved this gift! Smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;a fake!!!!!! Do not buy it!!!!!The bottle have a srange smell and the perfume smell like chemical stuff.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and amazing cologne!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very fond of this scent. This is a very large bottle that I expect will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle of cologne!  It was perfect for what my husband was wanting.  Good price too. I will purchase through Amazon again.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect birthday gift for my boyfriend!  Definitely worth the price as he usually pays this amount for the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments on this</li>
            <li> My favorite smelling cologne. Fair price</li>
            <li> First of all this cologne is top notch and if you have been using it since it came out like I have, you will know that it doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering blast for too long.  The smell is there if you smell your skin but it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you! That doesn&#x27;t mean it is a fake.  You really have to take some of these reviews with a grain of salt.  There are some people out there who purposely say it is fake just so it will scare you away from buying it here and go to the department store and purchase it so they make money.  What proof do you have that everything you read is true?  So use your common sense and either pay more at the department store or pay less here and trust you are getting the real thing and not just some hyped up review to scare you away.</li>
            <li> Genuine product, very happy. This is double the size that Sam&#x27;s Club sells for about the same price.</li>
            <li> Not only is the product being sold by Amazon a fake, also check out the photograph on this page and compare it to the product description. The photograph is for a 3.4 fluid ounce bottle even though the product description at the top of the page states that it is 6.7 ounces. What a rip off. Shame on you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for myself, I got so frustrated. I should have read the reviews before I purchased this. I felt there was something wrong with it. It smelled terrible and the packaging was old, I almost felt I bought something used. The smell of the cologne smelled old as well.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a better smelling man-stench than Armani Acqua di Gio. Definitely going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple years ago and still have almost half the bottle left! It&#x27;s my favorite cologne and never gets old to me.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne for men that I always buy for my husband. This was a huge bottle and was actually bigger than I had anticipated but that is perfectly fine.  I read a previous review about how he/she received a fake version of the actual stuff so that was the first thing I checked when I received the product.  The product I received was an authentic bottle of Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani.  So I was pleased with that since I was hesitant about buying it after reading that review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this product and would highly recommend this fragrance to anyone!</li>
            <li> I didnt like it,after spraying within 15 minutes,its gone;no smell of an 80 dollars cologne</li>
            <li> Smells great! It&#x27;s one of my teenagers favorite scents. They also like Versace Signature and Eau My by George Takei. I&#x27;d much rather they smell like Armani than Axe.</li>
            <li> One of my 2 son&#x27;s favorites [other being Play by Givenchy]! Says it drives the girls crazy:)Not too fruity, perfumey or overpowering. 2 spritzes last all day long even after working up a sweat!</li>
            <li> This was the best deal I have seen on this product.  It was way beyond the club prices.</li>
            <li> Sux too good of a price to be true I ordered this \\&quot;Gio\\&quot; or whatever it is when i started getting real low on my other bottle. Ran out opened the new bottle today sprayed it on \\&quot;WTF\\&quot; it smells simmuler but not quite it and also has a funky alcohol smell when you first apply it also doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real Gio this is JUNK . Went to see about a return or bottle of real but its a flameable product so can&#x27;t return it so stuck with a 90$ bottle of S***. I hope this helps someone. THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. I was first introduced to this scent by Sephora and fell in love with it. The downfall, however, is the fact that the 3.4 oz bottle is certainly not worth the price when considering the price of the 6.7 oz bottle. You almost feel obligated to buy the larger bottle just to get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> My style. Very recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> very pleased, priced right!!!</li>
            <li> Ladies love it. Enough said...</li>
            <li> It was a good buy and wear it everyday</li>
            <li> This seems to be fake. I have been using this cologne for a long time now. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;In past the fragrance lasted all day. I suspect this is a knock off.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great quality!</li>
            <li> Super product, a branD new hot item I got fir more than 45% off regular retail price but you gotta look for it!! Overall this is awesomeness!!</li>
            <li> Been a long time favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Worn this for over a year now. Get compliments from everyone and personally love the aroma.</li>
            <li> I met my boyfriend when he was using it.. I just felt in love! LOL ..The best smell ever for a man! 100% recommended. By the way , I already gave it to him as a gift ;)</li>
            <li> + Delivery was quick. I received it in 5 days even though the tracking info said 2 weeks.  +arrived in a good condition    - It deosn&#x27;t quite smell the same like the one i bought at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aqua Di Gio since it first came out in the mid to late 90&#x27;s and it is by far my favorite scent. Very citrusy and delicious but not overbearing. I believe it is best worn in the warmer months though. Although you can get away with wearing it year round!</li>
            <li> Great cologne, worth the price. I saw some complaints about this product not being the real thing. Don&#x27;t listen to that stuff - I have bought this from major retailers directly and from Amazon - this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> For those who like a good perfume, that&#x27;s such an offer for it&#x27;s cheaper than usual and a bigger quantity as well. I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The minute I sprayed it on myself I could tell something was not rite. It sucks and the worst part is amazon does not do returns with hazardous material! I&#x27;m taking a second look b4 I buy anything on amazon, if I choose to buy here!</li>
            <li> Why would you but this anywhere else?  I&#x27;ve paid $55 for half the size everytime I&#x27;ve purchased this until now!</li>
            <li> perfect gift for a father&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;price is right shipped fast and smooth and smells great . I reccomend this for every man who like to smell great</li>
            <li> I own about 8 - 12 different colognes at any given time. No matter what I buy, this gets the most compliments.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Not as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Actually larger bottle than expected great price! A+</li>
            <li> Fake!!! Only smells for 1 hour</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received nothing but compliments from the scent of this cologne.  It&#x27;s not overly strong like an Arimis or Polo cologne which every moose up in Cananda can smell if you dab it on in Florida.  My wife likes the \\&quot;Clean scent\\&quot; it emits and the ladies in a hospital where I work always ask \\&quot;what&#x27;s that cologne you&#x27;re wearing?  God I love it! It smells sooooooo good\\&quot;.  You can not and will not go wrong wearing this cologne.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  The large 6.7 oz spray bottle lasted me 13 1/2 months!  Exceptional value.  Don&#x27;t buy the small bottle - go large!</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it was priced well and got to my house fast! I got it as a present and the person loved it!</li>
            <li> I first heard about this for years, and I finally purchased a bottle......and all I can say is an instant classic.  Not overpowering.  Balanced and Refreshing, lasts for hours, great for spring and summer...fall.  I would hesitate to purchase this from Amazon.com, as I would purchase from Macy&#x27;s just because of authenticity of the product, you dont want to receive bad/fake/rancid cologne.  skip the headache and just go to your local Macy&#x27;s and touch, smell and enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very watered down!!!  I would not recommend buying this from Amazon.  True Acqua di Gio smells stronger and lasts much longer when applied to the body.</li>
            <li> The perfume they send, is a fake one. I tried to contact seller for their answer, but without any response. I showed the perfume at a local perfume store &amp; they did confirm that the one I received is fake.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Great price.</li>
            <li> women love this-- i walk by and they get closer---lol see if im kidding, shorty picked this out for me. its great</li>
            <li> I will never order from amazon again. I had a giftcard and it still was not worth it. This is not the real cologne. Thought it may be too good to be true and it was. This is not the real cologne. It smells vaguely similar for a moment and fades extremely quickly. By the time i get to work youd be hard pressed to know i even wore cologne.</li>
            <li> This is one of those colognes that stands the test of time. It is a lighter scent that still gets compliments even though it has been around forever.</li>
            <li> This was a great price on the larger bottle, and this is my go to cologne. To sum up...great scent...wife loves it...enough said!</li>
            <li> Was very surprised at the size of this bottle!  It is very big, making it a fantastic value compared to the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> Awesome value, and a great smell, I have bought a 1.7 ounce bottle in the mall for almost as much as the 6.7 ounce bottle I bought off amazon.</li>
            <li> Although expensive, this stuff covers the rank smell of my skunk wrestling fetish that I engage in every morning while it&#x27;s still dark.</li>
            <li> The insane, enduring popularity of this cologne absolutely confounds me.  It is instantly recognizable for its cloying, sickly sweet middle tones.  It&#x27;s incredibly aggressive, like lemon pledge gone bad.  Do your neighbors on the subway a major service and stop using this vile product.</li>
            <li> My son has worn Acqua Di Gio for years. It smalls so clean. He says the ladies love it too.  This is a really big bottle. He buys a smaller one for travel, but likes this size for home as he puts it on every day.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for the past two years and it is the best ever, every one like it.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells fantastic, and I consistently get compliments when I wear it out. The scent is not overpowering, but it lasts the whole night through!</li>
            <li> This product is a family favorite among the males.  With the great product and excellent customer service, you can&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase. Arrived ontime in perfect condition and the best is that this fragance lasts all day. I was concerned about some of the reviews mentioning that this was not a genuine product, but I don&#x27;t agree at all this product is of excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Great price and delivered quickly</li>
            <li> Great price and delivered on time!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT IF FOR MY BOY-FRIEND AND HE LOVES IT</li>
            <li> Is this same as the one which i get in store as sample , I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;This may be a diluted version</li>
            <li> Makes a statement without overpowering. This is a cologne for men that don&#x27;t need a potent fragrance to overwhelm anyone. This is a subtle scent that women love, and find attractive. If you aren&#x27;t looking for AXE or TAG adolescent type colognes, this gentlemen&#x27;s cologne will enhance, not smother your personality.</li>
            <li> Every where I go people ask what I have on. This is definitely  a multicultural cologne. This smells the best of all the Armani colognes I own and I own almost all of them.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother-in-law, this is the only cologne he uses. (I think he buys a larger size bottle around Christmas time, but this is the largest I could find.) I have a smaller bottle and I like the scent quite a bit. The key is to not use too much, like any cologne. This and D&amp;G Light Blue for Men are on my shelf at the moment.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of colognes and own scores of top of the line ones myself. Over the years that I&#x27;ve been studying, using and exploring men&#x27;s colognes, this is without doubt amongst the best that I have seen. A true timeless gem in the world of creative perfumery. Thank you Mr. Armani for this wonderful gift to the world of men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li> Looks and smell like one but the fragrance doesnot last more than an hour. which means its either fake or it is diluted one!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted me to get this, so I did, and she loves it...good deal on the big size. Recommended if you want action.</li>
            <li> Love this fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best available colognes for men anywhere at any price. I just love the smell of the cologne and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Definitely buying again</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;THE&amp;#34; best smelling cologne there is. Never had a scent that received more positive compliments from ladies. I would also recommend Clinique Happy for Men cologne as well.</li>
            <li> It appears to smell correct, so I am assuming the other reviews may have been from before?  The only thing I would state is the difference in staying power of the cologne.  If you walk into Macys and buy this, the smell lasts for hours upon hours.  You spray this on, and it smells right, but it does not last longer than the car ride to work.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as product that I&#x27;ve bought at Dillard&#x27;s, but ok</li>
            <li> great product at a great price.  This is a great deal for any one who likes this fragrance.  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite. Always order a bottle of GIO for his birthday, eatery year. You cannot beat the price. Outside it is almost $20.00 more!</li>
            <li> what REAL men use.  Of course it&#x27;s expensive; real men strive to please their ladies and this is one way they do it - they smell good and yes, it costs a few buck to do it.</li>
            <li> I can not tell if the product is original or fake because in the beginning the smell is the same to my other bottles befor. My problem is that the smell stays only for a couple minuts. So I guess that the parfum is really old or was stored wrong.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a counterfeit cologne.  Scent lasts about 2 seconds.  I will only by cologne from a department store from now on.</li>
            <li> Well I have been very hesitant after reading the fake cologne reviews on this cologne, after all spending almost $100 on cologne ain&#x27;t no joke, so I went ahead and googled fake Acqua Di Gio and the video with most views explained very well what some differences are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the obvious signs such as &amp;#34;Silver&amp;#34; (more reflective) letters on the front of the bottle checked out, the CLEAR tube instead of the FAKE white tube inside the bottle checked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller sprayer diameter instead of the fake bottles larger diameter checked out, but make sure you don&#x27;t freak out if you don&#x27;t have a fake one to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And overall the BIGGEST test.  I sprayed a total of 2 yes TWO squirts around my neck this morning, right under my turtleneck underarmor shirt, and after a 12 hour shift working in a warehouse i came home and every time i turn my head I can smell the fragrance VERY strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure most people write these reviews when things go wrong but as of March 2014 i gotta say that my cologne is absolutely legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to you guys amazon shoppers. Save some money and buy with confidence, amazon is back on track with their quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell,  5 out of 5!</li>
            <li> Another great price for an item that is costly any where else.</li>
            <li> I bought the 6.7 ounce bottle a while back from Amazon and something felt off on it.  It didn&#x27;t quite smell the same as my original bottle from a department store at a local mall where I originally tried the fragrance, loved it, and bought a large bottle.  That one even came with the extra little kit of items like aftershave and shower gel for not much more cash than Amazon.  I decided to ignore my suspicions, though, not wanting to believe it was a fake, and maybe it was my memory that was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself using a lot more however since the smell wasn&#x27;t as distinct as I remembered and I usually put more on at night since it only lasted a couple hours, so it ran out very quickly.  After reading some reviews on here before reordering, I learned that many people were saying that they got fake ones, even those ordered straight from Amazon (like mine)!  They suggested doing a test with a reputable store bought one.  OK, that&#x27;s a great idea.  So I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the same size on sale from a reputable department store online, free shipping for LESS than the Amazon price.  It came yesterday.  I did the test suggested by others, putting the Amazon version on on side of my body, on one arm, and the new one on the other.  I did not tell my wife this.  10 hours later, I come home as ask my wife to smell both arms.  What do you smell here? Nothing!  Here?  Nice cologne!  The claims in the one star reviews were true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you go.  Don&#x27;t buy perfume from Amazon, even Amazon direct.  It seems they are reselling fakes at the premium price.  Shop around online at the large department stores and get a discount code.  Amazon is great when it comes to most items, but with perfumes I can just no longer trust them.  They really need to investigate this.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on fake this fake that... I decided to just buy it.  I was quite disappointed when I sprayed it on and tried it out but I thought and didn&#x27;t smell a thing... sprayed it on some more... nothing.. WELP, you were warned!!</li>
            <li> Large enough bottle to last my boyfriend for 1.5 years and he wears it nearly everyday.  Plus he smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smells sooooooo good!!! I love it on my husband!</li>
            <li> Whoever said this was not the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing can go jump in a lake. It&#x27;s what I wanted and exactly the same as if I bought it from the store.</li>
            <li> Compare the number on the bottom of the bottle to the number on the bottom of the box. If the numbers dont match it is fake... just like the bottle i received.</li>
            <li> I usually pay the same thing for half as much but this was a great deal. This is the best smelling cologne ever!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne is my favorite makes the girls go nuts has been my favorite I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 16 years old and I&#x27;m 31 now cannot think of a better scent</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than retail, and this is my favorite fragrance.  Lots of compliments from the ladies.  What else matters? Hmmm?</li>
            <li> The best cologne ever!!!! I have worn this for years now and get compliments every single time I wear it. It&#x27;s worth every penny you will spend on it.</li>
            <li> If you like Acqua Di Gio, this size is amazing for the price, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on this cologne, my wife loves it, it brings me back to college days but it has a very delightful scent. Great for any occasion. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to scent for 15 years. I have a couple of others I mix into my routine, but this is the one I reorder time and time again. I&#x27;m not a scent specialist or a fragrance expert, but what I smell is mainly a fresh and clean scent with refreshing hints of citrus and grassy&lt;br /&gt;notes that work extremely well together.  Try it and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> Came a day early (with prime free 2 day shipping) Smells AMAZING, it is not a fake. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was genuine stuff. Google for the signs (the embossed batch # on box and label, tube color, etc) of a real vs fake. My wife loves the smell and I love the large bottle. This will last me some time!</li>
            <li> The price as right and delivered fast.</li>
            <li> I bought the large size 6.7oz Acqua Di Gio for men directly from Amazon. The shipping worked perfectly and arrived on the day expected. Due to some of the comments and reviews I was concerned that this might not be the authentic product. However I am confident that the bottle of Acqua Di Gio is the real thing; I have a bottle that I bought from a local big name retailer and was able to compare that bottle with the one purchased from Amazon and they look identical; I sprayed on some of the new bottle and it also passes the test. So, I am 100% satisfied in this purchase with Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of cologne.  I have been wearing this for years.  Great buy.  Just expensive, but it always is.</li>
            <li> I Love how it smells and also it&#x27;s a great price for the bottle size I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Value for money on Amazon. My wife likes the smell. Switched from Polo to this brand last year.</li>
            <li> This has been my preferred spray for over 5 years, it has gotten me alot of compliments over the years.</li>
            <li> Excellent experience with professional seller  Package new good condition and in time.looking forward to  do morebusiness.</li>
            <li> Excelent Perfum. I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he smells so GOOD!!  This is my all time most favorite men&#x27;s cologne ever!</li>
            <li> Can not go wrong with this cologne</li>
            <li> This is a large size of Eau De Toilette, I like to know I have it on hand and won&#x27;t run out soon. Not a size that you can carry on to an airplane flight.</li>
            <li> clearly fake from smell and bottle.. i wish i had done research before i purchased. Go to a reputable store and get this product.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product if you are wanting the REAL thing. I&#x27;ve had the real product. THIS IS NOT It! Everything down to serial number stickers appear to be legitimate except for two little issues. However, shortly after your initial use of this product, you&#x27;ll understand what I&#x27;m trying to convey to the consumer in this message.The first problem is the length the fragrance remains on the body. Even after a ridiculous number of spray (6-8) it took all of thirty minutes for the fragrance to nearly dissipate from my skin. The second little matter, and probably just as important to durability of scent, is the low price for such a large bottle. Too good to be true, save your money and buy the smaller bottle from the department store. You will get what you pay for there.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light, clean smelling cologne. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 8yrs. Amazon has the best price for the big bottle too. The first time I ordered this cologne there weren&#x27;t any issues at all, however, the second time around, I noticed the smell wasn&#x27;t the same. It could be because I purchased this during the summer months and where I&#x27;m from it can be 100 degrees plus. I&#x27;m going to give the company the benefit of the doubt since I know heat can change the chemistry of the smell. It still smells good, but it&#x27;s just not the same. I will still use it though because the price is great! Plus, it was left on my porch in the scorching heat for about 4 hours before I could get to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for over 14 years. I first heard about it in high school psychology class when my teacher was talking about the power of scent and mentioned that this cologne was rated one of the best smelling by females. Haven&#x27;t looked back since!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smells great and isn&#x27;t too powerful</li>
            <li> Everyone says how tired this scent is, but it is my go to scent for compliments when I mix it with a decent aftershave and a spritz of YSL Opium for men</li>
            <li> the item I got was not the one I expected. I have  been using Armani Acqua Di Gio for more than 3 years, and I am very familar with the scent. The Acqua Di Gio that l got from you doesn&#x27;t smell as same as the one I am used to use. I am not happy with this at all. I don&#x27;t think this is the real Acqua Di Gio!!! I got it from amazon.com</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son... His first cologne and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I buy this for my man continuously before it runs out.</li>
            <li> Fast friendly and great product</li>
            <li> I love this scent. The price is considerably less expensive than buying it in a reatil store. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent so I am getting it for him for Father&#x27;s Day.  It is the second bottle of the same fragrance I have gotten for him.  He is finicky about what he likes and doesn&#x27;t like so I am glad to know that this fragrance suits him.</li>
            <li> Great perfume - stays all day even in summer. Bit on the expensive side but every bit worth the price. Wife loves it too :)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product is fake. Before I used the same spray many times and the fragrance was very different. This one is apparently not original, starting with the box. The fragrance disappears on your body after 5 minutes (as if u did not use a perfume). Was paying for original product, but received a fake perfume priced as the authentic one. Don&#x27;t recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I am happy. I know this perfume long time ago. Some day a lady ask me about the name of this perfume, because she told me that the perfume smelled very good. I told her the name, and that she was right about it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my husband smell. Great product! Would definitely buy it again for him. Definitely recommend this product...</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I just learned about this product. I&#x27;m 55 and have purchased many high end colognes over the years adn for somereason never had this on my radar. I was reading men&#x27;&#x27;s cologne reviews online and this kept coming up as an all time fav so I bought some. What-the-heck! Why didn&#x27;t anyone tell me about it sooner? This stuff is da bomb! I love the light clean scent of Acqua Di Gio! My oldest son saw the bottle and said \\&quot;I&#x27;ve been wanting this for years!\\&quot;  So I gave it to him and a couple weeks later bought myself another bottle since I just can&#x27;t do without it now. It immediately has becomemyfavorite.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite, nothing beats this fragrance for formal or leisure events.  Recommended to all men who want to smell good!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one....it&#x27;s prob. the best cologne out there.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used. Get a lot of comments</li>
            <li> My girlfriend LOVES this cologne.  It lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> I have to say...in addition to loving the fresh, clean smell of this cologne, it has easily garnered me more compliments than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve worn. Outstanding!</li>
            <li> This stuff if AMAZING. All the men (heck, and women!) are huge fans of this particular fragrance, and I ordered this bottle on sale. it was about 50 % off, (As I cant bring myself to pay full price for anything) and it arrived 2 days after my order confirmation. Fast, and in perfect condition. LOVE LOVE LOVE..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I know I am supposed to write a review on the actual fragrance, but I cant exactly explain the scent. its manly, but not old man-ish. Yet completely suitable for an older gentlemen. not very alcoholly and the scent lasts all day. YUM :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item in the past with good results but I&#x27;m very disappointed with my most recent order.  The bottle seems to contain a version which is heavy on alcohol with an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> I like this product very well, the sailer good too! ! ! Very thanks&lt;br /&gt;Very well for my family and house!</li>
            <li> Have you smelled it? No? Go to a department store and try a tester. One whiff of this stuff and you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani has been an all-time favorite for me since the last five-six years. To be completely honest, I am no expert, and cannot identify what aroma it releases, but all I can say is that most of the people I have hung out with, especially girls, have complimented me on this cologne, and it does that without overriding your senses! Though nowadays, it is turning out to be very common, especially amongst young adults. The only other comparable colognes would be Gucci by Gucci, Gucci Guilty &amp; Pour Homme by Versace. It can only be improved by decreasing the price!</li>
            <li> Genuine, I used colognes for years and  years and I had this one before.</li>
            <li> The Acqua Di Gio cologne for men by Giorgio Armani has a fresh and crisp scent, is very invigorating when applied, and lasts for the entire work day. It has the subtle citrus fragrance note that is so popular in colognes today. The Acqua Di Gio cologne for men by Giorgio Armani is an excellent grooming product, and I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> As it should be, no complaints.</li>
            <li> This product is fake. It doesnt last as long as real acqua di gio does. it has no printing on the inside of the box as it should if it were real. The nozzle is to big for the real bottle. It is a good fake as the batch numbers do match. I contacted the seller who is giorio armani (supposedly) and just questioned the authenticity of the product and instead of responding they just immediately refunded so I am guessing they know its fake. Glad for the refund though. Now I will go to Macys and buy the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this scent, and have been using it for a couple of years now.  The 6.7 oz bottle is pretty huge and has been lasting me forever.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey to buy all at once, but for how long it lasts it ends up being pretty cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very masculine, and I think it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is better than any thing else I have tried, been using it for several years. A bit expensive but well worth it. Amazon has it at a lot better price than you will get it any where else.</li>
            <li> The only product I use.</li>
            <li> I thought when I got this it was really weak smelling and lasted like two minutes.  I just put up with it, thought it was me, but now I read all these reports of the same thing, it is a fake!  Come on Amazon!  This makes me wonder what other products are fake being sold by Amazon.  I will not buy anything else that is a consumable from Amazon.  Too risky, just lost 87 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have used Acqua Di Gio for a couple years and this is NOT Acqua Di Gio! I received this as a gift and it looks like the real product (box and bottle) but it smells completely different. I would suggest spending a few extra dollars and buying a cologne or perfume in person only after you smell it first.</li>
            <li> I got a tip from a young lady 15 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it and getting nothing but compliments since. I still get asked what scent I&#x27;m wearing. Smells nice without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years now and always used to buy from Macys. This time I bought from Amazon.com as it was $15-20 cheaper but I must confess the smell doesn&#x27;t last longer. The smell is somewhat similar but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the one I buy from Macys which makes me believe this is a glorified duplicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent $85 and wondering if I could return and get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that this is my first time purchase on amazon.com that I am not satisfied with. My past experience with amazon.com has been great.</li>
            <li> Smells like alcohol.  This is not the smell I was going for. Lol. Live and learn I suppose. Suggest you buy this wonderful scent,just not from here.  Get it from Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The 6.7 oz. product was on sale for roughly the same price as the 3.4 oz bottle. It arrived as the advertised product, and it smells great! It has alcohol and slight lime scents for a somewhat strong aroma that doesn&#x27;t linger. It&#x27;s a fantastic cologne to wear in the summer or when you might work up a little sweat!</li>
            <li> A request from my son - he loves the fragrance.</li>
            <li> GREAT EXTRA LARGE bottle you can buy at about 75% off retail cost!  this is a timeless sexy scent that any man will want to wear! Second time ordering!  great value!</li>
            <li> I recommend this cologne. From the first time I bought this cologne years ago, I always try to buy the same one.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years now and still buy GIO women love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> At half price from the department stores this is a very good deal. Packaged well. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> The plastic on the squirting part of the lid is broken. Hopefully it continues to work!</li>
            <li> My husband uses only this.  Clean fresh smell.  Always gets compliments from the ladies.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for a little over a year and it smells wonderful. Crisp and clean, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described. Great product and lasts long!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it it is a rip off</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne. I mean literally! He just doesn&#x27;t feel right without it. I love the scent as well. Amazon has had great prices and less hassle for our shopping. Thanks</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good!</li>
            <li> Scent goes away after an hour its not worth the money, you are better off buying it off the street</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s perfect scent while passing all the security and  sophistication of an Armani, brings a lighter side of young people when you use.  Love it</li>
            <li> This was the best deal I found on this anywhere!! I have bought this cologne several times.... This was the best deal HANDS DOWN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to buy it again and this deal is no where to be found?!?!? :(</li>
            <li> 6.7 fluid oz for only 70 bucks! Wow! One kick ass deal that makes my hubby smell like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love this scent. I get tons of compliments on this scent and have yet to find a woman that doesn&#x27;t like this smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with buying it from Amazon is it is very much diluted. I bought this from a department store and 3-4 sprays could last an entire day. This same bottle from Amazon takes 7-8 sprays just to be able to smell it, and usually needs a few more sprays to freshen the smell up at the end of the day. The price might be great on Amazon, but you end up using more to get the same result. Buy this product, just buy it some place else.</li>
            <li> Smells great for the summer</li>
            <li> My husband likes this fragrance.  The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This was an anniversary gift for my husband.  I loved the price and fast shipping, along with the smell.  He loved the cologne itself!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne. The price I paid for this purchase was shockingly cheap for the size of the bottle. This cologne smells amazing and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Good price, great value.  I reorder as I use it up.  I don&#x27;t have more to say, but the system required more.</li>
            <li> I gifted this to my love.. He loves this perfume.. I&#x27;m satisfied bcz he is happy.. I Loved it.. Thankx</li>
            <li> Seems ok to me. But what do I know??</li>
            <li> Beware. This item is fake. If you&#x27;ve bought this product before from a department store, you&#x27;ll be able to immediately tell that it&#x27;s counterfeit.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal, any reviews regarding counterfeit versions are old and before Amazon stepped in and switched their supplier, because what I received in the mail was a scent that gets me complements from everyone, men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acqua Di Gio gets respect from men and the most appropriate term would be appreciation from women. May this help on a date or in a club? Probably, but it&#x27;s simply a very pleasant scent almost anyone will enjoy when around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very famous and most people I know recognized it by name when they noticed it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to be the freshest person in the room, Acqui Di Gio is for you, if you want something unique to keep people guessing, I&#x27;d keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, some reviews mention that the scent goes away after a while and this indicates a fraudulent product, but anything you spray on yourself, your nose adapts to and I&#x27;ve actually asked when I stopped smelling it if my coworker could, and she could. Only I couldn&#x27;t smell it, but it was there. Also, if sprayed on clothing, don&#x27;t expect it to last long, cologne is for the skin, spraying on the warmer parts of your body like the inner elbows, backs of knees, wrists, neck, and chest help your body heat amplify the scent.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> One of the best Men fragrances ever made. Believe it -  it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Ok.  Stupid me bought this product in the 3.4 Oz.  For the first day or two I thought it was just me but apparently after reading the reviews everyone is saying exactly what I was experiencing,  I know gio as do any of the people who have used the real stuff and we all know 1 spray of the authentic smells great and lasts for days..  This stuff I ordered smells like a watered down version and the smell is gone after a few mins..  Highly highly recommend just spend the few extra bucks and buy at a mall or real place to get it.  Very dissapointed in my $65 waste of time product through amazon.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, however, i requested a gift note \\&quot;Just Because :)\\&quot; and it was not with the package. Also, i requested to have the price hidden because it was a gift, and the price was not hidden and the person I got it for even commented on the price, which of course is why it was supposed to be hidden.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for the first time on a cruise last year.  We bought another bottle this year.  It is the best smelling cologne ever for a man.  He wore it to the market last week and 2 women in the Deli followed us all the way to Produce just to see what the name of the cologne he was wearing was named.  Now that is how you can tell it smells good!</li>
            <li> My grandson  is a senior and he loves the smell as well as the girls.</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne and a fantastic price. I constantly get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This item I bought is not the true GIO Product.  I would like to get a refund.  How do I do this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Martin</li>
            <li> Great smell. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells cool n sweet which I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long (i.e. a day at work)! also a bit pricey compared to other similar ones like Euphoria by Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is all I use anymore. I get more compliments on this than any I have ever used</li>
            <li> I suspected this was not genuine as I thought the smell was weak. Once I looked online and saw the other reviews I realized it likely was a fake.  I&#x27;m going to try to get a refund, but this item cant be returned so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> This product is a valuable addition to any man&#x27;s cologne stock pile as it offers a classy and refined scent that has long lasting effects.</li>
            <li> This Giorgio Armani fragrance has been a favorite for my husband. It has to be one of the number one selling men&#x27;s fragrances. I purchased this through Amazon because it was cheaper to buy it through Amazon than Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Never found one I liked better. My friends often remark: &amp;#34;You smell good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than: &amp;#34;You stink!&amp;#34; LOL&lt;br /&gt;Worth the expensive price I pay.</li>
            <li> very good product as described by the seller</li>
            <li> My brother love this Gio</li>
            <li> Order was processed over 2 weeks ago. Order is still not yet received. SOLD BY SCAMMERS DO NOT BE A VICTIM!</li>
            <li> My favorite.  Fast shipping and good price!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells original and so far so good. It&#x27;s been about year and it still smells well.</li>
            <li> Great deal on our favorite cologne!</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite cologne. Shipping was hella fast!</li>
            <li> This product has no smell at all, not real Acqua Di Gio.</li>
            <li> It was a great price for the amount we got, this is my husbands favorite and it is not too strong or over powering.  Dudes actually comment on it more than woman</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! I bought it for my boyfriend and he loves it. The scent is amazing without being overwhelming. The price on amazon is much better than any of the stores I went to. You get much more of the cologne for this price than you would at a department store.</li>
            <li> Has anyone taken theirs to a store to check if it&#x27;s legit? I&#x27;m waiting for my 6.7oz bottle for men to be delivered, but after reading some reviews I&#x27;m worried. It would be so embarrassing to give this as a gift and turns out being fake. I did some research and a lot of fakes are almost identical to real ones. Just have to wait and see, I guess.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing on my boyfriend. Not too heavy but very manly. I can usually smell him from across the room but it&#x27;s not overpowering. Makes me randy... Haha</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. What can I say. The price should come down so I can buy it more often.</li>
            <li> This item came pretty fast wrapped pretty good but when I smelled it it wasn&#x27;t a fragrance a men should wear so I started letting everybody I knew smell it and they agreed that it smells like something a woman would wear</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep my hands off my man when he puts this stuff on... LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> I Just got another 6oz bottle because it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Everything went fine, cheers</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume..</li>
            <li> It show up an is really good</li>
            <li> Smell like the guy from My New Haircut Video</li>
            <li> Happy birthday my love</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002U6DIPQ Giorgio Armani &#x27;Acqua Di Gio&#x27; Men&#x27;s 6.7-ounce EDT Spray]]  the perfume arrived broken, that bad is that I paid $ 94.82 for this perfume, this is a hoax. Do not buy more at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Incredible smell, great deal on the larger size. My girlfriend loves it, and I constantly get compliments on my scent when I wear it.</li>
            <li> a great smelled product!  Every man should be wearing this scent!  this is my favorite cologne of all on my man!</li>
            <li> Fine and heady manly scent&lt;br /&gt;This one will turns heads for any man wearing it&lt;br /&gt;A good one to add to any collection of colognes</li>
            <li> Journal this Bourke is $100+ and the price we abashed for was perfect! This stuff lasts! Great qualiy mens  cologne!</li>
            <li> Acqua Di Gio is a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I need more!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I love this scent on my husband. It&#x27;s light, lingering and sexy. Not at all overpowering. I&#x27;ve always purchased it at the mall or, every once in a while, at the airport between flights. Either way, I would definitely recommend the fragrance. Great for day time and night time.</li>
            <li> i smell so wonderful now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and this is an amazing price...will continue buying it here!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this scent, and I have never met a single lady who didn&#x27;t comment oh how amazing I smell, lol.</li>
            <li> Great scent at a great price!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we expected!</li>
            <li> Almost non-existent smell. This purchase has been a great disappointment. I am not sure weather the product is old stock or fake but this much I know for certain that the item has almost no aroma. Amazon should have this supplier inspected for surely sales of such item will hurt their reputation. Next time will shop elsewhere for such product.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s what matters. I got a scratch &amp; sniff in the mail from Macy&#x27;s and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve used Drakkar for years, and like that also, but it was time for a change. The price was much better than from Macy&#x27;s, and the service was awesome as always. A happy wife is a happy life...</li>
            <li> It does not last as long as my old bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered 200 ml bottle this month.  It arrived promptly but has very weak fragrance.  My previous one was ordered from Macy&#x27;s and was much better.  The problem is that Amazon won&#x27;t allow to return because it is considered hazardous liquid. You are better off ordering from Macy&#x27;s.com.  They let you return if there is a problem</li>
            <li> Liked this very much.  A friend was wearing it and I liked it enough to order it for my husband.  Not strong or overpowering like many scents can be.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the bottle and it&#x27;s a great deal and don&#x27;t regret it at all thank you once again</li>
            <li> I bought this one from Amazon, not from my usual place (sephora) not for the price difference, but to try how amazon fares in perfumes. But, alas!, what a bad experience did I have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this one within a week or so. When I sprayed first time onto my wrist, I felt something odd. It smelled very differently from that of the the ADG I was used to. After half an hour or so, the top notes vanished and my wrist was left with somewhat acrid odour -- like propanol or methanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day I called up amazon, the customer service exec. apologized and offered a free replacement. I stupidly agreed to it. The replacement took one more week to reach me. But frankly, it smelled the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I want you - the reader - to be aware that what I received is a counterfeit perfume. Such fakes looks common. The second time, I called up Amazon and they offered a full refund (which is good). But I wasted an inordinate amount of time and effort (and expectation) in this whole buying exercise. I should have stuck with sephora.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wanted to file a complaint with amazon&#x27;s customer service, they simply refused to file a complaint against counterfeit perfume. The guy clarified that Amazon.com does not have a process to accept complaints regarding the genuineness of the products they sell. This was in sharp contrast to what the first CSE explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Amazon may or may not be aware of this (presence of counterfeits in their inventory). I am never buying a perfume from Amazon again. You are warned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Edit : Even though I mentioned I would never buy perfumes from Amazon, I bought two [[ASIN:B000E7STWK Burberry Brit By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces]]  and [[ASIN:B0009OAGZ6 Burberry By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces]]. These two are awesome perfumes and would recommend to anyone. In retrospect, I feel blaming Amazon was not the right thing for me to do. They do have good perfumes,but not all the perfumes they have are good.</li>
            <li> My husband always uses this cologne.  He was excited to see the huge bottle he received.  This scent is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. I have been using it for 10+ years. The only stuff I use.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite cologne</li>
            <li> Awesome price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am not sure what some other people are talking about when reviewing this item and calling it not being real.  This item is sold and shipped by AMAZON.  The item arrived on time and its exactly the same and original product that one would buy at a local retailer.</li>
            <li> Full bottle sitting there.  Its fake</li>
            <li> This is by far the most fresh smelling and classic scent on the market.  This has always been my go to cologne and has never disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried many other, but never receive quite as many compliments as I do on this.  If you&#x27;ve never tried it it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Most definitely will be back for more</li>
            <li> Great price and my wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> So apparently some people have been receiving fake acqua di gio cologne. I must be one of the lucky ones because the one I got seems legit. I purchased my last bottle from macys and i still had it to compare this one to. Every thing is identical (font, box color, cap, dimensions, etc.). The serial number on the box matched the serial number on the bottom of the cologne (which is one of the ways to tell if it is authentic).  The delivery was quick and packaged very well. I hope this helps future buyers.</li>
            <li> First bottle arrived cracked and half empty, smells like it&#x27;s diluted with alcohol fades in minutes,  replacement bottle box was clearly open and the lid had been cracked as if someone took it off I demand my money back and will gladly pay full price at ultra from now on</li>
            <li> Best price hands done for this great fragrance. 3.4 Oz at Sam&#x27;s Club was 10$ more than this 6.4 oz from amazon. Original sealed packaging.</li>
            <li> I picked this because I tested it at Macey&#x27;s, DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME SMELL. I CAN NOT RETURN IT, SO I&#x27;M STUCK WITH IT. SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT FROM MACEY&#x27;S,</li>
            <li> Has anyone taken theirs to a store to check if it&#x27;s legit? I&#x27;m waiting for my 6.7oz bottle for men to be delivered, but after reading some reviews I&#x27;m worried. It would be so embarrassing to give this as a gift and turns out being fake. I did some research and a lot of fakes are almost identical to real ones. Just have to wait and see, I guess.</li>
            <li> I just like this cologne</li>
            <li> This is one bottle of fragrance I replace as soon as the old bottle is halfway empty. A staple on the nightstand.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant with some of the negative reviews. Im happy I purchased, my husband smells good.</li>
            <li> I buy the big one 6.7oz for my son he can always smell good for me and his wife truely loves it too...never a disappointment for sure</li>
            <li> The package is one pound and it is about 2 and a half times the size of the smaller one.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad price either since Macy&#x27;s  charges about 130 for it.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, good size, perfect item.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so amazing! I lucked out when I fell in love with a guy whose favorite cologne is the same as mine! And this HUGE bottle was a steal!</li>
            <li> Excellent product great price. Very satisfied with this item</li>
            <li> Great Christmas present,  Recipient loved it</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> FAKE! smell goes away in minutes. I spray 10 sprays and 4 minutes later I can&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li> This cologne is not fake just like many reviews say! My husband has used this same cologne for 10 years now and this one is no different than the one in Macy&#x27;s. The price on the other hand is cheap! Thanks for the great deal on such an amazing cologne!</li>
            <li> Should of listened to the reviews. This product looks like the real thing but the smell is completely different. Purchased for my husband, this is the only cologne he has worn for years so we know exactly what it should smell like. Very disappointed, won&#x27;t be buying cologne or purfume of Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Does not last long! A bit Disappointed! Because I spent $100 on it and it only holds for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Okay, so much for the dramatic title. I met my husband back in &#x27;10 and I could&#x27;ve sworn this was his natural scent. When we lay down in bed it wasn&#x27;t too strong and definitely didn&#x27;t give off the old \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; smell (which for me, seems too \\&quot;techno\\&quot; or \\&quot;plastic\\&quot;). My husband isn&#x27;t very sweaty but he sweats, he doesn&#x27;t naturally make body odor within a day or 2 of no shower. I would say he is more of alkaline than acidic in terms of sweat or other..things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes lie beside him and I could smell it even after 5-6 hrs, he doesn&#x27;t bathe in it for sure..so it is just a lingering scent. If you go to bed without showering it will definitely still smell on you. I would say this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love The Size &amp; I love the smell as well as many others who have complimented me on both! Lol!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance, and I love it on him.  The price was close to what I paid for the large bottle at Fragrance.Net.  I feel we got a great deal!</li>
            <li> Love the smell get compliment all day. what can I say, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I have worn many different colognes but I get more compliments when I wear this.  it is clean, fresh and lasts a long time.  A bit pricey but via Amazon this is the cheapest.  Way to go.  I love this stuff but remember you have to try it first......it (like any cologne or especially perfume) smells different on different people.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but recent one received was not that great and I got allergic to it. Something wrong may be.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this scent by my female friend. I&#x27;ve been buying it regularly and always get compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s pretty strong but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I want to be honest this to me is more of a water-based cologne. I mean it is in the sweet smelling cologne its not in the Musk it&#x27;s a very light maybe even a Ocean Spray Cologne to me I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but everyone has their own option I&#x27;m into sweet smelling and musk this is a category on its own.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of colognes for different occasions but this is a staple for me. If you had just one cologne that you wanted to be universal in all situations this would be it. Great and not overpowering for work but still extremely appealing on a date or romantic night out. This is a consistent amazing scent and a must have in any collection.</li>
            <li> Nice price and authentic</li>
            <li> As expected, great price.</li>
            <li> It smells really great. The bottel looks really good. Got it as a gift and the person really liked it.</li>
            <li> Aqua Di Gio is my favorite cologne and I have been wearing it for 15 years.  I really just love it.</li>
            <li> this is not product that i thought.I apply lotion and scent does not last even an hour. i fell stolen</li>
            <li> Great product - no issues.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Fantastic shipping.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Came on time. And this huge bottle will last me a good while. 5 out of 5</li>
            <li> Been using GIO forever. Its my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my first time that I ever buy any perfume of any kind, and I love this! The fragrance is perfect, not too strong or too light. The smell last for a really long time! I tried by spray it on my wrist and then take a shower, but the fragrance still remain after the entire day. It is not a counterferit product like other revewiers mentioned. Recommended! Thought I was getting ripped off at first, but it actually cheaper than buying at Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Store.</li>
            <li> Thank you, always an amazing product</li>
            <li> This is best cologne there is! IMO.. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Refreshing, but not so strong that is offensive.  It has anice country fresh smell that easily escapes from tight spaces.  It is an excellent men&#x27;s  cologn.</li>
            <li> was worth the dollars invested great products and great attention from the vendor recommended 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was worth the dollars invested great products and great attention from the vendor recommended 100%</li>
            <li> Great price and Great service</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my son&#x27;s birthday. He had asked for this cologne. I&#x27;m happy he was so pleased with it. It was slightly cheaper than if I had purchased it in a big name dept store, and I got it just a few days after placing the order.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  The smell is fresh and clean, and I frequently get complements from wearing it.  Unlike other fragrances, it is not overpowering.  From the advice of a woman at one of the major department stores, she recommended this one to me.  I love it so much I bought one from Amazon when my supply ran out.  This particular bottle size lasted me about two years.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow I got a fake product, smell awful. Regret wasting my hard earn money on this bottle of junk!</li>
            <li> It is very weak.  I have to spray six times and then it is still too weak.  When I have purchesed it from the box stores I can only spray two times or it is too strong.  I will never buy this product from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this a few years ago at the department store, and ever since then the online purchases just don&#x27;t hold the same smell, It just fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt; I think this stuff is fake or a knockoff.</li>
            <li> Good price,  great smell</li>
            <li> Great Price super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Definitely diluted. Price was so good I ignored the warning comments. Have to douse myself and it still evaporates quickly. Will buy from department store next time.</li>
            <li> This cologne just has this classic smell. Never gets old. I bought this bottle for a friend. He couldn&#x27;t believe the deal on this bottle. He has paid twice the price for a much smaller bottle. What a great  value.</li>
            <li> Very good price fast shipping</li>
            <li> Sent me a replacement and it is great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Get many compliments.</li>
            <li> Cheap do not buy!!  Product is not good</li>
            <li> I love it, people can&#x27;t stop asking about the  perfume</li>
            <li> I was, candidly, very concerned that I might be buying some kind of knock-off and not the real Acqua Di Gio.  I&#x27;m VERY HAPPY to say that this is the real deal.  It is a sealed box with shrink wrap, a serial number, and smells just like the same wonderful aroma I&#x27;ve come to expect.  I may be able to maybe find this for a few bucks less someplace, or more likely not, BUT I get the big size I want without having to park at a mall and trudge through a store to wait in line to get what I can get here.  Me, I am VERY HAPPY with this Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Acqua di Gio is my dear husband&#x27;s go to scent! I usually hunt the sales and wait to get it then. Unfortunately, he was nearly out so I had to impulse buy! Amazon offered it at the best price so I bought it with some concern that it might be counterfeit. Thankfully, it&#x27;s the original and authentic product!</li>
            <li> I always have used this cologne and will continue to buy it until i grow old of it. Cant go wrong with a big bottle for the amount of price. This is the real thing</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  I love that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.com for a bit less than if I have to run to the department stores.  It&#x27;s the same quality and he smells so good (for less!).</li>
            <li> incredible perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Well, This was choice of perfume for a long long time now. I usually buy it from Macy&#x27;s all the time. For the first time i ordered a perfume from Amazon which is a serious crap. The smell does not lost for even 2 hours. It kind of sucks. When i inquired and read some articles about perfumes being sold for low prices on amazon.com, I heard an interesting fact which is, Amazon usually buy a hell huge of products from the seller years ago and sells them once prices are u in the market. It is a cheap trick to attract new customers and even existing customers to try perfumes from Amazon. I am sure every one will at least try once just coz of the 30$ difference on this product compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> This mens cologne is one of the best scents for men.  Always get positive comments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Live this smell on my honey! Yummy!! Plus this bottle is huge... Will last forever!</li>
            <li> Really does smell like rubbing alcohol &amp;&amp; the smell doesn&#x27;t last longer than 3 hours. Disappointment</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful smell! My husband likes it because its not too potent but still smells nice and last all day.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and no complaints yet. Plus my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the ladies love it!</li>
            <li> If you know the fragrance and want it, this is an economical way to get it quickly.</li>
            <li> Was given as a present.  It was what he asked for.</li>
            <li> Please proceed with caution when purchasing an item such as this online. If you open the product they will hold you liable for the sellers dishonesty&lt;br /&gt;and not refund you due to opening the product. This is not right and needs to be examined. ou do not buy a car just by looking at the outside without first testing it.&lt;br /&gt;However you are relegated the bad guy if you do so and your claim will ultimately be denied and stuck with the high cost for a counterfeit item.</li>
            <li> I get a LOT of great compliments on this cologne!</li>
            <li> el perfume no perdura el olor se va de inmediato no es autentico para mi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No lasting perfume smell goes away is not authentic to me</li>
            <li> This cologne is the best hands down. I recommend this cologne to everyone. It is pricey but well worth it. I always, I mean always get compliments on this cologne.</li>
            <li> Read reviews for this product AFTER I had made my order, so I was a little concerned. But after receiving the product, it&#x27;s the real deal. Good to know!  I&#x27;ll be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Acqua Di Gio since it was first launched in 1996 and I have strong reason to believe that this product is fake. The scent is slightly different and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as it normally does. When examining the bottle and closely to my old one that was purchased from Macy&#x27;s in Los Angeles, there are slight differences in the quality of the printing and the font.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that I am 100% sure that it is fake, but I am pretty certain that it is.. I will not buy a perfume from Amazon or any online retailer again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and still get compliments on the regular. I&#x27;ve switched scents a few times and the compliments seem to dissappear so i always come back to old faithful.</li>
