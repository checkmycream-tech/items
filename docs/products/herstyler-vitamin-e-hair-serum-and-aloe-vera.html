            <li>And I love it.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars, however it does make my hair have a bit of static.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been better off without it.</li>
            <li>For best results put before and after blowdrying or flat iron hair.</li>
            <li>This hair product is really good if you have dry, damaged  or frizzy or fly away hair.</li>
            <li>Although Redken anti snap is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>It smells of rose - real roses, not the fake/cheap rose scent in many products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not greasy, it is very smooth and the most important thing is:  It smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product it works great for my hair absorbs with out having that oily look and feel leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the easy purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>routine that works best is when you use the product after you get out of the shower and towel dry your hair.</li>
            <li>think that if you have fine hair,you may come accross a greasy look or may not be able to style your hair,because</li>
            <li>It smelled great and was not heavy on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought a bottle for my grand son who has curly hair and it makes his hair look smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you want a light glossy healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great, keeps my hair without freeze, makes my hair  soft, silky without leaving it grassy.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell and how it is light weight</li>
            <li>This serum makes your hair super soft and smells sooooo good !  </li>
            <li>Also, this company ship very quick.</li>

            <li>I purchased the HerStyler Flat iron at the fair this year, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked.</li>
            <li>Lucky me...</li>
            <li>The serum did an adequate job.  </li>
            <li>Used it before , and liked it since .very effective without Beeing heavy or greasy on hair .</li>
            <li>Perfumy, but not cloying and fades quickly after application.</li>
            <li>I want to return and get the serum without the OIL!!&lt;br /&gt;Please help me make sure that I will receive the other kind????</li>
            <li>The seller was very fast!</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy at all and my hair is very manageable and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>My hair feels lovely and soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel very soft and does a better job than anything else i have tried in keeping the frizzies at bay, but the frizzies still won out in the end.</li>
            <li>Bone straight &amp; bouncy!!</li>
            <li>Comparatively to other hair serums, this one&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>it doesnt seem to leave heavy residue on hair with repated applications and smells great</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>SO worth it.</li>

            <li>I love this product, it turned out to be better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>Sooo worth</li>
            <li>this product has by far did more for my frizzy hair</li>
            <li>buy all the time and the price is right if you look around on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have curly thick hair and my hair comes out beautiful when I put this on.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, but after applying to damp hair and drying naturally, it leaves my hair feeling soft but \\&quot;filmy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>They wanted way to much, I went on line and tadaaaaaa found it, the price was much less and still loving it!</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>I have fine naturally curly greying hair that I color</li>
            <li>it was unruly, \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; and dull.</li>
            <li>Love this product and have an will order again in the future</li>
            <li>and WOW it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I did try a different brand hair serum and thought it worked better.  </li>
            <li>My hair is pretty oily as well</li>
            <li>and I look like I came straight from the salon !</li>
            <li>There is no stiffness or wetness now just pretty managable hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and my hair stays straight all day even in the fog!  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel and it was only a fraction of the cost from the company</li>
            <li>Otherwise it makes my hair soft, shiny and frizz - free</li>
            <li>I used to love this product a couple of years ago when it actually contained vitamin E.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH MY BROTHER GOT IT FOR ME FOR A PRESENT AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean for days and it is so shinny and soft!</li>
            <li>I just love how it lasts and works great on long course hair to tame and get the frizzes out!</li>
            <li>it make my hair soft, feel very soft, i love it, i am sold..</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the smell is amazing!!</li>
            <li>I have gone 3 months without a hair cut and leaves hair super soft with no filmy residue.</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive to smells, I prefer no scent, but this was bearable for the results.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is a bit strong and for my type of hair its not hydrating enough.</li>
            <li>smell great, but by the mid day it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li>I really like using this hair serum.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I picked up a free sample while strolling through the Wynn casino mall in Las Vegas last month.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much about it</li>
            <li>Remember the trick don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>Just a tiny dab makes my hair look fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have fought with it my whole life, but with age it&#x27;s getting dryer and frizzier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>And it is really affordable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s argan oil instead of vitamin E. much thicker and oily than the product with Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>and it is very damaged.</li>
            <li>for example it used to take almost 3hours to blow dry/straighten my hair after i got out of the shower, now my hair is basically straight after blow drying</li>
            <li>I like it , very useful.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>So this product really helped me.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the Herstyler -- this is the only thing I use in my hair no other products!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes your hair without weighing it down or making it greasy which is great for mixed girls such as myself that have a hard time finding a happy medium between moisturizing and lightweight.</li>
            <li>i will be reordering this since i use daily and alot cheaper here then in the mall where i originally bought it</li>
            <li>Unlike most other hair serums, it nourishes the hair, so you&#x27;re not just using a &#x27;hair product&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Works good on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li>I have only had this product for less than a week but am so satisfied, its worth every penny !  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found this product for less price.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a hair serum made mainly of liquid vitamin E, but this is a silicone serum with added vitamin E.</li>
            <li>I prefer this particular one because of the quality of the vitamin E oil and the FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely hard to get totally flat, but with the serum and the flat iron, it&#x27;s turned out the best I have ever seen it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend</li>
            <li>Yes I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would be able to sell one serum for AS LITTLE as $35.</li>
            <li>normally I just keep walking by</li>
            <li>Its a few dollars in price more than drug store brands</li>
            <li>While in a shopping mall in New York I was given a sample of Herstyler Vitamin E Hair Serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an african american woman with shoulder length virgin hair (15yrs chemical free) &amp; I</li>
            <li>Leaves hair, soft and manageable, not greasy, I just use 2 drops and my hair is super long.</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised by the result!</li>
            <li>i use it on damp, combed hair right before i blow dry it</li>
            <li>and they were OK and helped a little but not enough to satisfy me.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and shint without making it oily and stringy.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and shine even if your hair is damage.</li>
            <li>My hair almost never feels soft.</li>
            <li>I have real issues with frizz and this product totally eliminates the issue.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Smells like heaven, makes your hair unbelievably soft</li>

            <li>It leaves your hair so soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It is relief to know that I can get that look of damage covered and have the look of controlled  and soft looking hair.</li>
            <li>No wonder the price is so low compared to the real HerStyler serum.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this randomly, decided to give it a try and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>It does contain vitamin e, and it works fine, but it&#x27;s no different from Biosilk, if less fragrant.  </li>
            <li>usually get 2 bottles to get the advantage of free shipping.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, there it was and it was in my hands in only a few days.  </li>
            <li>I pump 2 pumps in my hand and add a few drops of pure argon oil and rub my hands together and smooth it rough my hair!</li>
            <li>Herstyler Vitamin E Hair Serum, a new look, an open sun roof and on the road again.</li>
            <li>After using this, I&#x27;ve been told my hair is left soft.</li>
            <li>I love how it smooths down the cuticle and gives my hair a slight shine!</li>
            <li>This is one of the first products in a long time that I have found that takes the frizz out of my over colored damaged dry hair.</li>

            <li> This hair product is really good if you have dry, damaged  or frizzy or fly away hair.</li>
            <li> Although Redken anti snap is pretty good too.</li>

            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the easy purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> routine that works best is when you use the product after you get out of the shower and towel dry your hair.</li>
            <li> think that if you have fine hair,you may come accross a greasy look or may not be able to style your hair,because</li>
            <li> It smelled great and was not heavy on my hair.  </li>

            <li> Used it before , and liked it since .very effective without Beeing heavy or greasy on hair .</li>
            <li> Perfumy, but not cloying and fades quickly after application.</li>

            <li> My hair feels lovely and soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel very soft and does a better job than anything else i have tried in keeping the frizzies at bay, but the frizzies still won out in the end.</li>
            <li> Bone straight &amp; bouncy!!</li>
            <li> Comparatively to other hair serums, this one&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> it doesnt seem to leave heavy residue on hair with repated applications and smells great</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> SO worth it.</li>

            <li> Sooo worth</li>
            <li> this product has by far did more for my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> buy all the time and the price is right if you look around on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair and my hair comes out beautiful when I put this on.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice, but after applying to damp hair and drying naturally, it leaves my hair feeling soft but \\&quot;filmy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They wanted way to much, I went on line and tadaaaaaa found it, the price was much less and still loving it!</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> I have fine naturally curly greying hair that I color</li>
            <li> it was unruly, \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; and dull.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have an will order again in the future</li>
            <li> and WOW it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I did try a different brand hair serum and thought it worked better.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty oily as well</li>
            <li> and I look like I came straight from the salon !</li>
            <li> There is no stiffness or wetness now just pretty managable hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and my hair stays straight all day even in the fog!  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and it was only a fraction of the cost from the company</li>
            <li> Otherwise it makes my hair soft, shiny and frizz - free</li>
            <li> I used to love this product a couple of years ago when it actually contained vitamin E.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH MY BROTHER GOT IT FOR ME FOR A PRESENT AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean for days and it is so shinny and soft!</li>
            <li> I just love how it lasts and works great on long course hair to tame and get the frizzes out!</li>
            <li> it make my hair soft, feel very soft, i love it, i am sold..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the smell is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I have gone 3 months without a hair cut and leaves hair super soft with no filmy residue.</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive to smells, I prefer no scent, but this was bearable for the results.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is a bit strong and for my type of hair its not hydrating enough.</li>
            <li> smell great, but by the mid day it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> I really like using this hair serum.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I picked up a free sample while strolling through the Wynn casino mall in Las Vegas last month.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much about it</li>
            <li> Remember the trick don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li> Just a tiny dab makes my hair look fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have fought with it my whole life, but with age it&#x27;s getting dryer and frizzier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> And it is really affordable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s argan oil instead of vitamin E. much thicker and oily than the product with Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> and it is very damaged.</li>
            <li> for example it used to take almost 3hours to blow dry/straighten my hair after i got out of the shower, now my hair is basically straight after blow drying</li>
            <li> I like it , very useful.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> So this product really helped me.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the Herstyler -- this is the only thing I use in my hair no other products!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes your hair without weighing it down or making it greasy which is great for mixed girls such as myself that have a hard time finding a happy medium between moisturizing and lightweight.</li>
            <li> i will be reordering this since i use daily and alot cheaper here then in the mall where i originally bought it</li>
            <li> Unlike most other hair serums, it nourishes the hair, so you&#x27;re not just using a &#x27;hair product&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Works good on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for less than a week but am so satisfied, its worth every penny !  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this product for less price.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a hair serum made mainly of liquid vitamin E, but this is a silicone serum with added vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I prefer this particular one because of the quality of the vitamin E oil and the FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely hard to get totally flat, but with the serum and the flat iron, it&#x27;s turned out the best I have ever seen it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend</li>
            <li> Yes I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would be able to sell one serum for AS LITTLE as $35.</li>
            <li> normally I just keep walking by</li>
            <li> Its a few dollars in price more than drug store brands</li>
            <li> While in a shopping mall in New York I was given a sample of Herstyler Vitamin E Hair Serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african american woman with shoulder length virgin hair (15yrs chemical free) &amp; I</li>
            <li> Leaves hair, soft and manageable, not greasy, I just use 2 drops and my hair is super long.</li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised by the result!</li>
            <li> i use it on damp, combed hair right before i blow dry it</li>
            <li> and they were OK and helped a little but not enough to satisfy me.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and shint without making it oily and stringy.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and shine even if your hair is damage.</li>
            <li> My hair almost never feels soft.</li>
            <li> I have real issues with frizz and this product totally eliminates the issue.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven, makes your hair unbelievably soft</li>
            <li> Definitely helps, I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have as much slit ends using this product.</li>
            <li> Herstyler leaves your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This serum leaves your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> It is relief to know that I can get that look of damage covered and have the look of controlled  and soft looking hair.</li>
            <li> No wonder the price is so low compared to the real HerStyler serum.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this randomly, decided to give it a try and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> It does contain vitamin e, and it works fine, but it&#x27;s no different from Biosilk, if less fragrant.  </li>
            <li> usually get 2 bottles to get the advantage of free shipping.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, there it was and it was in my hands in only a few days.  </li>
            <li> I pump 2 pumps in my hand and add a few drops of pure argon oil and rub my hands together and smooth it rough my hair!</li>
            <li> Herstyler Vitamin E Hair Serum, a new look, an open sun roof and on the road again.</li>
            <li> After using this, I&#x27;ve been told my hair is left soft.</li>
            <li> I love how it smooths down the cuticle and gives my hair a slight shine!</li>
            <li> This is one of the first products in a long time that I have found that takes the frizz out of my over colored damaged dry hair.</li>
            <li> and I usually flat iron it daily.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product to anyone that has trouble growing and maintaining their hair.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to find a product that really lived up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I got this hair serum to go with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This product defintely helps when using curling irons or flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I use it before I use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> You only need a pea sized amount to coat your hair so it lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> I apply to each part &amp; flat</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair, most products weigh it down.</li>
            <li> However, when I actually bought the bottle of stuff, it was extremely greasy, oily, made my hair much too shiny and heavy, and the smell is quite overpowering.</li>
            <li> Wash hair, towel dry, brush and put on the ends only as the oil works</li>
            <li> Over the last several years I have spent literally hundreds on just about every type of oil, gel, cream, shampoo, conditioner, spray and mousse out there for my issue.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts all day, as long as you are not around a smoker.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s different from the picture.. be careful..</li>
            <li> I use it every day and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> While cleaning, I came across it again and made a mental note to try it the next time I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, it works great!!It lasts a long time and leaves your hair feeling silky not greasy</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin and frail hair, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I purchased the same at the mall locally for 35 dollars and they claimed this was half off.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only thing (other than argon oil) that smooths it out.</li>
            <li> I used it after shampooing on wet or damp hair and then before I blow dry or flat iron use.</li>
            <li> I use it before blow dry and after To add shine and a glossy look.</li>
            <li> Still dry, still poofy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> so it is dry</li>
            <li> i use it before i blow dry</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower, I let my hair dry.</li>
            <li> and I was worried that it would weigh down my hair or make it look greasy, but it doesnt, just a tiny dab on the middle down to the ends</li>
            <li> I can use it when air is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter’s hair tend to be very dry.  </li>
            <li> When it ran out I even cut the little sample pouch open and the tiniest bit worked.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it, but the price was a little too crazy, so I decided to search for it here on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> What I have found, is just a lighter wallet and not much else.</li>
            <li> I have wasted my time buying several if not hundreds of other hair oils, lotions, serums and nothing beats what this stuff does to my hair.</li>
            <li> couple times a week on the bottom half of my hair before I blow dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wound recommend this product to someone that does not have extremely course hair.</li>
            <li> But if I did not have any other...</li>
            <li> TRIED OTHER PROCUCTS--</li>
            <li> I sometimes deviate from it and try other brands</li>
            <li> but you put a little on before you dry your hair or before using a flatiron and your hair</li>
            <li> Put in on before using the flat iron and it gives you shine, one small pump each time is just enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use about a dime size and my hair is LONG- past my chest.</li>
            <li> so it weighs it down a bit.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and it gets rid of the frizz without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> Extremely upset!</li>
            <li> Would it be wet looking, or make my hair stiff?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked selling Herstyler products and seriously this price is such a bargain.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s with a past-your-shoulders, head-full of thick, naturally, kinky, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Just need a little to apply to the hair and ur hair won&#x27;t get frizzy when u straighten ur hair.</li>
            <li> It also feels heavy</li>
            <li> I just wasted my return shipping fees.</li>
            <li> And you get it for less than the mall kiosk or the manufacturer if you order on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> this product is for all hair types from thin, to course, to dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> The trick with this stuff is use just a SMIDGE no more - a micro drop.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a pump or two of it</li>
            <li> Using just a small amount, I got shinier, controlable hair.  </li>
            <li> Using just a small drop before styling smoothes , softens, and keeps the frizz under control.</li>
            <li> I rated this  a five because it makes my hair look and feel soft,shiney and unbelievably healthy,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I put a very, very small amount on my hands (not more than a few drops) and put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> so all i have to do is run a straightener through my hair-about 30mins, which has cut my hair managing time in half!!.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that frizzes with the least amount of moisture in the air.  </li>
            <li> have thick chemically treated hair</li>
            <li> However, it smells horrible and you have to be very careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> The trick with this stuff is using a small amount!</li>
            <li> It gets dry and staticky and drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> Skip the shampoo and conditioner - not good.</li>
            <li> If you already have oily hair, not a good idea.  </li>
            <li> I recommend both the iron and the serum for anyone with hard to manage, kinky hair like mine!</li>
            <li> It no longer does say that on the bottle therefore it is a product under false advertisement!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look healthier too, it doesn&#x27;t make it look dirty or oily.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the price too...</li>
            <li> This product is basically worthless as it didn&#x27;t do a thing for my curls whatsoever.</li>
            <li> very disappointed that this is falsely advertised!!!!</li>
            <li> iron.the results were shocking.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product and have an will order again in the future</li>
            <li> Love this!! Paid four times the amount at the Mall in my town. Glad to have found it online at such a great price!!</li>
            <li> i have a super frizzy hear and my hair is doing just fine with this serum, super love..it make my hair soft, feel very soft, i love it, i am sold..</li>
            <li> Leaves hair, soft and manageable, not greasy, I just use 2 drops and my hair is super long. In love with it!</li>
            <li> I really like using this hair serum.  It softens my natural curl and has a really nice fragrance that people are always commenting on.  I&#x27;d highly recommend</li>
            <li> Its great, leaves my hair feeling silky. Put in on before using the flat iron and it gives you shine, one small pump each time is just enough.&lt;br /&gt; I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This product smells sooo good. The smell lasts all day, as long as you are not around a smoker. It does a very good job of taking the frizz out of your hair when you apply heat. I have only used this product with my Chi flatiron so I can&#x27;t speak about a blow drier experience. I wound recommend this product to someone that does not have extremely course hair. I wish it came in a bigger bottle, I&#x27;m constantly running out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past year and it is wonderful. It smooths and shines my hair without any greasiness or heaviness. It leaves my hair with a polished finish. It can be used before and after styling without any buildup. A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts for a long time. Now that I have been using it I can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for several years for something like this for my shoulder length frizzy, bleached hair.  I&#x27;ve literally stood in Ulta and googled hair products on my phone looking for shampoo, conditioners, serums, money was no object - nothing compares to this.  My boyfriend and I picked up a free sample while strolling through the Wynn casino mall in Las Vegas last month.  I didn&#x27;t think much about it but I thought I&#x27;d try it while on vacation and WOW it is fabulous. When it ran out I even cut the little sample pouch open and the tiniest bit worked. The trick with this stuff is use just a SMIDGE no more - a micro drop.  I googled it and it was $49 on another site, I think herstyler.com&#x27;s website.  On amazon its $18!  It smells wonderful, makes your hair sleek and smooth or if you want to curl it - it comes out great.  It&#x27;s like having a healthy head of hair in a drop. Remember the trick don&#x27;t use too much.  FABULOUSITY!  Lucky me...oh amazon hurry and send mine!  I came back to add shipping was $11!  Go to ebay and get it there.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product. I have never had smoother silkier hair in my entire life! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum because of the price and good reviews, however, it&#x27;s just ok. It smells really nice, but after applying to damp hair and drying naturally, it leaves my hair feeling soft but \\&quot;filmy.\\&quot; It also feels heavy (I have medium-long hair) so it weighs it down a bit. I tried herstyler after running out of Unite Shina Liquid, but I&#x27;ll definitely be switching back to Unite. The Unite serum is literally perfect for my hair. I have gone 3 months without a hair cut and leaves hair super soft with no filmy residue. *White/Female with straight/slightly wavy medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Makes you hair shiny and feels good with out looking greasy</li>
            <li> Use this daily for my frizzy colored hair!!!! Won&#x27;t use anything else and I have tried them all. Hands done this is what works. Wash hair, towel dry, brush and put on the ends only as the oil works it&#x27;s way up the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> I love the Herstyler -- this is the only thing I use in my hair no other products! My hair feels clean for days and it is so shinny and soft! I have had people ask me what I am using ! You only need 1 pump size in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will love it!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003GXC0T2 Herstyler Vitamin E Hair Serum, 2 Ounce]]  I got this hair serum to go with the flat iron.  I wanted to get the best results on my hair and thought the pair would be the best case scenario.  The serum did an adequate job.  It smelled great and was not heavy on my hair.  I did try a different brand hair serum and thought it worked better.  So I am using that instead.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy the herstyler hair serum again because I have better. But if I did not have any other... this would do the job okay.</li>
            <li> This product defintely helps when using curling irons or flat irons.  Keeps the hair healthy and shiny and protected. It is worth every cent.  Will defintely continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome deal...I purchased the same at the mall locally for 35 dollars and they claimed this was half off.  I love how it makes my hair feel and the price was even better</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair, most products weigh it down. Herstyler in the best leave in conditioner I have ever used. Just a tiny dab makes my hair look fantastic. A bottle lasts about 6 months, I was so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is excellant to use before using hair straightner. Me &amp; my teenage daughter use it. It.helps protect hair from damage from heat. Makes hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s different from the picture.. be careful..it&#x27;s not vitamin E. it&#x27;s not a silver color cap..it&#x27;s a brown color cap.</li>
            <li> I bought this one day when I was in the mall, and I fell in love with it! It makes your hair soft and shint without making it oily and stringy. It also smells great. The price is way cheaper on here than it is at the kiosk in the mall!</li>
            <li> this product works on all hair types to reduce fizz and split ends it doesnt seem to leave heavy residue on hair with repated applications and smells great</li>
            <li> When I tried the sample from the mall kiosk, loved it. However, when I actually bought the bottle of stuff, it was extremely greasy, oily, made my hair much too shiny and heavy, and the smell is quite overpowering. Will not ever trust Herstyler again.</li>
            <li> It only takes one drop on my almost-shoulder length hair to give it a silky-smooth texture.  I use it every day and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! I have been using this product since 2010. Leaves your hair soft and shine even if your hair is damage. I use it before blow dry and after To add shine and a glossy look. Definetely I recommended!! Fast shipping and great price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly just like the sample at the mall! The brown top kind of threw me off a bit, but  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Used it before , and liked it since .very effective without Beeing heavy or greasy on hair . I&#x27;m very happy with the product .</li>
            <li> I was the vitamin E hair serum but this seller gave me the argan oil hair serum. It smells the same and feels the same in my hair but i rather have the vitamin E</li>
            <li> My wife used this sample before and she liked it. Therefore I found it on Amazon and the listed price was quite competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my wife has liked this hair caring product and she has no complains whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s with a past-your-shoulders, head-full of thick, naturally, kinky, curly hair. I have fought with it my whole life, but with age it&#x27;s getting dryer and frizzier. Even in Colorado, where the humidity is relatively low all year. Over the last several years I have spent literally hundreds on just about every type of oil, gel, cream, shampoo, conditioner, spray and mousse out there for my issue. What I have found, is just a lighter wallet and not much else. Almost everything I have tried has not worked. Still dry, still poofy and frizzy. At a fair in California I was given a sample of Herstyler Vitamin E. I took it home, set it aside and did not think about it for weeks. While cleaning, I came across it again and made a mental note to try it the next time I washed my hair. Boy was I surprised by the result! I should mention that I only wash my hair once a week, some might think that&#x27;s gross, but believe me, even after a week, my hair does not get oily. I used Loreal EverCurl sulfate free shampoo and conditoner, (also the best I have found), first and then applied the sample of Herstyler. I put my hair in a bun and went to bed. In the morning, my still mostly wet hair felt SOFT. My hair almost never feels soft. The frizz was kept to a minimum and I was thrilled. The next day, I bought the serum at Amazon and I have not regretted it. I am not saying this will do the same for you, but I am sold and will buy nothing else. Oh, I should also mention that it does have a smell. Perfumy, but not cloying and fades quickly after application. I am super sensitive to smells, I prefer no scent, but this was bearable for the results.</li>
            <li> I was shopping at an outlet mall and was stopped by a hair kiosk station by a woman trying to sell her products... normally I just keep walking by but I stopped that day and soooo glad I did !  This serum makes your hair super soft and smells sooooo good !  I color and highlight my hair a lot so it is dry and I usually flat iron it daily. I have only had this product for less than a week but am so satisfied, its worth every penny !  My hair is pretty oily as well and I was worried that it would weigh down my hair or make it look greasy, but it doesnt, just a tiny dab on the middle down to the ends and I look like I came straight from the salon !</li>
            <li> this product is grate for calming frizzy hair. I like the way it makes my hair shine. I bought a bottle for my grand son who has curly hair and it makes his hair look smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used it for years and it gets rid of the frizz without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> I have real issues with frizz and this product totally eliminates the issue. I like that I can use it when air is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Herstyler Vitamin E hair serum is a great product. The trick with this stuff is using a small amount! A little goes a long way. I use about a dime size and my hair is LONG- past my chest. I try to avoid the root area and mostly apply this towards the ends of my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy at all and my hair is very manageable and easy to work with. This is one of my favorite products and I&#x27;ve been  using is for years.</li>
            <li> Herstyler  vitamin E works wonderful and smells light and clean. I use it before I use my flat iron. Work great on humid days.. Controlling fuzziness. Works good on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> This hair product is really good if you have dry, damaged  or frizzy or fly away hair. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this randomly, decided to give it a try and LOVED it. I bought it immediately. It smells fantastic, it makes your hair feel thicker and softer...it&#x27;s fantastic. I usually use a pump or two of it couple times a week on the bottom half of my hair before I blow dry it. I was shocked at the price too...SO worth it.</li>
            <li> This is another silicone (cyclolmkethicone &amp; dimethicone) hair serum.  It does contain vitamin e, and it works fine, but it&#x27;s no different from Biosilk, if less fragrant.  I thought I was getting a hair serum made mainly of liquid vitamin E, but this is a silicone serum with added vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I snagged this at the mall as a sample and had to grab it after it ran out.  It smells great, makes your hair shiny and is perfect for pre-treatment before heating products.  You only need a pea sized amount to coat your hair so it lasts a really long time.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This product Is great. I have curly thick hair and my hair comes out beautiful when I put this on. For best results put before and after blowdrying or flat iron hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I wish it came in a bigger size. Skip the shampoo and conditioner - not good.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and shiny. I would recommend this to all my friends. This is the best hair serum I&#x27;v ever tried!</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven, makes your hair unbelievably soft</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It smells great, makes your hair look great, and the cost is very inexpensive! It lasts a long time as well. It comes packaged very safely too, something I was worried about since the bottle is glass.</li>
            <li> I tried this Serum at the mall. Loved the silkiness. They wanted way to much, I went on line and tadaaaaaa found it, the price was much less and still loving it! My hair feels great, the scent is great. Yes I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really love this product for my hair. It smells good and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy. I have gotten a lot of compliments on my hair. I recommend it if you want a light glossy healthy looking hair. And it is really affordable.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair hydrated, smooth and frizz free. Best hair serum on the market. The mall kiosks try to sell it to you for $30+, I always purchase from Amazon for cheaper.</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE IT SO MUCH MY BROTHER GOT IT FOR ME FOR A PRESENT AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT RIGHT AWAY A MUST BUY ACTUALLY GOING TO BUY IT NOW AGAIN</li>
            <li> I love this product it works great for my hair absorbs with out having that oily look and feel leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Buyer be ware!  This picture is not what they will ship you!  The product I ordered was the Vitamin E serum with a silver cap, and what they shipped me was Argan Oil with a bronze cap.  Not the same thing.  Thankfully though, Amazon has incredible customer service and refunded my money.</li>

            <li> I bought this product from a kiosk at a mall.  I fell in love with it, but the price was a little too crazy, so I decided to search for it here on Amazon.com.  So glad I found it and at a great price too!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> After using this, I&#x27;ve been told my hair is left soft. Definitely helps, I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have as much slit ends using this product.</li>

            <li> It is similar to argan oil and I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter’s hair tend to be very dry.  This product moistens hair and gives lots of shine.</li>
            <li> I wanted the serum WITH NO ARGAN OIL!!! That is what I thought I chose!!!! I want to return and get the serum without the OIL!!&lt;br /&gt;Please help me make sure that I will receive the other kind????</li>
            <li> This was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the easy purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have wasted my time buying several if not hundreds of other hair oils, lotions, serums and nothing beats what this stuff does to my hair. It smells wonderful and makes my curls smooth and silky soft. I hope they never stop making this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  Herstyler leaves your hair soft and shiny.  i use it on damp, combed hair right before i blow dry it and it smells wonderful as well.  [[ASIN:B000TW2JQC HERSTYLER HAIR SERUM VITAMIN E AND ALOE VERA [Health and Beauty]]]</li>
            <li> While in a shopping mall in New York I was given a sample of Herstyler Vitamin E Hair Serum.  It was the best thing I ever got in a free sample. It was summer and with washing my hair daily it was unruly, \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; and dull. I was anxious to find a product that really lived up to its claims. Would it be wet looking, or make my hair stiff? I was at my wits end and I could not find Herstyler products in my home state of North Carolina. Where did I find it?  Amazon, of course!![[ASIN:B000TW2JQC Herstyler Hair Serum Vitamin E and Aloe Vera(2.0 oz 60).  Sure enough, there it was and it was in my hands in only a few days.  Using just a small amount, I got shinier, controlable hair.  There is no stiffness or wetness now just pretty managable hair.  I have had loads of compliments on my \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair style. Herstyler Vitamin E Hair Serum, a new look, an open sun roof and on the road again.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my hair and even put on skin. It is not greasy and actually makes your hair feel great.</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome. I use it every day, it works great!!It lasts a long time and leaves your hair feeling silky not greasy</li>
            <li> I love this product, it turned out to be better than what I expected. It leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> makes your hair smell good and feel amazing&lt;br /&gt;very affordable compared to most places that sell this product&lt;br /&gt;will buy again</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SERUM. Smells great, keeps my hair without freeze, makes my hair  soft, silky without leaving it grassy. And I can have it for months!!!</li>
            <li> smell great, but by the mid day it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that frizzes with the least amount of moisture in the air.  I have tried serums from Italy, France, and the USA and they were OK and helped a little but not enough to satisfy me.  Herstyler Vitamin E is different.  It&#x27;s not greasy but you put a little on before you dry your hair or before using a flatiron and your hair does not frizz!  I even put a tiny bit on after I use a flatiron and my hair stays straight all day even in the fog!  I love this product.  It is well worth the price to me! And you get it for less than the mall kiosk or the manufacturer if you order on Amazon!  I stocked up!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the same product advertised.  It&#x27;s argan oil instead of vitamin E. much thicker and oily than the product with Vitamin E. very disappointed that this is falsely advertised!!!!</li>
            <li> This hair serum is excellent, the best I&#x27;ve used (&amp; I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of them)! It&#x27;s very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy or oily looking or anything. It makes my hair silkier &amp; shinier &amp; more healthy. I love it! I&#x27;ve never found another product like this, it works excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle. Great serum for removing frizz. It has the added benefit of smelling nice. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is a bit strong and for my type of hair its not hydrating enough.I would recoment it though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this hair serum for almost two years now. I prefer this particular one because of the quality of the vitamin E oil and the FRAGRANCE. It smells so good. Comparatively to other hair serums, this one&#x27;s pretty great. My hair is shiny, not frizzy at all, and left smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The routine that works best is when you use the product after you get out of the shower and towel dry your hair. When your hair is damp, apply four squirts (if you have hair length below your shoulders) and finger through your hair. (For best outcome: Apply pre hair straightening or apply post hair curling)</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and it was only a fraction of the cost from the company</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hair product I have ever used for taming very natural curly hair! Using just a small drop before styling smoothes , softens, and keeps the frizz under control. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Its great smells awesome. Just need a little to apply to the hair and ur hair won&#x27;t get frizzy when u straighten ur hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was walking through the mall and someone handed me a sample packet.  I love the smell and the shine it gave my hair.  I have reorded this porduct.</li>
            <li> have used it for a couple of years--great product FOR ANYONE WHO WANTSTRAIGHT  SHINY HAIR.  TRIED OTHER PROCUCTS--THIS BY FAR IS THE BEST</li>
            <li> i will be reordering this since i use daily and alot cheaper here then in the mall where i originally bought it</li>
            <li> This serum leaves your hair feeling soft and silky. I definitely recommend this product. I love this serum. :)) !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything I like better than this yet.  Although Redken anti snap is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this product I&#x27;m gonna give it a couple of weeks to try this product then I will be able to post on this , but so far the smell of this is really nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked selling Herstyler products and seriously this price is such a bargain. I would be able to sell one serum for AS LITTLE as $35. It leaves your hair so soft and non greasy. Great for frizz control and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first products in a long time that I have found that takes the frizz out of my over colored damaged dry hair. It is relief to know that I can get that look of damage covered and have the look of controlled  and soft looking hair. It even feels good to the touch. So happy to find this product. I have fine naturally curly greying hair that I color and it is very damaged. But this smooths and shines. I used it after shampooing on wet or damp hair and then before I blow dry or flat iron use.</li>
            <li> great stuff for a fraction of the price you would pay at the mall</li>
            <li> I tried it at the mall, but the price at the mall is a lot more expensive than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy, it is very smooth and the most important thing is:  It smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;I usually get 2 bottles to get the advantage of free shipping.</li>
            <li> i love this hair serum, it makes my hair soft and it smells really good, like a natural smelling hair scent. i use it before i blow dry and before i straighten and the condition of my hair has greatly improved. for example it used to take almost 3hours to blow dry/straighten my hair after i got out of the shower, now my hair is basically straight after blow drying so all i have to do is run a straightener through my hair-about 30mins, which has cut my hair managing time in half!!. i would highly recommend this product to anyone that has trouble growing and maintaining their hair. this product is for all hair types from thin, to course, to dry and damaged. It moisturizes your hair without weighing it down or making it greasy which is great for mixed girls such as myself that have a hard time finding a happy medium between moisturizing and lightweight. perfect!! buy it, i promise you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> Great price here on Amazon. Especially compared to Mall price($100) I just use on ends before using my flatiron.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and this hair serum is perfect for me. Unlike most other hair serums, it nourishes the hair, so you&#x27;re not just using a &#x27;hair product&#x27;. Its scent is acceptable to me. It smells of rose - real roses, not the fake/cheap rose scent in many products. I am chemically sensitive, and this does not cause a reaction as many, many fragrances do with me (like, Nuance - blechx).</li>
            <li> I like it , very useful.&lt;br /&gt;but smell to much,i like no smell.&lt;br /&gt;but it is still a good product.</li>
            <li> I love the scent &amp; how it makes my hair feel. I&#x27;m an african american woman with shoulder length virgin hair (15yrs chemical free) &amp; I no longer press my hair because of the herstyler flatiron &amp; the her styler hair serum with vitamin e &amp; aloe.I apply to each part &amp; flat iron.the results were shocking.Bone straight &amp; bouncy!! Lifetime customer indeed.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this serum. Its a few dollars in price more than drug store brands but it works like a $30 salon brand I bought awhile ago. It definitely works better than the kind you get at the drug stores. Sooo worth it hope this product stays on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Update 5-2016- I still buy this serum regularly. I sometimes deviate from it and try other brands but I always go back to this serum. Why? Well it smooths out my hair without leaving a greasy look to it. I have very fine, naturally wavy hair that loves to frizz and this is the only thing (other than argon oil) that smooths it out. I pump 2 pumps in my hand and add a few drops of pure argon oil and rub my hands together and smooth it rough my hair! I love how it smooths down the cuticle and gives my hair a slight shine!</li>
            <li> Does not do a thing.  This product is basically worthless as it didn&#x27;t do a thing for my curls whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a mall and some girls at a hair kiosk would give me samples of these all the time. I have pretty thin and frail hair, especially in the winter. It gets dry and staticky and drives me crazy. So this product really helped me. When I get out of the shower, I let my hair dry. Then I put a very, very small amount on my hands (not more than a few drops) and put it in my hair. It makes my hair look healthier too, it doesn&#x27;t make it look dirty or oily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I finally have the salon feel at home!  My hair is smooth, light, and takes heat styling.&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t miss a day without it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the word Vitamin E on either bottle or outside box. The smell and consistency is not the same too. No wonder the price is so low compared to the real HerStyler serum. I just wasted my return shipping fees. Extremely upset!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this product, it works great and smells great.  The price on-line is so much better than in the stores or the mall.  We are fans 4 life.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel very soft and does a better job than anything else i have tried in keeping the frizzies at bay, but the frizzies still won out in the end.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot. However, it smells horrible and you have to be very careful not to use too much. Otherwise it makes my hair soft, shiny and frizz - free</li>
            <li> Love it great product.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for years and I haven&#x27;t found a better serum!  My mom uses Peratin and I like the smell of Her Styler better and the way it makes my hair feel smooth and shinny!</li>
            <li> I purchased the HerStyler Flat iron at the fair this year, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. The consultant actually gave me a couple packets of the sample serum and from there I was hooked. My hair is extremely hard to get totally flat, but with the serum and the flat iron, it&#x27;s turned out the best I have ever seen it! It&#x27;s smoothe, silky, and shines like nothing else! I recommend both the iron and the serum for anyone with hard to manage, kinky hair like mine! Thank you HerStyler!</li>
            <li> Nothing like it on the market.  I just love how it lasts and works great on long course hair to tame and get the frizzes out!</li>
            <li> The best hair serum I have ever had! I small store outlet at the mall tried to sell me the exact same stuff for $40!!  I went home and immediately bought it off amazon! If you want to get rid of frizz, fly-aways,and super silky smooth hair, this stuff it for you! Plus, it smells good!</li>
            <li> I was introduced this by my son&#x27;s girlfriend.  And I love it.  My hair feels lovely and soft and full of body.  I color my hair and the shine I get from this product is really wonderful.  It is a really good product.  If you already have oily hair, not a good idea.  My hair is dry and it is really great.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this product.  A little goes a long way and the smell is amazing!! I would have given it 5 stars, however it does make my hair have a bit of static.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much. At the mall, I cannot afforded. The mall is over the price. I am so glad that I found this product for less price. Also, this company ship very quick. Overall, I give this company 5 stars...</li>
            <li> I used to love this product a couple of years ago when it actually contained vitamin E. It no longer does say that on the bottle therefore it is a product under false advertisement! I&#x27;ve been better off without it. I left several messages with Herstyler, and to date no response.</li>
            <li> I rated this  a five because it makes my hair look and feel soft,shiney and unbelievably healthy,&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you have fine hair,you may come accross a greasy look or may not be able to style your hair,because&lt;br /&gt;of the extra softness.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick chemically treated hair and i especially love this product when i blow my hair out!&lt;br /&gt;Gives great shine when i use a hot rod!</li>
            <li> I have tried many serums for my hair but have found Herstyler Vitamin E Hair Serum to be the best by far.</li>
            <li> The product it&#x27;s great! I use it for me and for my daughter and reduces  frizz and leaves the hair very smooth and shiny!. The seller was very fast! It was a great experience! Thanks for my product!!!</li>
            <li> this product has by far did more for my frizzy hair and I love the smell and how it is light weight</li>
