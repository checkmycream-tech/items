    <ol>
            <li>This sunscreen works excellent when used on the face.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This product is one of the best sunscreens I have ever used.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  </li>
            <li>I was EXTREMELY HAPPY that I was led to MD SOLAR SCIENCES MINERAL SCREEN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about this sunscreen, it&#x27;s all mineral, not chemical, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It feels great.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I bet the tinted version is amazing!</li>
            <li>Always on the lookout for best, safe, EWG.org would approved sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Not the gel that wanted to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Is a non-greasy cream with good aroma and a good sunscreen factor.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I bought this one and cannot get over how good it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Feels good to put it on.</li>
            <li>but it would be good for that.</li>
            <li>It has a great matte finish and is very comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li>Once on, it feels great, like a very light dusting of baby powder.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for great feeling, safe sunscreen for myself and my kids.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen and pray they never discontinue it!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li>IN love and will keep using forever!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen, however, is smooth and silky and felt amazing on my face just like a great moisturizer would.</li>
            <li>: I put this on under my foundation and find that it makes it kind of grip to my skin</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely and</li>
            <li>But it is nice protecting skin from burning, even if i look like a about to fry fish.</li>
            <li>MD Solar Sciences Minteral sunscreens are by far the best sunscreens out there, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I like that this brand is fragrance-free and safe to use on my kids&#x27; skin as well as my own.</li>
            <li>YOU CAN&#x27;T WASH IT OFF EASILY!  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the price has dropped some since, but even now at $310 a kg (about $150 a pound), this stuff BETTER be good.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and stays on well with activity.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a gel it goes on very smoothly under make up or alone.  </li>
            <li>and that is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I use MD Solar Sciences tinted sunscreen gel with their regular non-tinted mineral gel (I mix them together) which makes a perfect match for my skin color.  </li>
            <li>I love this product--I use it as a make-up and sun screen.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I have used the tinted mineral sun screen by the same manufacturer which was perfect.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth but without shine!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of noxiousness, have you ever read the list of ingredients on most sunscreens?  </li>
            <li>It relies mostly on zinc oxide and titanium dioxide for its protection abilities.  </li>
            <li>(Okay, don&#x27;t look too close at the &amp;#34;inactive ingredient list&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s more polysyllabic</li>
            <li>I think that my skin looks and feels better after using it</li>
            <li>It is great protection for them, doesn&#x27;t make them breakout either, and rubs in really well--no &amp;</li>
            <li>have had many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the powder finish.</li>
            <li>Really love the feelings.</li>
            <li>I bought the Mineral Gel sunscreen and am in LOVE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already been through one tube, but have placed an order for five more because I don&#x27;t want to ever run out of this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li>and if you reside in a humid climate!&lt;br /&gt;Its an awesome product as it doubles as sun block and base and the color is great - leaves flawless complexion</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>fast delivery, great product specially for oily skin</li>
            <li>Now I will still need to hunt for a good real gel sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>My make up easily goes on over it.</li>
            <li>I like the light gel of this sunscreen, even better than  a light lotion.  </li>
            <li>I intended to use it with, but I expect it would work fine if it did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this for the WHOLE FAMILY!!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit on the faucet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li>It goes on so light</li>
            <li>important to me for my face.</li>
            <li>The shipment was great because it only took two days although I didn&#x27;t purchase it through prime.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky &amp; smooth to apply on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a great sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t like the white.</li>
            <li>But the &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; part wins my approval :)</li>
            <li>This product is as it sounds MD Solar Mineral, not glamorous  or perfumed, just good old sun protection.</li>
            <li>It is light, blends nicely, and really stays put.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t have the cooling effect like most gels have.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t given it the test of bright sunshine, but it leaves my face with a white look.</li>
            <li>What I found was not only a sunscreen that I could feel good about, but a sunscreen that felt</li>
            <li>But at least it REALLY is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I had to send it back, it just didn&#x27;t feel good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Boy, there&#x27;s so much exciting and useful info on there!    </li>
            <li>One of the most common sunscreen ingredients appears to be hazardous to coral reefs (and they need all the help they can get, right?), and others mimic hormones (kind of like BPA</li>
            <li>it rubs in quickly too and doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all.</li>
            <li>On top of that, there&#x27;s only safe ingredients involved...</li>
            <li>I thought the idea of a sunscreen in the form of a gel was exciting, so I did a quick search and landed on their site.    </li>
            <li>but I think it is worth</li>
            <li>This mineral gel has everything a girl needs: soft, oil-free texture, safe formula, durability and scentless.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I just feel fresh.</li>
            <li>It went on so smooth, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and I never had a breakout--the main reason that I got this in the first place!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something no other sunscreen has been able to do...</li>
            <li>I feel the greasiness when I first apply it, but it does absorb pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Ectually I was so exciting when the first time I put it on my face, and couldn&#x27;t wait to tell my friends with that.</li>
            <li>If you struggle with finding the &#x27;just right&#x27; sunscreen for you, I highly recommend you give this brand a try!!</li>
            <li>I had previously gotten MD SS Mineral Screen Gel TINTED from my dermatologist and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Many of them made my sensitive skin break out or look very oily.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, but I prefer the one with the tint.</li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin, which is highly allergic to many additives and ingredients, including Paba and Paraben.  </li>
            <li>Having tried so many different brands of mineral sunscreen, I found MDSolarSciences and don&#x27;t have to search anymore.     </li>
            <li>I use it in place of regular lotion since it provides me with everything I get from lotion plus more.</li>
            <li>so my make-up stays put-even in hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li>Works very well at protecting my face from burning!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the skin deep recommended sunscreens and this is the best, it does come in a small bottle</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and more or less invisibly</li>
            <li>All the reviews have so many positive thing&#x27;s to say about this product, however I did not have the same luck!</li>
            <li>Since the first time I applied it, the gel felt really soft and cool on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous broad spectrum sun screen.  </li>
            <li>After discovered this product, my 10 yrs old daughter finally will put this on her own because how easy to apply and it won&#x27;t turn her face caky white that she doesn&#x27;t recognized herself in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I /did tons and tons of research before our vacation, looking for the best product that would protect my skin, blend in smoothly, not give me a white face or feel/look greasy, and more importantly, not make me breakout.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to rub on my skin, feels really soft and rubs in quickly without leaving white residue.</li>
            <li>The polysyllabic pharmaceuticals put in these products produces putaminal pain purely parsing out the pronunciation.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE let me know if it is in fact available now or becomes so in the future.  </li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and for a white sunscreen disappears and doesn&#x27;t make me look oily.</li>
            <li>This spreads really well</li>
            <li>It does not smell like sunscreen at all, and goes on like a makeup primer, smooth and matte - yet hydrating at the same time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work if your walking around looking like a zombie.</li>
            <li>But this one is REALLY oil-free.</li>
            <li>I also tried many natural mineral sunscreens but they always made my face look too white.  </li>
            <li>zinc oxide, that greasy, thick, brilliant white paste that lifeguards smear on their cheeks and noses.  </li>
            <li>And since I live in the hot and humid Southeast weather, I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As stated above, I originally got this for myself for a Mexico trip...</li>
            <li>Have tried many other so called &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; sunscreen, and NON of those have lived up to expectation.</li>
            <li>The product does dry very quickly on your face like someone else said in a review.</li>
            <li>It is highly sweatproof, and unlike mainstream sunscreens it doesn&#x27;t sting like acid when it gets in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is also highly water resistant, but I do re-apply it after swimming just for safety&#x27;s sake.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a few more tubes now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, with my health and the environment in mind, I went in search of a new sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I love how the texture of it is like velvet, not a hint of shine when applied and it actually acts a little like a primer/oil absorber under my makeup.</li>
            <li>Unlike other sunscreens, it is easy to apply and does not leave a white film on my face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and combination skin with oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>This is really soft on face, and never greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural sunscreen that would not flake or roll under my makeup.</li>
            <li>sunscreen makes your skin feel as smooth as velvet, blends well, and doesn&#x27;t feel harsh.</li>
            <li>I read good reviews on this product, so I decided to purchase it although it is really expensive according to my budget.</li>
            <li>I have searched and searched for safe sunscreen for under makeup that doesn&#x27;t cause an oil slick on my face or turn it white.</li>
            <li>So much junk in sunscreen and this one is very low on the \\&quot;danger\\&quot; scale - rated a 2 out of 10 which is considered low to no risk.  </li>
            <li>what \\&quot;broad spectrum\\&quot; or \\&quot;mineral sunscreen\\&quot; meant.    </li>
            <li>My first choice was this sunscreen because the SPF 30+ seemed reasonable enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li>(maybe a slight sheen / sparkle, but heck, with all the fuss about sparkly vampires in Forks, WA, sparkly is kinda &amp;#34;in&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old zinc oxide, only less white than that, but still very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this sunscreen at my dermatologist&#x27;s office last summer and thought it would be thick and oily like most of the other sunscreens I had purchased in the past.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> On top of that, there&#x27;s only safe ingredients involved...</li>
            <li> I thought the idea of a sunscreen in the form of a gel was exciting, so I did a quick search and landed on their site.    </li>
            <li> but I think it is worth</li>
            <li> This mineral gel has everything a girl needs: soft, oil-free texture, safe formula, durability and scentless.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I just feel fresh.</li>
            <li> It went on so smooth, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and I never had a breakout--the main reason that I got this in the first place!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something no other sunscreen has been able to do...</li>
            <li> I feel the greasiness when I first apply it, but it does absorb pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Ectually I was so exciting when the first time I put it on my face, and couldn&#x27;t wait to tell my friends with that.</li>
            <li> If you struggle with finding the &#x27;just right&#x27; sunscreen for you, I highly recommend you give this brand a try!!</li>
            <li> I had previously gotten MD SS Mineral Screen Gel TINTED from my dermatologist and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Many of them made my sensitive skin break out or look very oily.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, but I prefer the one with the tint.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin, which is highly allergic to many additives and ingredients, including Paba and Paraben.  </li>
            <li> Having tried so many different brands of mineral sunscreen, I found MDSolarSciences and don&#x27;t have to search anymore.     </li>
            <li> I use it in place of regular lotion since it provides me with everything I get from lotion plus more.</li>
            <li> so my make-up stays put-even in hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> Works very well at protecting my face from burning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the skin deep recommended sunscreens and this is the best, it does come in a small bottle</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and more or less invisibly</li>
            <li> All the reviews have so many positive thing&#x27;s to say about this product, however I did not have the same luck!</li>
            <li> Since the first time I applied it, the gel felt really soft and cool on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous broad spectrum sun screen.  </li>
            <li> After discovered this product, my 10 yrs old daughter finally will put this on her own because how easy to apply and it won&#x27;t turn her face caky white that she doesn&#x27;t recognized herself in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I /did tons and tons of research before our vacation, looking for the best product that would protect my skin, blend in smoothly, not give me a white face or feel/look greasy, and more importantly, not make me breakout.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to rub on my skin, feels really soft and rubs in quickly without leaving white residue.</li>
            <li> The polysyllabic pharmaceuticals put in these products produces putaminal pain purely parsing out the pronunciation.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE let me know if it is in fact available now or becomes so in the future.  </li>
            <li> It goes on really smoothly and for a white sunscreen disappears and doesn&#x27;t make me look oily.</li>
            <li> This spreads really well</li>
            <li> It does not smell like sunscreen at all, and goes on like a makeup primer, smooth and matte - yet hydrating at the same time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work if your walking around looking like a zombie.</li>
            <li> But this one is REALLY oil-free.</li>
            <li> I also tried many natural mineral sunscreens but they always made my face look too white.  </li>
            <li> zinc oxide, that greasy, thick, brilliant white paste that lifeguards smear on their cheeks and noses.  </li>
            <li> And since I live in the hot and humid Southeast weather, I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As stated above, I originally got this for myself for a Mexico trip...</li>
            <li> Have tried many other so called &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; sunscreen, and NON of those have lived up to expectation.</li>
            <li> The product does dry very quickly on your face like someone else said in a review.</li>
            <li> It is highly sweatproof, and unlike mainstream sunscreens it doesn&#x27;t sting like acid when it gets in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is also highly water resistant, but I do re-apply it after swimming just for safety&#x27;s sake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering a few more tubes now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, with my health and the environment in mind, I went in search of a new sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I love how the texture of it is like velvet, not a hint of shine when applied and it actually acts a little like a primer/oil absorber under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Unlike other sunscreens, it is easy to apply and does not leave a white film on my face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and combination skin with oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> This is really soft on face, and never greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural sunscreen that would not flake or roll under my makeup.</li>
            <li> sunscreen makes your skin feel as smooth as velvet, blends well, and doesn&#x27;t feel harsh.</li>
            <li> I read good reviews on this product, so I decided to purchase it although it is really expensive according to my budget.</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for safe sunscreen for under makeup that doesn&#x27;t cause an oil slick on my face or turn it white.</li>
            <li> So much junk in sunscreen and this one is very low on the \\&quot;danger\\&quot; scale - rated a 2 out of 10 which is considered low to no risk.  </li>
            <li> what \\&quot;broad spectrum\\&quot; or \\&quot;mineral sunscreen\\&quot; meant.    </li>
            <li> My first choice was this sunscreen because the SPF 30+ seemed reasonable enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li> (maybe a slight sheen / sparkle, but heck, with all the fuss about sparkly vampires in Forks, WA, sparkly is kinda &amp;#34;in&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old zinc oxide, only less white than that, but still very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this sunscreen at my dermatologist&#x27;s office last summer and thought it would be thick and oily like most of the other sunscreens I had purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> ; I use it on their faces and the dry spray for their bodies, however, it is for the entire body.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I should have applied more, but I got a little red-I don&#x27;t usually get red.</li>
            <li> There were no white marks or streaks on my face from the product like there are with other facial sunscreens.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you will have a tough time getting the white residue to blend away.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or caused a single breakout.  </li>
            <li> It could be a little more expensive than other sunscreen,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> The only caution to note-a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I only use it on my face and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It actually felt very dry, almost like it made my skin feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li> so the slight white cast this gives me is no biggie</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I never really thought about alternatives to the mainstream sun protection products out there.  </li>
            <li> and you only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I was searching for a mineral product due to concerns about chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> No shine on my face as all the other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious, google sunscreen ratings and see where your typical sunscreen rates - it will scare you.  </li>
            <li> Every sunny day, I would dutifully smear, spray or slather some sticky, greasy, noxious aerosol, cream, or lotion on my exposed areas and put up with the stickiness, greasiness, and noxiousness (really, I remember one or two products that stripped the paint of my camera and ate through some plastic/rubbery stuff, not to mention the weird stains that products leave on clothes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I would like a little color ..</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy</li>
            <li> and I would get very dark on my nose and cheecks.  </li>
            <li> This one is my family choice for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear sunscreen because it feels greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> The texture is really slick, I think from silicones?</li>
            <li> During the week I&#x27;m usually in and out of the my work office.</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s not exactly cheap... I stick to my face!</li>
            <li> and I have very uneven pigment.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face white and pasty, you look 20 years older, and the worst part is</li>
            <li> you hardly know it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li> My makeup had a hard time going over it too, it didn&#x27;t blend or move at all.</li>
            <li> For most of us it is a necessary evil, needed to prevent premature aging of the skin and reduce the risk of skin cancer, as well as to avoid painful sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I now order at least three bottles at a time for the summer months for my kids.  </li>
            <li> You can imagine how irritating it can be to have to wash your face numerous times to get this awful white paste off.  </li>
            <li> so I never worry about irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Well, I was actually trying to find a gel sunscreen for my body because I hate the greasiness of lotion and the spray (tried Neutrogena, Banana Boat, Coppertone Sport, etc).</li>
            <li> It is to expensive to use on the body.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run in the kids eyes, isn&#x27;t sticky or uncomfortable on their skin and they don&#x27;t complain when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> However, I was really disappointed when I see the texture because it looks and feels like a cream.</li>
            <li> and I hate the texture/greasiness.</li>
            <li> It is terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> if you&#x27;re idea of wearing sunblock is looking like a clown this is the product for you. if not get the tinted version.</li>
            <li> MD Solar Sciences Minteral sunscreens are by far the best sunscreens out there, in my opinion. I have searched for years for a sunscreen that left a matte finish and this is the only one that does it.  All the chemically based sunscreens always leave a sheen on my face and I was always having to blot that off (which probably defeats the purpose since each time I did that, I was wiping off the sun protection!).  I also tried many natural mineral sunscreens but they always made my face look too white.  I use MD Solar Sciences tinted sunscreen gel with their regular non-tinted mineral gel (I mix them together) which makes a perfect match for my skin color.  I literally use this for my foundation every day!  I love this sunscreen and pray they never discontinue it!  If you struggle with finding the &#x27;just right&#x27; sunscreen for you, I highly recommend you give this brand a try!!</li>
            <li> I love this product--I use it as a make-up and sun screen.  It has a great matte finish and is very comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not a gel. Not the gel that wanted to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Is a non-greasy cream with good aroma and a good sunscreen factor.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit on the faucet I intended to use it with, but I expect it would work fine if it did.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and stays on all day.  This product is as it sounds MD Solar Mineral, not glamorous  or perfumed, just good old sun protection.</li>
            <li> I had previously gotten MD SS Mineral Screen Gel TINTED from my dermatologist and loved it.  Thought that is what I ordered from Amazon, but it is white.  The tinted does not even appear to be for sale.  PLEASE let me know if it is in fact available now or becomes so in the future.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works excellent when used on the face.  It is to expensive to use on the body.  I use the MD SolarScience Mineral Screen Lotion for the body.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this sunscreen at my dermatologist&#x27;s office last summer and thought it would be thick and oily like most of the other sunscreens I had purchased in the past. This sunscreen, however, is smooth and silky and felt amazing on my face just like a great moisturizer would. There were no white marks or streaks on my face from the product like there are with other facial sunscreens. I actually use this sunscreen every day under my makeup (something I had never done before even though my doctor had recommended it).  I put my makeup on over it and the makeup stays put and doesn&#x27;t run.  I recently traveled to Arizona where my children and I used the sunscreen every day and not one of us had any sunburn even after hiking for 3 hours in the blazing sun! My daughter and I even use it in the part of our hair and it does not leave our hair greasy at all. I am so glad to have found this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for great feeling, safe sunscreen for myself and my kids.  So much junk in sunscreen and this one is very low on the \\&quot;danger\\&quot; scale - rated a 2 out of 10 which is considered low to no risk.  If you&#x27;re curious, google sunscreen ratings and see where your typical sunscreen rates - it will scare you.  Anyway, I bought this one and cannot get over how good it feels on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t run in the kids eyes, isn&#x27;t sticky or uncomfortable on their skin and they don&#x27;t complain when I put it on.  It is pricey at 23 bucks a pop but I think it is worth is and I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase it.  I&#x27;m ordering a few more tubes now.</li>
            <li> Before I learned of MDSolarSciences, I had no idea what \\&quot;broad spectrum\\&quot; or \\&quot;mineral sunscreen\\&quot; meant.    I thought the idea of a sunscreen in the form of a gel was exciting, so I did a quick search and landed on their site.    Boy, there&#x27;s so much exciting and useful info on there!    My first choice was this sunscreen because the SPF 30+ seemed reasonable enough for everyday use. Since the first time I applied it, the gel felt really soft and cool on my skin. That&#x27;s something no other sunscreen has been able to do...it rubs in quickly too and doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all. On top of that, there&#x27;s only safe ingredients involved...so I never worry about irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used the tinted mineral sun screen by the same manufacturer which was perfect.  I tried this one because I thought it would please me the same.  It is terrible.  It makes your face white and pasty, you look 20 years older, and the worst part is YOU CAN&#x27;T WASH IT OFF EASILY!  The specific reason why I am buying mineral sunscreen is because of my allergies.  You can imagine how irritating it can be to have to wash your face numerous times to get this awful white paste off.  I would NEVER recommend it.  I&#x27;m going to return the 2nd box I bought (together).  What a mistake!</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen, 365 days of the year.  I also have extremely sensitive skin, which is highly allergic to many additives and ingredients, including Paba and Paraben.  This mineral-based product seems to be the answer.  It is neither greasy nor pore clogging. Unlike other sunscreens, it is easy to apply and does not leave a white film on my face.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and stays on well with activity.  My make up easily goes on over it. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Its non greasy and wont clog pores! It goes on smooth but without shine! I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous broad spectrum sun screen.  I&#x27;ve used it for 5 years and I have very uneven pigment.  Because it&#x27;s a gel it goes on very smoothly under make up or alone.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Sunscreen.  For most of us it is a necessary evil, needed to prevent premature aging of the skin and reduce the risk of skin cancer, as well as to avoid painful sunburn.  I have to admit that I never really thought about alternatives to the mainstream sun protection products out there.  Every sunny day, I would dutifully smear, spray or slather some sticky, greasy, noxious aerosol, cream, or lotion on my exposed areas and put up with the stickiness, greasiness, and noxiousness (really, I remember one or two products that stripped the paint of my camera and ate through some plastic/rubbery stuff, not to mention the weird stains that products leave on clothes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of noxiousness, have you ever read the list of ingredients on most sunscreens?  The polysyllabic pharmaceuticals put in these products produces putaminal pain purely parsing out the pronunciation.  Alliteration aside, any assessment (wait... I said alliteration aside, didn&#x27;t I?) of their environmental impact?  I learned about it from a report that I read in National Geographic.  One of the most common sunscreen ingredients appears to be hazardous to coral reefs (and they need all the help they can get, right?), and others mimic hormones (kind of like BPA seems to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with my health and the environment in mind, I went in search of a new sunscreen.  I had the help of a website called EWG dot org.  What I found was not only a sunscreen that I could feel good about, but a sunscreen that felt good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MD Solar Sciences Mineral Screen Gel is a mineral type sunscreen.  It relies mostly on zinc oxide and titanium dioxide for its protection abilities.  I know... zinc oxide, that greasy, thick, brilliant white paste that lifeguards smear on their cheeks and noses.  But wait!  This stuff isn&#x27;t like that. (Okay, don&#x27;t look too close at the &amp;#34;inactive ingredient list&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s more polysyllabic potage.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MD Solar Sciences Mineral Screen Gel has &amp;#34;micronized&amp;#34; zincoxide.  It goes on smoothly and more or less invisibly (maybe a slight sheen / sparkle, but heck, with all the fuss about sparkly vampires in Forks, WA, sparkly is kinda &amp;#34;in&amp;#34;).  Once on, it feels great, like a very light dusting of baby powder.  I think that my skin looks and feels better after using it (I tend to break out, but not after using this product).  It is highly sweatproof, and unlike mainstream sunscreens it doesn&#x27;t sting like acid when it gets in my eyes.  It is also highly water resistant, but I do re-apply it after swimming just for safety&#x27;s sake.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave stains on my clothes or gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to MD Solar Sciences is the price.  When I bought three tubes from Amazon in 2012, the total before shipping came to $69!  Fortunately the price has dropped some since, but even now at $310 a kg (about $150 a pound), this stuff BETTER be good.</li>
            <li> I /did tons and tons of research before our vacation, looking for the best product that would protect my skin, blend in smoothly, not give me a white face or feel/look greasy, and more importantly, not make me breakout. I was EXTREMELY HAPPY that I was led to MD SOLAR SCIENCES MINERAL SCREEN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated above, I originally got this for myself for a Mexico trip...I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  It went on so smooth, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and I never had a breakout--the main reason that I got this in the first place! I now order at least three bottles at a time for the summer months for my kids.  It is great protection for them, doesn&#x27;t make them breakout either, and rubs in really well--no &amp;#34;ghost face!&amp;#34; I use it on their faces and the dry spray for their bodies, however, it is for the entire body. I LOVE this for the WHOLE FAMILY!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this! I love how the texture of it is like velvet, not a hint of shine when applied and it actually acts a little like a primer/oil absorber under my makeup. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out and that is a huge plus! I will continue buying this. I would also like to try the tinted version. I&#x27;m light skinned so the slight white cast this gives me is no biggie but I would like a little color ..I bet the tinted version is amazing!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily under makeup.  I like it very much, but I prefer the one with the tint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this sunscreen, it&#x27;s all mineral, not chemical, which is what I was looking for. The texture is really slick, I think from silicones? It goes on really smoothly and for a white sunscreen disappears and doesn&#x27;t make me look oily. I was actually trying to buy the tinted version, and got this one instead. I will use up and get the tinted next.</li>
            <li> This product gives all day coverage .I have had many compliments.I use under my makeup and it keeps a  &amp;#34;fresh look&amp;#34; all day</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me about this brand so I recently purchased a set of different MD SolarSciences sunscreens. This one is my family choice for everyday use. During the week I&#x27;m usually in and out of the my work office. Since I drive to work, I get a lot of sun exposure. I like to apply it after showing, about 15 minutes before leaving the house. It&#x27;s easy to rub on my skin, feels really soft and rubs in quickly without leaving white residue. I also apply it before leaving work for extra protection since sunscreen is likely to wear off. I like that this brand is fragrance-free and safe to use on my kids&#x27; skin as well as my own.</li>
            <li> Having tried so many different brands of mineral sunscreen, I found MDSolarSciences and don&#x27;t have to search anymore.     This mineral gel has everything a girl needs: soft, oil-free texture, safe formula, durability and scentless.  I use it in place of regular lotion since it provides me with everything I get from lotion plus more. I&#x27;ll probably go through a hundred tubes of this stuff before the year ends...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several sunscreens at every price point. Many of them made my sensitive skin break out or look very oily. This hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or caused a single breakout.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like a gel, as the name implies, but just a non-greasy lotion-with no noticeable scent. It is light, blends nicely, and really stays put. Bonus: I put this on under my foundation and find that it makes it kind of grip to my skin so my make-up stays put-even in hot, humid weather. The only caution to note-a little goes a long way. If you use too much, you will have a tough time getting the white residue to blend away.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in the sun riding bicycles and I would get very dark on my nose and cheecks.  I don&#x27;t like to wear sunscreen because it feels greasy and heavy.  This one was recommended by a dermatologist.  It goes on so light you hardly know it&#x27;s there.  It is also water proof so I won&#x27;t sweat it off.  It is a little pricy but I only use it on my face and a little bit goes a long way.  It is definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I want to slather it over every inch of me before I go outside but since it&#x27;s not exactly cheap... I stick to my face! This spreads really well and you only have to use a small amount. I love the powder finish. No smell either. I just feel fresh. You could wear this before work or the beach. It feels great. I will continue using this product for years!</li>
            <li> I like the light gel of this sunscreen, even better than  a light lotion.  It spreads nicely and&lt;br /&gt;smoothly over my face &amp; neck.  It could be a little more expensive than other sunscreen,&lt;br /&gt;but important to me for my face.</li>
            <li> Im medium skin toned and it doesnt blend well. But it is nice protecting skin from burning, even if i look like a about to fry fish.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and combination skin with oily T-zone. I hate to wear greasy or oily sunscreen, and I never found a sunscreen I am happy to use include the ones from lancome and Estee Arden, until this one. This is really soft on face, and never greasy at all. Really love the feelings. Ectually I was so exciting when the first time I put it on my face, and couldn&#x27;t wait to tell my friends with that.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural sunscreen that would not flake or roll under my makeup. Additionally, I was searching for a mineral product due to concerns about chemical sunscreens. I bought the Mineral Gel sunscreen and am in LOVE. I&#x27;ve already been through one tube, but have placed an order for five more because I don&#x27;t want to ever run out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen makes your skin feel as smooth as velvet, blends well, and doesn&#x27;t feel harsh.</li>
            <li> No shine on my face as all the other products I&#x27;ve used.  Feels good to put it on. I will be buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this and it does not clog pores. I am not sure if I should have applied more, but I got a little red-I don&#x27;t usually get red. But at least it REALLY is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Well, I was actually trying to find a gel sunscreen for my body because I hate the greasiness of lotion and the spray (tried Neutrogena, Banana Boat, Coppertone Sport, etc). And since I live in the hot and humid Southeast weather, I sweat a lot. I read good reviews on this product, so I decided to purchase it although it is really expensive according to my budget. The shipment was great because it only took two days although I didn&#x27;t purchase it through prime. However, I was really disappointed when I see the texture because it looks and feels like a cream. It certainly doesn&#x27;t have the cooling effect like most gels have. I feel the greasiness when I first apply it, but it does absorb pretty quickly. I definitely won&#x27;t wear it on my face since I have an oily skin and my BB cream already has spf 30 in it. Definitely not on my body because it will only last for approx. two applications and I hate the texture/greasiness. I don&#x27;t want to return it because it is a pain, so I will use it for my hands. Now I will still need to hunt for a good real gel sunscreen.</li>
            <li> All the reviews have so many positive thing&#x27;s to say about this product, however I did not have the same luck! The product does dry very quickly on your face like someone else said in a review. It actually felt very dry, almost like it made my skin feel tight and dry. My makeup had a hard time going over it too, it didn&#x27;t blend or move at all. I had to send it back, it just didn&#x27;t feel good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Always on the lookout for best, safe, EWG.org would approved sunscreen.  I&#x27;m soooo glad I found this product.  It&#x27;s silky &amp; smooth to apply on.  After discovered this product, my 10 yrs old daughter finally will put this on her own because how easy to apply and it won&#x27;t turn her face caky white that she doesn&#x27;t recognized herself in the mirror.  Great product!</li>
            <li> fast delivery, great product specially for oily skin and if you reside in a humid climate!&lt;br /&gt;Its an awesome product as it doubles as sun block and base and the color is great - leaves flawless complexion</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best sunscreens I have ever used. It does not smell like sunscreen at all, and goes on like a makeup primer, smooth and matte - yet hydrating at the same time. Works very well at protecting my face from burning! IN love and will keep using forever!</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for safe sunscreen for under makeup that doesn&#x27;t cause an oil slick on my face or turn it white. This is non greasy and won&#x27;t make your face shine all day. It&#x27;s velvety smooth. I do not have oily skin by the way but it would be good for that. I&#x27;ve tried all the skin deep recommended sunscreens and this is the best, it does come in a small bottle so I am just using it on my face and a different one on the body</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t given it the test of bright sunshine, but it leaves my face with a white look. It reminds me of the old zinc oxide, only less white than that, but still very noticeable. It&#x27;s probably a great sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t like the white.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face white. It doesn&#x27;t really work if your walking around looking like a zombie. No wonder people stared!&lt;br /&gt;I gave 2 stars because of its smoothness.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sun screen that won&#x27;t break out my skin. I finally found it.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have tried many other so called &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; sunscreen, and NON of those have lived up to expectation. But this one is REALLY oil-free. No shine for someone who has oily skin, matte finish. And it does NOT irritate skin as chemical sunblock does. Only draw-back is it does leave you a white residue. But the &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; part wins my approval :)</li>
            <li> I love this product...now I don&#x27;t have to go to the dermatologist to get it!&lt;br /&gt;Would order again and again.</li>
            <li> Was looking for sunscreen gel, which by the name this would indicate.  However, this is not a gel, its a lotion.</li>
