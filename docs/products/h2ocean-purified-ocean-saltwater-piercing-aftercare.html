            <li>So i just wanted to point that out :)</li>
            <li>(a bigger one :)!!!)</li>
            <li>This is much easier to use than making salt water on your own.</li>
            <li>seem to keep things very clean, but I like to keep a can of this for papercuts and surface wounds - very soothing!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed not having to go through the trouble of making my own solution.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the phone number on the invoice goes straight to a message without a ring and states the mail box is full.</li>
            <li>Funny how the size now has 1.5 oz.</li>
            <li>no problem the first time .</li>
            <li>The can was smaller than expected but it still is pretty good....</li>
            <li>It seemed to help better than my other cleaning routines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it says and looks like, if you really need this get a bigger spray bottle.</li>
            <li>was smaller than expected and cost more will not buy again picture</li>
            <li>this my second review because on the first one I thought my package got lost</li>
            <li>came couple days of ordering it,  have to say it was a little smaller than expected but other that that it was great</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s very convenient!</li>

            <li> The only down side was that because of the size/amount in it, it only lasted about 2 weeks.</li>

            <li> I use this product all the time - I found out about it after I got a monroe piercing, and it works well for acne and other skin issues.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I guess I was being impatient</li>
            <li> It was not authentic.</li>
            <li> False advertisement to say the least.</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive for how small it is.</li>
            <li> BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE 1.5 OZ CAN WAS SHIPPED.  </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy and this seems like thievery.</li>
            <li> It also smelled horrible.</li>

            <li> Amazinggggg! Gets the Job done</li>
            <li> False advertisement to say the least. I demand my 4oz. that I paid for. Funny how the size now has 1.5 oz. I know I saw and was ordering 4 0z bottle. I am very unhappy and this seems like thievery. Oh, and the phone number on the invoice goes straight to a message without a ring and states the mail box is full. Don&#x27;t buy it. Don&#x27;t trust them.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use this on a piercing it never gets infected definitely sanitizes the area</li>
            <li> I love it! Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll work for your piercings. It&#x27;s exactly what it says and looks like, if you really need this get a bigger spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed not having to go through the trouble of making my own solution. I would suggest it to anyone with piercing</li>
            <li> This is much easier to use than making salt water on your own. 10/10 will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was not authentic. It also smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive for how small it is.</li>
            <li> Shipped in with in 2 days and works great</li>
            <li> good for healing piercings</li>
            <li> works well for my piercing and i&#x27;m definitely going to reorder again in the future and i would recommend it</li>
            <li> Ive gotten this before and it works magic on my piercings! I accidentally bought the 1.5oz but it wasnt their fault... I just didnt read the info. After i bought it i realized. I was looking at other H2Ocean stuff and found the same 1.5oz for $9.99 and then the one that I bought was around $7.00. So i just wanted to point that out :) but in all this product works perfect!</li>
            <li> It seemed to help better than my other cleaning routines. The only down side was that because of the size/amount in it, it only lasted about 2 weeks. Other than that, it&#x27;s very convenient!</li>
            <li> this is my second time ordering this product . no problem the first time . but I ordered the 2.6 oz this time rather than the 1.5 oz , yet still recieved the 1.5 oz .</li>
            <li> was smaller than expected and cost more will not buy again picture made them look bigger than they were</li>
            <li> Excellent for care of nose piercing.  Works wonders!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time - I found out about it after I got a monroe piercing, and it works well for acne and other skin issues.  For some reason I believed that I was ordering a four ounce can, but the shipping and service were fantastic This seller gets an excellent rating from me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems at all and my piercing is almost healed. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with piercings.</li>
            <li> I thought it would last longer then a week. I only used it once a day as well. Why would I pay 8$ for something that lasted only a week. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING THE 4 OZ SPRAY BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE 1.5 OZ CAN WAS SHIPPED.  LOOKS LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE SO BEWARE!</li>
            <li> The can was smaller than expected but it still is pretty good....this my second review because on the first one I thought my package got lost but I guess I was being impatient but I will be buying another can soon (a bigger one :)!!!)</li>
            <li> I was given a can of this by the woman who pierced my navel for me and it was a Godsend. It kept the whole area clean and infection free, and whenever the site felt the least bit uncomfortable, one little spray eased it all. Now, I&#x27;m all healed up and my daily lap swim in a salt-filtered pool seem to keep things very clean, but I like to keep a can of this for papercuts and surface wounds - very soothing!</li>
            <li> came couple days of ordering it,  have to say it was a little smaller than expected but other that that it was great</li>
