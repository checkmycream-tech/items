            <li>and it works really well and does not cause any type of reaction.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t mark it up like the high dollar garbage that doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and wish I could find it here in the states as well...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, the cream really is great, it&#x27;s the cost and customs that are questionable and</li>
            <li>This is gentle stuff, yet leaves your skin dewy and soft.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait to get it from UK, the only place that makes it.</li>

            <li> Amazing product! Softens as well as healing.</li>
            <li> Worked very well on sides of fingers affected by eczema. Scaling reduced after one use, and within a week completely eliminated it.</li>
            <li> U used this cream wen I lived in Scotland and am so glad to be able to get it here. It is wonderful and not expensive!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for super dry skin. Too bad I can&#x27;t find it any place here in the US. This was the perfect size for my purse.</li>
            <li> I like the tube and carry it in my pocket book.  I have psoriasis and have used it on my feet for the flaky dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely tell my friends to use it</li>
            <li> This is one of these creams that just hydrate without any unpleasant chemicals. Worth the wait to get it from UK, the only place that makes it.</li>
            <li> After years of searching and too many products later, with skin damage from high dollar name brand goop, my wife&#x27;s sister recommend this goop to my wife. This goop actually works !!! I even tried it and it worked on me too. Amazing, Somebody made an affordable goop that actually works. Now, to all the corporate geniuses at E 45 cream company. DON&#x27;T SCREW IT UP AND MAKE IT NEW AND IMPROVED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t mark it up like the high dollar garbage that doesn&#x27;t work either. If you have a brain somewhere in those skulls of yours, word of mouth will make this the best selling goop on the planet. Don&#x27;t waste money advertising and raising the price to pay for the lame ads. Let the marketplace and word of mouth do it&#x27;s thing. All you geniuses have to do it keep it affordable and don&#x27;t &amp;#34; New and improve &amp;#34; the formula. How you corporate geniuses justify your big salaries with your dumb ideas is a dis-service to the folks who work for a living. Every time my wife has found a product she likes and actually works, the companies discontinue it and replace it with something that is garbage. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it !!!</li>
            <li> This cream is great!  My dad has very dry skin on his legs and he only uses this product!  It has actually reduced the dryness after only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful to only use on affected areas!</li>
            <li> I definitely like this cream because it is odorless and non-greasy and it helps to heal dry calloused skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The turn off is the price, shipping cost and the man handling by customs is a turn off. When I got the tube, the box was ripped and had finger prints on it - obviously customs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if I wanted cheaper I would buy the 250g jar rather than the 50g tube, but I do not know how much more the shipping cost will be given the heavier container - research before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the cream really is great, it&#x27;s the cost and customs that are questionable and that is why the 4 stars. The cream is worth 5.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I had a dry patch on my face for months after a bad sunburn. Nothing worked until I tried E45 cream and it literally cleared it up in days! I live in the US now, thank goodness I can order it through Amazon. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Heard this was a great cream. Waited for shipment from Europe to US. Within days of use, my daughter broke out in a rash.  She is NOT prone to allergic reactions.  Was hoping it would be the answer, just added another issue. We&#x27;ll keep on looking.</li>
            <li> Great cream if your really dry</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the best product I ever used. I tried it in England and was amazed how gently it was for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay so far am not quite sure if it&#x27;s helping or not, I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s finished</li>
            <li> Product is excellent for med to light dried skin.  Received timely and all good.</li>
            <li> My baby girl had had issues with Eczema all her life,  she&#x27;s 14, and on our cruise to Bohamas she broke out in her arms,  being her legs,  like usual, with horrible, red, itchi, Open sores l. I remember at every port,  I stopped at every pharmacy to ask what was available to help het eczema, until I found a humble looking pharmacy at one of the ports, Belize and I asked the pharmacist, who happen to be an  &amp;#34;American &amp;#34; if they had anything for eczema. She adked if we had tried E-45, I said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; not available in the States, I reluctantly bought it. I had tried so many different prescriptions steroidsand nothing seems to work for her. I was  of skeptical about putting anything on my baby girls skin. The pharmacist talked/educated me about it.  ToldMrthere are no side effects,  no steroid.  We Loved it. Within 30 to 40 minutes my baby&#x27;s skin began to improve,  clear up and in a 24 hour period her skin healing and improving. I am so thankful to God for putting this product in my path.</li>
            <li> Very useful for traveling and keeps the dryness in check with no messy problems. Good price but small amount sent.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those with very sensitive skin!  The redness in my skin is literally not there anymore.  This is gentle stuff, yet leaves your skin dewy and soft.</li>
            <li> I love it and only use E45 Cream on my face.  Now one of my sons is using it on his face, as well.  Was introduced to it years ago when I lived in Britain for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Deborah Lawlor</li>
            <li> fabulous. I have psoriasis on my knuckles and until I got this no medication prescribed did anything.  I highly recommend this and wish I could find it here in the states as well...</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would help my daughters eczema but it didn&#x27;t.  It is a good hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The E45 has always met my expectations (for the last year, or so) for an effective, reasonably priced treatment for psoriasis. It is &amp; has been a soothing, comforting, treatment. And like it&#x27;s competitors, not a cure.</li>
            <li> It was awesome.  My husband had been battling psoriasis on his elbows, knees, shins, and behind his ears.  We saw an improvement after one week on the E45 Cream. After a month, it is almost gone from all parts.</li>
            <li> I was advised to buy this cream to help with treatment of a burn while in Scotland and I have been using it ever since. I have very sensitive facial skin and it works really well and does not cause any type of reaction. The smell is clean and not too strong.  This is definitely my go to cream whenever I have any dryness on my face.</li>
