            <li>For a nice full look be sure and order two sets.</li>
            <li>I love them :) they are worth the price &amp; the wait.</li>
            <li>but they untangle so easily.</li>
            <li>They clip in easy and they&#x27;ll stay in.</li>
            <li>/melt they are still perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Love them!!!!got them yesterday about a week after ordering and put them in right away</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s not as bright as the red color pictured.</li>
            <li>Just wish I could curl them but other than that their great</li>
            <li>It is very pretty when you get it.</li>
            <li>They also shed but how can you really care considering how cheap these are.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely worth the couple bucks.</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>Very silky and quick delivery</li>
            <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend you to hot iron them</li>
            <li>Im definitely Buying more</li>
            <li>i thought they would be more red but found em more on the pink side.</li>
            <li>Really long.. love how it look when it&#x27;s on my hair</li>
            <li>Came in the mail fast</li>
            <li>they are a little on the pink side byt still so pretty and soft for the price they are great</li>
            <li>the hair falls out easily and hard to wash, they&#x27;re okay for maybe a costume of some sort but definetly not for daily use.</li>
            <li>The color is so vibrant and it is so nice to add a touch of color to my hair when I am feeling edgy.</li>
            <li>Waaaaay too shiny to be passed off as real or natural looking hair.</li>
            <li>Get tangled way to easy but would definitely get for a one night only type thing</li>
            <li>These are super long and shiny.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and shiny</li>
            <li>and they are soo soft!</li>
            <li>but it is the exact same color</li>
            <li>I can only wear them when I style my hair straight.</li>
            <li>they save me so much trouble so much money and so much headache</li>
            <li>Super waste of money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting red in my hair for quite some time but the red was just never taking properly and if I did happen to get lucky enough to get red</li>
            <li>Absolutely loveeeee paid for expected shipping ordered 11 at night on the 3rd</li>
            <li>the color is as shown although they get tangled very easily.. and look fake when not in a braid, ect.</li>
            <li>They look real enough and they&#x27;re soft and don&#x27;t tangle as long as you keep them hung up somewhere</li>

            <li> The other set I have are 100% human hair</li>
            <li> They only sent me half of what I ordered</li>
            <li> I love the color and they aren&#x27;t that bad in price.</li>
            <li> They arrived faster than expected being as they were shipped from China!</li>
            <li> But the clips are so hard to open and close</li>
            <li> The color however was a little off</li>
            <li> Can anyone offer a few tips.</li>
            <li> yes they get frizzy after a few wears but nothing some products can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> I was skeptical due to the low price</li>
            <li> Really tacky looking and feels like nasty dried hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> not how its advertised in the picture and hair quality is not great</li>
            <li> Wrong color than shown.</li>
            <li> I got sick and tired of making three trips alone to the hair salon and spending $400 a trip</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really fake looking and awful tangles.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>

            <li> I love them :) they are worth the price &amp; the wait. Just wish I could curl them but other than that their great</li>
            <li> LOVE the hair! The color is so vibrant and it is so nice to add a touch of color to my hair when I am feeling edgy. I don&#x27;t clip them all in just two pieces in the front to add a pop and frame my face. I get compliments ALL the time. The only thing that you cannot do is style them AT ALL. I can only wear them when I style my hair straight. The other set I have are 100% human hair and I can curl them, or straighten them but I paid $100. So this is a good cheap alternative. Recommend!</li>
            <li> For the price these extensions are amazing!! Came in the mail fast and they are soo soft! They even came with extra clips. The color however was a little off i thought they would be more red but found em more on the pink side. These are super long and shiny. They will get tangled if you wear them all day long but they untangle so easily. They also shed but how can you really care considering how cheap these are.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Wrong color than shown. Shed a ton. Shiny as all hell.</li>
            <li> terrible. not anything what i wanted</li>
            <li> the color is as shown although they get tangled very easily.. and look fake when not in a braid, ect. the hair falls out easily and hard to wash, they&#x27;re okay for maybe a costume of some sort but definetly not for daily use.</li>
            <li> These are great!  They clip in easy and they&#x27;ll stay in. I love the color and they aren&#x27;t that bad in price. Looking forward to buying more from them.</li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t match my hair but it is the exact same color so I was extremely happy.  They came earlier then they were supposed too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, I took the chances of ruining my hair extensions you can curl them. I decided to kremp them I only did it for about 10-15 seconds on low heat cause I don&#x27;t want to ruin them &amp; they did not fry/melt they are still perfectly fine. Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend you to hot iron them 24/7 though.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty when you get it. But the clips are so hard to open and close it hurts your fingers and scalp. It is very soft and shiny</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> they are absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve been wanting red in my hair for quite some time but the red was just never taking properly and if I did happen to get lucky enough to get red it would fade out in like 2 days I got sick and tired of making three trips alone to the hair salon and spending $400 a trip so I decided to buy these they save me so much trouble so much money and so much headache and they&#x27;re absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Amazing for the price!!! They are soft and easy to style. My only problem is that I have never used extensions before and don&#x27;t know how to get them to clip into my hair. Can anyone offer a few tips.</li>
            <li> Love them!!!!got them yesterday about a week after ordering and put them in right away they are a little on the pink side byt still so pretty and soft for the price they are great i want more colors!!!</li>
            <li> Get tangled way to easy but would definitely get for a one night only type thing</li>
            <li> Absolutely loveeeee paid for expected shipping ordered 11 at night on the 3rd got them the 6th no u can&#x27;t curl but omg there amazing yes they get frizzy after a few wears but nothing some products can&#x27;t fix I have thin hair so pkg was enough noone noticed they were synthetic</li>
            <li> They only sent me half of what I ordered so I got a hold of them and they were really nice about it and re sent me them and they came in a lot faster then before. They look real enough and they&#x27;re soft and don&#x27;t tangle as long as you keep them hung up somewhere safe. They&#x27;re definitely worth the couple bucks. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed. Really fake looking and awful tangles.</li>
            <li> Way cute.. Really long.. love how it look when it&#x27;s on my hair</li>
            <li> These are amazing! They arrived faster than expected being as they were shipped from China! I was skeptical due to the low price but I love these! For a nice full look be sure and order two sets.</li>

            <li> not how its advertised in the picture and hair quality is not great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Super waste of money. Really tacky looking and feels like nasty dried hair.</li>
            <li> Omg i absolutely love it i just got them in today and im very happy they look and feel like real hair. Im definitely Buying more</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted longer. These extensions didn&#x27;t belong under heat. It got messed up the week in I got it!</li>
            <li> Waaaaay too shiny to be passed off as real or natural looking hair. Plus, it&#x27;s not as bright as the red color pictured.</li>
