            <li>Love the product....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this every day for years and just love it.</li>

            <li>The color is perfect for blue eyes.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>I LOVE this mascara mostly because it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li>Really good mascara for my blue eyes.</li>
            <li>It goes on extremely easily with absolutely zero clumps.</li>
            <li>The waterproof really works when swimming, yet it comes off easily with the right makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This old mascara has once again become my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my blue eye color every time I wear it!</li>
            <li>and it makes my eyelashes look pretty.</li>
            <li>I love this Cover Girl mascara for blue eyes!  </li>
            <li>I love the color and the way it enhances Blue eyes.</li>
            <li>If I add more before going out to dinner, sometimes it feels crispy going on as a second coat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the mascaras that make your lashes ridiculously long, but I do want some extra length and definitely some color, so this one is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having a harder time finding it in local stores, so I was happy to see it on Amazon . . .</li>
            <li>This is nice for a change from black or brown mascara.  </li>
            <li>This is very flattering.</li>
            <li>Does it really \\&quot;brighten\\</li>
            <li>This one is very manageable.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle color and that is what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>really makes them stand out.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes look long but still more natural.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Oh, and my eyes are very sensitive to a lot of makeup; this mascara does not irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
            <li>however I notice it doesn&#x27;t apply that easily anymore nor does it last as long.  </li>
            <li>unfortunately I&#x27;m not the only one this has happened to.</li>
            <li>Not harsh.</li>
            <li>I like the product and so far no problems with flaking.</li>
            <li>It covers very well without caking, separates well, and definitely gives a highlight to eye color.</li>
            <li>Only if you try and use too much.</li>
            <li>it looks completely naturally and most people just think i naturally have really long dark eyelashes, and that i&#x27;m not even wearing mascara.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin and light blue eyes, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a subtle hint of color that makes it more interesting than plain black.  </li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll just stick with plain old black :)</li>
            <li>As per description, I expected much darker shade.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have found the black to be too dark for my light blue eyes.</li>
            <li>It is black mascara with a blue iridescence, so it is much more subtle than wearing blue mascara.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I prefer this over one of the highest rated mascaras, which I&#x27;ve had in both blue &amp; black:</li>
            <li> Mascara Backstage Makeup - Black (#090) 0.38 Fluid Ounce (11.5ml)  Brush]]</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes and the black saphire mascara</li>
            <li> Others are too wet and end up dotting your eyelids while you&#x27;re applying, requiring a bit of cleanup when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> find that I do have to be careful when applying the mascara so that it does not clump on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the brush is not fine enough to separate lashes, and I have to use a lash separator.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s due to the structure of my eyes or skin, but all mascara seems to flake and/or smudge on me, even the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; types.  </li>
            <li> I like this because it doesn&#x27;t get black all over my face</li>
            <li> When I received the two out of three that I ordered, they were dried up inside.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find a grey that suits my blue eyes.</li>
            <li> This one does so least of all that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed that they were unusable.</li>
            <li> 1....very disappointed...</li>
            <li> The waterproof mascaras that promise volume, length, etc. are the worst for flaking/smudging on me.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a repurchase of an item I am already using -- it doesn&#x27;t clump, I prefer the smaller brush (which this product does have) and I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever! I get so many compliments on my blue eye color every time I wear it!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have found the black to be too dark for my light blue eyes. This is a lighter color that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I like it and have been using it for years however I notice it doesn&#x27;t apply that easily anymore nor does it last as long.  Maybe they changed the formula?  Dunno but would like a better clinging product.</li>
            <li> When I received the two out of three that I ordered, they were dried up inside. I was quite disappointed that they were unusable.</li>
            <li> I received my package ... Unfortunately only one item is there ... It should be pack of 3 !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the color and the way it goes on but it irritates my eyes. Turns out it has alluminum powder in it. That&#x27;s the same stuff they mix in car paint to give it sparkle. Guess I&#x27;ll just stick with plain old black :)</li>
            <li> I like this because it doesn&#x27;t get black all over my face and it makes my eyelashes look pretty.</li>
            <li> This is very flattering. Not harsh. Stays put all day yet washes of easily at night. I find that I am using eye makeup more often because of this product!!</li>
            <li> Does it really \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; your eyes?..well the jury&#x27;s still out on that one. What I can tell you for sure though, is that it is probably the best mascara on the market right now regardless. I don&#x27;t like the mascaras that make your lashes ridiculously long, but I do want some extra length and definitely some color, so this one is absolutely perfect. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this mascara flaking, smudging, or running either, and that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I got these for blue eyes. Color of the mascara is best described as midnight - a deep blue-black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the brush is not fine enough to separate lashes, and I have to use a lash separator. I use this one: [[ASIN:B000REKQDK Seki Edge Folding Lash Pin Comb]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless very nice for the price. I prefer this over one of the highest rated mascaras, which I&#x27;ve had in both blue &amp; black: [[ASIN:B001GMANIK Christian Dior Diorshow Mascara Backstage Makeup - Black (#090) 0.38 Fluid Ounce (11.5ml)  Brush]]</li>
            <li> Love the product....but I bought the 3 pack for $19 and only received 1....very disappointed...unfortunately I&#x27;m not the only one this has happened to. I&#x27;m not out a ton of money, but if you list a 3 pack, you should send all 3!</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best i have ever owned. It goes on extremely easily with absolutely zero clumps. it looks completely naturally and most people just think i naturally have really long dark eyelashes, and that i&#x27;m not even wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it!!! Eyes are blue and pop with this on... Compliments across the board!!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s due to the structure of my eyes or skin, but all mascara seems to flake and/or smudge on me, even the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; types.  The waterproof mascaras that promise volume, length, etc. are the worst for flaking/smudging on me.  This one does so least of all that I&#x27;ve used.  I have pale skin and light blue eyes, so both the Ruby and the Sapphire of this mascara provide a &amp;#34;hint&amp;#34; of color to my face, without being glaringly unnatural or obvious.  Oh, and my eyes are very sensitive to a lot of makeup; this mascara does not irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day for years and just love it. The waterproof really works when swimming, yet it comes off easily with the right makeup remover. Doesn&#x27;t clump, just looks great.</li>
            <li> Really good mascara for my blue eyes. Eyelashes look long but still more natural. I can count on this one.</li>
            <li> I love this Cover Girl mascara for blue eyes!  It&#x27;s got a subtle hint of color that makes it more interesting than plain black.  The consistency is just right--no clumps or heaviness.  I&#x27;m having a harder time finding it in local stores, so I was happy to see it on Amazon . . . and in a three-pack for a good price!</li>
            <li> This is nice for a change from black or brown mascara.  I like the product and so far no problems with flaking.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this mascara twice now and still haven&#x27;t changed my mind about it.... I will keep buying this stuff cuz it&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge a lot and is easy to apply.  This is one of the best prices I have found for it.  And I like the color with a hint of blue in it.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorites for years. I have never found a mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge. This one stays put. So well that not every eye makeup remover will take it out. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara mostly because it&#x27;s not messy. Others are too wet and end up dotting your eyelids while you&#x27;re applying, requiring a bit of cleanup when you&#x27;re done. This one is very manageable. PLUS they&#x27;re designed to bring out your eye color, and it works!</li>
            <li> I love the color and the way it enhances Blue eyes.</li>
            <li> Easily applied and easily washed off. No clumping or breakup of mascara. Great.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I rub my eyes all the time and most mascara gives me raccoon eyes. This one never does. It doesn&#x27;t flake or rub off. It&#x27;s the only mascara I&#x27;ll wear now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It is waterproof which is important to me. It covers very well without caking, separates well, and definitely gives a highlight to eye color.</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara!!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes blue eyes look bluer and lashes look longer without any clumps.  The mascara does not run, smear or make your eyes water.</li>
            <li> I like it, wish it was also lengthening though - it really does a good job of bringing out the blues though! (FYI, you can see it in the pictures!)</li>
            <li> This is a gentle color and that is what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts all day.  If I add more before going out to dinner, sometimes it feels crispy going on as a second coat.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t this brush be in every Mascara? The color is perfect for blue eyes. And the brush is amazing. No clumps. No goop. Only if you try and use too much. Tried L&#x27;Oreal Butterfly and threw $8 away. Tried Dior!! $28 and the stuff stained my eyelid where I made a mistake! This old mascara has once again become my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s by far the best eyeliner I had. It is very difficult to find a grey that suits my blue eyes. this one is perfect: it does not leak, makes naturally separsted and defined eyelashes.</li>
            <li> As per description, I expected much darker shade.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. I have blue eyes and the black saphire mascara really makes them stand out. It is black mascara with a blue iridescence, so it is much more subtle than wearing blue mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I do have to be careful when applying the mascara so that it does not clump on my eyelashes. That being said, it lasts all day &amp; is waterproof which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. It does enhance blue eyes!</li>
