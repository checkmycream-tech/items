    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This product is very good.  </li>
            <li>GREAT JOB Deal Seekers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of color protection, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and she was very happy with the large bottle.</li>
            <li>2 stars because it DOES smell nice</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and smells great (although I wouldn&#x27;t pin the scent as lavender).</li>
            <li>Gave it away to a friend who liked it more than I did</li>
            <li>Love the scent and feel.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 1L size since it was the best buy overall, but also because the reviews were encouraging.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance also.</li>
            <li>Along with the coditioner, my hair never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely pleased at the spped of delivery and the products condition.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok - read that it compared to Pureology - not even close, for my hair anyways.  </li>
            <li>I chose the blue lavender because I was hoping for a mild and not overpowering fruity smell, and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great shampoo!</li>
            <li>May be too strong.  </li>
            <li>And the reviews were right on!  </li>
            <li>, I use it daily and think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>I bought this due to the great reviews and price.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped my order quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo; my color really stays true longer; It doesn&#x27;t use sulphates, so it doesn&#x27;t produce suds as much, but thats why hair color doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>My hair stays cleaner much much longer, my color is holding its own for what seems to be forever, and the overall condition of my aging, thinning, fine hair has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>received it so fast!  </li>
            <li>Exactly in the condition advertised.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this again, but it won&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
            <li>The only reason I marked it down is because the bottle is fairly large, it should have a pump top instead of the kind you have to squeeze out.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t clean on first shampooing--I use a styling spray and sometimes mousse.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I think the lavender refers to the color of the bottle - the scent really isn&#x27;t lavender</li>
            <li>but the color was clear.</li>
            <li>I spent $20 on it only to be left with not being able to use it.</li>
            <li>Over scented and did not smell like natural lavender.</li>
            <li>It lathers well but is still gentle and does not dry my hair out with daily shampooing.</li>
            <li>It is not legal for sale in Califronia (where I live) because of carcinogenic ingredients.</li>
            <li>It also has almost no fragrance--which can be good or bad depending on what you wanted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this shampoo all the time! Love the scent and feel.  received it so fast!  thank you for your prompt service!!</li>
            <li> Well I guess I didn&#x27;t do my homework. I read this shampoo to be a \\&quot;blue Lavender\\&quot; shampoo (thinking it was for blonde hair) but the color was clear. I spent $20 on it only to be left with not being able to use it. Now I see the price has dropped down to $8. WHAT???? Arg. 2 stars because it DOES smell nice but I feel a tad cheated for the wording on the bottle. :(</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo; my color really stays true longer; It doesn&#x27;t use sulphates, so it doesn&#x27;t produce suds as much, but thats why hair color doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> This product is very good.  I have used it in the past.  The seller shipped my order quickly.</li>
            <li> I had been pondering the benefits of switching to a sulfate-free shampoo for quite some time.  After checking out various reviews, I found Back to Basics.  I ordered the 1L size since it was the best buy overall, but also because the reviews were encouraging.  And the reviews were right on!  My hair stays cleaner much much longer, my color is holding its own for what seems to be forever, and the overall condition of my aging, thinning, fine hair has improved tremendously. It works for me...and just may be the biggest change I&#x27;ve ever made to my \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; arsenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read reviews that said it left hair flat and oily.  This has not been my experience.  Works very well.  Cleans well, I use it daily and think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for two years and my color lasts longer than it ever has.It lathers well but is still gentle and does not dry my hair out with daily shampooing.I love the fragrance also.</li>
            <li> Came as said no problems</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for the dyed red hair since it doesn&#x27;t have a sulfates in it. It arrived quickly and smells great (although I wouldn&#x27;t pin the scent as lavender). The only reason I marked it down is because the bottle is fairly large, it should have a pump top instead of the kind you have to squeeze out. Other than that, great shampoo!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shampoo. Along with the coditioner, my hair never looked or felt better. I recomened these oroducts to everyone .</li>
            <li> Over scented and did not smell like natural lavender. Gave it away to a friend who liked it more than I did</li>
            <li> Love this. I dye my hair dark red which is a hard color to keep up with, and this shampoo helped the color stay in so much longer.</li>
            <li> Like an idiot I bought this. It is not legal for sale in Califronia (where I live) because of carcinogenic ingredients. Oh, and it has a fragrance but it is not lavender. I have a variety of lavender plants in my yard and they don&#x27;t smell like this.It is some sort of a floral scent.</li>
            <li> So sad this product is discontinued :(</li>
            <li> I just received this order Back to Basics Blue Lavender Protect Shampoo and I am extremely pleased at the spped of delivery and the products condition.  Exactly in the condition advertised.  I plan on using this seller for any future orders and recommend others to follow suit.  GREAT JOB Deal Seekers</li>
            <li> Does not protect color at all. I won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister (she requested it because she was having a problem finding it in local stores). I had no problem finding it on Amazon and she was very happy with the large bottle. She has color treated hair and she likes the way it makes her hair look and feel. I&#x27;ve never used it myself, but my sister loves it.</li>
            <li> Since I color my hair, I&#x27;m careful how I wash it and the products I use as I want the color to last as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this shampoo meets my requirements.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - read that it compared to Pureology - not even close, for my hair anyways.  I think the lavender refers to the color of the bottle - the scent really isn&#x27;t lavender but it is fresh-smelling.</li>
            <li> It cleans well; however it is too drying for my hair. May be too strong.  I can not tell if it is protecting the color, because I can not use it on a daily basis. Because it dries my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the great reviews and price. It&#x27;s a good value. It does a good job of color protection, which is what I was looking for. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t clean on first shampooing--I use a styling spray and sometimes mousse.  It does get all the out if I use a 2nd shampooing. It also has almost no fragrance--which can be good or bad depending on what you wanted. I wanted to smell lavender and just don&#x27;t. I would buy this again, but it won&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
            <li> I had been using a different back-to-basics product, but it was discontinued. I chose the blue lavender because I was hoping for a mild and not overpowering fruity smell, and it is perfect. It is a very subtle but pleasing aroma.</li>
