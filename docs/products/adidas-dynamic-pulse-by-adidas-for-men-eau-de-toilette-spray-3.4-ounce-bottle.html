            <li>Nice and cooling .</li>
            <li>This smells good, probably one of the better Adidas smells</li>
            <li>Smelled nice</li>
            <li>The smell is really good can&#x27;t stop useing it favorite smell</li>
            <li>At first, very good aroma.</li>
            <li>this is suitable for more sporty than stylish men.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and strong, I like it,</li>
            <li>Adidas Dynamic Pulse, a Men&#x27;s Eau De Toilette Spray, excellent scent that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>This company will always be a favorite of mine and will always make quality products.</li>
            <li>If you are more \\&quot;gentalman\\&quot; or some</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he will like it, my fiance likes it.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t purchase more then one of this style.</li>
            <li>and we both love Pulse.</li>
            <li>I like it more after an hour.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying more of there smells.</li>
            <li>I am sure you can getting something better for the money.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and bottle size.</li>
            <li>No loss :).</li>
            <li>Come on, I believe you would surely like the style and perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that has to do with its being alcohol based.</li>
            <li>Definitely an awesome product attracting others, the results become definitely obvious.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for fathers day, it a nice full size bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is good to start showing your children proper hygiene, smelling good, doing your hair etc.</li>
            <li>From the smell i would say this is a 20 to 25 dollar cologne but to only pay 10 dollars and some change is amazing strong smell great ended to it</li>
            <li>Not his favorite, but not a bad scent.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean scent clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>I purchased a lot of colognes all at once on Amazon, so I have not used this product much, but it seems nice.  </li>
            <li>Wanted a cheap clone to use here</li>
            <li>I have yet to run into one from Adidas that I don&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy it quite a bit</li>
            <li>Great smell ,Have gotten compliments for years using this stuff,and Amazon is the cheapest one almost the only place to buy this aftershave.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, so why not give it a try?</li>
            <li>I love it in 9 $ its worth every penny ....</li>
            <li>For me was awesome, useful and easy to use everyday for my sport training....</li>
            <li>Not too strong but good for daily use.</li>
            <li>The price for what you get is simple amazing!</li>
            <li>simply superb for small cost.</li>
            <li>smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d stop spending 70$ on him a month for his cologne and this way he can splash on as much as he wants :)</li>
            <li>most Adidas colognes and perfumes there is definitely a very sporty, fresh almost citrus type scent that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>But very... Sexy, would be the word I would use to describe the scent.</li>
            <li>I like Dynamic Pluse by Adidas and get good compliments from people wearing it.</li>
            <li>The smell is not too sweet, not too overpowering, and not too strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price its not a bad buy....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, the bottle is fairly easy to grip and the sprayer works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It comes out of the gates with a clean, fresh, and finishes with notes of spice and musk.  </li>
            <li>I get quickly after I made my order.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to find this stuff at Marshalls/TJMaxx for about $10, and have been very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>The good thing i like about it is that it last for a good decent time (though not very long).</li>
            <li>It is cheap while keeping a masculine sent that is not too strong or even fruity for that matter.  </li>
            <li>, I suggest using this in the morning to get ready for an event then lightly putting it on through the day</li>
            <li>its having a nice fragrance and last for almost a day.</li>
            <li>Worth for the price</li>
            <li>(smell is always subjective to taste, but we liked it) and kept it&#x27;s scent the entire time.</li>
            <li>I simply love fruity scents, so naturally I like it.  </li>
            <li>This feels and smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Would be good for active men.</li>
            <li>Adidas Dynamic Pulse has a pleasant clean and crisp scent that is appropriate for everyday use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the perfume smells nice, but does not lasts very long.</li>
            <li>This Adidas Dynamic Pulse spray has a really nice fresh, fruit based sent tone and is very masculine.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 2-3 hour at most&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a crisp scent that lasts for 2-4 hours.</li>
            <li>it smell like the first morning of winter with hot cocoa over the stove and wathcing my dog sleep by the fireplace</li>
            <li>I wish it was lasting more than 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>At first I was going to cancel my order for this cologne for a diffirent type, but when I recieved it, I changed my mind.</li>
            <li>Way better then any spray body spray in my opinion and costs about the same.</li>
            <li>It has received numerous compliments, and does seem to hang in for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more bet it don&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li>/&gt;i don´t know what was exactly the problem with the perfum, but today, february 13°, i am still waiting.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>which is great because many people like myself, hate colognes or pheromones that give a sent that is too strong and give headaches anyways.</li>
            <li>Simply put,  this is a good scent for any working male.  </li>
            <li>have positively commented it as well</li>
            <li>This is a really cheap cologne obviously, but it&#x27;s a very sporty, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it guys,  that&#x27;s the real reason why we wear cologne in the first place,  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>He loves the scent and it is very flattering to him.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and I have no problems giving this one 5 Stars!</li>
            <li>so I got it straight from Adidas.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Other then that the fragrance is ok.</li>
            <li>Not very strong hence very comfortable to sport</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend, he loves this brand/smell and glad it&#x27;s so much less money on here than in the store.  </li>
            <li>My son won&#x27;t wear anything else but this particular scent by Addidas.  </li>
            <li>As compared to the price, what you will get is a decent deal.</li>
            <li>Poor sillage and longevity, but a nice fresh &#x27;sport&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li>Normally use it in the morning and after shave.</li>
            <li>The true test, or indicator, for me is the Wow Factor - compliments from the opposite sex..!!  </li>
            <li>Unlike some cologne companies, they&#x27;ve given enough hose on the sprayer that when it is low, I should still be able to get it out of the bottle easily by turning it a little to get into one corner.  </li>
            <li>Try something new - you may like it...</li>
            <li>I enjoy finding that \\&quot;diamond in the rough\\&quot;... Similar to my review of Victory League, I am giving Dynamic Pulse 4 stars out of 5.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, but not really long lasting, a few hours at max.</li>
            <li>Amazon and other online sellers definitely have better prices than that found in malls.</li>
            <li>This is my second review of Adidas colognes (Victory League was first)...</li>
            <li>I find that Adidas mostly smells all the same, but if I had to pick from the ones I&#x27;ve tried this would be slightly preferable to others.</li>
            <li>I bought adidas dynamic pulse spray for my son for Christmas and my son really enjoys this cologne ...............  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.  </li>
            <li>but all in all i would say buy it for a young man or a teenage whos just starting to wear cologne or any guy really</li>
            <li>early, so that way by the time they are teenagers, they have their routine down ;-)</li>
            <li>I also use it for general body spray after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PWN.</li>
            <li>I spray my normal 3 sprays on my body, and 5 minutes later, there is absolutely no scent of this left at all.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d stop spending 70$ on him a month for his cologne and this way he can splash on as much as he wants :)</li>
            <li> most Adidas colognes and perfumes there is definitely a very sporty, fresh almost citrus type scent that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> But very... Sexy, would be the word I would use to describe the scent.</li>
            <li> I like Dynamic Pluse by Adidas and get good compliments from people wearing it.</li>
            <li> The smell is not too sweet, not too overpowering, and not too strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price its not a bad buy....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the bottle is fairly easy to grip and the sprayer works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It comes out of the gates with a clean, fresh, and finishes with notes of spice and musk.  </li>
            <li> I get quickly after I made my order.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to find this stuff at Marshalls/TJMaxx for about $10, and have been very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> The good thing i like about it is that it last for a good decent time (though not very long).</li>
            <li> It is cheap while keeping a masculine sent that is not too strong or even fruity for that matter.  </li>
            <li> , I suggest using this in the morning to get ready for an event then lightly putting it on through the day</li>
            <li> its having a nice fragrance and last for almost a day.</li>
            <li> Worth for the price</li>
            <li> (smell is always subjective to taste, but we liked it) and kept it&#x27;s scent the entire time.</li>
            <li> I simply love fruity scents, so naturally I like it.  </li>
            <li> This feels and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> Would be good for active men.</li>
            <li> Adidas Dynamic Pulse has a pleasant clean and crisp scent that is appropriate for everyday use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the perfume smells nice, but does not lasts very long.</li>
            <li> This Adidas Dynamic Pulse spray has a really nice fresh, fruit based sent tone and is very masculine.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 2-3 hour at most&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crisp scent that lasts for 2-4 hours.</li>
            <li> it smell like the first morning of winter with hot cocoa over the stove and wathcing my dog sleep by the fireplace</li>
            <li> I wish it was lasting more than 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> At first I was going to cancel my order for this cologne for a diffirent type, but when I recieved it, I changed my mind.</li>
            <li> Way better then any spray body spray in my opinion and costs about the same.</li>
            <li> It has received numerous compliments, and does seem to hang in for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more bet it don&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li> /&gt;i don´t know what was exactly the problem with the perfum, but today, february 13°, i am still waiting.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> which is great because many people like myself, hate colognes or pheromones that give a sent that is too strong and give headaches anyways.</li>
            <li> Simply put,  this is a good scent for any working male.  </li>
            <li> have positively commented it as well</li>
            <li> This is a really cheap cologne obviously, but it&#x27;s a very sporty, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it guys,  that&#x27;s the real reason why we wear cologne in the first place,  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> He loves the scent and it is very flattering to him.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended and I have no problems giving this one 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> so I got it straight from Adidas.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Other then that the fragrance is ok.</li>
            <li> Not very strong hence very comfortable to sport</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, he loves this brand/smell and glad it&#x27;s so much less money on here than in the store.  </li>
            <li> My son won&#x27;t wear anything else but this particular scent by Addidas.  </li>
            <li> As compared to the price, what you will get is a decent deal.</li>
            <li> Poor sillage and longevity, but a nice fresh &#x27;sport&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li> Normally use it in the morning and after shave.</li>
            <li> The true test, or indicator, for me is the Wow Factor - compliments from the opposite sex..!!  </li>
            <li> Unlike some cologne companies, they&#x27;ve given enough hose on the sprayer that when it is low, I should still be able to get it out of the bottle easily by turning it a little to get into one corner.  </li>
            <li> Try something new - you may like it...</li>
            <li> I enjoy finding that \\&quot;diamond in the rough\\&quot;... Similar to my review of Victory League, I am giving Dynamic Pulse 4 stars out of 5.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, but not really long lasting, a few hours at max.</li>
            <li> Amazon and other online sellers definitely have better prices than that found in malls.</li>
            <li> This is my second review of Adidas colognes (Victory League was first)...</li>
            <li> I find that Adidas mostly smells all the same, but if I had to pick from the ones I&#x27;ve tried this would be slightly preferable to others.</li>
            <li> I bought adidas dynamic pulse spray for my son for Christmas and my son really enjoys this cologne ...............  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far.  </li>
            <li> but all in all i would say buy it for a young man or a teenage whos just starting to wear cologne or any guy really</li>
            <li> early, so that way by the time they are teenagers, they have their routine down ;-)</li>
            <li> I also use it for general body spray after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PWN.</li>
            <li> I spray my normal 3 sprays on my body, and 5 minutes later, there is absolutely no scent of this left at all.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> this one doesn&#x27;t last long unless you spray yourself like 6 - 10 times.</li>
            <li> I will say it does not last that long</li>
            <li> For the price, and you enjoy finding that \\&quot;diamond in the rough\\&quot; (a.k.a. blind buy), go for it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage son who wore it until the bottle was empty.  </li>
            <li> its lasted also long on my skin...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, compliments have been given only within an hour of applying: it doesn&#x27;t last much longer than that on my skin (it does seem to last longer on cloth).</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it just wears off a little soon.</li>
            <li> Sweetie gives me the smell test everyday and she gives a thumbs up for Dynamic Pulse...</li>
            <li> Any way, I like it, maybe i&#x27;ll change to some other brands for a try.</li>
            <li> It smells like a variation of every other Adidas cologne.</li>
            <li> My cologne collection now exceeds 300+ bottles (and growing, ranging from expensive bottles to not so much.  </li>
            <li> Minus one star though because the smell is gone in what seems like a few minutes.</li>
            <li> and it last for at least half the day...</li>
            <li> Like its been watered down.</li>
            <li> Got it for my dad since he likes to use half a bottle of cologne on himself each time.  </li>
            <li> I typically wear Gillette deodorant and aftershave, and this seems to work with those.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but its nothing special.</li>
            <li> After a few pumps, the aroma almost died away.</li>
            <li> It did ship a little bit late, but other than that</li>
            <li> I had used  a few of Adidas Body Spray and Eau De Toilette Spray&#x27;s in past and out of all of them this one is my one of the favourite</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase and you will save plenty of cash compared to buying from your local supplier.</li>
            <li> When i use cologne, I usually spray it on my clothes 2 to 3 times</li>
            <li> Obviously it will not be as glamorous or have the long lasting smell as a really expensive cologne, but for the price this is still a dynamite deal!!!!</li>
            <li> Applying a couple of sprays on in the morning will last a little over a half day which isn&#x27;t bad at all at this price</li>
            <li> what \\&quot;social-style\\&quot;, maybe it&#x27;s not suitable for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overbearing and goes well with the shirt and tie guys as well as the work boot and hard hat men.  </li>
            <li> This cologne has such a masculine scent that it drives me crazy!!!</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just received a bad bottle, but I&#x27;m really disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> i am really disappointed about this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For me was awesome, useful and easy to use everyday for my sport training.... I get quickly after I made my order. Just buy it if u need it</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, he loves this brand/smell and glad it&#x27;s so much less money on here than in the store.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Got it for my dad since he likes to use half a bottle of cologne on himself each time.  I figured I&#x27;d stop spending 70$ on him a month for his cologne and this way he can splash on as much as he wants :)</li>
            <li> I purchased a lot of colognes all at once on Amazon, so I have not used this product much, but it seems nice.  Obviously it will not be as glamorous or have the long lasting smell as a really expensive cologne, but for the price this is still a dynamite deal!!!!</li>
            <li> Adidas Dynamic Pulse, a Men&#x27;s Eau De Toilette Spray, excellent scent that lasts all day.  Can&#x27;t say much more, good stuff.  Thanks Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Broke in shipping so I never got to use it.</li>
            <li> My son won&#x27;t wear anything else but this particular scent by Addidas.  It is great to be able to find it online for him.  He loves the scent and it is very flattering to him.  I also think the price is great!!!</li>
            <li> this is an all time hit spray.  simply superb for small cost. this is suitable for more sporty than stylish men.</li>
            <li> I have the after shave of this, so thought \\&quot;Hey, why not get the cologne to complement it?\\&quot;  I spray my normal 3 sprays on my body, and 5 minutes later, there is absolutely no scent of this left at all.  Maybe I just received a bad bottle, but I&#x27;m really disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Wanted a cheap clone to use here and there when I needed it, these were great when they were like $5, now at this price they don&#x27;t make no sense.</li>
            <li> This is the spray I was waiting for. The delivery had no problem and the product was in good condition. It has great after effect specially nice for the partying people I guess. Definitely recommend..</li>
            <li> From the smell i would say this is a 20 to 25 dollar cologne but to only pay 10 dollars and some change is amazing strong smell great ended to it but all in all i would say buy it for a young man or a teenage whos just starting to wear cologne or any guy really</li>
            <li> This is the second Adidas Cologne that I have purchased for my self and I&#x27;m very impressed. I have yet to run into one from Adidas that I don&#x27;t enjoy. The price for what you get is simple amazing! Applying a couple of sprays on in the morning will last a little over a half day which isn&#x27;t bad at all at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most Adidas colognes and perfumes there is definitely a very sporty, fresh almost citrus type scent that I really enjoy. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase and you will save plenty of cash compared to buying from your local supplier. Highly recommended and I have no problems giving this one 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> As compared to the price, what you will get is a decent deal. The good thing i like about it is that it last for a good decent time (though not very long). Smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for fathers day, it a nice full size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;the perfume smells nice, but does not lasts very long. however i like the price.</li>
            <li> ery Very good scent but it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 2-3 hour at most&lt;br /&gt;overall it is a good deal</li>
            <li> Great product and would buy again if needed.This company will always be a favorite of mine and will always make quality products.</li>
            <li> The smell do not last at all</li>
            <li> I just like the ADIDAS perfume, it&#x27;s designed for sports and energized man and it is my style. If you are more \\&quot;gentalman\\&quot; or some what \\&quot;social-style\\&quot;, maybe it&#x27;s not suitable for you. Any way, I like it, maybe i&#x27;ll change to some other brands for a try.</li>
            <li> not one of my favorites it smells okay i use it for work only it gets the job done if i had to go out i wouldnt spray it on me..</li>
            <li> smells nice, I bought it as a gift for my brother for Christmas. I&#x27;m sure he will like it, my fiance likes it.</li>
            <li> Good one recomendrd. Its ver good abd i love it and i recomend to all of my friends. Tr rf</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and strong, I like it, also the price was good, I can say that I will get one more</li>
            <li> I like this product.Normally use it in the morning and after shave.Like it  and use it on a daily basis</li>
            <li> Our six-year-old son loves this one. It does smell good, but we like the force Adidas the best :-D but anything is good. I think it is good to start showing your children proper hygiene, smelling good, doing your hair etc. early, so that way by the time they are teenagers, they have their routine down ;-) Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> My husband wears this scent to work.  Not his favorite, but not a bad scent.  Especially for the price. Would be good for active men.</li>
            <li> It smells like a variation of every other Adidas cologne. But very... Sexy, would be the word I would use to describe the scent.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but I do enjoy it quite a bit, I suggest using this in the morning to get ready for an event then lightly putting it on through the day</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Adidas has produced. Smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a really cheap cologne obviously, but it&#x27;s a very sporty, fresh scent. It&#x27;s really nice for gym days, etc, but not something to wear for a fancy date type event. It&#x27;s a crisp scent that lasts for 2-4 hours. I find that Adidas mostly smells all the same, but if I had to pick from the ones I&#x27;ve tried this would be slightly preferable to others. Amazon and other online sellers definitely have better prices than that found in malls.</li>
            <li> When i use cologne, I usually spray it on my clothes 2 to 3 times and it last for at least half the day... this one doesn&#x27;t last long unless you spray yourself like 6 - 10 times. Like its been watered down. Other then that the fragrance is ok.</li>
            <li> Great Aroma. it smell like the first morning of winter with hot cocoa over the stove and wathcing my dog sleep by the fireplace</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume. Not too strong but good for daily use.</li>
            <li> Great smell ,Have gotten compliments for years using this stuff,and Amazon is the cheapest one almost the only place to buy this aftershave.Hope they don&#x27;t stop making it .</li>
            <li> My son is in 6th grade. A slob. But he changed when he got a whiff of this stocking stuffer. He&#x27;s grooming and dressing fly. He smells great. I gues this is his scent. For now.</li>
            <li> Great quality, 100% recommended! I love it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> At first, very good aroma. All aroma oils must have been in bottom of bottle from shipping and shelf storage. After a few pumps, the aroma almost died away. (Possible shaking may be required before use.)</li>
            <li> This Adidas Dynamic Pulse spray has a really nice fresh, fruit based sent tone and is very masculine. Great price. I also use it for general body spray after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PWN.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and I LOVE the way it smells! This cologne has such a masculine scent that it drives me crazy!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second review of Adidas colognes (Victory League was first)... \\&quot;Sweetie\\&quot; (a.k.a. my girlfriend) picked up these two colognes for supplement birthday presents... I enjoy finding that \\&quot;diamond in the rough\\&quot;... Similar to my review of Victory League, I am giving Dynamic Pulse 4 stars out of 5.  It comes out of the gates with a clean, fresh, and finishes with notes of spice and musk.  Great scent..!!  It does not last.  For those I have tried with short staying power, I take the bottle with me and reapply as needed.  For the price, and you enjoy finding that \\&quot;diamond in the rough\\&quot; (a.k.a. blind buy), go for it.  My cologne collection now exceeds 300+ bottles (and growing, ranging from expensive bottles to not so much.  The true test, or indicator, for me is the Wow Factor - compliments from the opposite sex..!!  Sweetie gives me the smell test everyday and she gives a thumbs up for Dynamic Pulse... Try something new - you may like it...</li>
            <li> For the price, it is awesome. I wish it was lasting more than 2-3 hours. I like the scent of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I. Like the smell Adidas</li>
            <li> Nice and cooling . Not very strong hence very comfortable to sport</li>
            <li> great price smell good</li>
            <li> Adidas knows Perfum too. I like Dynamic Pluse by Adidas and get good compliments from people wearing it. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had used  a few of Adidas Body Spray and Eau De Toilette Spray&#x27;s in past and out of all of them this one is my one of the favourite and since I just put in the order today will see how it is once I receive it.</li>
            <li> Not too bad. I tend to think all the Adidas cologne of this style smell really similar. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but its nothing special. For the price its not a bad buy....just don&#x27;t purchase more then one of this style.</li>
            <li> At first I was going to cancel my order for this cologne for a diffirent type, but when I recieved it, I changed my mind. It smells great and it is the best cologne I used so far. You should buy it, I definitely reccomend it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recommended I check out Adidas cologne. I got this scent and Ice Dive and we both love Pulse.</li>
            <li> This product smells good, I would recommend it.  The only downside to this product is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> This smells good, probably one of the better Adidas smells I have smelt. I like it more after an hour. It does not seem to stick around all day though but that&#x27;s ok, at this price just hit it again later. Way better then any spray body spray in my opinion and costs about the same. I look forward to trying more of there smells.</li>
            <li> its having a nice fragrance and last for almost a day. Worth for the price and I will recommend this.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not really long lasting, a few hours at max. I am sure you can getting something better for the money.</li>
            <li> Poor sillage and longevity, but a nice fresh &#x27;sport&#x27; scent. It is cheap, so why not give it a try? Good for the price. I recommend it after sport events (like training), for every day use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage son who wore it until the bottle was empty.  Smelled nice (smell is always subjective to taste, but we liked it) and kept it&#x27;s scent the entire time.</li>
            <li> Great smell, sport-like.</li>
            <li> No problem with order</li>
            <li> All of the local stores were either out, or had stopped carrying this brand so I got it straight from Adidas. Love the smell and bottle size. It did ship a little bit late, but other than that everything went well. Amazing brand; would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I bought adidas dynamic pulse spray for my son for Christmas and my son really enjoys this cologne ...............  he said he likes the scent and others have positively commented it as well</li>
            <li> I was in the market for an inexpensive cologne I could wear daily.  I was lucky enough to find this stuff at Marshalls/TJMaxx for about $10, and have been very pleased with my purchase.  It has received numerous compliments, and does seem to hang in for most of the day.  I typically wear Gillette deodorant and aftershave, and this seems to work with those.  No complaints so far.  The smell is not too sweet, not too overpowering, and not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the bottle is fairly easy to grip and the sprayer works pretty well.  Unlike some cologne companies, they&#x27;ve given enough hose on the sprayer that when it is low, I should still be able to get it out of the bottle easily by turning it a little to get into one corner.  No loss :).</li>
            <li> My husband likes this. It smells good &amp; it&#x27;s a good price, won&#x27;t break the bank. Haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> The smell is really good can&#x27;t stop useing it favorite smell I will buy more bet it don&#x27;t last all day bout 2 hours</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent clean &amp; fresh. Good for just around the house after shower. I will say it does not last that long but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I like it very much! Do not hesitate! Come on, I believe you would surely like the style and perfume.</li>
            <li> hi&lt;br /&gt;even i made the purshase last days of december 2012, i haven´t recived the product. i am really disappointed about this. otherwise i also bought a pair of X-box 360 games and a wireless controller the same day i bought this adidas eau de tolittete and they were sent to me inmediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don´t know what was exactly the problem with the perfum, but today, february 13°, i am still waiting.</li>

            <li> To say it&#x27;s so cheap, it smells great. Minus one star though because the smell is gone in what seems like a few minutes. I&#x27;m sure that has to do with its being alcohol based.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it! Not only was it a present for him but it is a present for me too because I get to smell the cologne all the time:P Also, the bottle is a good size. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love it in 9 $ its worth every penny .... its lasted also long on my skin...so its a good deal for me</li>
            <li> This was an Aftershave I use to buy, I loved it, smelled better than any cologne I&#x27;ve ever used, they stopped selling it at the stores I went to, and now I know it&#x27;s because it BECAME a cologne!... I STILL USE IS AS AN AFTERSHAVE THOUGH!</li>
            <li> smells great and lasts long. my husband loves it!!</li>
            <li> Definitely an awesome product attracting others, the results become definitely obvious. It is cheap while keeping a masculine sent that is not too strong or even fruity for that matter.  The only problem is that it just wears off a little soon. which is great because many people like myself, hate colognes or pheromones that give a sent that is too strong and give headaches anyways.</li>
            <li> I loved it and there was no problems with the package at all&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really really really really really good</li>
            <li> I simply love fruity scents, so naturally I like it.  I really like it it and my wife does to .</li>
            <li> Adidas Dynamic Pulse has a pleasant clean and crisp scent that is appropriate for everyday use. Several female co-workers have complimented me on it. Unfortunately, compliments have been given only within an hour of applying: it doesn&#x27;t last much longer than that on my skin (it does seem to last longer on cloth).</li>
            <li> Simply put,  this is a good scent for any working male.  It&#x27;s not overbearing and goes well with the shirt and tie guys as well as the work boot and hard hat men.  I&#x27;ve received nothing but compliments from women since I&#x27;ve worn it.  Let&#x27;s face it guys,  that&#x27;s the real reason why we wear cologne in the first place,  isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> A good eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else. Settled on this after trying several perfumes from the bestseller list.. This feels and smells fresh. Wife loves it - end of argument.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. it&#x27;s excellent. the scent its great and chicks like it a lot so buy it!</li>
