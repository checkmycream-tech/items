            <li>They got here well before they were supposed to, which is great.</li>
            <li>it makes a great cosplay or costume piece</li>
            <li>Love em, though I keep putting them on unevenly lol</li>
            <li>I had to use a bobby pin or two to get them to look exactly how I wanted them, but otherwise, they were perfect!</li>
            <li>These are nice(:</li>
            <li>Honestly thought they would be better quality.</li>
            <li>They are very cute and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>I have very smooth hair, so a lot of things I wear tend to slide of, but this one stays on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love that it comes with an apple shaped apple peeler.</li>
            <li>It makes no sense for it to include that, but I love it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>mostly bought this to see if one of my friends would want one.</li>
            <li>I tried  them on and just  fell in love with  them</li>
            <li>More like mouse ears or &amp;#34;Cow&amp;#34; wears is what my sister said...</li>
            <li>but for the price they&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li>They look more like mouse ears though.</li>
            <li>First of all, for its cheap price, these are very nice.</li>
            <li>Cute and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>It falls out of my hair easily</li>
            <li>Overall they&#x27;re great c:</li>
            <li>was so excited to get these</li>
            <li>I really like them, they&#x27;re comfortable and adorable.</li>
            <li>A simple stitch at the top could probably fix that easily.</li>
            <li>the inside isn&#x27;t really that good, they come off easily, and the product is hard to clip on, but i still enjoyed these.</li>
            <li>They look almost exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Super soft and the clips don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the bendy barrette that they put on the bottom which makes it easier to stay on.</li>
            <li>Absolutely puuuurrfect</li>
            <li>Besides that, they&#x27;re cute and are what I expected.</li>
            <li>I love these because they&#x27;re so fluffy and adorable but they aren&#x27;t as pointed as I expected.</li>
            <li>Meh, these ears are kind of weird</li>
            <li>There was some black fluff on the pink, but it was really easy to rub off.</li>

            <li> Yeah like this green apple peeler?</li>
            <li> This was waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was expecting them to be triangle shaped like the ones in the pictures, but no they are cone shaped so it makes them look round and not cat ear shaped like at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very round and look closer to mouse ears.</li>
            <li> they are very round, loo like mouse ears instead of cat, not what i paid for</li>
            <li> but there is honestly no shape to them.</li>
            <li> But I gave it a 4/5 because they came 4 days late.</li>
            <li> Not a great product over all.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>

            <li> Looked like mouse ears not cat ears</li>
            <li> They look almost exactly like the picture. There was some black fluff on the pink, but it was really easy to rub off. I really like the bendy barrette that they put on the bottom which makes it easier to stay on. I have very smooth hair, so a lot of things I wear tend to slide of, but this one stays on.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes with an apple shaped apple peeler. It makes no sense for it to include that, but I love it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I mostly bought this to see if one of my friends would want one. She fawned over them immediately. I will definitely get one set for her.</li>
            <li> Part of this came apart in a week later. Do not buy these...</li>
            <li> You can tell they&#x27;re ears but there is honestly no shape to them. Still cute&lt;br /&gt; I wear them constantly.</li>
            <li> Love em, though I keep putting them on unevenly lol</li>
            <li> Girlfriend got these, and she didn&#x27;t even get to snap the clip open before the hair clip came off. The glue was crappy. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely puuuurrfect</li>
            <li> These were alright... Looked like mouse ears, but that&#x27;s alright. These are nice(:</li>
            <li> I really like them, they&#x27;re comfortable and adorable. Super soft and the clips don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair. But I gave it a 4/5 because they came 4 days late.</li>

            <li> I had to use a bobby pin or two to get them to look exactly how I wanted them, but otherwise, they were perfect! They got here well before they were supposed to, which is great. For some reason, though, they came with an apple peeler that I never ordered...?</li>
            <li> I tried  them on and just  fell in love with  them</li>
            <li> it makes a great cosplay or costume piece</li>
            <li> Honestly thought they would be better quality. And it came with a peeler? Yeah like this green apple peeler? Not sure why. Whats it for??? Not a great product over all.</li>
            <li> They look like pig ears not cat ears</li>
            <li> Cute and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Welp. This was waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get these but then I was saddened that they weren&#x27;t what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;These &amp;#34;cat&amp;#34; ears don&#x27;t even look like cat ears.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting them to be triangle shaped like the ones in the pictures, but no they are cone shaped so it makes them look round and not cat ear shaped like at all. More like mouse ears or &amp;#34;Cow&amp;#34; wears is what my sister said...&lt;br /&gt;Oh well you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I purchased the black/pink version. First of all, for its cheap price, these are very nice. However, they don&#x27;t actually have a cat ear shape. They&#x27;re very round and look closer to mouse ears. A simple stitch at the top could probably fix that easily. Besides that, they&#x27;re cute and are what I expected.</li>
            <li> It falls out of my hair easily</li>
            <li> They are very cute and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> Meh, these ears are kind of weird but for the price they&#x27;re okay. They look more like mouse ears though.</li>
            <li> they are very round, loo like mouse ears instead of cat, not what i paid for</li>
