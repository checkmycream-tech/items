            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>She was wearing all this Amazing Grace stuff before we got together</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter for Christmas as she loves Amazing Grace.  </li>
            <li>Amazing grace does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>The Amazing Grace smell is also gone in minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Philosophy products for years and have an abundance of Amazing Grace items.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;like Amazing Grace.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t gotten stains on my clothes fom it, the scent is nice but does need to be layered (so it&#x27;s not overpowering), , and the mist bottle does spray/spread nicely.</li>
            <li>I love it, get compliments and questions about what are you wearing that smells so good?  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice shine to your skin.  </li>
            <li>Non greasy and smells so clean!!</li>
            <li>Believe it or not the oil smells even better than the perfume - it is softer and warmer without any of the warm additives like amber or musk.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent of Amazing Grace</li>
            <li>I love the Amazing Grace fragrance but this product seems to be oil/spoiled.  </li>
            <li>I love the amazing Grace fragrance but have never tried this product.  </li>
            <li>This is not the Amazing Grace fragrance I&#x27;ve come to love.  </li>

            <li>I love this Amazing Grace Oil Mist.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance Amazing Grace</li>

            <li>but it is very light</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely way to layer scents.  </li>
            <li>So happy to find one of my favorite fragrances on Amazon at such a good price.</li>
            <li>love all of the Philosophy product line.</li>
            <li>I love the product itself.</li>
            <li>I love it tho.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Always sure to please any person that uses it.</li>
            <li>I love this oil mist.  </li>
            <li>I love the oil feel on my skin</li>
            <li>Love it after shower.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance</li>
            <li>But I love how silky it leaves your skin.</li>
            <li>Smell is authentic to Grace.</li>
            <li>Love the earthy scent of  the lotion and body wash.</li>
            <li>I wear the Amazing Grace perfume and love the clean smell.</li>
            <li>I love philosophy amazing grace.great after a nice hot shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but has enough of a wonderful fragrance to it that you catch a whiff of it as you move through your day...</li>
            <li>Perfect for after shower and lightly scented enough to wear to work.</li>
            <li>great oil mist, leaves skin satin soft seriously, i love this.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin extremely soft as well as smelling great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to buy online and a fine product, just not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>This product smelled good on a client of mine, but I didn&#x27;t like it that much on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the fresh scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so full of fragrance!  </li>
            <li>I love dry oil and the Philosophy brand smells soooooo good!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear body sprays or perfume because they are always to strong or fruity</li>
            <li>the scent isn&#x27;t strong at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, it&#x27;s not floral, it&#x27;s not cloying.</li>
            <li>The best part is that the scent is so subtle that you can easily wear the Amazing Grace perfume without the smell becoming cloying or overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can smell a hint of Amazing Grace when I first put it on</li>
            <li>It is very fresh and clean fragrance...lovely!</li>
            <li>So when I went on their site and saw this I went straight to my Amazon Prime account to see if it was cheaper and as in most cases it was!  </li>
            <li>I love the soft  scent fo Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li>Although the scent is light, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, just absorbs into the skin and moisturized while scenting your skin with fabulous Grace.</li>
            <li>) the lotion gives me a smooth feel, and it lasts.  </li>
            <li>This is a light fragrance that I have been wearing for years.</li>
            <li>Light moisturizer and no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Leaves a light scent.</li>
            <li>Light moisturizing I even spray it on my face.</li>
            <li>Only wish the scent of Amazing Grace was more prominent in the product.  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully light to wear on</li>
            <li>I use neutrogena light sesame body oil and thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>This product smells like some cheap perfume and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and pretty, but nothing like the perfume.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect product for those of us who are too lazy to spend time applying lotion.  </li>
            <li>it is light and feminine with out being overly sweet and cloying.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of Amazing Grace and wanted a body oil with the same scent as my perfume.</li>
            <li>I love Amazing Grace scent as a daily fragrance</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling silky soft and smooth, especially right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and clean and the oil is light.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and clean and makes your skin extremely soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and soft</li>
            <li>Love this so much</li>
            <li>you feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>but it quickly fades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok and it smells good for a few minutes..</li>
            <li>It is fresh and unique - not floral or musky or overly sweet, doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;fresh linen\\&quot; -</li>
            <li>Plus I smell good all day long.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>I can definitely smell it when my skin heats up in the warm weather, but I can&#x27;t smell it around me all day like a perfume.</li>
            <li>love the fact that the oil mist completely absorbs into my skin and does not stain my clothing.  </li>
            <li>but this spray isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
            <li>I spray it on right after the shower and yeas</li>
            <li>oil goes on satiny smooth and dries quickly leaving my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I actually wish the perfume smelled more like the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The application, scent and long lasting effect is great.</li>
            <li>Not so much!</li>
            <li>use the body butter first then the oil mist and you will have lasting fragrance, love this stuff</li>
            <li>And such a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>There was absolutely on scent to this oil!</li>
            <li>It is a simple way to keep skin moisturized and, as an added bonus, it is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews that stated this was as good, if not better than the traditional perfume.</li>
            <li>She had never had this &amp; said she really truly liked it and it made her skin feel extra soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li>your gonna love them so easy not greasy or thick like lotions.</li>
            <li>I caution you that if this gets on the BR floor or shower floor, it is VERY slippery.</li>
            <li>I buy this whole line of Philosophy for my fiance.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any oil stains on anything.</li>
            <li>but it is very feint</li>
            <li>Philosophy really missed the mark on this one.</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated so I am using it sparingly.</li>
            <li>feels like satin going on and really melts into skin.</li>
            <li>Similar to grocery store one dimensional cheap scents.</li>
            <li>It does not linger and the oil mist doesn&#x27;t really soften ..</li>
            <li>Goes on nice, but once it&#x27;s on for a few minutes my skin feels like it never had anything on it.  </li>
            <li>It soaks right in to your skin and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Great for those men that hate greasy women:)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>If  you&#x27;re close enough, you can smell it and that&#x27;s exactly how it should be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbs into the skin giving it a moisture treatment unlike other oil sprays.  </li>
            <li>I ended up spraying very close to skin while on larger bath mat.</li>
            <li>I bought her some early this year</li>
            <li>My husband always told me and others how soft my skin was.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately we need to get a really good moisturizer that soaks in and stays there.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately I switched over to the new Vaseline Product...same benefits, without the over spray.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t help dry skin.  </li>
            <li>She disagrees with reviews about the scent wearing off too quickly, saying that it&#x27;s not made to be heavy in the air around you all the time.</li>

            <li> This product smelled good on a client of mine, but I didn&#x27;t like it that much on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the fresh scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so full of fragrance!  </li>
            <li> I love dry oil and the Philosophy brand smells soooooo good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear body sprays or perfume because they are always to strong or fruity</li>
            <li> the scent isn&#x27;t strong at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong, it&#x27;s not floral, it&#x27;s not cloying.</li>
            <li> The best part is that the scent is so subtle that you can easily wear the Amazing Grace perfume without the smell becoming cloying or overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can smell a hint of Amazing Grace when I first put it on</li>
            <li> It is very fresh and clean fragrance...lovely!</li>
            <li> So when I went on their site and saw this I went straight to my Amazon Prime account to see if it was cheaper and as in most cases it was!  </li>
            <li> I love the soft  scent fo Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li> Although the scent is light, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, just absorbs into the skin and moisturized while scenting your skin with fabulous Grace.</li>
            <li> ) the lotion gives me a smooth feel, and it lasts.  </li>
            <li> This is a light fragrance that I have been wearing for years.</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer and no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Leaves a light scent.</li>
            <li> Light moisturizing I even spray it on my face.</li>
            <li> Only wish the scent of Amazing Grace was more prominent in the product.  </li>
            <li> Wonderfully light to wear on</li>
            <li> I use neutrogena light sesame body oil and thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> This product smells like some cheap perfume and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and pretty, but nothing like the perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for those of us who are too lazy to spend time applying lotion.  </li>
            <li> it is light and feminine with out being overly sweet and cloying.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of Amazing Grace and wanted a body oil with the same scent as my perfume.</li>
            <li> I love Amazing Grace scent as a daily fragrance</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling silky soft and smooth, especially right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and clean and the oil is light.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and clean and makes your skin extremely soft.</li>

            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> but it quickly fades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok and it smells good for a few minutes..</li>
            <li> It is fresh and unique - not floral or musky or overly sweet, doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;fresh linen\\&quot; -</li>
            <li> Plus I smell good all day long.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> I can definitely smell it when my skin heats up in the warm weather, but I can&#x27;t smell it around me all day like a perfume.</li>
            <li> love the fact that the oil mist completely absorbs into my skin and does not stain my clothing.  </li>
            <li> but this spray isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
            <li> I spray it on right after the shower and yeas</li>
            <li> oil goes on satiny smooth and dries quickly leaving my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I actually wish the perfume smelled more like the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The application, scent and long lasting effect is great.</li>
            <li> Not so much!</li>
            <li> use the body butter first then the oil mist and you will have lasting fragrance, love this stuff</li>
            <li> And such a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely on scent to this oil!</li>
            <li> It is a simple way to keep skin moisturized and, as an added bonus, it is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews that stated this was as good, if not better than the traditional perfume.</li>
            <li> She had never had this &amp; said she really truly liked it and it made her skin feel extra soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li> your gonna love them so easy not greasy or thick like lotions.</li>
            <li> I caution you that if this gets on the BR floor or shower floor, it is VERY slippery.</li>
            <li> I buy this whole line of Philosophy for my fiance.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any oil stains on anything.</li>
            <li> but it is very feint</li>
            <li> Philosophy really missed the mark on this one.</li>
            <li> It is very concentrated so I am using it sparingly.</li>
            <li> feels like satin going on and really melts into skin.</li>
            <li> Similar to grocery store one dimensional cheap scents.</li>
            <li> It does not linger and the oil mist doesn&#x27;t really soften ..</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, but once it&#x27;s on for a few minutes my skin feels like it never had anything on it.  </li>
            <li> It soaks right in to your skin and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great for those men that hate greasy women:)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> If  you&#x27;re close enough, you can smell it and that&#x27;s exactly how it should be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbs into the skin giving it a moisture treatment unlike other oil sprays.  </li>
            <li> I ended up spraying very close to skin while on larger bath mat.</li>
            <li> I bought her some early this year</li>
            <li> My husband always told me and others how soft my skin was.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately we need to get a really good moisturizer that soaks in and stays there.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately I switched over to the new Vaseline Product...same benefits, without the over spray.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t help dry skin.  </li>
            <li> She disagrees with reviews about the scent wearing off too quickly, saying that it&#x27;s not made to be heavy in the air around you all the time.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of this scent when I first put it on but after about half an hour, the scent softened and is enjoyable.</li>
            <li> But I am very sad that they say the fragrance smell is philosophy amazing grace..</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This oil last a long time.  </li>
            <li> but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long....</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> they make this Dry Oil.</li>
            <li> When Sephoria stopped selling their line of dry body oil</li>
            <li> If you have never used dry oils</li>
            <li> Make sure you are careful about where you apply the product, as it can leave a sheen on your floor or your bathtub - which can be dangerous.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Does not require using a lot of product as a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Has very little lasting smell...</li>
            <li> It smells completely different at least on me.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s half of what attracted me to her in the 1st place.</li>
            <li> little product for the money, spray not easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I seriously mean NO ONE smells like my girl.</li>
            <li> The spray application is a bit sloppy as it sprays all over and you end up getting it on bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say now it&#x27;s in the rotation of \\&quot;must have\\&quot; items.</li>
            <li> Scent is too faint.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of being too shiny with this oil.  </li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> ,disappointed.</li>

            <li> Perfect for after shower and lightly scented enough to wear to work. Although the scent is light, it lasts all day. It&#x27;s not greasy, just absorbs into the skin and moisturized while scenting your skin with fabulous Grace.</li>
            <li> I love dry oil and the Philosophy brand smells soooooo good! It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It soaks right in to your skin and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized. Will buy again and definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I love the soft  scent fo Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li> I wear the Amazing Grace perfume and love the clean smell. It is fresh and unique - not floral or musky or overly sweet, doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;fresh linen\\&quot; - it&#x27;s just wonderful. Believe it or not the oil smells even better than the perfume - it is softer and warmer without any of the warm additives like amber or musk. I love it. I actually wish the perfume smelled more like the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil goes on satiny smooth and dries quickly leaving my skin soft. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or any greasy feel at all. The smell lingers throughout the day but is not overpowering. I can definitely smell it when my skin heats up in the warm weather, but I can&#x27;t smell it around me all day like a perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely way to layer scents.  I also have the Philosophy lotion and cologne, so spraying this on after (or instead of) the lotion gives me a smooth feel, and it lasts.  This is a light fragrance that I have been wearing for years.</li>
            <li> I need more!!! Addicting!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Authentic and great!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell of Amazing Grace. With this is added bonus of oil in a spray. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  Last all day.  Lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear body sprays or perfume because they are always to strong or fruity and I get headaches from the scent. I LOVE the scent of Amazing Grace it&#x27;s nice and soft you feel fresh and clean the scent isn&#x27;t strong at all. I would highly recommend it I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!!!!  I am on my 5th or 6th bottle of the stuff.  I keep it in the shower and spray it all over once I have toweled off.  This is the perfect product for those of us who are too lazy to spend time applying lotion.  It makes your skin extremely soft as well as smelling great.</li>
            <li> This product smelled good on a client of mine, but I didn&#x27;t like it that much on me.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to buy online and a fine product, just not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.  Smells wonderful but wish the fragrance lasted longer.</li>
            <li> So happy to find one of my favorite fragrances on Amazon at such a good price.</li>
            <li> love all of the Philosophy product line.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, price, and shipping were outstanding</li>
            <li> I love the product itself. The application, scent and long lasting effect is great. The spray application is a bit sloppy as it sprays all over and you end up getting it on bathroom floor.  To remedy this:stand on bath mat as you spray or spray while in shower.  I caution you that if this gets on the BR floor or shower floor, it is VERY slippery. I ended up spraying very close to skin while on larger bath mat. Ultimately I switched over to the new Vaseline Product...same benefits, without the over spray.</li>
            <li> it was ok, nice Fragance, not what I exepcted for the price!</li>
            <li> Spray it on and it&#x27;s not oily.  Light moisturizer and no greasy feel.  Great for those men that hate greasy women:) but it really doesn&#x27;t help dry skin.  Unfortunately we need to get a really good moisturizer that soaks in and stays there.  If someone finds one that isn&#x27;t greasy and won&#x27;t cost a fortune let me know!</li>
            <li> Smells so good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long....even with layering it with skin cream and parfum. I love it tho.</li>
            <li> great product, smells amazing... just like amazing grace. great oil mist, leaves skin satin soft seriously, i love this. will def buy again!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried this line of fragrance -- Look, this stuff is awesome. I buy this whole line of Philosophy for my fiance. She was wearing all this Amazing Grace stuff before we got together and I&#x27;ll tell ya, it&#x27;s half of what attracted me to her in the 1st place. NO ONE and I seriously mean NO ONE smells like my girl. I NEVER encounter anyone on the streets wearing this stuff. It&#x27;s fantastic. It&#x27;s not too strong, it&#x27;s not floral, it&#x27;s not cloying. It&#x27;s just woman-awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so aside of the scent, which hopefully you&#x27;re sold on... this oil stuff is supposed to be great. I bought her some early this year and she&#x27;s on her 3rd bottle now. Needless to say now it&#x27;s in the rotation of \\&quot;must have\\&quot; items. She disagrees with reviews about the scent wearing off too quickly, saying that it&#x27;s not made to be heavy in the air around you all the time. If  you&#x27;re close enough, you can smell it and that&#x27;s exactly how it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give it 6 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> Smells so good. Leaves a light scent. Light moisturizing I even spray it on my face. Would recommend, boyfriend loves to sniff me when I&#x27;m wearing it!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews that stated this was as good, if not better than the traditional perfume. Not so much! It&#x27;s very light and pretty, but nothing like the perfume. It smells completely different at least on me. It is still very nice, just not what I wanted. Absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any oil stains on anything.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Does not require using a lot of product as a little bit goes a long way.  This bottle will last a long time.  Only wish the scent of Amazing Grace was more prominent in the product.  Works well with layering.</li>
            <li> Love Amazing Grace!! Quick shipping!!</li>
            <li> Smells great but not as potent as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love this product it smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> Has very little lasting smell...,disappointed.</li>
            <li> Philosophy is a wonderful name in womens products..Always sure to please any person that uses it. Great gift items for women of all ages.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I would like and it is not scented that wonderful &amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34; fragrance.  I had hoped it would take the place of my body lotion and act as another layer of the fragrance.  Not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Amazing Grace and wanted a body oil with the same scent as my perfume. I&#x27;m so gad they make this Dry Oil. It isn&#x27;t greasy so I haven&#x27;t gotten stains on my clothes fom it, the scent is nice but does need to be layered (so it&#x27;s not overpowering), , and the mist bottle does spray/spread nicely.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product!! OMG!! Love it!! I am a big fan of this fragrance! It is awesome! Non greasy and smells so clean!! I actually was going to order my perfume, which I ran out of, but after using this I don&#x27;t think I need too!! Awesome!!  Love the fresh scent! Feel like I just came out of the shower all day!!</li>
            <li> I love the Amazing Grace fragrance but this product seems to be oil/spoiled.  Dumping it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of being too shiny with this oil.  Quickly absorbs into the skin giving it a moisture treatment unlike other oil sprays.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the amazing Grace fragrance but have never tried this product.  I love it, get compliments and questions about what are you wearing that smells so good?  Leaves a satiny non oily, non greasy finish.  No residue on skin or clothing.  Wonderfully light to wear on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> use the body butter first then the oil mist and you will have lasting fragrance, love this stuff.......love this scent but it is very feint, you have to layer this with the body butter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas as she loves Amazing Grace.  She had never had this &amp; said she really truly liked it and it made her skin feel extra soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Mazing grace is my fav always ❤️</li>
            <li> This is awesome, a wonderful compliment to the spritz!</li>
            <li> This feels so good on my skin. And such a lovely scent. Amazing grace does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I use neutrogena light sesame body oil and thought I would give this a try. Totally not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Too little product for the money, spray not easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The scent is fresh and clean and the oil is light. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This is my mom&#x27;s favorite scent and this was a great product to get her.</li>
            <li> I love this oil mist.  It leaves my skin feeling silky soft and smooth, especially right out of the shower.  The best part is that the scent is so subtle that you can easily wear the Amazing Grace perfume without the smell becoming cloying or overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the oil mist completely absorbs into my skin and does not stain my clothing.  Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love the oil feel on my skin but I gave this three stars only because it is not scented enough. I can smell a hint of Amazing Grace when I first put it on but it quickly fades.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft and has a very light scent. Does not feel greasy or oily. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Light. Great scent. Love it after shower.</li>
            <li> Love this item!  Fragrance lasts!</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> The body oil mist is great and makes your skin feel good. But I am very sad that they say the fragrance smell is philosophy amazing grace..but I do not smell that at all. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, but once it&#x27;s on for a few minutes my skin feels like it never had anything on it.  The Amazing Grace smell is also gone in minutes.</li>
            <li> received product before eta and in good condition. Love the fragrance but it is very light so you need to layer it ( oil, perfume, lotion) in order to smell it. It is very fresh and clean fragrance...lovely!</li>
            <li> Smells like nothing!  This is not the Amazing Grace fragrance I&#x27;ve come to love.  This body oil spray smells like nothing.  It was a complete waste of money.  Philosophy really missed the mark on this one.</li>
            <li> I love the amazing grace perfume so I thought I would give this a try. It&#x27;s ok and it smells good for a few minutes.. But does not last at all. I personally don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Philosophy products for years and have an abundance of Amazing Grace items.  This product smells like some cheap perfume and NOT at all&lt;br /&gt;like Amazing Grace.  I was ripped off and believe this must have been a counterfeit items.</li>
            <li> I love this Amazing Grace Oil Mist.  It is not greasy.  It gives a nice shine to your skin.  Plus I smell good all day long.</li>
            <li> When Sephoria stopped selling their line of dry body oil I was frantic!  My husband always told me and others how soft my skin was.  I love Amazing Grace scent as a daily fragrance it is light and feminine with out being overly sweet and cloying.  So when I went on their site and saw this I went straight to my Amazon Prime account to see if it was cheaper and as in most cases it was!  This oil last a long time.  I spray it on right after the shower and yeas the legacy continues.  My skin is so soft.  If you have never used dry oils your gonna love them so easy not greasy or thick like lotions.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of this scent when I first put it on but after about half an hour, the scent softened and is enjoyable. It is very concentrated so I am using it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because the scent is perfect!  It&#x27;s not too strong, but has enough of a wonderful fragrance to it that you catch a whiff of it as you move through your day... and you think, ooh, what smells so good? ....Yeah, that would be me!</li>
            <li> Perfect to just spray on when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  Smells nice and clean and makes your skin extremely soft. I love it!</li>
            <li> feels like satin going on and really melts into skin. I love philosophy amazing grace.great after a nice hot shower.</li>
            <li> Scent is too faint. But I love how silky it leaves your skin. I used it this summer on my legs and shoulders with my maxi dresses and it made my tan look awesome</li>
            <li> There was absolutely on scent to this oil!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as good as I rwmembered. But it still smelled good.</li>
            <li> Of course AMAZON Prime comes through with the BEST deals ...this scented body oil does go on somewhat oily - but a minute after rubbing on the skin - it&#x27;s perfect! Smell is authentic to Grace. Thank you !</li>
            <li> Love this so much I have ordered a second bottle for my vacation home. It is a simple way to keep skin moisturized and, as an added bonus, it is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so full of fragrance!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the earthy scent of  the lotion and body wash. Not present in the oil at all. Similar to grocery store one dimensional cheap scents.</li>
            <li> I like the product - it smells very nice.  Make sure you are careful about where you apply the product, as it can leave a sheen on your floor or your bathtub - which can be dangerous.  It isn&#x27;t too overpowering and arrived as described.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance Amazing Grace but this spray isn&#x27;t worth the time. It does not linger and the oil mist doesn&#x27;t really soften .. it doesn&#x27;t help my dry skin.</li>
