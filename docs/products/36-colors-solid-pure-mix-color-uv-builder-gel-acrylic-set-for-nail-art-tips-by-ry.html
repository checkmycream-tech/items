            <li>Good luck if you do!</li>
            <li>however these are great.</li>

            <li>Great Colors.</li>
            <li>Great product and cost effective!</li>
            <li>Good value for the money</li>
            <li>The colors look really great and it was clean!</li>
            <li>I would of liked to had colors wrote on the container</li>
            <li>Ok so I thought the quality was not going to be good because of the price which I was ok with</li>
            <li>just be sure to mix each color in pot w. a toothpick as the pigment settles in the bottom.</li>
            <li>Then I tried to use them and ended up having a meltdown because most of them wouldn&#x27;t cure under the gel lamp.</li>
            <li>I had to put the color dots on top</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the cheaper one on eBay</li>
            <li>Bright , vibrant, pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>I just put a dot on each lid and cured in my lamp easy fix.</li>
            <li>If I keep them done with the gel they are strong and don&#x27;t break off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>I only wish they worked with an led light lol</li>
            <li>I have an led light and didn&#x27;t notice these need a up light.</li>
            <li>and I had to clean all the containers off but was easily done with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>excited to try it..</li>
            <li>You get really beautiful colors and a wide range of colors.</li>
            <li>there was no residue on the sides of the container to clean up and the color consistency as well as the thickness of the product</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly-  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>but it was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>is really amazing especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Anyway, it is a risky buy, but nice to have the colors when they actually work.</li>
            <li>regrets, glad I tried (this deal seemed too good to pass!), but no thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky</li>
            <li>would&#x27;ve just tried to give them to a friend if they were interested, but I ended up throwing them out.</li>
            <li>These colors are amazing, they are thick so most colors need only one coat.</li>
            <li>delivery is really fast..</li>
            <li>The order came a whole day earlier than expected so that was nice.</li>
            <li>I do however, in spite of the drawbacks, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>But I think  thatafter practice with it a little more</li>
            <li>I got mostly pinks, no greens, and even a few sparkles.</li>
            <li>Got these a few weeks ago and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>after I&#x27;ve used it a few more times.</li>
            <li>so, I gave them a new home...</li>
            <li>but I read a suggestion to do thin layers and mix the gel before using them to get a nice even color.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and no two are the same!</li>
            <li>It takes quite a bit of time to open each container, label them and clean up the mess from opening each of them.</li>
            <li>It does not look smooth and is not like gel at all it goes on clumpy and thick .</li>
            <li>Wide array of colors but kind of runny or thin.</li>
            <li>Color Dots would be much easier or prelabel them before you pack them would save a BIG MESS for all of us later.</li>

            <li> I got these for a Xmas gift and loovvvee them! Bright , vibrant, pigmented colors.Not clumpy or watery-  just be sure to mix each color in pot w. a toothpick as the pigment settles in the bottom.Shipped quickly-  As a nail tech I&#x27;m pretty picky however these are great.FYI These are not soak off gel they are file off. The possibilities are endless. Only knock is there is no way of knowing what colors are in each pot. After I opened them carefully ...I just put a dot on each lid and cured in my lamp easy fix. Great product and cost effective!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about all of these, I waited 3 weeks for them to get here, and the colors you get are random. I got mostly pinks, no greens, and even a few sparkles. It was weird. Then I tried to use them and ended up having a meltdown because most of them wouldn&#x27;t cure under the gel lamp. Then the next day some decided to work when I tried again. Anyway, it is a risky buy, but nice to have the colors when they actually work. Good luck if you do!</li>
            <li> Some duplicate colors,  they come in small white jars with no lables at all. I had to open all of them, put some gel on the cap and cure it to know what color was inside so I wouldn&#x27;t have to open them all again the next time I used them.</li>
            <li> Work great with my lamp. I tend to break my nails off even when they are very short. If I keep them done with the gel they are strong and don&#x27;t break off. I have one or two color repeats but the rest are different colors.</li>
            <li> Got these a few weeks ago and I absolutely love them. I had to put the color dots on top but it was fast and easy. Lots of colors. I was worried about them not curing but I read a suggestion to do thin layers and mix the gel before using them to get a nice even color. I did that and have had no problems with it!</li>
            <li> When I ordered these, I thought they would be like the gel nail polish you typically buy in the store. I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem if they were a little thick in consistency—I can deal with that—but I would describe being similar to &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34;. Molasses even! The weird thing is even though they&#x27;re really thick, they don&#x27;t cover really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve just tried to give them to a friend if they were interested, but I ended up throwing them out. I&#x27;m used to nail polish smell (it doesn&#x27;t really bother me), but this odor made me feel a bit sick. It&#x27;s a strong chemical smell and I felt irritation in my throat after a while! The scary thing is these have no label so there&#x27;s no telling what&#x27;s going on with that so, I gave them a new home... in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets, glad I tried (this deal seemed too good to pass!), but no thanks!</li>
            <li> My fault. I have an led light and didn&#x27;t notice these need a up light. Getting one soon. These colors are amazing, they are thick so most colors need only one coat. The colors are vibrant and no two are the same! I only wish they worked with an led light lol</li>
            <li> Ok so I thought the quality was not going to be good because of the price which I was ok with but I Was WRONG! I love this product the consistency is really thick there is no product separation. The colors look really great and it was clean! My classmates ordered from eBay and it&#x27;s a different product. This is so much better than the cheaper one on eBay there was no residue on the sides of the container to clean up and the color consistency as well as the thickness of the product is really amazing especially for the price!</li>
            <li> It does not look smooth and is not like gel at all it goes on clumpy and thick . I want my money back and do not recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> there should be a color indicator...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;white bottles without anything on those...&lt;br /&gt;i still need to use them tho</li>
            <li> delivery is really fast..have&#x27;nt tried the product yet...but I like it...excited to try it..</li>
            <li> Wide array of colors but kind of runny or thin. Shipping took a month.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick. Very happy with pjrchase will be buying again. You get really beautiful colors and a wide range of colors.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money</li>
            <li> All come in white tubs. No way of know what color is inside</li>
            <li> The order came a whole day earlier than expected so that was nice. There was a container that came open and I had to clean all the containers off but was easily done with a paper towel. I would of liked to had colors wrote on the container but I opened them all and wrote on the outside with a marker. Colors seem vibrant and did a sample nail to test out manageability, it was a little hard to work with. But I think  thatafter practice with it a little more it will work well. I am not sure if I will buy this again but will hold off saying yes or no after I&#x27;ve used it a few more times.</li>
            <li> Great Colors. I just wish the company would insert \\&quot;COLOR DOTS\\&quot; in the box. It takes quite a bit of time to open each container, label them and clean up the mess from opening each of them. The gel is pressure packed so consequently when you open them, a bit explodes out. Color Dots would be much easier or prelabel them before you pack them would save a BIG MESS for all of us later. I do however, in spite of the drawbacks, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
