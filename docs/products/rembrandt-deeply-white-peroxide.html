    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>And the best mouthwash is Crest&#x27;s whitening mouth wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the best whitening toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Great name too after the painter!</li>
            <li>yet I believe the best stain removing toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It works GREAT!</li>
            <li>being said, this toothpaste is probably the best you&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
            <li>Well... as awesome as awesome can be for just being toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best whitening  toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>the price that Amazon is charging is very fair.</li>
            <li>Order arrives in great packing condition...</li>
            <li>I tried this toothpaste expecting, considering the price, that it would be great.</li>

            <li>The results for this toothpaste are amazing!</li>
            <li>is my kind of shopping!</li>
            <li>After trying many brands of toothpaste this is still the BEST!!</li>
            <li>I do like the product but, be honest with your packaging Rembrandt!</li>
            <li>Fluoride in the toothpaste may be a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Good toothpaste but overpriced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with this toothpaste for good.</li>
            <li>This works really good with the rinse.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and good.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>So I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>After paying for braces with an included Zoom whitening treatment, we wanted to make sure they could keep up the maintenance for those beautiful smiles.</li>
            <li>It would be great to be able to order that in the 3-pack.  </li>
            <li>Great toothpaste, but needs to be packaged better.</li>
            <li>lol :)</li>
            <li>My teeth do look a lot better, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Ok if you get a great deal like I did on a \\&quot;Today&#x27;s Deal\\&quot; from Amazon</li>
            <li>very, very pleased.</li>
            <li>(so it is very safe and gentle)that will dissolve away stains on the surface of the teeth instead of an abrasive.  </li>
            <li>Ok let say it is one very popular and nice paste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried $18 tubes of whitening toothpaste and Rembrandts is better!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I would surely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>I really love using this tooth paste!</li>
            <li>When I took the tube out of the box it was pleasantly plump, as if there was more product than I thought.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This purchase from Amazon was amazing</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>I work in a hospital and one of the neurosurgeons stopped me in the hallway to ask what I did to keep my teeth bright and so healthy looking...</li>
            <li>Cleans and whitens your teeth and has a nice flavor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how effective this toothpaste is, it should be a crime to sell this product in a tube</li>
            <li>Was packed nicely and no product damage.</li>
            <li>It really does whiten the best and prevents cavities.  </li>
            <li>kind of pricey for me</li>
            <li>Of all the whitening toothpaste I have tried, this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Crest whitening strips and toothpastes, Colgate whitening toothpastes and an at home UV treatment, but this has by far shown the best results.</li>
            <li>I had known that whitening could be this easy, I would have started years ago!  </li>
            <li>and it had a much better consistency and worked well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how safe is peroxide on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>, the tubes are probably more than half-air</li>
            <li>Did I mention it does work :-)</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference, but I&#x27;ll give it more time :)</li>
            <li>This product seems to work much better than any of the others we&#x27;ve tried, so we signed up for Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste, my mouth feels refresh</li>
            <li>It really works, and when I&#x27;ve recommended it to others, they&#x27;ve always told me that they were happy with it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my teeth were perfect and grew several shades whiter</li>
            <li>For me is a tooth paste and nothing more.</li>
            <li>it is still my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Wife has allergies to ingredients in most all toothpaste products.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is okay - it does seem to whiten over</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but don&#x27;t use it more to twice a day.</li>
            <li>I may not be a dentist, but I know my own experience, and it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My last dental cleaning, I asked what was the best toothpaste for whightning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure someone will comment with \\&quot;It</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see if I can get my girlfriend to use the rest of it. :)</li>
            <li>It works way better then the cheap toothpaste!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen many people write reviews and make inaccurate accusations because the consumers are failing to read ALL of the products information.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having clarified those oversights that it seems many reviewers are obviously overlooking, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure results will vary</li>
            <li>I was very excited to hear about this toothpaste</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t experienced any tooth sensitivity, which is a particular relief because tooth sensitivity runs in my family.    </li>
            <li>I love strong mint flavors</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll start off with the flaw as it&#x27;s most important.</li>
            <li>It was full of air!</li>
            <li>Before try Rembrandt, I was using a store-bought bottle of a popular whitening solution which was way better then this and whitening effect was very noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has quite a strong flavor because of the whitening ingredients.</li>
            <li>Because I have veneers, my dentist limits the kinds of toothpaste I can use, but my kids use Rembrandt and they have beautiful white teeth.  </li>
            <li>so it taste fine, but I wouldnt brush your tongue with it.</li>
            <li>so it does go quickly if you brush your teeth twice a day or more.</li>
            <li>Worth trying for sure.</li>
            <li>and she reconmended Rembrandt Deep Cleaning products and said their strips work really great too.</li>
            <li>My teeth stay smooth for hours and hours.</li>
            <li>Overall, they have whitened and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This does a great job keeping my teeth white if I could get over the taste!</li>
            <li>Using Rembrandt products made me feel confident in my smile again.</li>
            <li>I finally went and I had a great checkup</li>
            <li>- at this cost the tube is to be completely full of toothpaste that dispenses in an easily controlled fashion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All my family now is using only this toothpaste as it whitens the teeth very effectively.</li>
            <li>So keep yourself knowledgeable, and enjoy your beautiful white smile if you decide to use this product.</li>
            <li>This is the only toothpaste she likes and it does a great job cleaning and leaving a fresh breath.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t clean your car with an abrasive kitchen cleanser -- you&#x27;d use a non abrasive car soap that \\&quot;dissolves\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s because of the special toothpaste?</li>
            <li>And sure, I missed the part where the box says &amp;#34;2.6 fl oz&amp;#34; but why make the tube so large?</li>
            <li>Which Rembrandt intense stain is actually better.  </li>
            <li>rembrandt uses plastic tubing that doesn&#x27;t stay collapsed when you squeeze so it always looks like a full tube.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because the tube is full of air.  </li>
            <li>You think you&#x27;re getting more than you really are.  </li>
            <li>The full benefit depends on your technique as well.</li>
            <li>Its not painful to use</li>
            <li>Have yet to find a toothpaste that does a better job of whitening without much use.  </li>
            <li>Quick results.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste and in the past had great and pretty immediate results.  </li>
            <li>I am not exaggerating when I say that I noticed a difference the very FIRST  time</li>
            <li>No kidding, after the first brushing, it looked like this toothpaste devoured the stains and lifted color to one shade whiter!</li>
            <li>I said I refuse to use any other brand of whitening toothpaste, honestly if they stopped making this it would be the apocalypse for me!</li>
            <li>, I noticed significant positive changes in the colour of my teeth.</li>
            <li>This fit my requirements of really whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the best non-prescription toothpaste for people who had too many antibiotics when young and their enamel is thin.</li>
            <li>But I think the whitening effects make it worth while.</li>
            <li>If you can drop the cash on this then it may or may not be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>After using this toothpaste, I feel that this toothpaste is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>As far as the toothpaste itself goes, I agree with the majority that it whitens and cleans my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that a serious dental journal article with an abstract online recommended it -- not for whitening -- but for plaque removal!?  </li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste in comparison with all other on the shelf, but I wish I had bought Intense Stain to begin.</li>
            <li>To everyone who&#x27;s complaining about the tube itself: \\&quot;This proprietary formula contains Active Dental Peroxide which releases oxygen for superior whitening.</li>
            <li>The tube is full of air  and upon opening it for the first few uses, make sure to have your toothbrush ready, as the paste will flow out on its own.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will use no other.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t care to much for the flavor (not bad ~ just off tasting I&#x27;ve been told)</li>
            <li>First let me start by stating this product information is stamped on the box AND tube: \\&quot;This proprietary formula contains Active Dental Peroxide, which releases oxygen for superior whitening.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, the taste isn&#x27;t fantastic, but it is completely tolerable, and totally worth the results.  </li>
            <li>The most obvious problem with this product is the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Did not do much for me!</li>
            <li>A ton of air comes out first.</li>
            <li>It is very potent, will leave your mouth feeling fresh, it may burn your tongue a bit but nothing too harsh.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Look, I realize this review probably isn&#x27;t answering your questions, but there&#x27;s something to be said about a company that thinks they can trick you by making you think you&#x27;re getting way more than you actually are.</li>
            <li>and this was my first choice as my sister recommended it.</li>
            <li>I just drink too much coffee!  </li>
            <li>When we looked back at the photos, both the photographer and my family noted (without any prompting from me) that my teeth were visibly brighter than those of my mother, father, and sister; all of whom still have lovely smiles, but I digress.  </li>
            <li>opened the first tube to try</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten to my 2nd tube yet, and maybe there&#x27;s a way to get the gas to accumulate at the top of the tube before opening it, but there was no warning on the package that this could/would occur</li>
            <li>If anyone has found a way to prevent this from occurring, I&#x27;d love to hear it before I open my remaining tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I no longer use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>my gosh, that stuff you are using on your teeth is really working!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as white as I would like them to be just yet, but I am sure they will get there.</li>
            <li>I saw results in the first week.  </li>
            <li>my teeth are more yellow than before</li>
            <li>I love it because it keep my teeth white</li>
            <li>but I checked CVS is website and this same item is selling for a dollar more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste twice a day (brushing for 3-5 minutes, spitting out the toothpaste without rinsing it off my teeth), but my teeth are not discernibly whiter than they were when I first started using this toothpaste two months ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, unless you brush your teeth more than three times a day, the amount of toothpaste you get will last you about two-and-a-half to three months.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste taste refreshing and my teeth felt nice afterward, but the whitening capabilities of Rembrandt do not seem any better than store brands at a little over half the price.  </li>
            <li>here&#x27;s an impressive, robust tube of toothpaste,&amp;#34; then you take a little peep through the nozzle to see all the empty room inside.</li>
            <li>but Rembrandt Deeply White to brush the way to my shiny bright future.</li>
            <li>No other toothpaste compares and having it delivered for free and at a lower cost from Amazon</li>
            <li>It also leaves your mouth feeling really fresh, although it is very strong for the first few days of use.</li>
            <li>Now, I can even wear lipsticks in shades that are not so flattering for the teeth (coral, nude, orange-red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not being paid to write this, I just wanted to share my positive experience.</li>
            <li>&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t just work by magic, there are chemicals involved which explain the tube design, and the slightly strange taste.</li>
            <li>I first opened the box for the toothpaste, I noticed that the tube was very \\&quot;tight\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>You will more than likely shell out $6 to $7 for a tube of this \\&quot;high</li>
            <li>And while the baking soda version of Advanced White isn&#x27;t necessarily as tasty as normal toothpastes, it&#x27;s definitely better than the Rembrandt.</li>
            <li>This product has a very high quality.</li>
            <li>Deeply White, although my teeth may be whitening more gradually than they would with strips, the progress is steady and highly visible --</li>
            <li>It really whitens your teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I didnt feel that it cleaned my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s speculated that this is caused by the mother consuming too much flouride during pregnancy, but regardless of the cause, they&#x27;ve plagued me all my life.</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it works and how much not.</li>
            <li>Really does seem to whiten and not sugary like others.</li>
            <li>The tubes are deceiving as they had a lot of air in them and not so much paste.  </li>
            <li>I may to much.</li>
            <li>I might be ready to marry this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I get that it&#x27;s sold by weight rather than volume, but if each tune really has 2.6 ounces, why so much packaging?  </li>
            <li>Have not noticed much in the way of whiter teeth since using this product.</li>
            <li>Even my mother said that she is going to have to give it a try, haha.</li>
            <li>Really cleans where</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening</li>
            <li>And my teeth hurt for at least a good 20 min after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE on 5/1/2012 - I opened the 2nd tube some time ago and was able to prevent toothpaste from exiting by massaging it around and getting all of the gas near the opening.</li>
            <li>Rembrandt is what I&#x27;ve been recommending to my patients since the early 80&#x27;s, right after Dr. Robert Ibsen created this toothpaste with his company DenMat.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you stay away or try other brands...or better yet just go to your dentist if you really like to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>My only complaints about this toothpaste is that the tube it comes in is filled with air and the bottle is only about 3/4 full</li>
            <li>It is absolutely normal!</li>
            <li>my two other tubes were better off</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few months of use, it&#x27;s safe to say that I am completely satisfied with the progression of my results; but, it didn&#x27;t even take that long for me to start seeing improvement!  </li>
            <li>Deep Clean toothpaste has oxygen in it, so dont freak out if the tube deflates-</li>
            <li>its makes a teeth slightly more sensitive and there&#x27;s wierd white spots near where some of my teeth touch.</li>
            <li>Happened with the first 2 tubes so far.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I remember other tubes of this toothpaste I&#x27;ve purchased at large box stores not feeling only half-full.</li>
            <li>Quality toothpaste, don&#x27;t leave your teeth hanging, your teeth are your lively hood!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker, a red wine drinker, and a few years ago (good riddance!)</li>
            <li>Okay, enough about Crest white strips.</li>
            <li>a word of warning: the tube does seem kind of empty when you open it.</li>
            <li>If you use this product only once a day, you won&#x27;t get the whitening results as quickly as someone who faithfully uses it 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>I always use this particular Rembrandt toothpaste.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super super white, but they are definitely whiter.</li>
            <li>Finally, a toothpaste comparable to Topol (not manufactured any more - and the only product that would rid my teeth of coffee stains).  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the same day I bought thos toothpaste, I purchased a new toothbrush to ensure I would get the full benefit of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This product was purchased based on the hope of the \\&quot;name\\&quot; and high cost paying off in terms of quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product as my friend in the beauty industry rated it highly.</li>
            <li>Only challenge is when we opened the first tube the toothpaste shot out all over the place!  </li>
            <li>Has a nice subtle mint flavor with no horrible peroxide after-taste, and actually DOES whiten your teeth pretty well... not much else to say about a tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I normally order 3-4 packs at a time.</li>
            <li>Most toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, even expensive ones, use the same ingredients: a fluoride compound for cavity prevention, hydrated silica for scrubbing power, some kind of peroxide for whitening, sodium lauryl phosphate for foaming, etc.</li>
            <li>They were all ineffectual because, until this product, all whitening toothpastes have worked by pretty much the same mechanism: they contain abrasive particles that scrub away surface stains from the teeth.</li>
            <li>just wish the tube appeared full instead of half empty—which is what it looks like at my first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but it the tube comes half empty...</li>
            <li>First of all, every time I opened a tube that I ordered from Amazon about 1/4 of the product came bursting out of the bottle, which was a huge waste of money since I couldn&#x27;t exactly push it back in.</li>
            <li>but I feel with legal limits of peroxide being very low for shelf products the next step for a much brighter smile is visiting the dentists.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new toothpaste of choice</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll try that new crest brilliance.</li>
            <li>I received mine in 3 separate boxes as expected, however each one I opened did not have a foil cover over the top like the red label.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Use the Intense Stain Rembrandt, it will really get right down in your teeth and get the job done, with fluoride.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any pain or increased sensitivity, and my teeth are normally very sensitive.</li>
            <li>You need more paste then other brands to get equal amount of foam.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve seen that addresses stains below the enamel, and it not only addresses them, it obliterates them.</li>
            <li>and already I&#x27;ve seen more whitening of my deep stains than I have in 22 years using every other whitening toothpaste on the market.</li>
            <li>It tingles when I use it, so you can FEEL it really clean unlike other brands like Crest and Colgate&#x27;s peroxide toothpastes which didnt work for me.</li>
            <li>Just the level of clean is fresher than any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The tube is full of air due to the fact that it contains dental peroxide.</li>
            <li>As I got older I stopped brushing my teethe 3 times a to about 1-2 times a day which has a major effect on your teethe&#x27;s natural color.</li>
            <li>do not get what the big fuss about using Rembrandt really is.</li>
            <li>On first use, I squeezed for a long time before any product came out.  </li>
            <li>Take your time and gently brush using circular motions especially where you want to see results.</li>
            <li>Three weeks after I began brushing with this toothpaste, my family went in to get portraits taken with a professional photographer.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, and this has not bothered them as whitening strips have.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product several times and have been very please with the results.</li>
            <li>and I hope with use that it at least proves to be worth the exorbitant price charged.</li>
            <li>Unless you want the tube to burst and have to clean up splattered toothpaste from packaging failure, I&#x27;d say the packaging is pretty convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s so large and fat when it&#x27;s only half full.</li>
            <li>maybe justifiably so) keep in mind that there is the potential for a large percentage of the toothpaste to uncontrollably exit when you first open it, thereby increasing the cost of the toothpaste even further.</li>
            <li>I opened them up - the second tube was exactly the same - lots of air</li>
            <li>After several months of use and no change, I went back to Crest and tried their 3D white + luxe and noticed a HUGE difference in only 3 days.</li>
            <li>Would also highly recommend their deep whitening mouth rinse to use with it.</li>
            <li>Literally more than half the tube was empty.  </li>
            <li>This is the only toothpaste i&#x27;m aware of, besides a few much harder to find brands, that actually whitens more than the surface of the tooth.  </li>
            <li>it is very good,before use it my teeth a little yellow,but now my friend said you teeth is much whiter than before.</li>
            <li>and you get much less product for your money (compared to most other toothpaste).</li>
            <li>This really has a different technology (as does Colgate Total with its anti-gingivitis triclosan -- known to everyone as the anti-bacterial ingredient in liquid hand soap.)    </li>
            <li>but I would recommend switching back and fourth with another trusted toothpaste if the sensitivity is too much to handle.</li>
            <li>But you get the exact amount as in the other types.</li>
            <li>Content only half full and does not even work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve run through the whole spectrum of whitening products, even shelled out $500 for professional laser whitening, just to have it have no impact other than sensitizing my teeth.</li>
            <li>It looks good, but after found to have some to be hard to squeeze out, which a lot of air, very little toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste due to the positive reviews it received and the price at which Amazon was selling it when I made my purchase.</li>
            <li>I generally drink a lot of coffee throughout the day (office job)</li>
            <li>They work  well together, also this toothepaste doesn&#x27;t last long, but ti works really well.    </li>
            <li>I only use it once a day, I use a Sensitive toothpaste at night and this in the morning.</li>
            <li>I went to Walmart and got the Deep Clean (green and white) toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>One a day using this would be better, while you use your other tooth past and it will save you money as well.  </li>
            <li>after 3 or 4 weeks the compliments will start on how white your teeth are, and after about 6 months your teeth will get second glances from strangers due to how white they are (hopefully that&#x27;s the real reason!</li>
            <li>For the first few days it caused irritation to my gums, but in all fairness I have a problem with gum recession, and the problem remedied itself before the week was out.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty pricey for how little of it you actually get in the tube, but mind you--no toothpaste even compares in whitening.</li>
            <li>At least with regular toothpastes, they clean at the same time freshen our breath as well.</li>
            <li>For me because I drink at least 1-2 cups of coffee a day (which I normally use intense stain but, wanted to try this one out)</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> And the best mouthwash is Crest&#x27;s whitening mouth wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best whitening toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> Great name too after the painter!</li>
            <li> yet I believe the best stain removing toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It works GREAT!</li>
            <li> being said, this toothpaste is probably the best you&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
            <li> Well... as awesome as awesome can be for just being toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best whitening  toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> the price that Amazon is charging is very fair.</li>
            <li> Order arrives in great packing condition...</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste expecting, considering the price, that it would be great.</li>
            <li> Great price and great results.</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> The results for this toothpaste are amazing!</li>
            <li> is my kind of shopping!</li>
            <li> After trying many brands of toothpaste this is still the BEST!!</li>
            <li> I do like the product but, be honest with your packaging Rembrandt!</li>
            <li> Fluoride in the toothpaste may be a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Good toothpaste but overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with this toothpaste for good.</li>
            <li> This works really good with the rinse.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and good.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> So I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> After paying for braces with an included Zoom whitening treatment, we wanted to make sure they could keep up the maintenance for those beautiful smiles.</li>
            <li> It would be great to be able to order that in the 3-pack.  </li>
            <li> Great toothpaste, but needs to be packaged better.</li>
            <li> lol :)</li>
            <li> My teeth do look a lot better, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Ok if you get a great deal like I did on a \\&quot;Today&#x27;s Deal\\&quot; from Amazon</li>
            <li> very, very pleased.</li>
            <li> (so it is very safe and gentle)that will dissolve away stains on the surface of the teeth instead of an abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Ok let say it is one very popular and nice paste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried $18 tubes of whitening toothpaste and Rembrandts is better!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I would surely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really love using this tooth paste!</li>
            <li> When I took the tube out of the box it was pleasantly plump, as if there was more product than I thought.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This purchase from Amazon was amazing</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital and one of the neurosurgeons stopped me in the hallway to ask what I did to keep my teeth bright and so healthy looking...</li>
            <li> Cleans and whitens your teeth and has a nice flavor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how effective this toothpaste is, it should be a crime to sell this product in a tube</li>
            <li> Was packed nicely and no product damage.</li>
            <li> It really does whiten the best and prevents cavities.  </li>
            <li> kind of pricey for me</li>
            <li> Of all the whitening toothpaste I have tried, this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Crest whitening strips and toothpastes, Colgate whitening toothpastes and an at home UV treatment, but this has by far shown the best results.</li>
            <li> I had known that whitening could be this easy, I would have started years ago!  </li>
            <li> and it had a much better consistency and worked well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how safe is peroxide on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> , the tubes are probably more than half-air</li>
            <li> Did I mention it does work :-)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference, but I&#x27;ll give it more time :)</li>
            <li> This product seems to work much better than any of the others we&#x27;ve tried, so we signed up for Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, my mouth feels refresh</li>
            <li> It really works, and when I&#x27;ve recommended it to others, they&#x27;ve always told me that they were happy with it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my teeth were perfect and grew several shades whiter</li>
            <li> For me is a tooth paste and nothing more.</li>
            <li> it is still my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Wife has allergies to ingredients in most all toothpaste products.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is okay - it does seem to whiten over</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but don&#x27;t use it more to twice a day.</li>
            <li> I may not be a dentist, but I know my own experience, and it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My last dental cleaning, I asked what was the best toothpaste for whightning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure someone will comment with \\&quot;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see if I can get my girlfriend to use the rest of it. :)</li>
            <li> It works way better then the cheap toothpaste!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen many people write reviews and make inaccurate accusations because the consumers are failing to read ALL of the products information.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having clarified those oversights that it seems many reviewers are obviously overlooking, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure results will vary</li>
            <li> I was very excited to hear about this toothpaste</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t experienced any tooth sensitivity, which is a particular relief because tooth sensitivity runs in my family.    </li>
            <li> I love strong mint flavors</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll start off with the flaw as it&#x27;s most important.</li>
            <li> It was full of air!</li>
            <li> Before try Rembrandt, I was using a store-bought bottle of a popular whitening solution which was way better then this and whitening effect was very noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has quite a strong flavor because of the whitening ingredients.</li>
            <li> Because I have veneers, my dentist limits the kinds of toothpaste I can use, but my kids use Rembrandt and they have beautiful white teeth.  </li>
            <li> so it taste fine, but I wouldnt brush your tongue with it.</li>
            <li> so it does go quickly if you brush your teeth twice a day or more.</li>
            <li> Worth trying for sure.</li>
            <li> and she reconmended Rembrandt Deep Cleaning products and said their strips work really great too.</li>
            <li> My teeth stay smooth for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> Overall, they have whitened and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This does a great job keeping my teeth white if I could get over the taste!</li>
            <li> Using Rembrandt products made me feel confident in my smile again.</li>
            <li> I finally went and I had a great checkup</li>
            <li> - at this cost the tube is to be completely full of toothpaste that dispenses in an easily controlled fashion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All my family now is using only this toothpaste as it whitens the teeth very effectively.</li>
            <li> So keep yourself knowledgeable, and enjoy your beautiful white smile if you decide to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste she likes and it does a great job cleaning and leaving a fresh breath.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t clean your car with an abrasive kitchen cleanser -- you&#x27;d use a non abrasive car soap that \\&quot;dissolves\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s because of the special toothpaste?</li>
            <li> And sure, I missed the part where the box says &amp;#34;2.6 fl oz&amp;#34; but why make the tube so large?</li>
            <li> Which Rembrandt intense stain is actually better.  </li>
            <li> rembrandt uses plastic tubing that doesn&#x27;t stay collapsed when you squeeze so it always looks like a full tube.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because the tube is full of air.  </li>
            <li> You think you&#x27;re getting more than you really are.  </li>
            <li> The full benefit depends on your technique as well.</li>
            <li> Its not painful to use</li>
            <li> Have yet to find a toothpaste that does a better job of whitening without much use.  </li>
            <li> Quick results.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and in the past had great and pretty immediate results.  </li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating when I say that I noticed a difference the very FIRST  time</li>
            <li> No kidding, after the first brushing, it looked like this toothpaste devoured the stains and lifted color to one shade whiter!</li>
            <li> I said I refuse to use any other brand of whitening toothpaste, honestly if they stopped making this it would be the apocalypse for me!</li>
            <li> , I noticed significant positive changes in the colour of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This fit my requirements of really whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the best non-prescription toothpaste for people who had too many antibiotics when young and their enamel is thin.</li>
            <li> But I think the whitening effects make it worth while.</li>
            <li> If you can drop the cash on this then it may or may not be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> After using this toothpaste, I feel that this toothpaste is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> As far as the toothpaste itself goes, I agree with the majority that it whitens and cleans my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that a serious dental journal article with an abstract online recommended it -- not for whitening -- but for plaque removal!?  </li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste in comparison with all other on the shelf, but I wish I had bought Intense Stain to begin.</li>
            <li> To everyone who&#x27;s complaining about the tube itself: \\&quot;This proprietary formula contains Active Dental Peroxide which releases oxygen for superior whitening.</li>
            <li> The tube is full of air  and upon opening it for the first few uses, make sure to have your toothbrush ready, as the paste will flow out on its own.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will use no other.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t care to much for the flavor (not bad ~ just off tasting I&#x27;ve been told)</li>
            <li> First let me start by stating this product information is stamped on the box AND tube: \\&quot;This proprietary formula contains Active Dental Peroxide, which releases oxygen for superior whitening.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, the taste isn&#x27;t fantastic, but it is completely tolerable, and totally worth the results.  </li>
            <li> The most obvious problem with this product is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Did not do much for me!</li>
            <li> A ton of air comes out first.</li>
            <li> It is very potent, will leave your mouth feeling fresh, it may burn your tongue a bit but nothing too harsh.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Look, I realize this review probably isn&#x27;t answering your questions, but there&#x27;s something to be said about a company that thinks they can trick you by making you think you&#x27;re getting way more than you actually are.</li>
            <li> and this was my first choice as my sister recommended it.</li>
            <li> I just drink too much coffee!  </li>
            <li> When we looked back at the photos, both the photographer and my family noted (without any prompting from me) that my teeth were visibly brighter than those of my mother, father, and sister; all of whom still have lovely smiles, but I digress.  </li>
            <li> opened the first tube to try</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to my 2nd tube yet, and maybe there&#x27;s a way to get the gas to accumulate at the top of the tube before opening it, but there was no warning on the package that this could/would occur</li>
            <li> If anyone has found a way to prevent this from occurring, I&#x27;d love to hear it before I open my remaining tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I no longer use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> my gosh, that stuff you are using on your teeth is really working!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as white as I would like them to be just yet, but I am sure they will get there.</li>
            <li> I saw results in the first week.  </li>
            <li> my teeth are more yellow than before</li>
            <li> I love it because it keep my teeth white</li>
            <li> but I checked CVS is website and this same item is selling for a dollar more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste twice a day (brushing for 3-5 minutes, spitting out the toothpaste without rinsing it off my teeth), but my teeth are not discernibly whiter than they were when I first started using this toothpaste two months ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, unless you brush your teeth more than three times a day, the amount of toothpaste you get will last you about two-and-a-half to three months.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste taste refreshing and my teeth felt nice afterward, but the whitening capabilities of Rembrandt do not seem any better than store brands at a little over half the price.  </li>
            <li> here&#x27;s an impressive, robust tube of toothpaste,&amp;#34; then you take a little peep through the nozzle to see all the empty room inside.</li>
            <li> but Rembrandt Deeply White to brush the way to my shiny bright future.</li>
            <li> No other toothpaste compares and having it delivered for free and at a lower cost from Amazon</li>
            <li> It also leaves your mouth feeling really fresh, although it is very strong for the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> Now, I can even wear lipsticks in shades that are not so flattering for the teeth (coral, nude, orange-red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not being paid to write this, I just wanted to share my positive experience.</li>
            <li> &quot;  It doesn&#x27;t just work by magic, there are chemicals involved which explain the tube design, and the slightly strange taste.</li>
            <li> I first opened the box for the toothpaste, I noticed that the tube was very \\&quot;tight\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You will more than likely shell out $6 to $7 for a tube of this \\&quot;high</li>
            <li> And while the baking soda version of Advanced White isn&#x27;t necessarily as tasty as normal toothpastes, it&#x27;s definitely better than the Rembrandt.</li>
            <li> This product has a very high quality.</li>
            <li> Deeply White, although my teeth may be whitening more gradually than they would with strips, the progress is steady and highly visible --</li>
            <li> It really whitens your teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I didnt feel that it cleaned my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s speculated that this is caused by the mother consuming too much flouride during pregnancy, but regardless of the cause, they&#x27;ve plagued me all my life.</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it works and how much not.</li>
            <li> Really does seem to whiten and not sugary like others.</li>
            <li> The tubes are deceiving as they had a lot of air in them and not so much paste.  </li>
            <li> I may to much.</li>
            <li> I might be ready to marry this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I get that it&#x27;s sold by weight rather than volume, but if each tune really has 2.6 ounces, why so much packaging?  </li>
            <li> Have not noticed much in the way of whiter teeth since using this product.</li>
            <li> Even my mother said that she is going to have to give it a try, haha.</li>
            <li> Really cleans where</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening</li>
            <li> And my teeth hurt for at least a good 20 min after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE on 5/1/2012 - I opened the 2nd tube some time ago and was able to prevent toothpaste from exiting by massaging it around and getting all of the gas near the opening.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt is what I&#x27;ve been recommending to my patients since the early 80&#x27;s, right after Dr. Robert Ibsen created this toothpaste with his company DenMat.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you stay away or try other brands...or better yet just go to your dentist if you really like to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> My only complaints about this toothpaste is that the tube it comes in is filled with air and the bottle is only about 3/4 full</li>
            <li> It is absolutely normal!</li>
            <li> my two other tubes were better off</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few months of use, it&#x27;s safe to say that I am completely satisfied with the progression of my results; but, it didn&#x27;t even take that long for me to start seeing improvement!  </li>
            <li> Deep Clean toothpaste has oxygen in it, so dont freak out if the tube deflates-</li>
            <li> its makes a teeth slightly more sensitive and there&#x27;s wierd white spots near where some of my teeth touch.</li>
            <li> Happened with the first 2 tubes so far.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I remember other tubes of this toothpaste I&#x27;ve purchased at large box stores not feeling only half-full.</li>
            <li> Quality toothpaste, don&#x27;t leave your teeth hanging, your teeth are your lively hood!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker, a red wine drinker, and a few years ago (good riddance!)</li>
            <li> Okay, enough about Crest white strips.</li>
            <li> a word of warning: the tube does seem kind of empty when you open it.</li>
            <li> If you use this product only once a day, you won&#x27;t get the whitening results as quickly as someone who faithfully uses it 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I always use this particular Rembrandt toothpaste.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super super white, but they are definitely whiter.</li>
            <li> Finally, a toothpaste comparable to Topol (not manufactured any more - and the only product that would rid my teeth of coffee stains).  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the same day I bought thos toothpaste, I purchased a new toothbrush to ensure I would get the full benefit of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased based on the hope of the \\&quot;name\\&quot; and high cost paying off in terms of quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product as my friend in the beauty industry rated it highly.</li>
            <li> Only challenge is when we opened the first tube the toothpaste shot out all over the place!  </li>
            <li> Has a nice subtle mint flavor with no horrible peroxide after-taste, and actually DOES whiten your teeth pretty well... not much else to say about a tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I normally order 3-4 packs at a time.</li>
            <li> Most toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, even expensive ones, use the same ingredients: a fluoride compound for cavity prevention, hydrated silica for scrubbing power, some kind of peroxide for whitening, sodium lauryl phosphate for foaming, etc.</li>
            <li> They were all ineffectual because, until this product, all whitening toothpastes have worked by pretty much the same mechanism: they contain abrasive particles that scrub away surface stains from the teeth.</li>
            <li> just wish the tube appeared full instead of half empty—which is what it looks like at my first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but it the tube comes half empty...</li>
            <li> First of all, every time I opened a tube that I ordered from Amazon about 1/4 of the product came bursting out of the bottle, which was a huge waste of money since I couldn&#x27;t exactly push it back in.</li>
            <li> but I feel with legal limits of peroxide being very low for shelf products the next step for a much brighter smile is visiting the dentists.</li>
            <li> Definitely my new toothpaste of choice</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll try that new crest brilliance.</li>
            <li> I received mine in 3 separate boxes as expected, however each one I opened did not have a foil cover over the top like the red label.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Use the Intense Stain Rembrandt, it will really get right down in your teeth and get the job done, with fluoride.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any pain or increased sensitivity, and my teeth are normally very sensitive.</li>
            <li> You need more paste then other brands to get equal amount of foam.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve seen that addresses stains below the enamel, and it not only addresses them, it obliterates them.</li>
            <li> and already I&#x27;ve seen more whitening of my deep stains than I have in 22 years using every other whitening toothpaste on the market.</li>
            <li> It tingles when I use it, so you can FEEL it really clean unlike other brands like Crest and Colgate&#x27;s peroxide toothpastes which didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> Just the level of clean is fresher than any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The tube is full of air due to the fact that it contains dental peroxide.</li>
            <li> As I got older I stopped brushing my teethe 3 times a to about 1-2 times a day which has a major effect on your teethe&#x27;s natural color.</li>
            <li> do not get what the big fuss about using Rembrandt really is.</li>
            <li> On first use, I squeezed for a long time before any product came out.  </li>
            <li> Take your time and gently brush using circular motions especially where you want to see results.</li>
            <li> Three weeks after I began brushing with this toothpaste, my family went in to get portraits taken with a professional photographer.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and this has not bothered them as whitening strips have.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times and have been very please with the results.</li>
            <li> and I hope with use that it at least proves to be worth the exorbitant price charged.</li>
            <li> Unless you want the tube to burst and have to clean up splattered toothpaste from packaging failure, I&#x27;d say the packaging is pretty convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so large and fat when it&#x27;s only half full.</li>
            <li> maybe justifiably so) keep in mind that there is the potential for a large percentage of the toothpaste to uncontrollably exit when you first open it, thereby increasing the cost of the toothpaste even further.</li>
            <li> I opened them up - the second tube was exactly the same - lots of air</li>
            <li> After several months of use and no change, I went back to Crest and tried their 3D white + luxe and noticed a HUGE difference in only 3 days.</li>
            <li> Would also highly recommend their deep whitening mouth rinse to use with it.</li>
            <li> Literally more than half the tube was empty.  </li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste i&#x27;m aware of, besides a few much harder to find brands, that actually whitens more than the surface of the tooth.  </li>
            <li> it is very good,before use it my teeth a little yellow,but now my friend said you teeth is much whiter than before.</li>
            <li> and you get much less product for your money (compared to most other toothpaste).</li>
            <li> This really has a different technology (as does Colgate Total with its anti-gingivitis triclosan -- known to everyone as the anti-bacterial ingredient in liquid hand soap.)    </li>
            <li> but I would recommend switching back and fourth with another trusted toothpaste if the sensitivity is too much to handle.</li>
            <li> But you get the exact amount as in the other types.</li>
            <li> Content only half full and does not even work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve run through the whole spectrum of whitening products, even shelled out $500 for professional laser whitening, just to have it have no impact other than sensitizing my teeth.</li>
            <li> It looks good, but after found to have some to be hard to squeeze out, which a lot of air, very little toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste due to the positive reviews it received and the price at which Amazon was selling it when I made my purchase.</li>
            <li> I generally drink a lot of coffee throughout the day (office job)</li>
            <li> They work  well together, also this toothepaste doesn&#x27;t last long, but ti works really well.    </li>
            <li> I only use it once a day, I use a Sensitive toothpaste at night and this in the morning.</li>
            <li> I went to Walmart and got the Deep Clean (green and white) toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> One a day using this would be better, while you use your other tooth past and it will save you money as well.  </li>
            <li> after 3 or 4 weeks the compliments will start on how white your teeth are, and after about 6 months your teeth will get second glances from strangers due to how white they are (hopefully that&#x27;s the real reason!</li>
            <li> For the first few days it caused irritation to my gums, but in all fairness I have a problem with gum recession, and the problem remedied itself before the week was out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty pricey for how little of it you actually get in the tube, but mind you--no toothpaste even compares in whitening.</li>
            <li> At least with regular toothpastes, they clean at the same time freshen our breath as well.</li>
            <li> For me because I drink at least 1-2 cups of coffee a day (which I normally use intense stain but, wanted to try this one out)</li>
            <li> , little paste.&lt;br /&gt;The third tube was a surprise, about 3$ worth of toothpaste shot out immediately due to compressed air in the tube!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After your first use, it will look like the tube is more than half empty -- a very poor customer experience.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it is any better than the new Crest which is also less expensive.</li>
            <li> Yes it is an expensive toothpaste and at first I thought these toothpaste were defects because only half full</li>
            <li> I tried crest 3d white and only received a minor difference.</li>
            <li> - Squeeze n apply it on tooth brush  - Brush for a minute or so as in apply everywhere  - let your tooth brush take little rest  - close your mouth and have little fun with your iPhone - news may be  - 5 minutes repeat brushing and rinse    1 week, twice a day - it changed several shades for me.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste, as my only whitening treatment, for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I paid a high price for this small amount of toothpaste in order to have some smaller tubes of toothpaste for travel and carrying in my purse when I go out to dinner or am away from home all day.  </li>
            <li> but, it does its job and its not a major difference for whitening your teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, not only is this toothpaste more expensive than other brands (</li>
            <li> never happens to me, you must be opening it wrong\\&quot;, but besides randomly massaging the tube trying to get gas to the top, there&#x27;s not much else I can do to prevent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not absolutely pissed because the product seemed to have done something, I unfortunately didn&#x27;t brush even close to long enough as I was not expecting the toothpaste to have an effect like the alcohol in mouthwash does, but my teeth feel clean after a short twenty second brush.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard on my gums the first time, probably because of the peroxide, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know why this kind of thing would happen except that the tube was filled incorrectly by the tube filling machine, somehow compressing the air in behind the paste.&lt;br /&gt;Given the incredibly small amount of actual toothpaste that these three very expensive tubes will yield the actual long term whitening quality will never be known by me.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> After reading the back of it, it mentions that due to the chemicals used, they will release gas and cause the tube to expand, which is nothing to worry about; however, upon opening the lid to my first tube, the pressure inside the tube forced about 1/3rd of toothpaste in the tube out and into my sink.</li>
            <li> After making it through the first tube and part of the second, I started to notice a trend of bad breath and a funny taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Would recommend, long time user.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well to maintain white teeth.</li>
            <li> The other day my sister came up to me and stopped me mid sentence just to tell me,</li>
            <li> The only thing is, the peroxide causes the bottom of my gums to become a little white.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still shiny and white, and I refused to use any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t in bad condition and are fairly white to begin with, but I switched from Crest whitening toothpaste after seeing ads for this and assuming that it would work better.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m looking at you, Crest) and ultimately prefer to harsh, short cycles of strip whitening.  </li>
            <li> so I assumed it would be full, and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This means less wear of your teeth over the years and less \\&quot;notching\\&quot; of the teeth up near the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My net impression is that Rembrandt may be a decent toothpaste, but it is still a rip-off.</li>
            <li> It is freaking expensive and was less than a third full.  </li>
            <li> I wish you could do half stars because I&#x27;d throw it square in the middle at 2.5.</li>
            <li> When you open it and squeeze you are emptying the half of the tube before you get any of the paste.</li>
            <li> That is because this toothpaste contains peroxide, and it needs a little extra room in the tube, so it won&#x27;t explode.</li>
            <li> so you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t bad, just not any better.</li>
            <li> After the yellowing, this is where Rembrandt comes in, it&#x27;s a great producr, tastes horrible, but it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see the negative reviews for Rembrandt.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I&#x27;m not seeing any difference between this stuff and Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Advance White.</li>
            <li> when you open it, the pressure from the air pushes a lot of toothpaste out and is wasted.</li>
            <li> boxes empty</li>
            <li> absolutely no difference in my teeth color.</li>
            <li> After using it for several days, once a day, I have painful blisters all over the right upper side of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> At first, my teeth got overly sensitive but that only lasted for a few days and it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> It costs 7~8 dollars per tube and you only get less than half tube of paste.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, the tube deflated and it became a chore to unscrew the cap, as the tube itself crumples and twists in one hand while you try to remove the cap with other.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while I can feel the tingly effect on my tongue due to the peroxide.</li>
            <li> but I realize it must be due to the peroxide causing the air inside the tube.</li>
            <li> Other Rembrandt&#x27;s toothpaste aren&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other whitening products from other brands they don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> a trait I have yet to find in any other \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpaste</li>
            <li> other whitening&lt;br /&gt;toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> No THANKS!  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the tube seems empty and you need to stand it on its cap to get the paste down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, when you buy this toothpaste the tube will be almost half empty because the oxygen released by the formulation needs a place to go.</li>
            <li> Also, as mentioned by the previous reviewers, the tube comes half empty.</li>
            <li> I switched to some cheap Crest from my local department store and the bad breath slowly went away.</li>
            <li> At least enough for me to continue using it.</li>
            <li> If you are used to mint-flavored toothpaste, this stuff will taste sour in comparison.  </li>
            <li> I now refuse to use any other brand of toothpaste ever again!</li>
            <li> Second, it smells horrible and you don&#x27;t get a minty, refreshing feeling after use like in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Flat and dull</li>
            <li> Considering all the negative side-effects VS the minor whiteness, this is definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> Eversince I started using Rembrandt, my teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive anymore especially when I drink cold beverages.</li>
            <li> Half of the tube is air...</li>
            <li> I also was upset that the tube was half air.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this previously and thought I&#x27;d use it until the tube was gone before I wrote my review.</li>
            <li> But the tube is pumped with air half of it.</li>
            <li> This particular flavor, the one in the liem green box work effing miracles.</li>
            <li> But you do get used to the taste and after a few weeks you do see a slight change in teeth color.  </li>
            <li> Yes, yes and YES - It does work wonders with a little catch.    </li>
            <li> Between strips and this paste, I see a little improvement</li>
            <li> This is not worth it!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> As a HEAVY tea drinker, I have stained discolored teeth.</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible, honestly.</li>
            <li> I used to be a heavy wine drinker, chain smoker, and tooth neglecter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit expensive, but I&#x27;ve found that using it just once a day (and using an inexpensive tooth paste the other times of the day) still makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I spent so much time with this product when it did not make any difference.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the results were only slight and not noticeable for others to comment on.</li>
            <li> I have been a little obsessed with it, and have been brushing my teeth a couple extra times a day.</li>
            <li> Like what the other reviewers state, their claim of false packaging may have some merit as the tube contains way less of toothpaste than what is stated.</li>
            <li> I bought it randomly at CVS one day, and after a few weeks of using it, my teeth were so shiny and white.</li>
            <li> As a result, it is common for the tube to appear slightly inflated or release air when opened.\\</li>
            <li> As a result, it is common for the tube to appear slightly inflated or release air when opened.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels like I have just had my teeth cleaned, everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my teeth whitened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and already it&#x27;s difficult to get the actual paste out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried whitening strips in the past, but the discomfort, cost, and sheer time commitment were never worth the disappointing results.  </li>
            <li> They are sensitive to cold, but they have always been that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a very heavy tea drinker.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed to receive large tubes underfilled with toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> and frankly it will be pretty annoying if it does it for the remaining tubes.</li>
            <li> They are both hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but something to never cheap out on is yourself.</li>
            <li> Whitens but not effectively</li>
            <li> The paste is thick</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a subtle change.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive in the stores</li>
            <li> My whole family hated the taste of it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product today and well, it turned my gums white and was SO painful.</li>
            <li> Incredibly frustrating</li>
            <li> I decided to step up my teeth game</li>
            <li> toothpaste\\&quot;, but I&#x27;ve used worse products that have cost twice the amount of the Rembrandt brand.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for the unlucky few of us... :(</li>
            <li> Stupid little trick.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is expensive toothpaste but with long-term results you will see some whitening.</li>
            <li> To our dismay, it didn&#x27;t whiten our teeth, it also has some mediocre performance cleaning them.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Expensive and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Even though Rembrandt expensive (a bit cheaper on amazon)</li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to find in my area--</li>
            <li> Those disappointments are now nothing but vague and buried memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely useless for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> This was EXTREMELY disappointing and I will NOT purchase this product again because of this unless they fix this.</li>
            <li> and I made the assumption that this was also the cause of my bad breath.</li>
            <li> Painful and burns your gums while brushing.</li>
            <li> It tastes like crap</li>
            <li> this is close to worthless.  </li>
            <li> All of those things stain teeth terribly.</li>
            <li> The worst toothpaste ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The texture on this toothpaste was grainy.  I had previouosly used the Rembrandt Red package toothpaste and it had a much better consistency and worked well.  It would be great to be able to order that in the 3-pack.  Thought I&#x27;d try for the convenience but won&#x27;t re-order this item.</li>
            <li> It does work. I have had exceptionally white teethe all of my life. I would always get compliments on them. As I got older I stopped brushing my teethe 3 times a to about 1-2 times a day which has a major effect on your teethe&#x27;s natural color. Also, I used Crest White strips (yes, that works too) to whiten my teethe, but it&#x27;s only temporary. And once you stop using them, and the effect goes away, you&#x27;ll notice how \\&quot;not so white\\&quot; your teethe were prior to using them. Okay, enough about Crest white strips. After the yellowing, this is where Rembrandt comes in, it&#x27;s a great producr, tastes horrible, but it works. Within 3 days I promise you&#x27;ll see a difference,  brush your teethe 2-3 times a day. And the best mouthwash is Crest&#x27;s whitening mouth wash. They work  well together, also this toothepaste doesn&#x27;t last long, but ti works really well.    I am telling you you&#x27;ve found the onyl toothepaste you&#x27;ll ever need. No need to purchase anything else. This particular flavor, the one in the liem green box work effing miracles. GET IT. It&#x27;s worth every penny!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I *think* they work. At least enough for me to continue using it.</li>
            <li> If you are used to mint-flavored toothpaste, this stuff will taste sour in comparison.  But you do get used to the taste and after a few weeks you do see a slight change in teeth color.  For a cheaper alternative, rinse mouth with peroxide like my dental hygienist daughter does.  Her teeth glimmer like pearls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredient: sodium monofluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Inactive ingredients:  glycerin,  hydrated silica, urea peroxide, aluminum hydroxide, modified food starch, silica, sodium citrate, propylene glycol, cocamidopropyl betaine, papain, sodium lauryl sulfate, carbomer, sodium saccharin, calcium disodium EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who complain about there being \\&quot;premium air\\&quot; in the tubes need to realize that the \\&quot;Net weight 2.6 ounces\\&quot; on the tubes is for the weight of the actual paste.  Yes, this is expensive toothpaste but with long-term results you will see some whitening.</li>
            <li> Painful and burns your gums while brushing. It even bleaches your gums white. Considering all the negative side-effects VS the minor whiteness, this is definitely not worth it. Also, as mentioned by the previous reviewers, the tube comes half empty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how safe is peroxide on your teeth.  Fluoride in the toothpaste may be a good thing.  One thing I can say about this toothpaste when brushing your teeth is feels somewhat watery.  Which Rembrandt intense stain is actually better.  Just my opinion, but, it does its job and its not a major difference for whitening your teeth.  For me because I drink at least 1-2 cups of coffee a day (which I normally use intense stain but, wanted to try this one out) gives me 1-2 shades whiter.  Might be different for you.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any whitening effect after trying 3 tubes of this product. Before try Rembrandt, I was using a store-bought bottle of a popular whitening solution which was way better then this and whitening effect was very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tubes are probably more than half-air and you get much less product for your money (compared to most other toothpaste). You need more paste then other brands to get equal amount of foam.  The cleaning effect and overall experience is only okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not get what the big fuss about using Rembrandt really is.</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste for me! Feels like I have just had my teeth cleaned, everyday! No other toothpaste compares and having it delivered for free and at a lower cost from Amazon is my kind of shopping!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this toothpaste for one week, so I cannot yet comment on its whitening power.  For the first few days it caused irritation to my gums, but in all fairness I have a problem with gum recession, and the problem remedied itself before the week was out.  The most obvious problem with this product is the packaging.  The tube is full of air  and upon opening it for the first few uses, make sure to have your toothbrush ready, as the paste will flow out on its own.  After a couple of days, the tube deflated and it became a chore to unscrew the cap, as the tube itself crumples and twists in one hand while you try to remove the cap with other.  Incredibly frustrating and I hope with use that it at least proves to be worth the exorbitant price charged.</li>
            <li> Literally more than half the tube was empty.  rembrandt uses plastic tubing that doesn&#x27;t stay collapsed when you squeeze so it always looks like a full tube.  On initial opening you&#x27;ll discover that you&#x27;ve just paid for premium packaging and not product.  My whole family hated the taste of it.  Flat and dull</li>
            <li> Order arrives in great packing condition...only toothpaste I use and I normally order 3-4 packs at a time.</li>
            <li> After trying many brands of toothpaste this is still the BEST!! Cleans and whitens your teeth and has a nice flavor. Works especially well with my sonicare toothbrush!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I&#x27;m not seeing any difference between this stuff and Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Advance White. And while the baking soda version of Advanced White isn&#x27;t necessarily as tasty as normal toothpastes, it&#x27;s definitely better than the Rembrandt. So I can&#x27;t see myself purchasing this again. Wasn&#x27;t bad, just not any better. I wish you could do half stars because I&#x27;d throw it square in the middle at 2.5.</li>
            <li> Did not do much for me!</li>
            <li> Perfection is always what you see</li>
            <li> This Rembrandt is different int hat it contains Citroxain, a papain-containing ingredient. I was impressed that a serious dental journal article with an abstract online recommended it -- not for whitening -- but for plaque removal!?  The article did not even mention the Rembrandt(r) brand name, but it did praise the Citroxain ingredient.    Most toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, even expensive ones, use the same ingredients: a fluoride compound for cavity prevention, hydrated silica for scrubbing power, some kind of peroxide for whitening, sodium lauryl phosphate for foaming, etc. This really has a different technology (as does Colgate Total with its anti-gingivitis triclosan -- known to everyone as the anti-bacterial ingredient in liquid hand soap.)    I&#x27;ll report back on whitening results.</li>
            <li> again - Yes, yes and YES - It does work wonders with a little catch.    - Squeeze n apply it on tooth brush  - Brush for a minute or so as in apply everywhere  - let your tooth brush take little rest  - close your mouth and have little fun with your iPhone - news may be  - 5 minutes repeat brushing and rinse    1 week, twice a day - it changed several shades for me.     Did I mention it does work :-)</li>
            <li> This toothpaste actually does what it says.  It really whitens your teeth.  It will take a couple of months, but it works.  To everyone who&#x27;s complaining about the tube itself: \\&quot;This proprietary formula contains Active Dental Peroxide which releases oxygen for superior whitening. As a result, it is common for the tube to appear slightly inflated or release air when opened.\\&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t just work by magic, there are chemicals involved which explain the tube design, and the slightly strange taste.</li>
            <li> Eversince I started using Rembrandt, my teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive anymore especially when I drink cold beverages. I&#x27;m not sure if my teeth whitened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the tube appeared full instead of half empty—which is what it looks like at my first use. A ton of air comes out first. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s because of the special toothpaste?</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste, but needs to be packaged better. Half of the tube is air... when you open it, the pressure from the air pushes a lot of toothpaste out and is wasted.</li>
            <li> I agree with the comments on packaging.  When I took the tube out of the box it was pleasantly plump, as if there was more product than I thought.  On first use, I squeezed for a long time before any product came out.  That&#x27;s because the tube is full of air.  After your first use, it will look like the tube is more than half empty -- a very poor customer experience.  The toothpaste taste refreshing and my teeth felt nice afterward, but the whitening capabilities of Rembrandt do not seem any better than store brands at a little over half the price.  My net impression is that Rembrandt may be a decent toothpaste, but it is still a rip-off.</li>
            <li> Watch when you open the tubes, they seem to explode and the packaging says this as well.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and I don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference, but I&#x27;ll give it more time :)</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste expecting, considering the price, that it would be great. It tastes like crap and I didnt feel that it cleaned my teeth very well. I also was upset that the tube was half air. I will definitely stick with the toothpaste I was using before.</li>
            <li> To put it briefly: this toothpaste is a Godsend. I was born with what I can only describe as camo-esque stains under my enamel. As you can imagine, they&#x27;re ghastly. It&#x27;s speculated that this is caused by the mother consuming too much flouride during pregnancy, but regardless of the cause, they&#x27;ve plagued me all my life. I&#x27;ve run through the whole spectrum of whitening products, even shelled out $500 for professional laser whitening, just to have it have no impact other than sensitizing my teeth. They were all ineffectual because, until this product, all whitening toothpastes have worked by pretty much the same mechanism: they contain abrasive particles that scrub away surface stains from the teeth. However, none of them touch deeper stains. I was very excited to hear about this toothpaste becasue it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve seen that addresses stains below the enamel, and it not only addresses them, it obliterates them. I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for a week and already I&#x27;ve seen more whitening of my deep stains than I have in 22 years using every other whitening toothpaste on the market. I&#x27;d of payed 50 times the cost of this toothpaste for these results. Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is Ultra Premium Toothpaste.     It costs 7~8 dollars per tube and you only get less than half tube of paste. The rest are premium air.</li>
            <li> Because I have veneers, my dentist limits the kinds of toothpaste I can use, but my kids use Rembrandt and they have beautiful white teeth.  After paying for braces with an included Zoom whitening treatment, we wanted to make sure they could keep up the maintenance for those beautiful smiles. This product seems to work much better than any of the others we&#x27;ve tried, so we signed up for Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, my mouth feels refresh and I like the peroxide ingredient. Once in a while I can feel the tingly effect on my tongue due to the peroxide. Yes it is an expensive toothpaste and at first I thought these toothpaste were defects because only half full but I realize it must be due to the peroxide causing the air inside the tube. Other Rembrandt&#x27;s toothpaste aren&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> it is very good,before use it my teeth a little yellow,but now my friend said you teeth is much whiter than before.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste but overpriced.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well to maintain white teeth. The taste isn&#x27;t awful, but it&#x27;s definitely not the best tasting toothpaste out there. But I think the whitening effects make it worth while.</li>
            <li> My wife and I tried this after using another brand of whitening strips. To our dismay, it didn&#x27;t whiten our teeth, it also has some mediocre performance cleaning them. At least with regular toothpastes, they clean at the same time freshen our breath as well. Waste of money. Like what the other reviewers state, their claim of false packaging may have some merit as the tube contains way less of toothpaste than what is stated. I suggest you stay away or try other brands...or better yet just go to your dentist if you really like to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best whitening toothpaste out there. It is very potent, will leave your mouth feeling fresh, it may burn your tongue a bit but nothing too harsh. I noticed whiter teeth within 3-5 days. after 3 or 4 weeks the compliments will start on how white your teeth are, and after about 6 months your teeth will get second glances from strangers due to how white they are (hopefully that&#x27;s the real reason! ;) haha  My only complaints about this toothpaste is that the tube it comes in is filled with air and the bottle is only about 3/4 full so it does go quickly if you brush your teeth twice a day or more. Also, it takes gross.... really gross, but you get used to it. it&#x27;s pretty pricey for how little of it you actually get in the tube, but mind you--no toothpaste even compares in whitening.</li>
            <li> after reading numerous reviews, I decided to give this a try. I tried crest 3d white and only received a minor difference. Now...I don&#x27;t have teeth that are so yellow you might confuse them for corn, but I wanted a whitening toothpaste that \\&quot;actually\\&quot; worked. I don&#x27;t know if it is just because I use a battery powered toothbrush but when I brush my teeth with this. It hurts like hell. It feels like someone is grinding my teeth with a power sander. And my teeth hurt for at least a good 20 min after brushing my teeth. (sigh)......the things i do to get a girl to notice me and get into her pants. lol :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried $18 tubes of whitening toothpaste and Rembrandts is better!  Great price and great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker, a red wine drinker, and a few years ago (good riddance!) was a pack-a-day smoker. But, I always get compliments on how white my teeth are, even back when I smoked. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste, as my only whitening treatment, for as long as I can remember. It really works, and when I&#x27;ve recommended it to others, they&#x27;ve always told me that they were happy with it too.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expensive, but I&#x27;ve found that using it just once a day (and using an inexpensive tooth paste the other times of the day) still makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;Just a word of warning: the tube does seem kind of empty when you open it. That is because this toothpaste contains peroxide, and it needs a little extra room in the tube, so it won&#x27;t explode. So don&#x27;t freak out and try to return it as defective. It is absolutely normal!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Rembrandt in the drugstore and it always has a foil over the opening.  The tubes I received through Amazon had no foil and some of the toothpaste had been removed.</li>
            <li> My sister and my husband both think their teeth need whitening so when I saw this I decided to buy it for them ~ they both like the toothpaste (and use it with the mouthwash) and it does appear to be whitening their teeth. They don&#x27;t care to much for the flavor (not bad ~ just off tasting I&#x27;ve been told) and you have to follow the instructions, but it does seem to do what they wanted it for so, another one we put on Auto Delivery!</li>
            <li> I am upset that as a consumer, I feel &amp;#34;hoodwinked&amp;#34; by the packaging.  The tube of toothpaste is two times larger than the quantity inside the tube.  WHY????  As a consumer, this is fraud.  You think you&#x27;re getting more than you really are.  I do like the product but, be honest with your packaging Rembrandt!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. After having my teeth Zoomed, I purchased this toothpaste as part of my daily maintenance. It makes them LOSE a shade of whiteness. Expensive and ineffective. Threw it in the trash after using it for a week. I realize that after the Zoom treatment, a shade or two will be lost in a day or two. That&#x27;s what the Nite white and custom trays are for. Yet each morning when I used this product, I would see the difference caused by Rembrandt D immediately. I began waiting and hour or two once I had removed the trays in the morning. Same results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how effective this toothpaste is, it should be a crime to sell this product in a tube that&#x27;s so large and fat when it&#x27;s only half full. You open it and you&#x27;re like &amp;#34;now here&#x27;s an impressive, robust tube of toothpaste,&amp;#34; then you take a little peep through the nozzle to see all the empty room inside. I&#x27;ve used it like twice and already it&#x27;s difficult to get the actual paste out of the tube. God knows what I&#x27;m going to do when I get to the end. Look, I realize this review probably isn&#x27;t answering your questions, but there&#x27;s something to be said about a company that thinks they can trick you by making you think you&#x27;re getting way more than you actually are. And sure, I missed the part where the box says &amp;#34;2.6 fl oz&amp;#34; but why make the tube so large? Do you think I don&#x27;t understand the theory of conservation? Smh.</li>
            <li> If you use this product only once a day, you won&#x27;t get the whitening results as quickly as someone who faithfully uses it 2-3 times a day. I purchaed this toothpaste because I noticed how yellow my teeth had become over the years from drinking red wine, grape juice, coffee sometimes, and tea. All of those things stain teeth terribly. Anyway, the same day I bought thos toothpaste, I purchased a new toothbrush to ensure I would get the full benefit of this toothpaste. As soon as I got home, I ate and then brushed using this toothpaste. The full benefit depends on your technique as well. Take your time and gently brush using circular motions especially where you want to see results. No kidding, after the first brushing, it looked like this toothpaste devoured the stains and lifted color to one shade whiter! Also contains fluoride which is a plus! I&#x27;m sticking with this toothpaste for good. Purchasing the matching mouthwash in the morning at the store!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell this type of Rembrandt in my area at all. I have ordered this previously and thought I&#x27;d use it until the tube was gone before I wrote my review. The tube is full of air due to the fact that it contains dental peroxide. But you get the exact amount as in the other types. The bottle just has to have room to expand. It definitely whitened my theeth. I&#x27;m a smoker and a coffee drinker. Using it and the mouth was will make your theeth whiter. Noticeably so. I&#x27;ve used the other whitening products from other brands they don&#x27;t even compare. It arravied when it said it would. Was packed nicely and no product damage.</li>
            <li> I decided to step up my teeth game and this was my first choice as my sister recommended it. At first, my teeth got overly sensitive but that only lasted for a few days and it wasn&#x27;t that bad. Afterwards, my teeth were perfect and grew several shades whiter and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Definitely my new toothpaste of choice but I would recommend switching back and fourth with another trusted toothpaste if the sensitivity is too much to handle. It&#x27;s a little expensive but something to never cheap out on is yourself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it works and how much not.For me is a tooth paste and nothing more. Ok let say it is one very popular and nice paste.I don&#x27;t mind. But the tube is pumped with air half of it. When you open it and squeeze you are emptying the half of the tube before you get any of the paste. Stupid little trick. Actually you are paying double for this paste. This is ridiculous.Such a big and famous company is doing such a lousy and greedy tricks. Shame on you</li>
            <li> Even though Rembrandt expensive (a bit cheaper on amazon) it is still my favorite toothpaste. Really does seem to whiten and not sugary like others.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Only complaint is that the tube seems empty and you need to stand it on its cap to get the paste down.&lt;br /&gt;I have a dental friend and they recommended this to me.</li>
            <li> Wife has allergies to ingredients in most all toothpaste products. This is the only toothpaste she likes and it does a great job cleaning and leaving a fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Somehow already used. This fit my requirements of really whitening my teeth. Is it not possible to have bigger pack of this?</li>
            <li> All my family now is using only this toothpaste as it whitens the teeth very effectively. This product has a very high quality.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is okay - it does seem to whiten over time-  I just drink too much coffee!  The tubes are deceiving as they had a lot of air in them and not so much paste.  I don&#x27;t know that it is any better than the new Crest which is also less expensive.</li>
            <li> Between strips and this paste, I see a little improvement</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste since its inception.  It is sometimes difficult to find in my area--so Amazon to the rescue.  It really does whiten the best and prevents cavities.  I love it and will use no other.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I always use this particular Rembrandt toothpaste. I learned that it is now carried by a couple of local merchants, so now I purchase it there instead of in bulk, but the toothpast is the only thing that keeps my teeth white.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this!!! It is freaking expensive and was less than a third full.  It was full of air!</li>
            <li> Whitens but not effectively</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but don&#x27;t use it more to twice a day. I may to much. One a day using this would be better, while you use your other tooth past and it will save you money as well.  My teeth do look a lot better, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I might be ready to marry this toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve tried whitening strips in the past, but the discomfort, cost, and sheer time commitment were never worth the disappointing results.  Those disappointments are now nothing but vague and buried memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Deeply White, although my teeth may be whitening more gradually than they would with strips, the progress is steady and highly visible -- a trait I have yet to find in any other \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpaste (I&#x27;m looking at you, Crest) and ultimately prefer to harsh, short cycles of strip whitening.  Getting and maintaining results is effortless, because all I have to do is brush my teeth... which I would already be doing even if I wasn&#x27;t trying to whiten!  I also haven&#x27;t experienced any tooth sensitivity, which is a particular relief because tooth sensitivity runs in my family.    Admittedly, the taste isn&#x27;t fantastic, but it is completely tolerable, and totally worth the results.  And don&#x27;t be alarmed by the amount of air space in the bottle -- this stuff will still give you your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months of use, it&#x27;s safe to say that I am completely satisfied with the progression of my results; but, it didn&#x27;t even take that long for me to start seeing improvement!  Three weeks after I began brushing with this toothpaste, my family went in to get portraits taken with a professional photographer.  When we looked back at the photos, both the photographer and my family noted (without any prompting from me) that my teeth were visibly brighter than those of my mother, father, and sister; all of whom still have lovely smiles, but I digress.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had known that whitening could be this easy, I would have started years ago!  I may not be a dentist, but I know my own experience, and it&#x27;s been fantastic.  I am a convert.  From now on, I will be using nothing but Rembrandt Deeply White to brush the way to my shiny bright future.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Have been using for several years and always get compliments on my teeth. Worth trying for sure.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased based on the hope of the \\&quot;name\\&quot; and high cost paying off in terms of quality.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the first tube to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I had left the tube cap end up since the night before (not planned, just landed that way) and as I squeezed all I got was air for 50% of the capacity of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping my two other tubes were better off I opened them up - the second tube was exactly the same - lots of air, little paste.&lt;br /&gt;The third tube was a surprise, about 3$ worth of toothpaste shot out immediately due to compressed air in the tube!&lt;br /&gt;I am at sea level so I don&#x27;t know why this kind of thing would happen except that the tube was filled incorrectly by the tube filling machine, somehow compressing the air in behind the paste.&lt;br /&gt;Given the incredibly small amount of actual toothpaste that these three very expensive tubes will yield the actual long term whitening quality will never be known by me.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry - at this cost the tube is to be completely full of toothpaste that dispenses in an easily controlled fashion.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you do, do not drop the big money on this.</li>
            <li> The worst toothpaste ever. Content only half full and does not even work.</li>
            <li> I am jumping the bandwagon with wanting to marry this toothpaste! As a HEAVY tea drinker, I have stained discolored teeth. My last dental cleaning, I asked what was the best toothpaste for whightning and she reconmended Rembrandt Deep Cleaning products and said their strips work really great too. I went to Walmart and got the Deep Clean (green and white) toothpaste and mouthwash. I now refuse to use any other brand of toothpaste ever again! Its almost always sold out at Walmart and Target because it does work!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Clean toothpaste has oxygen in it, so dont freak out if the tube deflates- theres still toothpaste inside! It tingles when I use it, so you can FEEL it really clean unlike other brands like Crest and Colgate&#x27;s peroxide toothpastes which didnt work for me. Its not painful to use and you will see results in about a week if you read all the instructions properly. I love strong mint flavors so it taste fine, but I wouldnt brush your tongue with it. You wont have bleach colored teeth, but you will have a whiter smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I refuse to use any other brand of whitening toothpaste, honestly if they stopped making this it would be the apocalypse for me! My family complemented my teeth when we got together for a birthday party and Im thankful my dentist recondmended this for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember if you use any of their products you do get what you pay for and READ/FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONSif you want the results!</li>
            <li> Of all the whitening toothpaste I have tried, this is by far the best one.  Believe me when I say you get what you pay for.  It is a little expensive in the stores but you have opportunities to get it discounted.  This purchase from Amazon was amazing so I jumped at the chance to buy it.  After you use it, you can see your teeth whitening immediately and when you stop using for whatever reason, the yellow comes back.  So I have used it every since and not going back to the regular toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste due to the positive reviews it received and the price at which Amazon was selling it when I made my purchase. As far as the toothpaste itself goes, I agree with the majority that it whitens and cleans my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used before. What I don&#x27;t like, is the product packaging and the result of the formula used with this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box for the toothpaste, I noticed that the tube was very \\&quot;tight\\&quot;. After reading the back of it, it mentions that due to the chemicals used, they will release gas and cause the tube to expand, which is nothing to worry about; however, upon opening the lid to my first tube, the pressure inside the tube forced about 1/3rd of toothpaste in the tube out and into my sink. I haven&#x27;t gotten to my 2nd tube yet, and maybe there&#x27;s a way to get the gas to accumulate at the top of the tube before opening it, but there was no warning on the package that this could/would occur and frankly it will be pretty annoying if it does it for the remaining tubes. I&#x27;m sure someone will comment with \\&quot;It never happens to me, you must be opening it wrong\\&quot;, but besides randomly massaging the tube trying to get gas to the top, there&#x27;s not much else I can do to prevent it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, not only is this toothpaste more expensive than other brands (maybe justifiably so) keep in mind that there is the potential for a large percentage of the toothpaste to uncontrollably exit when you first open it, thereby increasing the cost of the toothpaste even further. If anyone has found a way to prevent this from occurring, I&#x27;d love to hear it before I open my remaining tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on 5/1/2012 - I opened the 2nd tube some time ago and was able to prevent toothpaste from exiting by massaging it around and getting all of the gas near the opening. Unfortunately, I no longer use this toothpaste. After making it through the first tube and part of the second, I started to notice a trend of bad breath and a funny taste in my mouth. The taste in my mouth was similar to hydrogen peroxide and I made the assumption that this was also the cause of my bad breath. I switched to some cheap Crest from my local department store and the bad breath slowly went away. I&#x27;ll see if I can get my girlfriend to use the rest of it. :)</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and in the past had great and pretty immediate results.  I don&#x27;t what to deal is, but each tube in the three-pack we bought seems to be only half-full.  I get that it&#x27;s sold by weight rather than volume, but if each tune really has 2.6 ounces, why so much packaging?  Honestly, I remember other tubes of this toothpaste I&#x27;ve purchased at large box stores not feeling only half-full.</li>
            <li> Only used once, so I will post results of whitening later. For now I had to get this out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start off with the flaw as it&#x27;s most important. If you&#x27;ve read the reviews on the website you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m about to say. I paid a premium price, for ½ of a tube of air. This was EXTREMELY disappointing and I will NOT purchase this product again because of this unless they fix this. I wish I had read the reviews on the site before buying, but instead I went with these reviews...that was a mistake. I saw it was 2.6 fl oz. but the tube was much smaller than a 4 fl oz tube of Sensodyne so I assumed it would be full, and I was wrong. I&#x27;m not absolutely pissed because the product seemed to have done something, I unfortunately didn&#x27;t brush even close to long enough as I was not expecting the toothpaste to have an effect like the alcohol in mouthwash does, but my teeth feel clean after a short twenty second brush. If you&#x27;re looking for a budget whitening toothpaste look elsewhere, maybe Colgate Optic White or Tom&#x27;S Of Maine Simply White. If you can drop the cash on this then it may or may not be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening results: TBD, will use 2x day for 1 week.</li>
            <li> Works great! This is the only toothpaste i&#x27;m aware of, besides a few much harder to find brands, that actually whitens more than the surface of the tooth.  Because whats the point in having your teeth whitened, then returning to a toothpaste that allows those deep stains to return? It also leaves your mouth feeling really fresh, although it is very strong for the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> Think my teeth are slightly white. Nothing amazing. Gone through 2.5 tubes and it&#x27;s a subtle change.</li>
            <li> granddaughter loves it....kind of pricey for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this makes my teeth whiter or not. I only use it once a day, I use a Sensitive toothpaste at night and this in the morning. It tastes horrible, honestly.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed much in the way of whiter teeth since using this product. Seems to do the same a Crest that I used from the grocery store. Ok if you get a great deal like I did on a \\&quot;Today&#x27;s Deal\\&quot; from Amazon</li>
            <li> I paid a high price for this small amount of toothpaste in order to have some smaller tubes of toothpaste for travel and carrying in my purse when I go out to dinner or am away from home all day.  I was extremely disappointed to receive large tubes underfilled with toothpaste.  Completely useless for my purposes.  Fool me once .....</li>
            <li> Especially when used with the \\&quot;D\\&quot; mouthwash, truly keeps teeth white but not the white that looks like it is painted on or overbleached.  I work in a hospital and one of the neurosurgeons stopped me in the hallway to ask what I did to keep my teeth bright and so healthy looking... I told him about Rembrandt products... and gave the brand credit for doing what it advertises that it will do.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product as my friend in the beauty industry rated it highly. Unfortunately the results were only slight and not noticeable for others to comment on. I don&#x27;t smoke, don&#x27;t drink wine and just drink one cup of caffeine per day. If you can&#x27;t afford to get your teeth whitened this is something to help you go a shade lighter but I feel with legal limits of peroxide being very low for shelf products the next step for a much brighter smile is visiting the dentists.</li>
            <li> The results for this toothpaste are amazing! I am a coffee and tea drinker, and you could definitely tell by my teeth before I started to use this product. I admit it. I have been a little obsessed with it, and have been brushing my teeth a couple extra times a day. Just the level of clean is fresher than any other toothpaste. My teeth stay smooth for hours and hours. As for the whitening, yes, it is gradual, but it is working. The other day my sister came up to me and stopped me mid sentence just to tell me, \\&quot;oh my gosh, that stuff you are using on your teeth is really working! They look so white!.\\&quot; Even my mother said that she is going to have to give it a try, haha. They aren&#x27;t super super white, but they are definitely whiter. They aren&#x27;t as white as I would like them to be just yet, but I am sure they will get there. They look whiter with every brushing. I have sensitive teeth, and this has not bothered them as whitening strips have. It was a little hard on my gums the first time, probably because of the peroxide, but nothing major. The only thing is, the peroxide causes the bottom of my gums to become a little white. That goes away within ten minutes. I am also using this with the mouthwash. I have tried Crest whitening strips and toothpastes, Colgate whitening toothpastes and an at home UV treatment, but this has by far shown the best results. I would surely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This works really good with the rinse.  Really cleans where other whitening&lt;br /&gt;toothpastes.  Quick results.  I saw results in the first week.  The paste is thick so you only need a little.  I recommend that you buy the deep rinse as well as I am reviewing based on the products used together.</li>
            <li> I received mine in 3 separate boxes as expected, however each one I opened did not have a foil cover over the top like the red label.&lt;br /&gt;3 boxes empty</li>
            <li> I generally drink a lot of coffee throughout the day (office job) so I started looking for a solution that will help whiten my teeth. I came across this product, ordered, and after about 2 weeks of usage (2x a day, morning before work, night before bed), I noticed significant positive changes in the colour of my teeth. Overall, they have whitened and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every cent. I&#x27;d turn a trick for this stuff. I am not exaggerating when I say that I noticed a difference the very FIRST  time I usd it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times and have been very please with the results. Would also highly recommend their deep whitening mouth rinse to use with it. very, very pleased.</li>
            <li> absolutely no difference in my teeth color. this is close to worthless.  its makes a teeth slightly more sensitive and there&#x27;s wierd white spots near where some of my teeth touch.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month，but my teeth are more yellow than before</li>
            <li> Very good product. Whitens teeth. Use with an electric toothbrush daily</li>
            <li> I really love using this tooth paste! It works way better then the cheap toothpaste! It leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and good.</li>
            <li> I threw this product in the TRASH!  After using it for several days, once a day, I have painful blisters all over the right upper side of my mouth.  I have them all along the roof and gumline.  No THANKS!  I will go back to my ProNamel Sensodyne. This is not worth it! No toothpaste should EVER do this. Rembrandt DOES say to stop using product if you experience oral irritation.  This should have been my warning BEFORE I used it.  Unless you have gums of steel, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it because it keep my teeth white</li>
            <li> Good product.  We can see a difference already!  Only challenge is when we opened the first tube the toothpaste shot out all over the place!  Happened with the first 2 tubes so far.  Haven&#x27;t opened the third one yet.</li>
            <li> The lesser of the two toothpastes by Rembrandt. This is a great toothpaste in comparison with all other on the shelf, but I wish I had bought Intense Stain to begin. Use the Intense Stain Rembrandt, it will really get right down in your teeth and get the job done, with fluoride. Quality toothpaste, don&#x27;t leave your teeth hanging, your teeth are your lively hood! Cheers to Rembrandt! Great name too after the painter!</li>
            <li> Finally, a toothpaste comparable to Topol (not manufactured any more - and the only product that would rid my teeth of coffee stains).  This product works great.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try out this product but I checked CVS is website and this same item is selling for a dollar more. I will update when I&#x27;m trying this out</li>
            <li> Have yet to find a toothpaste that does a better job of whitening without much use.  Would recommend, long time user.</li>
            <li> After using this toothpaste, I feel that this toothpaste is not as good as I expected.It looks good, but after found to have some to be hard to squeeze out, which a lot of air, very little toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see the negative reviews for Rembrandt. I bought it randomly at CVS one day, and after a few weeks of using it, my teeth were so shiny and white. They&#x27;re still shiny and white, and I refused to use any other toothpaste. It never burned my gums before, but this is just my experience with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist for 34 years and a dental researcher and developer for 36 years -- and I&#x27;m also an author and lecturer.  Rembrandt is what I&#x27;ve been recommending to my patients since the early 80&#x27;s, right after Dr. Robert Ibsen created this toothpaste with his company DenMat.  It has since been sold to Oral-B and now one of the Johnson &amp; Johnson companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY low in abrasion yet I believe the best stain removing toothpaste.  You wouldn&#x27;t clean your car with an abrasive kitchen cleanser -- you&#x27;d use a non abrasive car soap that \\&quot;dissolves\\&quot; stains instead of \\&quot;sanding\\&quot; them off with abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rembrandt uses a proteolytic enzyme that comes from the papaya fruit (so it is very safe and gentle)that will dissolve away stains on the surface of the teeth instead of an abrasive.  This means less wear of your teeth over the years and less \\&quot;notching\\&quot; of the teeth up near the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price that Amazon is charging is very fair.</li>
            <li> This is the best non-prescription toothpaste for people who had too many antibiotics when young and their enamel is thin. It works GREAT!</li>
            <li> I bought this product today and well, it turned my gums white and was SO painful. I&#x27;m a health freak, I floss and everything, I just like to drink colored stuff but guess this isn&#x27;t for me. Guess I&#x27;ll try that new crest brilliance.</li>
            <li> This does a great job keeping my teeth white if I could get over the taste! I prefer the red one over this one. They are both hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I used this product for several months. First of all, every time I opened a tube that I ordered from Amazon about 1/4 of the product came bursting out of the bottle, which was a huge waste of money since I couldn&#x27;t exactly push it back in. Second, it smells horrible and you don&#x27;t get a minty, refreshing feeling after use like in other toothpastes. Third, I did not notice ANY increase in the whiteness of my teeth. My teeth aren&#x27;t in bad condition and are fairly white to begin with, but I switched from Crest whitening toothpaste after seeing ads for this and assuming that it would work better. After several months of use and no change, I went back to Crest and tried their 3D white + luxe and noticed a HUGE difference in only 3 days. Disappointed that I spent so much time with this product when it did not make any difference.</li>
            <li> I use the 2hr kit, this toothpaste, and the mouthwash. If they made floss, I would actually start flossing. That is how well Rembrandt works for me. I am a very heavy tea drinker. I used to be a heavy wine drinker, chain smoker, and tooth neglecter. Using Rembrandt products made me feel confident in my smile again. Now, I can even wear lipsticks in shades that are not so flattering for the teeth (coral, nude, orange-red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not being paid to write this, I just wanted to share my positive experience. I haven&#x27;t had any pain or increased sensitivity, and my teeth are normally very sensitive. They are sensitive to cold, but they have always been that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I said I&#x27;ll give it a try, but I can&#x27;t see any difference, well maybe if we want to have white teeth we have to visit a dentist who can give advice..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste twice a day (brushing for 3-5 minutes, spitting out the toothpaste without rinsing it off my teeth), but my teeth are not discernibly whiter than they were when I first started using this toothpaste two months ago. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for the unlucky few of us... :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but it the tube comes half empty...is there a bigger size?</li>
            <li> Has quite a strong flavor because of the whitening ingredients. But you get used to it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening but it&#x27;s not going to the yellow direction either. So I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> My favourite toothpaste</li>
            <li> First let me start by stating this product information is stamped on the box AND tube: \\&quot;This proprietary formula contains Active Dental Peroxide, which releases oxygen for superior whitening. As a result, it is common for the tube to appear slightly inflated or release air when opened.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this toothpaste is probably the best you&#x27;ll ever buy. It works as advertised. Has a nice subtle mint flavor with no horrible peroxide after-taste, and actually DOES whiten your teeth pretty well... not much else to say about a tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen many people write reviews and make inaccurate accusations because the consumers are failing to read ALL of the products information. Yes, when you buy this toothpaste the tube will be almost half empty because the oxygen released by the formulation needs a place to go. Unless you want the tube to burst and have to clean up splattered toothpaste from packaging failure, I&#x27;d say the packaging is pretty convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, unless you brush your teeth more than three times a day, the amount of toothpaste you get will last you about two-and-a-half to three months. Ask any dentist or dental expert and they will all say that you only need a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to properly brush your teeth. Anything else is overkill and wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having clarified those oversights that it seems many reviewers are obviously overlooking, this product is awesome. Well... as awesome as awesome can be for just being toothpaste. You will more than likely shell out $6 to $7 for a tube of this \\&quot;high end toothpaste\\&quot;, but I&#x27;ve used worse products that have cost twice the amount of the Rembrandt brand. So keep yourself knowledgeable, and enjoy your beautiful white smile if you decide to use this product.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best whitening  toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go to the dentist for 10 years and used only this toothpaste. I finally went and I had a great checkup, I&#x27;m sure results will vary but it&#x27;s got my vote.</li>
