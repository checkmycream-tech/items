            <li>so I have to stay on top of it</li>
            <li>WOULD CAUSE MORE IRRITATION, BUT USING THIS ONCE</li>
            <li>It really foams up and tastes great.</li>
            <li>This is great toothpaste really whitens.  </li>
            <li>But, I will know for sure after more uses.</li>
            <li>Love this tooth paste everybody ask</li>
            <li>This product claimed to do better than remove surface stains from teeth but also to &amp;#34;clean deep&amp;#34; (what ever that means).</li>
            <li>Toms of Maine OK also.</li>
            <li>I use it now too and we&#x27;ve noticed our teeth are noticeably whiter and gums feel much better.</li>
            <li>I switched to this brand after using Crest for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 days with this toothpaste (and the accompanying mouthwash, which I also LOVE) and my teeth are already noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and will tell everyone about this paste.</li>
            <li>after using it ,teeth more clean than before~&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>Perfectly clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always favored Rembrandt because I thought it left my teeth feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Nice flavor to it...doesn&#x27;t taste too much like peroxide like some of the whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li>it is just great always white teeth.</li>
            <li>Seems just as good for me as the old C formula.  </li>
            <li>this product is great, it keeps my teeth very white and clean.  </li>
            <li>Upon subsequent uses, it&#x27;s been getting better and better!</li>
            <li>when the tube ran out i switched to regular toothpaste because i couldn&#x27;t find any more of this kind at the store, and</li>
            <li>They take the stain away visibly after prolonged use, so that the teeth looks clean.</li>
            <li>WHAT YOU NEED FOR CLEAN TEETH.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone looking to brighten their smile and make their teeth appear more healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is effective and worth the relatively high price</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I went abroad that I noticed the full effects of Rembrandt.     </li>
            <li>Under the impression that the toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t make my teeth any MORE stained, I was not expecting much.</li>
            <li>about a month later i noticed that my teeth had gotten a good bit yellower.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the Intense Stain paste.</li>
            <li>Pleasant taste and lasting fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the Glamorous white as it works much better than original.</li>
            <li>Not thinking much of it (and because I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of finding good toothpaste), I started using generic brand toothpaste.</li>
            <li>i have a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee, so just looking for a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>The label guarantees a whiter smile if used twice a day for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>However, I did have a lot of success with stain removal by using a Staino tooth</li>
            <li>This is good as expected.</li>
            <li>Absolutly worth a try if you used to use the C.  SightLine Readers</li>
            <li>I can honestly say there is a definite difference in this paste compared to others.</li>
            <li>She was right.  </li>
            <li>easy on sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I felt it worked very well, and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, I purchased this plus the mouth wash from Walmart (better prices there) and wanted to give it a few weeks before giving an honest review.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves your teeth and overall mouth feeling very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I did drink more red wine, but the amount of \\&quot;staining\\&quot; foods I consumed (coffee, tea, etc.) did not change...</li>
            <li>First off, I don&#x27;t drink alot of alcohol...  </li>
            <li>I also follow the directions and brush and use the mouthwash first thing in the morning, about 30-45 minutes before drinking any coffee.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but was hoping for better results compared to the generic whitening toothpaste you can find in stores.</li>
            <li>At first I thought that they had stopped making this.</li>
            <li>intense white - and the mouthwash, I think all 3 added together do a great job of keeping my teeth white.</li>
            <li>It was very beneficial to me and I am looking forward to dealing with you again soon!</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel very clean and it seems to do what it should, remove stains and keep my teeth from yellowing further.</li>
            <li>It pretty much does everything that it advertises to do.  </li>
            <li>For someone who drinks a lot of black coffee and smokes it is nice to have this toothpaste at my disposal.  </li>
            <li>in the first 2 weeks I noticed a considerable difference and the cost is very reasonable for the results i&#x27;ve gotten...</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any results after using this for about 3 months.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any results after using the whole tube and followed the directions.</li>
            <li>The taste hasn&#x27;t changed, really.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste really brightens up my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Really does help noticeably whiten teeth within a month or so.  </li>
            <li>However, I still need sometime to see how much impact it may place on me.</li>
            <li>I never run out of the toothpaste so fast.</li>
            <li>It cleans teeth very well and removes stains.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Unless your teeth are really stained, you won&#x27;t see much of a difference while using this product.</li>
            <li>I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t put a lot of thought into my toothpaste.</li>
            <li>or my teeth get yellow pretty quickly.   </li>
            <li>but it also whitens them significantly with regular use.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean them well</li>
            <li>After paying a substantially higher price for what has turned out to be just another toothpaste, I feel completely taken for a ride...</li>
            <li>So with this particular toothpaste, I see 4-5 shades of white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>routine is normally 30 seconds top and bottom, front and back (upper and lower teeth) and believe me, it helps alot.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend for those with smoking or coffee drinking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using the Staino tooth eraser for tobacco stains.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>A DAY IN COMBINATION WITH ANOTHER SENSITIVE TOOTHPASTE HAS REALLY HELPED WITH MY DENTAL PAIN, AND DRYNESS.</li>
            <li>Even my 7 year old although she finds it very minty asks for it after she has berries to brush.</li>
            <li>I also mix milk in my coffee so it isn&#x27;t black (not as strong staining power.</li>
            <li>Your teeth do feel clean, as you would expect from any other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using a regular toothbrush, you may still see some shades of white but, not as effective with an electric toothbrush since it scrubs the stains off more quicker (with the vibration which will feel weird at first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use it after brushing with other toothpaste first, but it made my gums sting too much.</li>
            <li>In fact, I didn&#x27;t drink as much coffee or tea during those months as I do back in the states.      </li>
            <li>It helps reduce the frequency for professional bleaching and at-home whitening treatment.</li>
            <li>I bought the toothpaste on a whim because I couldn&#x27;t drop the cash for any professional whitening and didn&#x27;t want to fuss with at home kits.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Did whiten my teeth, but also made them sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I would rather use this toothpaste everyday than put some trays in my mouth filled with goop that drip.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Just WOW.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I trashed that junk right away and invested in something better.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t a case of not knowing what my teeth need, it is always a case of my financial standing and like many, I go for the sale items/coupon combination which means I usually have a supply of 10 tubes that I spent about 33 cents on always at the ready.  </li>
            <li>A few weeks later I tried Crest 3D white and within in 1 week my teeth were super white and month felt fresh for hours at the fraction of what this product cost.</li>
            <li>I saw very little improvement after almost one full bottle of the paste.</li>
            <li>I try to do this at least once either in the morning or night and then followed by 15 second top, bottom, front and back teeth.  </li>
            <li>have no regrets in using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But still, I&#x27;ve not used any toothpaste other than Rembrandt for years, and no matter how much coffee/tea I drink, I&#x27;m still getting compliments on my teeth.</li>
            <li>When I got back home, I had to use whitening strips to get my teeth back to the previous white color, and I immediately started using the Intense Stain toothpaste to clean out the stains (previously, I just used the green-boxed Deeply white toothpaste from Rembrandt).</li>
            <li>I would definitely reorder this product as I think that other whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t work as well or as fast.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but was hoping for better results compared to the generic whitening toothpaste you can find in stores.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that they had stopped making this.</li>
            <li> intense white - and the mouthwash, I think all 3 added together do a great job of keeping my teeth white.</li>
            <li> It was very beneficial to me and I am looking forward to dealing with you again soon!</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel very clean and it seems to do what it should, remove stains and keep my teeth from yellowing further.</li>
            <li> It pretty much does everything that it advertises to do.  </li>
            <li> For someone who drinks a lot of black coffee and smokes it is nice to have this toothpaste at my disposal.  </li>
            <li> in the first 2 weeks I noticed a considerable difference and the cost is very reasonable for the results i&#x27;ve gotten...</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any results after using this for about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results after using the whole tube and followed the directions.</li>
            <li> The taste hasn&#x27;t changed, really.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste really brightens up my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Really does help noticeably whiten teeth within a month or so.  </li>
            <li> However, I still need sometime to see how much impact it may place on me.</li>
            <li> I never run out of the toothpaste so fast.</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth very well and removes stains.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Unless your teeth are really stained, you won&#x27;t see much of a difference while using this product.</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t put a lot of thought into my toothpaste.</li>
            <li> or my teeth get yellow pretty quickly.   </li>
            <li> but it also whitens them significantly with regular use.</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean them well</li>
            <li> After paying a substantially higher price for what has turned out to be just another toothpaste, I feel completely taken for a ride...</li>
            <li> So with this particular toothpaste, I see 4-5 shades of white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> routine is normally 30 seconds top and bottom, front and back (upper and lower teeth) and believe me, it helps alot.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend for those with smoking or coffee drinking.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using the Staino tooth eraser for tobacco stains.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> A DAY IN COMBINATION WITH ANOTHER SENSITIVE TOOTHPASTE HAS REALLY HELPED WITH MY DENTAL PAIN, AND DRYNESS.</li>
            <li> Even my 7 year old although she finds it very minty asks for it after she has berries to brush.</li>
            <li> I also mix milk in my coffee so it isn&#x27;t black (not as strong staining power.</li>
            <li> Your teeth do feel clean, as you would expect from any other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using a regular toothbrush, you may still see some shades of white but, not as effective with an electric toothbrush since it scrubs the stains off more quicker (with the vibration which will feel weird at first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use it after brushing with other toothpaste first, but it made my gums sting too much.</li>
            <li> In fact, I didn&#x27;t drink as much coffee or tea during those months as I do back in the states.      </li>
            <li> It helps reduce the frequency for professional bleaching and at-home whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought the toothpaste on a whim because I couldn&#x27;t drop the cash for any professional whitening and didn&#x27;t want to fuss with at home kits.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Did whiten my teeth, but also made them sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I would rather use this toothpaste everyday than put some trays in my mouth filled with goop that drip.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Just WOW.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I trashed that junk right away and invested in something better.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t a case of not knowing what my teeth need, it is always a case of my financial standing and like many, I go for the sale items/coupon combination which means I usually have a supply of 10 tubes that I spent about 33 cents on always at the ready.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks later I tried Crest 3D white and within in 1 week my teeth were super white and month felt fresh for hours at the fraction of what this product cost.</li>
            <li> I saw very little improvement after almost one full bottle of the paste.</li>
            <li> I try to do this at least once either in the morning or night and then followed by 15 second top, bottom, front and back teeth.  </li>
            <li> have no regrets in using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But still, I&#x27;ve not used any toothpaste other than Rembrandt for years, and no matter how much coffee/tea I drink, I&#x27;m still getting compliments on my teeth.</li>
            <li> When I got back home, I had to use whitening strips to get my teeth back to the previous white color, and I immediately started using the Intense Stain toothpaste to clean out the stains (previously, I just used the green-boxed Deeply white toothpaste from Rembrandt).</li>
            <li> I would definitely reorder this product as I think that other whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t work as well or as fast.</li>
            <li> It is expensive as far as toothpastes goes, but I have found it to be definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews and figured because it cost twice as much as other whitening toothpastes at half the bottle size it was bound to work.</li>
            <li> As for the result, I&#x27;m not sure I can really tell a difference in the whiteness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular toothpaste 3 times a day for the past 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally prone to a little discoloration even though I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product because I&#x27;d used whitening products in the past with little success.</li>
            <li> OK, so they discontinued the formula that they marketed for canker sore suffers.  </li>
            <li> Tried several whitening products(toothpastes and gels) with no real noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Upon closer inspection, I saw brown stains on my upper and lower center teeth!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a couple of days, mainly due to the delay of Customs clearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first bought it in 2005, it was thin and runny.</li>
            <li> and I will never EVER go back to any other dental brand!</li>
            <li> Eventually, my teeth retained their original white hue, but I was shocked that a switching toothpaste could have caused such a noticable change.     </li>
            <li> I realize that there must be other factors, i.e., my foreign toothpaste could have been exceptionally low quality as it was provided for me at no cost.</li>
            <li> Although this product is a bit expensive, the whitening effects show quickly after a couple months of use compared to other products.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using the generic toothpaste, I started noticing that my teeth looked yellower.</li>
            <li> Using it since a few years, everybody ask me why my teeth are so white</li>
            <li> is the film you get on your lips after brushing, including a few hours later.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience these empty tubes that others complain about.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, both professions required large consumption of coffee!</li>
            <li> Value for money, little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve used crest, colgate and other brands.  </li>
            <li> Other brands had suggested \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; and I never noticed a thing.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste was painfree (unlike some whitening solutions) and worked extremely well - my teeth are noticeably whiter</li>
            <li> One star off because it&#x27;s pretty expensive for toothpaste.   </li>
            <li> I will say I&#x27;ve tried Crest and the other whitening toothpastes and the one thing I do not like about the others</li>
            <li> I will try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be skeptical when I first bought this product</li>
            <li> packages are hard to open</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I spent about three months in Europe, and about a month in, my tube of Rembrandt ran out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than any other brand!  </li>
            <li> The other thing is there is very little in the tube.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> In any case, after trying the product there was little to no significant difference.  </li>
            <li> It works no better than my normal Colgate toothpaste and it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON REMBRANT.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just not a fit for me, maybe it works for some people.</li>
            <li> although it can be harsh</li>
            <li> WASTED MY MONEY</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and it is too stiff to bend.</li>
            <li> White teeth are impossible to get unless they are bleached or you used something like Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li> The quality of this dvd was bad , the songs where short, I do not recommend that anyone buy this dvd, it is low grade</li>
            <li> Now keep in mind, I drink coffee, but usually no more than one cup in the morning.</li>
            <li> You can get it at almost all drug and grocery stores and I saw immediate improvements in no more than one day.</li>
            <li> I drink at least 4 cups of coffee per day and needed something to remove the surface stains.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed I searched out another paste and found Crest 3D Glamorous White for about $3 less as well as</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t too terribly bad to begin with, but I drink a lot of coffee and red wine, which discolored my teeth a bit.</li>
            <li> I have some mad coffee stains, not like ugly dark stuff</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all with this product.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;strips are difficult to remove from package, and often start to disintegrate in the removal process</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;strips are difficult to place and sometimes fold in on themselves in the application&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> To me it is just another toothpaste that has become expensive!  </li>
            <li> and my toothpaste is not there :((</li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always favored Rembrandt because I thought it left my teeth feeling clean and healthy. It wasn&#x27;t until I went abroad that I noticed the full effects of Rembrandt.     A few years ago, I spent about three months in Europe, and about a month in, my tube of Rembrandt ran out. Not thinking much of it (and because I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of finding good toothpaste), I started using generic brand toothpaste. After a few weeks of using the generic toothpaste, I started noticing that my teeth looked yellower. Upon closer inspection, I saw brown stains on my upper and lower center teeth! Granted, I did drink more red wine, but the amount of \\&quot;staining\\&quot; foods I consumed (coffee, tea, etc.) did not change... In fact, I didn&#x27;t drink as much coffee or tea during those months as I do back in the states.      When I got back home, I had to use whitening strips to get my teeth back to the previous white color, and I immediately started using the Intense Stain toothpaste to clean out the stains (previously, I just used the green-boxed Deeply white toothpaste from Rembrandt). Eventually, my teeth retained their original white hue, but I was shocked that a switching toothpaste could have caused such a noticable change.     I realize that there must be other factors, i.e., my foreign toothpaste could have been exceptionally low quality as it was provided for me at no cost. But still, I&#x27;ve not used any toothpaste other than Rembrandt for years, and no matter how much coffee/tea I drink, I&#x27;m still getting compliments on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for quite a while. It works well enough on tea and coffee stain. easy on sensitive teeth.  will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for 2+ year and am really happy with the result.  It helps reduce the frequency for professional bleaching and at-home whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> I have some mad coffee stains, not like ugly dark stuff but my teeth are off off white, so after brushing my teeth with this for a week, 2 shades whiter! Love it! It removes the stains instead of whitening them.</li>
            <li> Some claim that it works and some don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t know why but, I&#x27;ll tell you what helps me.  First off, I don&#x27;t drink alot of alcohol...  Every once in awhile.  I drink coffee (1-2 cups a day) and drink coke or sprite once in awhile. So, I&#x27;ve used crest, colgate and other brands.  Even with my sonic care toothbrush (I&#x27;m just saying what I&#x27;m using and not recommending that), it does scrub some stains out with regular toothpaste, but, still leaves my teeth somewhat yellow.  So with this particular toothpaste, I see 4-5 shades of white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a regular toothbrush, you may still see some shades of white but, not as effective with an electric toothbrush since it scrubs the stains off more quicker (with the vibration which will feel weird at first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine is normally 30 seconds top and bottom, front and back (upper and lower teeth) and believe me, it helps alot.  I try to do this at least once either in the morning or night and then followed by 15 second top, bottom, front and back teeth.  Works for me and won&#x27;t tell you what to do.  This is my method.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, I purchased this plus the mouth wash from Walmart (better prices there) and wanted to give it a few weeks before giving an honest review. I read the positive reviews and figured because it cost twice as much as other whitening toothpastes at half the bottle size it was bound to work. Now keep in mind, I drink coffee, but usually no more than one cup in the morning. I also follow the directions and brush and use the mouthwash first thing in the morning, about 30-45 minutes before drinking any coffee. I also mix milk in my coffee so it isn&#x27;t black (not as strong staining power. I saw very little improvement after almost one full bottle of the paste. I was so disappointed I searched out another paste and found Crest 3D Glamorous White for about $3 less as well as it&#x27;s a much bigger bottle. I had used the 3D line before, in fact I have it in my desk for after lunch brushing. Buy this! You can get it at almost all drug and grocery stores and I saw immediate improvements in no more than one day. Be sure to get the Glamorous white as it works much better than original. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON REMBRANT.</li>
            <li> I am a college student and a barista. Needless to say, both professions required large consumption of coffee! I bought the toothpaste on a whim because I couldn&#x27;t drop the cash for any professional whitening and didn&#x27;t want to fuss with at home kits. Under the impression that the toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t make my teeth any MORE stained, I was not expecting much. Other brands had suggested \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; and I never noticed a thing. I gave my teeth some thorough brushing and I when I rinsed, I noticed a big difference!  Upon subsequent uses, it&#x27;s been getting better and better! My breath is fresh and it leaves my gums feeling good too!    I am SO happy with this product and I will never EVER go back to any other dental brand!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any results after using this for about 3 months. I don&#x27;t smoke, don&#x27;t drink red wine, I just drink around 2 coffees/day, but this definitely didn&#x27;t help. I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but was hoping for better results compared to the generic whitening toothpaste you can find in stores. Maybe it&#x27;s just not a fit for me, maybe it works for some people.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product on amazon. Actually bought it at the store. But I just want too let people know that it does make a diffrence I use it twice a day and within 3 weeks i noticed results.Im a big coffee drinker I look at before and after photos and notice i have a whiter smile. I was buying crest Strips But there are So PRICEY. This is reasonable with great results. FOR SURE BUY!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular toothpaste 3 times a day for the past 2 weeks. It tastes great and has an immediate effect on my teeth. Not only does it clean them well but it also whitens them significantly with regular use. I have no coffee or nicotine stains on my teeth anymore. I&#x27;m hooked :)</li>
            <li> Nice flavor to it...doesn&#x27;t taste too much like peroxide like some of the whitening toothpastes. I just started using it, but it seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> The quality of this dvd was bad , the songs where short, I do not recommend that anyone buy this dvd, it is low grade&lt;br /&gt;and I feel I was cheated out of my money</li>
            <li> after using it ,teeth more clean than before~&lt;br /&gt;will but it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just say This is the Only thing I&#x27;ll buy!! White is what I&#x27;m going for....</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but only been using item for a short time.  I like the minty taste and feel that with further use, my teeth should be whiter than they currently are.  I drink a lot of coffee, so just looking for a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product because I&#x27;d used whitening products in the past with little success. But I was pleasantly surprised with this toothpaste. The label guarantees a whiter smile if used twice a day for 2 weeks. I saw an improvement in a matter of days! My teeth weren&#x27;t too terribly bad to begin with, but I drink a lot of coffee and red wine, which discolored my teeth a bit. The toothpaste was painfree (unlike some whitening solutions) and worked extremely well - my teeth are noticeably whiter and I can drink all the coffee and wine I want!</li>
            <li> when i used the product, i can&#x27;t say that my teeth got any whiter. but they didn&#x27;t get any darker either. when the tube ran out i switched to regular toothpaste because i couldn&#x27;t find any more of this kind at the store, and about a month later i noticed that my teeth had gotten a good bit yellower. if you&#x27;re looking to cure discolored teeth, then i don&#x27;t know of any toothpaste that will help, but if you want something preventitive, this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great whitening toothpaste! Good value for the price!</li>
            <li> My wife is using this toothpaste. It keeps her teeth snow white. No side effects like extra sensitivity. She is happy with Rembrandt toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It works.  Nothing else to say. It works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results after using the whole tube and followed the directions.</li>
            <li> Excellent was beautiful and wonderful, but after experience pain in the teeth of cold water&lt;br /&gt;Experience more of the wonderful thank you</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes great and it is very reasonable priced here. The only thing is that I have subscription with this product and it is oftenly out of stock which is against the point of monthly subscription cus now i have to go to the supermarket for toothpaste last minute when I open my monthly subsciption delivery and my toothpaste is not there :((</li>
            <li> it is just great always white teeth. Using it since a few years, everybody ask me why my teeth are so white</li>
            <li> At first I thought that they had stopped making this. When I first bought it in 2005, it was thin and runny. But since I only use it a couple times a year, it has thickened up. I have always made sure I kept it with the &#x27;take&#x27; things every time I moved. The taste hasn&#x27;t changed, really. Still productive. I used to use it after brushing with other toothpaste first, but it made my gums sting too much. So now when I get stain spots I use it and give it a couple days before regular brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste really brightens up my teeth.  Mint is not severe</li>
            <li> I am a smoker and coffee drinker and using this product I have whiter teeth then people who don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee!</li>
            <li> I love the Rembrandt strips - intense white - and the mouthwash, I think all 3 added together do a great job of keeping my teeth white.</li>
            <li> Really does help noticeably whiten teeth within a month or so.  For someone who drinks a lot of black coffee and smokes it is nice to have this toothpaste at my disposal.  It pretty much does everything that it advertises to do.  I would definitely reorder this product as I think that other whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t work as well or as fast.</li>
            <li> Does seem to keep teeth whiter</li>
            <li> Did whiten my teeth, but also made them sensitive. If you&#x27;re adamant about whitening you teeth, use this because it&#x27;s very good, but it may have some drawbacks.</li>
            <li> After paying a substantially higher price for what has turned out to be just another toothpaste, I feel completely taken for a ride...I&#x27;ve been using the product for weeks and have not noticed any change--I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, just an improvement of some sort. I can&#x27;t honestly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Tried several whitening products(toothpastes and gels) with no real noticeable difference. in the first 2 weeks I noticed a considerable difference and the cost is very reasonable for the results i&#x27;ve gotten...couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  Leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than any other brand!  It is expensive as far as toothpastes goes, but I have found it to be definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell, but it tastes great! Feels like it&#x27;s working, though.</li>
            <li> perfect for whitening teeth, works great, love the flavor, I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now, and doesn&#x27;t disappoint. highly recommend for those with smoking or coffee drinking. love the way it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rembrandt toothpaste for more than 10 years and its keep my teeth whiter than others brand.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time. Every once in a while I will switch up, trying to find a brand that works as well but is cheaper, but I have had no luck. I drink coffee every day so I have to stay on top of it or my teeth get yellow pretty quickly.   One star off because it&#x27;s pretty expensive for toothpaste.   The texture did change a while ago (it got thinner) but it&#x27;s smoother and seems to work as well for me.   I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an Amazon problem because what I have bought from the drugstore is the same consistency.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves your teeth and overall mouth feeling very fresh and clean.  I also noticed improved whiteness within 2-3 days, amazed even me.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product matches the description.</li>
            <li> I´ve been using this Rembrandt toothpaste for three years now and, although my teeth are not white as a 96%-white paper, I continue to use it just because once, when I ran out of it, I had to use a regular one... Guess what? My teeth felt so much different, that I immediately ordered this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets in using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST toothpaste I have ever used.  Little if any foaming and because I am a tea drinker, it is an awesome stain remover.  Would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all with this product.  It works no better than my normal Colgate toothpaste and it is expensive.  Over $6 for only 3oz.  Will not buy this again.  However, I did have a lot of success with stain removal by using a Staino tooth eraser.[[ASIN:B000BF3ZVA STAINO TOOTH STAIN ERSR 1 HNDL Size: 2 TIPS]]  Highly recommend using the Staino tooth eraser for tobacco stains.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for years, but something has changed.  I have recently switched to another preferred product by Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Although this product is a bit expensive, the whitening effects show quickly after a couple months of use compared to other products. They take the stain away visibly after prolonged use, so that the teeth looks clean.</li>
            <li> This is good as expected. I like the taste especially. However, I still need sometime to see how much impact it may place on me. I have only been using it for a couple of days, mainly due to the delay of Customs clearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> OK, so they discontinued the formula that they marketed for canker sore suffers.  So I tried this (I read somewhere that this did not have one of the two ingredients that the C formula had).... you know what.... no problem.  Seems just as good for me as the old C formula.  Absolutly worth a try if you used to use the C.  SightLine Readers</li>
            <li> packages are hard to open&lt;br /&gt;strips are difficult to remove from package, and often start to disintegrate in the removal process&lt;br /&gt;strips are difficult to place and sometimes fold in on themselves in the application&lt;br /&gt;but...they do not work!</li>
            <li> BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS TOOTHPASTE HELPS WITH ORAL SENSITIVITY/DRY MOUTH.  SOUNDS LIKE WHITENING FORMULA WOULD CAUSE MORE IRRITATION, BUT USING THIS ONCE A DAY IN COMBINATION WITH ANOTHER SENSITIVE TOOTHPASTE HAS REALLY HELPED WITH MY DENTAL PAIN, AND DRYNESS.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a yr and I like it alot. It really foams up and tastes great. It makes my mouth feel very clean and it seems to do what it should, remove stains and keep my teeth from yellowing further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three of the Rembrandt flavors and this is the one I like the best.  As for the result, I&#x27;m not sure I can really tell a difference in the whiteness.  Your teeth do feel clean, as you would expect from any other toothpaste.  I will say I&#x27;ve tried Crest and the other whitening toothpastes and the one thing I do not like about the others is the film you get on your lips after brushing, including a few hours later.  You do NOT get this with the Rembrandt products, which is why I continue to buy their products.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste did not whiten my teeth after about 2 weeks of use there as no difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one two three</li>
            <li> This is great toothpaste really whitens.  The reason I give it a 4 is because of the tube.  I have arthritis and it is too stiff to bend. I know I have to get one of those devices to get the paste out.  The other thing is there is very little in the tube. I never run out of the toothpaste so fast.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist when I asked about getting a whitening procedure.  She said, &amp;#34;it takes time, but it will get your teeth white.&amp;#34;  She was right.  I do also use crest 3d white strips once a month and maintain with Rembrandt in between.</li>
            <li> Awful product. I would never touch this again</li>
            <li> Absolutely excellent toothpaste, does everything what is promising. Value for money, little goes a long way. Pleasant taste and lasting fresh breath.</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth very well and removes stains. I&#x27;m really happy with it. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any remarkable results</li>
            <li> this product is great, it keeps my teeth very white and clean.  although it can be harsh so i also use sensodyne sometimes</li>
            <li> To me it is just another toothpaste that has become expensive!  But, I will know for sure after more uses.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste everybody ask if I go get my teeth cleaned all the time. I would so recommend this.</li>
            <li> been using it for years as a smoker &amp; since quitting&lt;br /&gt;it is effective and worth the relatively high price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;arrived well packaged and on time&lt;br /&gt;my thanks</li>
            <li> To the people who are saying that it doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t make your teeth white, it just cleans the stains off of them. Your enamel is not naturally white. White teeth are impossible to get unless they are bleached or you used something like Crest White Strips. Unless your teeth are really stained, you won&#x27;t see much of a difference while using this product.</li>
            <li> I am on my third tube of this toothpaste. I can really see the difference. It works so well that I find that I brush three times a day. I spend longer brushing my teeth because I see them getting whiter.</li>
            <li> Perfectly clean and refreshing.My family loved it, though. I am very happy, I will buy more. I will try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste hoping it would do what it described--lift stains and visibly brighten my teeth. I can say that after two weeks it has done just that.  I will caveat my review by saying you should not expect to have movie star white teeth after using this product.  BUT...your teeth will be visibly whiter and stains will be lifted.  I wanted to be skeptical when I first bought this product but Rembrandt changed my mind.  I highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone looking to brighten their smile and make their teeth appear more healthy.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste. It has a nice minty flavor that&#x27;s not too stronger. It works great with the mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I would rather use this toothpaste everyday than put some trays in my mouth filled with goop that drip.Great product!</li>
            <li> I felt it worked very well, and quickly.  I also thought that the progress stopped after some point.  It will not make your teeth really white.  But I believe it does get a shade of two whiter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to whiten my teeth. I drink at least 4 cups of coffee per day and needed something to remove the surface stains. This product claimed to do better than remove surface stains from teeth but also to &amp;#34;clean deep&amp;#34; (what ever that means). In any case, after trying the product there was little to no significant difference.  A few weeks later I tried Crest 3D white and within in 1 week my teeth were super white and month felt fresh for hours at the fraction of what this product cost. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> WHAT YOU NEED FOR CLEAN TEETH. Cheaper toothpastes aren&#x27;t even rec.online by health sites. Toms of Maine OK also.</li>
            <li> The item arrived rapidly. It was very beneficial to me and I am looking forward to dealing with you again soon!</li>
            <li> My wife is from Russia and loves this toothpaste. I use it now too and we&#x27;ve noticed our teeth are noticeably whiter and gums feel much better. It tastes good and work great. I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is truly the best at whitening. I switched to this brand after using Crest for many years. On my recent dental cleaning my hygienist told me to stop using Crest since it was embedding plastic specks deep into my gums! Needless to say I trashed that junk right away and invested in something better. My teeth are naturally prone to a little discoloration even though I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke. It&#x27;s been 3 days with this toothpaste (and the accompanying mouthwash, which I also LOVE) and my teeth are already noticeably whiter. I will never go back. I didn&#x27;t experience these empty tubes that others complain about.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t put a lot of thought into my toothpaste. It really isn&#x27;t a case of not knowing what my teeth need, it is always a case of my financial standing and like many, I go for the sale items/coupon combination which means I usually have a supply of 10 tubes that I spent about 33 cents on always at the ready.  HOWEVER, that being said, now that I have tried the Rembrandt Collection, I don&#x27;t know that I can go back to buying anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were horoughly impressed. My favorite is the Intense Stain paste. WOW. Just WOW. I can honestly say there is a definite difference in this paste compared to others. This is it for me. Even my 7 year old although she finds it very minty asks for it after she has berries to brush. I LOVE it and will tell everyone about this paste.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING IT JUST YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO,  SEE NO DIFFERENCE.  WASTED MY MONEY WILL NOT REORDER THIS PRODUCT EVER</li>
