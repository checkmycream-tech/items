            <li>the fragrance &amp; spray allows for great distribution.</li>
            <li>Loved this product.</li>
            <li>Product was as seller described, just not as good of a Moroccan product as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and the idea of it is great</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>

            <li>It is an amazing moisturizer and smells FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Plus you can cook with it as well! :)))</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo and conditioner as well and that may contribute to the lasting delicious scent!  </li>
            <li>The oils is more greasy than moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love love love the scent of this - hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>It worked best when used with the entire product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry AZ winters!</li>
            <li>I love it would not use anything else clean smell .</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil Dry Body Oil is great for your skin, especially in the wintertime but put on your legs in the summertime for a wonderful shine.</li>
            <li>It has changed the texture of my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Also the packaging didn&#x27;t prevent the oil from leaking even though I could tell the merchant did their best to secure it tightly.  </li>
            <li>Cheap pharmacy brands work way</li>
            <li>I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t provide as much moisture as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more very soon</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does come in a very attractive glass bottle, and absorbed very quickly - not at all greasy!</li>
            <li>am currently using organic coconut oil and, trust me, it does an amazing job for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I am a product connoisseur and have never had problems returning a product (which is RARELY)</li>
            <li>Was excited to get this because I love the hair products in the same brand.</li>
            <li>Love this product its not too oily just enough to make your skin nice and smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>They were happy to give me a small discount because of the leak.</li>
            <li>very light and does not last.</li>
            <li>; Moisturizer for my whole body!  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great( exact same as other MO products), hence, my one star rating.  </li>
            <li>Great fir dry skin, love the subtle smell</li>
            <li>First, very pricey for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well</li>
            <li>My hair has been highlighted for many years and I finally feel like the damage is starting to go away.</li>
            <li>I used it daily and was glad when I finally used it up.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t make an oily mess.</li>
            <li>But as far as moisture goes...</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive and dry skin like mine and looking for a solution, I would stay away from this one.</li>

            <li> Who does not take back products if the customer is not satisfied?  </li>
            <li> The product can be found for around $30 on other sites and at salons.</li>

            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed in the scent...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it would not use anything else clean smell .</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;Be all End all&amp;#34; Moisturizer for my whole body!  The avocado oil alone keeps me moisturized all day, so the Argan Oil (MorooccanOil Style) and Olive oil are just a bonus!!  The Oil absorbs in immediately into your skin and it&#x27;s Idiot proof ....you can&#x27;t use too much! I just can&#x27;t emphasize enough how I will never have to buy another moisturizer again!</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan but I regret not buying it on Amazon....I bought it on the Moroccanoil website....they do not take returns!  I looked and there is a very small disclaimer that says they don&#x27;t take returns.  I did not see it when I placed my order...I went back and looked at the disclaimer and it is so hard to miss.  Plus the customer service was not helpful at all....they said for me to give it to someone else.  Who does not take back products if the customer is not satisfied?  I am a product connoisseur and have never had problems returning a product (which is RARELY) if I don&#x27;t like it.  Amazon, Nordstrom, QVC....all take back products from unsatisfied customers.  The smell of the oil bothers me and they won&#x27;t take it back.  I am contacting the BBB.</li>
            <li> Love this product its not too oily just enough to make your skin nice and smooth all day long., its a must buy</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil Dry Body Oil is great for your skin, especially in the wintertime but put on your legs in the summertime for a wonderful shine.</li>
            <li> First, very pricey for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does not moisturize as advertised. The smell is great( exact same as other MO products), hence, my one star rating.  If you have very sensitive and dry skin like mine and looking for a solution, I would stay away from this one. Cheap pharmacy brands work way better.&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using organic coconut oil and, trust me, it does an amazing job for a fraction of the price. Highly recommend and the smell is delicious! Plus you can cook with it as well! :)))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict - NOT WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel. I like it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t provide as much moisture as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is an amazing moisturizer and smells FANTASTIC! The only thing is DON&#x27;T buy it here! The product can be found for around $30 on other sites and at salons.</li>
            <li> unfortunately even when you close it it leaks so all my clothes in my suitcase were stained</li>
            <li> Very happy with my order.Just like the salons.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. It has changed the texture of my fine hair. My hair has been highlighted for many years and I finally feel like the damage is starting to go away.</li>
            <li> Five stars for the smell alone!  For me the scent lasts all day.  I use the shampoo and conditioner as well and that may contribute to the lasting delicious scent!  It moisturizers well enough.  I do wish that it was not so expensive so I do not purchase it all of the time.</li>
            <li> Great fir dry skin, love the subtle smell</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is the best hydration for your skin. If you have someone who is Ill and can&#x27;t get much sun. Moroccanoil</li>
            <li> I use moisturizing oils a lot. Was excited to get this because I love the hair products in the same brand. Somewhat disappointed in the scent...very light and does not last. The oils is more greasy than moisturizing. Product was as seller described, just not as good of a Moroccan product as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I love love love the scent of this - hence the 4 stars. But as far as moisture goes... Not so much. I used it daily and was glad when I finally used it up. It worked best when used with the entire product line.&lt;br /&gt;It does come in a very attractive glass bottle, and absorbed very quickly - not at all greasy!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and the idea of it is great but it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well and it&#x27;s too pricey.</li>
            <li> Love the texture &amp; smell! Perfect for dry AZ winters!</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I hoped for.  I thought it was a bit pricey, however.  Also the packaging didn&#x27;t prevent the oil from leaking even though I could tell the merchant did their best to secure it tightly.  They were happy to give me a small discount because of the leak.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I have used this in the winter for dry skin and in the summer after being in the sun or pool.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fragrance &amp; spray allows for great distribution.</li>
            <li> Very expensive and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got this two weeks ago and its almost gone. I&#x27;m addicted to our and it smells wonderful. I&#x27;m ordering more very soon</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t make an oily mess.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the shampoo.</li>
