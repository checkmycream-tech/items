    <ol>
            <li>but this is the best</li>
            <li>This thing is awesome!</li>
            <li>My legs and underarms are great though!</li>
            <li>Emoji is the best I ever had.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be perfect</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Since the Optima no longer exists I decided to try the Philips Satin Perfect.</li>
            <li>Using this Emjoi epilator is wonderful and I have been using it sucessfully.</li>
            <li>This eRase has the perfect size and shape</li>
            <li>The Emoji Erase does not epilate AS well as the Braun, but its perfectly function</li>
            <li>If this sounds wonderful to you, then read on.  </li>
            <li>Again, I felt using the device after I showered would be the best time.  </li>
            <li>Very good and up to my expectation.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the best and a good deal for what you get.  </li>
            <li>it works, and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>I have not attempted the bikini area but for everything else it&#x27;s been great</li>
            <li>This epilator works great on my legs.</li>
            <li>The eRase is superior to the Satin Perfect, but not as good as the Optima.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Cord is good, but would like it just a bit longer for where my plug in is.</li>
            <li>Happy hair pulling everyone :)</li>
            <li>been using these for years - love them!</li>
            <li>The newest epilator from Emjoi is just what you need to keep your skin looking beautiful in a fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with how quickly I was able to remove the hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li>Is effective if used as the directions instruct.</li>
            <li>and you will end up loving it.</li>
            <li>I use a micro- fiber towelettes shaped liked a glove for washing my face that wash clothes reddened or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the dual-opposed heads and don&#x27;t feel as if they were effective at all.  </li>
            <li>best thing I found on this is that is is so gentle.</li>
            <li>I used to own a Braun Silk Epi 7...</li>
            <li>So I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>so I ordered another Remington Smooth &amp; Silky EP6010 (which works great but hurts a bit more)</li>
            <li>and I find it very easy to take with me on a trip.</li>
            <li>I love LOVE Summer!  </li>
            <li>On my old Braun the trimmer attachment worked well and best of all was &#x27;safe&#x27;...</li>
            <li>It is more time consuming than shaving.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>It worked more like an electric razor to me.</li>
            <li>but it just broke off most of them.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I love it.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi pulls *most</li>
            <li>way better than shaving because i didn&#x27;t get razor</li>
            <li>legs are where I shave the most.  </li>
            <li>So this is where I used the device the most.  </li>
            <li>OK, well we&#x27;ll see how that works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason the hairs in this area are thicker and more stubbly, probably from my shaving them all the time.  </li>
            <li>This was definitely the best combination for me to use.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m pleased with it as a cheap and compact epilator.  </li>
            <li>give the eRase four stars based on its ability to remove more hairs with less pain than the Satin Perfect.</li>
            <li>It is quiet, comfortable, and most importantly - effective!</li>
            <li>It feels nice in my hand, works so great and so much less pain.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job getting the fine facial hair and fuzz.</li>
            <li>So I will continue to use it for my underarms but its kind of iffy to use on my arms and legs because it doesnt seem to do much</li>
            <li>I found this at such a great price and snatched it up.</li>
            <li>Emoji trimmer is not cut free.</li>
            <li>and I am still hair free, YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am still hair free there.  </li>
            <li>This emjoi also didn&#x27;t really hurt when I was using it - probably because it doesn&#x27;t work!!!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Remember to clean blades with this east pop out head with the brush that is included, and use alcohol wipes per directions on blade for oily skin.</li>
            <li>It takes some time getting used to but it is not extremely painful.</li>
            <li>, this doesn&#x27;t make your legs super smooth, since the hair needs to be a certain length before the tweezers can grab it, but it makes your legs look smooth, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>OK, I said it, one of my least favorite beauty tasks is shaving; keeping my legs hair free, my underarms hair free, and of course my bikini area hair free, no unsightly stray hairs, yuck!  </li>
            <li>e60 Epilator is a sleek, small hair removal device that is great for at home hair removal and easy to pack to carry with you while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was dissapointed because at first I thought it worked because my skin was smooth</li>
            <li>I am very aware of what they are, but I have never used one before.  </li>
            <li>what I like so much about it is that is is quick and easy to use</li>
            <li>My first epilator was an Emjoi Optima, which I loved until it broke last year.</li>
            <li>Because of its size, it&#x27;s fast and easy to get into all angles -</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Benefits - efficient, fast, easy to get the hard-to-reach angles</li>
            <li>Great and powerful little tool.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>This is so effective that I now only have my eyebrows waxed.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the time</li>
            <li>and it is totally worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs as well as the last kind I bought.  </li>
            <li>So after I spent a lot of time reading over the instructions on how to use theEmjoi eRase e60 device, and making sure I was 100% sure of how to use it, I began my review process.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the sensitive attachment with the slower speed, I was able to remove some of the hairs, but there were still some visible to me.  </li>
            <li>the Satin Perfect was much less effective at removing hair and much more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how small it is, but now that I&#x27;ve used it I think it&#x27;s the perfect</li>
            <li>Only used twice but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Just be aware if you&#x27;re buying it in part for the trimmer function,  the trimmer can easily cut groin/underarm soft skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>The first time it takes first take some time to get all the hair out,</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>This is my first time with an epilator.  </li>
            <li>It really works as advertised!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t handle this without screaming; it was pretty close to child birth.</li>
            <li>I bought the dual tweezer head version of this the first time over 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>So what if I told you there is a relatively easy, relatively pain-free way to keep your body silky smooth and hair free that can last for up to 6 weeks!!  </li>
            <li>have noticed, however, lesser pain than with my previous epilator, which is always good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for your arms and legs, but you have to do them in small areas at a time.</li>
            <li>My single head braun epilator gets 3 times more hair out by the root.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re only looking to use it for fine body hair</li>
            <li>My pain tolerance is pretty high; in my opinion it stung a bit</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>It did not hurt as much as I thought it would...</li>
            <li>But, my hair grows fast; hair on my head and my body.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much hair on my face.  </li>
            <li>I want it gone fast, so I chose to use the faster setting mode on the device.  </li>
            <li>The old one would rrrrrip the hairs right out 1-2 passes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a red head and following directions to clean your skin of any oils is important.</li>
            <li>I loved it and only had to replace the head once due to a tooth breaking off on a head.</li>
            <li>You see I have very sensitive skin and break out easily with regular razors.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly small, yet highly effective.</li>
            <li>Again, I have dark hair, so they show more</li>
            <li>I was ready to return this when I saw its size - it&#x27;s smaller than the first 3.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I found that positioning the device correctly is key to comfort and success.  </li>
            <li>but when I got a good look at it the hair was just broken off.</li>
            <li>It pulls all the hairs without having to go back over a hundred times and hurts a lot less than my old Remington Smooth &amp; Silky full size epilator.</li>
            <li>The middle foil section worked fine getting short hair shorter, but the trimmer edges are still a hazard when you have soft skin nearby.  </li>
            <li>It cleans pretty short hear.</li>
            <li>Without the plastic - I&#x27;d still be on my first or second one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than my original with the same size tweezer head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;OK, sensitive area of conversation, yes?!  </li>
            <li>and so far I have not had to use the razor!  </li>
            <li>This is my 4th Emjoi epilator in 14 yrs, and by far the smallest - but easily did the quickest work and less pain than others.  </li>
            <li>I found that the hairs on my legs were so few and far between and so fine in gauge, that I was able to glide the device over my legs and feel very little tugging or discomfort.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use the sensitive attachment for this area of my body, because let&#x27;s face it, it is a sensitive area!  </li>
            <li>about half an hour a week and very worth it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest starting from a less hairy area then work your way to the more dense spots that way you will get used to the feeling.</li>
            <li>Personally, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think.</li>
            <li>The upper lip not so much.</li>
            <li>On previous Emjoi (my favorite was the Optima - but it&#x27;s discontinued; eRase is like a mini-Optima) products, I had to go over the same spot several times - with the eRase, it was about 2-3x, then done.  </li>
            <li>I usually tweeze my upper lip and underarms, but this did most of the job.</li>
            <li>(tweezers sit slightly above the top and extend a little outside the edges) to get all the angles and places I &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; on my legs and bikini line.  </li>
            <li>It is too harsh on parts of the face to go full force.  </li>
            <li>I do not have a lot of hair on them, but my hair is dark, so when I do have hair grow out, I want it gone, gone right away.  </li>
            <li>I felt a little pulling of the hair, but again, just a slight stinging sensation which lasted a second, then I got used to it and was so pleased with the results that the slight pain was quickly forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My upper lip skin is too sensitive for the eRase e60</li>
            <li>it was made in such a way it couldn&#x27;t cut you, even when using it on soft curved parts of your body below the waist.</li>
            <li>I thought about using a razor to remove the rest, but decided to hold off, and try again the next day without using the sensitive attachment and also user the faster speed.  </li>
            <li>I was able to remove the rest of the hairs, with just a little bit of tugging and pulling which I did feel some slight pain and stinging.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller, but you do it quickly and there&#x27;s less re-angling because of all the places you can go with its smaller size.  </li>
            <li>So I pulled my skin tight with my left and, with my right hand holding the device facing my skin, glided it along using the slower speed.  </li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s just me not used to how the epilator head is set up (parallel tweezers instead of 1 big row of tweezers on the old one).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I am not a very hairy person, hahaaa, that sounds strange to say, but there are some women who are very hairy!  </li>
            <li>Generally, epilators will hurt - especially the first time, but now it just feels like a little sting and afterwards my legs are tingly</li>
            <li>A slight stinging sensation is how I would describe the discomfort, but it went away almost just as fast as it was felt.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Benefits - efficient, fast, easy to get the hard-to-reach angles</li>
            <li> Great and powerful little tool.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> This is so effective that I now only have my eyebrows waxed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the time</li>
            <li> and it is totally worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs as well as the last kind I bought.  </li>
            <li> So after I spent a lot of time reading over the instructions on how to use theEmjoi eRase e60 device, and making sure I was 100% sure of how to use it, I began my review process.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the sensitive attachment with the slower speed, I was able to remove some of the hairs, but there were still some visible to me.  </li>
            <li> the Satin Perfect was much less effective at removing hair and much more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small it is, but now that I&#x27;ve used it I think it&#x27;s the perfect</li>
            <li> Only used twice but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Just be aware if you&#x27;re buying it in part for the trimmer function,  the trimmer can easily cut groin/underarm soft skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> The first time it takes first take some time to get all the hair out,</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> This is my first time with an epilator.  </li>
            <li> It really works as advertised!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle this without screaming; it was pretty close to child birth.</li>
            <li> I bought the dual tweezer head version of this the first time over 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> So what if I told you there is a relatively easy, relatively pain-free way to keep your body silky smooth and hair free that can last for up to 6 weeks!!  </li>
            <li> have noticed, however, lesser pain than with my previous epilator, which is always good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for your arms and legs, but you have to do them in small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> My single head braun epilator gets 3 times more hair out by the root.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re only looking to use it for fine body hair</li>
            <li> My pain tolerance is pretty high; in my opinion it stung a bit</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> It did not hurt as much as I thought it would...</li>
            <li> But, my hair grows fast; hair on my head and my body.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much hair on my face.  </li>
            <li> I want it gone fast, so I chose to use the faster setting mode on the device.  </li>
            <li> The old one would rrrrrip the hairs right out 1-2 passes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a red head and following directions to clean your skin of any oils is important.</li>
            <li> I loved it and only had to replace the head once due to a tooth breaking off on a head.</li>
            <li> You see I have very sensitive skin and break out easily with regular razors.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly small, yet highly effective.</li>
            <li> Again, I have dark hair, so they show more</li>
            <li> I was ready to return this when I saw its size - it&#x27;s smaller than the first 3.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I found that positioning the device correctly is key to comfort and success.  </li>
            <li> but when I got a good look at it the hair was just broken off.</li>
            <li> It pulls all the hairs without having to go back over a hundred times and hurts a lot less than my old Remington Smooth &amp; Silky full size epilator.</li>
            <li> The middle foil section worked fine getting short hair shorter, but the trimmer edges are still a hazard when you have soft skin nearby.  </li>
            <li> It cleans pretty short hear.</li>
            <li> Without the plastic - I&#x27;d still be on my first or second one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than my original with the same size tweezer head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OK, sensitive area of conversation, yes?!  </li>
            <li> and so far I have not had to use the razor!  </li>
            <li> This is my 4th Emjoi epilator in 14 yrs, and by far the smallest - but easily did the quickest work and less pain than others.  </li>
            <li> I found that the hairs on my legs were so few and far between and so fine in gauge, that I was able to glide the device over my legs and feel very little tugging or discomfort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use the sensitive attachment for this area of my body, because let&#x27;s face it, it is a sensitive area!  </li>
            <li> about half an hour a week and very worth it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest starting from a less hairy area then work your way to the more dense spots that way you will get used to the feeling.</li>
            <li> Personally, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think.</li>
            <li> The upper lip not so much.</li>
            <li> On previous Emjoi (my favorite was the Optima - but it&#x27;s discontinued; eRase is like a mini-Optima) products, I had to go over the same spot several times - with the eRase, it was about 2-3x, then done.  </li>
            <li> I usually tweeze my upper lip and underarms, but this did most of the job.</li>
            <li> (tweezers sit slightly above the top and extend a little outside the edges) to get all the angles and places I &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; on my legs and bikini line.  </li>
            <li> It is too harsh on parts of the face to go full force.  </li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of hair on them, but my hair is dark, so when I do have hair grow out, I want it gone, gone right away.  </li>
            <li> I felt a little pulling of the hair, but again, just a slight stinging sensation which lasted a second, then I got used to it and was so pleased with the results that the slight pain was quickly forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My upper lip skin is too sensitive for the eRase e60</li>
            <li> it was made in such a way it couldn&#x27;t cut you, even when using it on soft curved parts of your body below the waist.</li>
            <li> I thought about using a razor to remove the rest, but decided to hold off, and try again the next day without using the sensitive attachment and also user the faster speed.  </li>
            <li> I was able to remove the rest of the hairs, with just a little bit of tugging and pulling which I did feel some slight pain and stinging.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller, but you do it quickly and there&#x27;s less re-angling because of all the places you can go with its smaller size.  </li>
            <li> So I pulled my skin tight with my left and, with my right hand holding the device facing my skin, glided it along using the slower speed.  </li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s just me not used to how the epilator head is set up (parallel tweezers instead of 1 big row of tweezers on the old one).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am not a very hairy person, hahaaa, that sounds strange to say, but there are some women who are very hairy!  </li>
            <li> Generally, epilators will hurt - especially the first time, but now it just feels like a little sting and afterwards my legs are tingly</li>
            <li> A slight stinging sensation is how I would describe the discomfort, but it went away almost just as fast as it was felt.  </li>
            <li> Not as fast as my original &amp;#34;Simply Gold Caress&amp;#34; which is over 10 years old and the cord is finally going bad.</li>
            <li> One of the most interesting aspects of this Emoji is that it actually cuts down on how fast the hair grows back by weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Woman who are use to having lip area and chin waxed can use the highest setting as it&#x27;s less painful than waxing, in fact my skin is frail and they had to switch from liquid wax to hard wax.</li>
            <li> I usually shave them twice a week, again, I do not have that much hair under my arms, but enough that I want to shave them so no hairs are visible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said this, there are a few negatives for this particular model.</li>
            <li> For those stray hairs that do not look pretty when you are strutting around in your bikini.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely not without pain, but minor pain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long lasting results</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to move the switch to 1st speed, it wants to just go to 2nd speed.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it is SMALL!</li>
            <li> But, at the same time I do have a normal amount of hair where it usually is, my underarms, my legs and my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> (1st - slow, 2nd fast)  </li>
            <li> Yes, you can invest just a little time, a little effort, and deal with a little bit of temporary discomfort to ensure you are hair free all summer long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now to see how long it will be until I have to use the e60 again on my legs.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while, but this little guy has guts!  </li>
            <li> * of the hair on my face and only about half on my neck.</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward to hold, I wish it had indentations as to have a better grip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downfalls - plastic gears (look to get 3-4 years before they start slipping and/or break on you)</li>
            <li> I bought this partially for the epilator head, but also partially for the shaver head.  </li>
            <li> I spent about 5 minutes on each leg.  </li>
            <li> I really do not have any hair there</li>
            <li> I spent about 4 minutes on each side.  </li>
            <li> People are afraid to use it on the bikini line, I used mine there, and yes, it will hurt a bit, but totally worth the results!</li>
            <li> There is just no comparison to other</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised it took about 26 min to do both legs past my knees and my very tight bikini line.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s smaller, it also pulls less hairs at once, so the pain is a little less.  </li>
            <li> The second negative is related to the first, for a machine so small it is relatively expensive, in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The epilator portion works well, but the trimmer is not safe to use on non flat surfaces - the edges cut you!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Like I said, it hurts less than my other one did</li>
            <li> I probably used I for over half an hour trying to get all the hair</li>
            <li> I like this epilator, although I was hoping it&#x27;d grab hair with less effort.</li>
            <li> Well that one broke after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> And, I used the e60 after I had taken a shower so my skin was exfoliated and the hair follicles were moistened which made removing the hair a lot less</li>
            <li> The edges are really sharp and not protected in some way, so on my first attempt to use it on my bikini line, i ended up with a bunch of painful nicks, and also a few on my under arms.</li>
            <li> BUT after a few uses you start to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I did my legs over the course of a few days and it works.</li>
            <li> There were still a few stray stubborn hairs that needed to be tweezed out</li>
            <li> I have dropped it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Again, it lasted just a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Emjoi epilators seem to beat the competition hands down (at least the Emjoi dual-opposed head designs).</li>
            <li> Very little hair breakage though.</li>
            <li> As much as I really wanted to like this, it was just too painful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just doing small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is small, yet</li>
            <li> I took just a small amount off because the Emjoi is so so small.</li>
            <li> I looked online and the same model was too expensive for me</li>
            <li> not sure what the work around is...</li>
            <li> You have to work hard to get the hairs out Works</li>
            <li> I used the sensitive guard and it was still painful and for all the pain it gave me ...</li>
            <li> at least epilation pain  is ephemeral...</li>
            <li> There are 2 settings on the e60 and for me slow is not how I want to remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> Unless you specifically need a very small epiliator.</li>
            <li> It worked on my upper lip hair, but the pain was bad</li>
            <li> It is almost awkward to use due to its smallness.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, and waxing seems like a giant pain in the ass, so</li>
            <li> I am sort of addicted now.</li>
            <li> im just addicted to pain.</li>
            <li> It isnt extremely painful but it does hurt a little.</li>
            <li> that might be weird.</li>
            <li> but nothing painful like child birth.</li>
            <li> and it was so painful.</li>
            <li> thing that has really disappointed me about it is the trimmer part.  </li>
            <li> a bit annoying but</li>
            <li> I hate HATE shaving!  </li>
            <li> I was expecting the worst, you know, that feeling when you pluck a hair from your eyebrows,</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good I test others but this is the best</li>
            <li> Is effective if used as the directions instruct. It is definitely not without pain, but minor pain. It is more time consuming than shaving. I like using it on my underarms though for no &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Personally, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think. It takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s long lasting results</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! This is my first epilator so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it seems to work really well. To all the people giving 1 star reviews saying &amp;#34;it hurts!&amp;#34;: well of course it hurts! All epilators are going to hurt, you&#x27;re ripping your hair out! BUT after a few uses you start to get used to it. I did my legs over the course of a few days and it works. I hate shaving, and waxing seems like a giant pain in the ass, so I like this because it&#x27;s convenient and I can use it anywhere. No muss no fuss! I was surprised at how small it is, but now that I&#x27;ve used it I think it&#x27;s the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this doesn&#x27;t make your legs super smooth, since the hair needs to be a certain length before the tweezers can grab it, but it makes your legs look smooth, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator. It did not hurt as much as I thought it would... I would suggest starting from a less hairy area then work your way to the more dense spots that way you will get used to the feeling. I am sort of addicted now. In the beginning I did it every 2-3 days until I got all of it and then it lasted longer till I had to epilate again.</li>
            <li> 1. ONLY BUY A CORDED UNIT.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; thing, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;2. Not as fast as my original &amp;#34;Simply Gold Caress&amp;#34; which is over 10 years old and the cord is finally going bad. And I cant find a replacement cord, so I bought this one.  I just need to get used to it I guess. The old one would rrrrrip the hairs right out 1-2 passes. This one, I have to go over the same spot again and again...maybe it&#x27;s just me not used to how the epilator head is set up (parallel tweezers instead of 1 big row of tweezers on the old one).&lt;br /&gt;But it works, and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you dont wax or tweeze regularly it&#x27;ll definitely hurt. i don&#x27;t have alot of hair but enough to say this thing is aaddictive or msybe im just addicted to pain. I tried it on my face well my cheeks and yes it tweezer hurt but nothing painful like child birth. I say get it try it a couple times if you have to get before waxing spray do it and you will end up loving it. So convenient and you dont have to constantly buy wax, get waxed or tweeze.</li>
            <li> Very good and up to my expectation.</li>
            <li> The eRase e60 worked well on my lower legs. The upper lip not so much. It worked on my upper lip hair, but the pain was bad and I couldn&#x27;t stop sneezing. My upper lip skin is too sensitive for the eRase e60 I now have a rash on my upper lip. My legs and underarms are great though! Very little hair breakage though.</li>
            <li> It isnt extremely painful but it does hurt a little. I was dissapointed because at first I thought it worked because my skin was smooth but when I got a good look at it the hair was just broken off.Some were plucked out but the majority was there. It worked more like an electric razor to me. I probably used I for over half an hour trying to get all the hair but it just broke off most of them. But I do have to say that it worked well for my underarms for some wierd reason. So I will continue to use it for my underarms but its kind of iffy to use on my arms and legs because it doesnt seem to do much</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a couple off month. Emoji is the best I ever had. It cleans pretty short hear. I use it only for my legs, I think it&#x27;s would work for any parts of the body.</li>
            <li> You have to work hard to get the hairs out Works ok. Will keep it. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is so effective that I now only have my eyebrows waxed. One of the most interesting aspects of this Emoji is that it actually cuts down on how fast the hair grows back by weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Woman who are use to having lip area and chin waxed can use the highest setting as it&#x27;s less painful than waxing, in fact my skin is frail and they had to switch from liquid wax to hard wax. I&#x27;m a red head and following directions to clean your skin of any oils is important. I use a micro- fiber towelettes shaped liked a glove for washing my face that wash clothes reddened or irritate my skin. Hold skin taut and in front of a lighted close up mirror do section by section. Remember to clean blades with this east pop out head with the brush that is included, and use alcohol wipes per directions on blade for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works well. Never can get enough of it.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I love it. I usually tweeze my upper lip and underarms, but this did most of the job. There were still a few stray stubborn hairs that needed to be tweezed out but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be perfect so I&#x27;m not disappointed. My pain tolerance is pretty high; in my opinion it stung a bit but it&#x27;s worth the time (tweezing) and money (waxing) saved. It&#x27;s also good for your arms and legs, but you have to do them in small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> Great and powerful little tool. It takes some time getting used to but it is not extremely painful. I will definitely recommend and my legs have never been smoother! I have used it in the under arm and it is totally worth the discomfort. The first time it takes first take some time to get all the hair out, after that it&#x27;s just maintenance about half an hour a week and very worth it. I have not attempted the bikini area but for everything else it&#x27;s been great It will not remove 100% of the hair but it will take about 80 to 90% This is my first epilator and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while, but this little guy has guts!  One thing, if you want to use it on your face, please read the instructions!  It is too harsh on parts of the face to go full force.  People are afraid to use it on the bikini line, I used mine there, and yes, it will hurt a bit, but totally worth the results!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi e Rase e60 Tweezer Head Epilator works like a charm.  It removes the hair from the legs and underarms with no discomfort.  I like the in use power supply instead of battery.  There is no reduction in power.</li>
            <li> I like this epilator, although I was hoping it&#x27;d grab hair with less effort. I still have to run it on the same spot several times and it&#x27;ll miss some hairs (nothing too concerning), which, with the amount of tweezers it has, one would think it wouldn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed, however, lesser pain than with my previous epilator, which is always good!</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator on my underarms and bikini line for about eight years. My first epilator was an Emjoi Optima, which I loved until it broke last year. Since the Optima no longer exists I decided to try the Philips Satin Perfect. The difference was noticeable: the Satin Perfect was much less effective at removing hair and much more uncomfortable. I decided to keep it for a year and then go back to Emjoi. The eRase is superior to the Satin Perfect, but not as good as the Optima.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the eRase four stars based on its ability to remove more hairs with less pain than the Satin Perfect. Emjoi epilators seem to beat the competition hands down (at least the Emjoi dual-opposed head designs). There is just no comparison to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said this, there are a few negatives for this particular model. First and foremost, it is SMALL! I am convinced that the photo of the woman holding the eRase on the box has been photoshopped. It is almost awkward to use due to its smallness. If you want to use this for your legs you might want to consider a larger Emjoi model. The second negative is related to the first, for a machine so small it is relatively expensive, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this model for people who need epilation on their underarms or bikini line. It is quiet, comfortable, and most importantly - effective! I wanted an epilator that gets the job done, and this one does.</li>
            <li> Getting used to this.  This is my first time with an epilator.  It is a little awkward to hold, I wish it had indentations as to have a better grip. I have dropped it a few times.  Otherwise it&#x27;s lightweight.  Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to move the switch to 1st speed, it wants to just go to 2nd speed. (1st - slow, 2nd fast)  It seems to get the job done.  I&#x27;m just doing small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs as well as the last kind I bought.  It seems to break the hairs instead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the dual-opposed heads and don&#x27;t feel as if they were effective at all.  My single head braun epilator gets 3 times more hair out by the root.  This emjoi also didn&#x27;t really hurt when I was using it - probably because it doesn&#x27;t work!!!  I&#x27;m sticking with my braun.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but it does work. My hair growth came back within 2 weeks. But, my hair grows fast; hair on my head and my body.</li>
            <li> Using this Emjoi epilator is wonderful and I have been using it sucessfully. Yes, it is small, yet what I like so much about it is that is is quick and easy to use and I find it very easy to take with me on a trip. (In the box with this is a white zipped pouch carrying case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****The best thing I found on this is that is is so gentle. You see I have very sensitive skin and break out easily with regular razors. With this unit, I have not had any breakouts or discomfort--my skin is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi was sent to me for testing and reviewing. After testing, I rate it at 4.8 stars rounded off to 5.0 stars. I took just a small amount off because the Emjoi is so so small. It really works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly small, yet highly effective. Only used twice but so far so good. Does a great job getting the fine facial hair and fuzz. Cord is good, but would like it just a bit longer for where my plug in is. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> been using these for years - love them!</li>
            <li> This thing works, but you have to endure lots of pain, and it takes a while to get the hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle this without screaming; it was pretty close to child birth. I used the sensitive guard and it was still painful and for all the pain it gave me ... I still have hair under my arms. It literally feels like your skin is being ripped off. I can&#x27;t imagine putting this on my face.  As much as I really wanted to like this, it was just too painful so I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Emjoi epilator in 14 yrs, and by far the smallest - but easily did the quickest work and less pain than others.  I was ready to return this when I saw its size - it&#x27;s smaller than the first 3.  Because of its size, it&#x27;s fast and easy to get into all angles - I was pleasantly surprised it took about 26 min to do both legs past my knees and my very tight bikini line.  I&#x27;m sold!  I will always stick with Emjoi brand.  They&#x27;re the best and a good deal for what you get.  Each one has lasted me about 4 years - and their downfall is the plastic gears inside.  Without the plastic - I&#x27;d still be on my first or second one.  This eRase has the perfect size and shape (tweezers sit slightly above the top and extend a little outside the edges) to get all the angles and places I &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; on my legs and bikini line.  It&#x27;s smaller, but you do it quickly and there&#x27;s less re-angling because of all the places you can go with its smaller size.  On previous Emjoi (my favorite was the Optima - but it&#x27;s discontinued; eRase is like a mini-Optima) products, I had to go over the same spot several times - with the eRase, it was about 2-3x, then done.  Because it&#x27;s smaller, it also pulls less hairs at once, so the pain is a little less.  Generally, epilators will hurt - especially the first time, but now it just feels like a little sting and afterwards my legs are tingly and it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Benefits - efficient, fast, easy to get the hard-to-reach angles&lt;br /&gt;Downfalls - plastic gears (look to get 3-4 years before they start slipping and/or break on you)</li>
            <li> Pass on this. Unless you specifically need a very small epiliator.</li>
            <li> This epilator works great on my legs. It pulls all the hairs without having to go back over a hundred times and hurts a lot less than my old Remington Smooth &amp; Silky full size epilator. However, I have PCOS which causes coarse hair to grow on my face and neck. The Emjoi pulls *most* of the hair on my face and only about half on my neck. Like I said, it hurts less than my other one did so I ordered another Remington Smooth &amp; Silky EP6010 (which works great but hurts a bit more) and I&#x27;m going to use them in conjunction. If you&#x27;re only looking to use it for fine body hair this is the epilator for you! But if you have coarse hair spend the extra money for the Remington EP6010. Happy hair pulling everyone :)</li>
            <li> Works well but hurts alot.</li>
            <li> I bought the dual tweezer head version of this the first time over 15 years ago. I loved it and only had to replace the head once due to a tooth breaking off on a head. I used it till it died two years ago. I looked online and the same model was too expensive for me so I cheapped out and got a Remington at the local walgreens. BIG MISTAKE! One tweezer head no guard and left scratched up skin and it was so painful. Well that one broke after a year and a half. Almost a blessing actually. I found this at such a great price and snatched it up. It&#x27;s smaller than my original with the same size tweezer head. It feels nice in my hand, works so great and so much less pain.  Even in...delicate areas. I would recommend this to everyone. I&#x27;d buy it as a gift for my lady friends but.. that might be weird.</li>
            <li> It never worked.  I can&#x27;t figure it out.  It was my error in not sending it back.</li>
            <li> I bought this partially for the epilator head, but also partially for the shaver head.  When i bought this Emoji i was hoping to get both an epilator for my legs and a trimmer for my bikini area....  The epilator portion works well, but the trimmer is not safe to use on non flat surfaces - the edges cut you!&lt;br /&gt; I used to own a Braun Silk Epi 7...the big waterproof cordless model. The Emoji Erase does not epilate AS well as the Braun, but its perfectly function and i&#x27;m pleased with it as a cheap and compact epilator.  It is not cordless..it has no internal battery so it must be plugged in to use it...a bit annoying but manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that has really disappointed me about it is the trimmer part.  On my old Braun the trimmer attachment worked well and best of all was &#x27;safe&#x27;...it was made in such a way it couldn&#x27;t cut you, even when using it on soft curved parts of your body below the waist. In fact it was how i exclusively trimmed my bikini line for three years...way better than shaving because i didn&#x27;t get razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emoji trimmer is not cut free. The edges are really sharp and not protected in some way, so on my first attempt to use it on my bikini line, i ended up with a bunch of painful nicks, and also a few on my under arms. The middle foil section worked fine getting short hair shorter, but the trimmer edges are still a hazard when you have soft skin nearby.  The epilator head has a cover piece that covers the edges exposing a middle strip for bikini line, but the trimmer doesnt have a protective cover for the edges of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the work around is...i might put duct tape over the edges.  Just be aware if you&#x27;re buying it in part for the trimmer function,  the trimmer can easily cut groin/underarm soft skin.  I may start trying the epilator part on my bikini area with the cover...at least epilation pain  is ephemeral...cuts take a while to heal.</li>
            <li> I love LOVE Summer!  I hate HATE shaving!  OK, I said it, one of my least favorite beauty tasks is shaving; keeping my legs hair free, my underarms hair free, and of course my bikini area hair free, no unsightly stray hairs, yuck!  So what if I told you there is a relatively easy, relatively pain-free way to keep your body silky smooth and hair free that can last for up to 6 weeks!!  Yes, you can invest just a little time, a little effort, and deal with a little bit of temporary discomfort to ensure you are hair free all summer long.  If this sounds wonderful to you, then read on.  The newest epilator from Emjoi is just what you need to keep your skin looking beautiful in a fabulous.  The Emjoi eRase e60 Epilator is a sleek, small hair removal device that is great for at home hair removal and easy to pack to carry with you while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY THOUGHTS:&lt;br /&gt;OK, I am a newbie with epilators.  I am very aware of what they are, but I have never used one before.  I am not a very hairy person, hahaaa, that sounds strange to say, but there are some women who are very hairy!  But, at the same time I do have a normal amount of hair where it usually is, my underarms, my legs and my bikini area.  I don&#x27;t have much hair on my face.  So after I spent a lot of time reading over the instructions on how to use theEmjoi eRase e60 device, and making sure I was 100% sure of how to use it, I began my review process.  Here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LEGS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs are where I shave the most.  I do not have a lot of hair on them, but my hair is dark, so when I do have hair grow out, I want it gone, gone right away.  So this is where I used the device the most.  There are 2 settings on the e60 and for me slow is not how I want to remove the hair.  I want it gone fast, so I chose to use the faster setting mode on the device.  I was expecting the worst, you know, that feeling when you pluck a hair from your eyebrows, well, that is what I expectedto feel on my legs, times 100!  But that was not the case.  I found that the hairs on my legs were so few and far between and so fine in gauge, that I was able to glide the device over my legs and feel very little tugging or discomfort.  A slight stinging sensation is how I would describe the discomfort, but it went away almost just as fast as it was felt.  I am very impressed with how quickly I was able to remove the hair on my legs.  I spent about 5 minutes on each leg.  And, I used the e60 after I had taken a shower so my skin was exfoliated and the hair follicles were moistened which made removing the hair a lot less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to see how long it will be until I have to use the e60 again on my legs.  It has been 2 1/2 weeks since I used it and I am still hair free, YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNDERARMS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I used the e60 on my underarms.  I usually shave them twice a week, again, I do not have that much hair under my arms, but enough that I want to shave them so no hairs are visible.  Again, I felt using the device after I showered would be the best time.  So that is when I used the device on this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that positioning the device correctly is key to comfort and success.  My skin is relatively taunt, so I found this to be the easiest of areas to remove hair.  It took about 2 minutes for each underarm.  I felt a little pulling of the hair, but again, just a slight stinging sensation which lasted a second, then I got used to it and was so pleased with the results that the slight pain was quickly forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 1/2 weeks since I used the e60 on my underarms and I am still hair free there.  Again, wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not used the e60 on my face.  I really do not have any hair there so there was no need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIKINI AREA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, sensitive area of conversation, yes?!  Well, this is &amp;#34;G&amp;#34; rated I promise!  I only used the e60 on the areas outside of my privateareas, along the edges of the tops of my legs where the panty line ends and the skin begins.  For those stray hairs that do not look pretty when you are strutting around in your bikini.  Again, I have dark hair, so they show more so I want them gone, to disappear, forever!  OK, well we&#x27;ll see how that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use the sensitive attachment for this area of my body, because let&#x27;s face it, it is a sensitive area!  I was so nervous, because even shaving that area give me goose bumps.  So I pulled my skin tight with my left and, with my right hand holding the device facing my skin, glided it along using the slower speed.  For some reason the hairs in this area are thicker and more stubbly, probably from my shaving them all the time.  And, they always grow back, grrrrrr.  So I found this area of my body to be the most difficult to use the device on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the sensitive attachment with the slower speed, I was able to remove some of the hairs, but there were still some visible to me.  I thought about using a razor to remove the rest, but decided to hold off, and try again the next day without using the sensitive attachment and also user the faster speed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next day I went at it again.  I spent about 4 minutes on each side.  This was definitely the best combination for me to use.  The faster speed, and without any attachments.  I was able to remove the rest of the hairs, with just a little bit of tugging and pulling which I did feel some slight pain and stinging.  Again, it lasted just a few seconds.  And, I was hair free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 weeks since I did this and so far I have not had to use the razor!  So I am thrilled.</li>
