            <li>Sodial (R) Plastic Teeth Comb Hairband is awesome.  </li>
            <li>The best hairband I have found</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Great product for great price.</li>
            <li>Great headband....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good one for money</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt my head, holds my hair good.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>it just ok, it&#x27;s too lose for my head!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>Very easy to slide on and off, does not pull hair.</li>
            <li>This is very cheap, and the plastic nubs that hold it in the mold had to be filed off.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to receive it.  :)</li>
            <li>Wish it came in more colors.</li>
            <li>Price could not be better.</li>
            <li>I re-ordered four more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li>and I have bought many.</li>
            <li>It seems ok for me.</li>
            <li>Seems more flexible so it might not break as easily as some others.  </li>
            <li>Most comfortable head band I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>plastic combs break off easily...</li>
            <li>Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it slides out a couple of times a day</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and this headband stays in place and also gives my hair some lift.  </li>
            <li>A true no headache head band.</li>
            <li>This one is VERY COMFORTABLE, keeps hair back without putting pressure on my head.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much for the headband.</li>
            <li>Also, the teeth provide hair (even very straight hair) with a lot of texture.  </li>
            <li>It also is easy to wear glasses with and the teeth to hold your hair back.</li>
            <li>didnt really like the item</li>
            <li>This headband is just weird and dosnt look good in my opinion!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold tightly and is very light, almost like it&#x27;s going to break when putting it in.</li>
            <li>Takes a LONG time to deliver from Hong Kong, but worth it.</li>
            <li>However, the sodial does exactly as it describes, it pulls your hair back and does not pinch.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised, I am not hard on my hair care products yet this just didnt make it.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, and arrived early.</li>
            <li>FOR AN ADULT HEAD TO WEAR.</li>
            <li>Took a few weeks to ship to me from China but for the cheap price of $1.88, that was no problem.</li>
            <li>So far it didn&#x27;t hurt even if you wear it the whole day, but it made out of plastic and the teet broke off less than 1 month used</li>
            <li>very small - Im only 5&#x27; 4&amp;#34; and this doesnt fit properly.</li>

            <li> THIS HAIRBAND IS MUCH TOO SMALL</li>
            <li> very loose.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple other headbands, but they were harder and had ends that hurt my head.  </li>
            <li> i have extremely thick hair and have been searching for a headband that holds it back.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, but comb is very small and thin plastic.  </li>
            <li> This headband is still a bit less heavy and sturdy than I would like</li>
            <li> I got it from China where the majority are very tiny &amp; too thin, maybe it fits them</li>
            <li> Totally waste of money</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found a headband that stays in place, and is not too tight!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried non- &amp;#34;pinching&amp;#34; hairbands, but those can&#x27;t hold my hair back and are useless.  </li>
            <li> Cannot wear daily , hair get stuck into those pins and find very difficult to pull out.</li>
            <li> one of the dent was broken.</li>
            <li> When I took it off, I was heart broken.  </li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> So sorry to say this headband broke after one use.</li>
            <li> Never arrived, Just a metal band terrible</li>

            <li> one of the dent was broken. and it is brittle.</li>
            <li> didnt really like the item</li>
            <li> Never arrived, Just a metal band terrible</li>
            <li> But it broke.  I wore it 1 day.  When I took it off, I was heart broken.  Most comfortable head band I have ever worn.  The company is sending me another one.  I can&#x27;t wait to receive it.  :)</li>
            <li> Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap!</li>

            <li> A true no headache head band. It looks flexible enough to not break taking it off your head. It also is easy to wear glasses with and the teeth to hold your hair back. Price could not be better. I re-ordered four more.</li>
            <li> Am wearing it today. Very easy to slide on and off, does not pull hair. I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li> The best hairband I have found and I have bought many.</li>

            <li> THIS HAIRBAND IS MUCH TOO SMALL FOR AN ADULT HEAD TO WEAR.</li>
            <li> plastic combs break off easily...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found a headband that stays in place, and is not too tight!  For this price, it is a super-bargain!!!</li>
            <li> So far it didn&#x27;t hurt even if you wear it the whole day, but it made out of plastic and the teet broke off less than 1 month used</li>
            <li> Took forever to get it but It&#x27;s nice. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my head, holds my hair good. Looks nice. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get.</li>
            <li> It seems ok for me. Cannot wear daily , hair get stuck into those pins and find very difficult to pull out.</li>
            <li> it just ok, it&#x27;s too lose for my head!</li>
            <li> This is very cheap, and the plastic nubs that hold it in the mold had to be filed off. Not great.</li>

            <li> very loose. I have fine hair and it slides out a couple of times a day</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and this headband stays in place and also gives my hair some lift.  Seems more flexible so it might not break as easily as some others.  Only drawback is that I wish it were from USA instead of China.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the headband.</li>
            <li> So sorry to say this headband broke after one use. I was surprised, I am not hard on my hair care products yet this just didnt make it.</li>
            <li> Great headband....I love it!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I like to pull back my bangs, but I don&#x27;t like how hairbands give me the &amp;#34;hairband headaches&amp;#34; when they pinch.  I&#x27;ve tried non- &amp;#34;pinching&amp;#34; hairbands, but those can&#x27;t hold my hair back and are useless.  However, the sodial does exactly as it describes, it pulls your hair back and does not pinch.  Also, the teeth provide hair (even very straight hair) with a lot of texture.  If you have highlights in your hair, it will definitely showcase them.</li>
            <li> i have extremely thick hair and have been searching for a headband that holds it back.
