            <li>Great product and I am really happy with the product.</li>
            <li>BUT WHAT I RECEIVED WAS&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;PUNK&amp;#34; NOT AS GOOD</li>
            <li>smells good.</li>
            <li>good size.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>holds strong, good product!</li>
            <li>I love this hair gel!</li>
            <li>I ALSO LOVE HOW IT SMELLS!</li>
            <li>And who doesn&#x27;t love the name?!</li>
            <li>The hold is amazing.</li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT &amp;#34;EXTREME HOLD&amp;#34; WAS A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hold is very strong and even after sweating it stays put.</li>
            <li>This is the best product to use on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>As for my own opinion, this is my favorite gel.</li>
            <li>But either way, I love it and they do too.  </li>
            <li>They get a kick out of telling people they have gorilla snot in their hair :)</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>love my Moco</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really love this product</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Best part, no flakes or any white residue.</li>
            <li>I love the snot-like tacky/elasticity of this product.</li>
            <li>Please make sure that you apply it to clean hair and don&#x27;t apply it over or with another gel because it will look like you have sand in your hair.  </li>
            <li>It holds for over 24hrs and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>But if you are a busy person this is good, just make sure you wash it out.</li>
            <li>Fantastic delivery time.</li>
            <li>Has a light smell nothing overpowering.  </li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>what kind of gel I use, I have trouble finding a strong enough gel that doesn&#x27;t flake, but now that I use moco my hair is perfect!</li>
            <li>and the bright yellow colour!</li>
            <li>If you are not that picky about your hair you can even just put some in really quickly and let it work and go.</li>
            <li>its a fun thing to play with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely Luv this product!</li>
            <li>I have two boys, 4 and 7, with the craziest cowlicks and stick straight hair.  </li>
            <li>My husband is really content with this product.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t use too much because it will get flaky if you use to much.</li>
            <li>Holds very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most sure-fire hair holder I&#x27;ve used, other than the Elmers Glue I used on my Mohawk when I was 18.</li>
            <li>I tried different types of geld and hair products that had a strong hold but most left a white residue or didn&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
            <li>We LOVE this gel for our little boy.</li>
            <li>While stylists live to run their fingers through it, it won&#x27;t stay in place for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>I found it holds better when I apply it dry or with wet hands.  </li>
            <li>Great for a firm but not rock hard hold.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if anybody else was too.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I have to admit that this gel can hold ANY type of hair down, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for freshly permed hair</li>
            <li>This holds my hair very well, too much will result on it being flaky when dried though,</li>
            <li>It was always hard to do anything with their hair besides a long bowl cut, but with Gorilla Snot, they can have all the cute styles-</li>
            <li>it really brings out those hidden curls.</li>

            <li> I am a black female with natural hair.</li>
            <li> If you keep this in for a long time it will start to turn white and look dandruff like in your hair.</li>
            <li> So for some advice just put water on your hair when your using it, and occasionally if you are planning on keeping it on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Left my hair sticky &amp; dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about other textured hair but this works REALLY well on African American textures,</li>
            <li> It does not flake and it holds all day long.  </li>
            <li> after trying over 20 other gels, I have to say this is the only one that not only holds all day, but does not flake at all when dried.</li>
            <li> it goes on quite thickly, and nice and heavy to catch those tight random curls on my 4c edges.it doesn&#x27;t hold easily enough to keep them slick when its &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, after applying, so I usually hold the ends taut and blow-dry carefully (as to not damage my edges further) until it is set &amp; solid.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would hold my hair while I was in Cabo San Lucas, but I ended up not really using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy it again as soon this one empty</li>
            <li> For the past 4 years I have been using various gel combinations in order to get my thick hair to lay down properly.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for edge control as well as the rest of your hair with little to no flaking.</li>
            <li> It works ok, however it leaves a nasty crusty buildup on your hair.</li>
            <li> I just hate the flakes</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user. This stuf is awesome. Works like a charm and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love this hair gel! It holds, even in humidity. Please make sure that you apply it to clean hair and don&#x27;t apply it over or with another gel because it will look like you have sand in your hair.  If you use it alone - it works and is great!</li>
            <li> I came across this brand by accident, and now I&#x27;m hooked!  I don&#x27;t spike my hair, but it is curly and gets frizzy now matter what kind of gel I use, I have trouble finding a strong enough gel that doesn&#x27;t flake, but now that I use moco my hair is perfect!</li>
            <li> Seems to work like gel should.</li>
            <li> Excellent price &amp; product. I would definitely recommend this product &amp; this seller.</li>
            <li> THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT &amp;#34;EXTREME HOLD&amp;#34; WAS A GREAT PRODUCT BUT WHAT I RECEIVED WAS&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;PUNK&amp;#34; NOT AS GOOD A PRODUCT FOR MY HAIR ANYWAY</li>
            <li> I have two boys, 4 and 7, with the craziest cowlicks and stick straight hair.  It was always hard to do anything with their hair besides a long bowl cut, but with Gorilla Snot, they can have all the cute styles- spiky, slicked back, side swept, etc.  It does not flake and it holds all day long.  It even holds up during sweaty, humid soccer games.  I found it holds better when I apply it dry or with wet hands.  When I use it on their damp hair it didn&#x27;t have the holding power for some reason.  But either way, I love it and they do too.  They get a kick out of telling people they have gorilla snot in their hair :)</li>
            <li> This holds my hair very well, too much will result on it being flaky when dried though,</li>
            <li> Amazing gel!!! My husband is really content with this product. Thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> One bottle has lasted over a year!  Who knew!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and I tried it and I LOVE IT. I ALSO LOVE HOW IT SMELLS!</li>
            <li> Thank God I found this product .I love my Moco</li>
            <li> This is the best product to use on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Just as described...Very good price for the amount of product received.  Fantastic delivery time.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! And who doesn&#x27;t love the name?!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Best hair gel your going to find. If you buy this time to upgrade your shampoo. lol</li>
            <li> If you keep this in for a long time it will start to turn white and look dandruff like in your hair. You definitely don&#x27;t want that! I really love this product and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if anybody else was too. So for some advice just put water on your hair when your using it, and occasionally if you are planning on keeping it on for a long time. And if you have curly hair like mine....OMG it brings out your curls!, but eventually you have to wash it out. But if you are a busy person this is good, just make sure you wash it out. If you are not that picky about your hair you can even just put some in really quickly and let it work and go. I&#x27;m not sure about other textured hair but this works REALLY well on African American textures, no matter your hair type it really brings out those hidden curls.</li>
            <li> My hair can&#x27;t take this product. Please don&#x27;t buy. Will not  lay edges. Hair just turns yellow.</li>
            <li> I tried different types of geld and hair products that had a strong hold but most left a white residue or didn&#x27;t hold up well. But now with the gorrilla gel WOW I love it. It&#x27;s hold is very strong and even after sweating it stays put. Has a light smell nothing overpowering.  There&#x27;s different type for whatever style your looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing how great it is! I wanted something that would hold my hair while I was in Cabo San Lucas, but I ended up not really using it. I have to admit that this gel can hold ANY type of hair down, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for freshly permed hair (like mine was when I used this product). This product is when you are stretching and need your edges to lay down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Leaves white flakes in your hair. The hold is amazing. I just hate the flakes</li>
            <li> It works ok, however it leaves a nasty crusty buildup on your hair.</li>
            <li> best gel in the world. cheap. smells good. good size.</li>
            <li> I have the finest hair I&#x27;ve ever felt. While stylists live to run their fingers through it, it won&#x27;t stay in place for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT this snot! It keeps it wherever I put it. It&#x27;s the most sure-fire hair holder I&#x27;ve used, other than the Elmers Glue I used on my Mohawk when I was 18.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with natural hair. For the past 4 years I have been using various gel combinations in order to get my thick hair to lay down properly. This works wonders for edge control as well as the rest of your hair with little to no flaking.</li>
            <li> Good but you can&#x27;t use too much because it will get flaky if you use to much. Holds very well.</li>
            <li> holds strong, good product!</li>
            <li> Very good product!! Best holding gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, this is great. Lasts all day and night and takes a second to put on. Best gel ive used</li>
            <li> I absolutely Luv this product! I&#x27;ve been wearing the same bun for 5 days &amp; have not wrapped my hair not even once &amp; it is still in place. All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and no damage!</li>
            <li> after trying over 20 other gels, I have to say this is the only one that not only holds all day, but does not flake at all when dried. Best gel yet!</li>
            <li> Great for a firm but not rock hard hold. It held my roughest curliest napes on the sides of my head.</li>
            <li> Great product and I am really happy with the product. I&#x27;m going to buy it again as soon this one empty</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations 😊😊😊</li>
            <li> Left my hair sticky &amp; dry</li>
            <li> everybody in my family uses this product. It&#x27;s great for Mohawks!</li>
            <li> As for my own opinion, this is my favorite gel. Ever. It holds for over 24hrs and easy to remove. Best part, no flakes or any white residue. At this price for this package deal, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> I love the snot-like tacky/elasticity of this product. and the bright yellow colour! its a fun thing to play with. it goes on quite thickly, and nice and heavy to catch those tight random curls on my 4c edges.it doesn&#x27;t hold easily enough to keep them slick when its &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, after applying, so I usually hold the ends taut and blow-dry carefully (as to not damage my edges further) until it is set &amp; solid. it feels a lot like glue. then it washes off like slime. no difficulty, just dissolves in the water.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this gel for our little boy. It is about the only thing that will give him the spike in the front. Have used this since he was a baby and he&#x27;ll be 3 this year. THE BEST!</li>
