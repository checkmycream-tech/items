            <li>The Proglide is the best for me it has more lubricants which is easier on my face.</li>
            <li>Nice gel!</li>
            <li>I find it to be a very good deal...and an even better deal when offered with a coupon.  </li>
            <li>but this makes it very easy to do!</li>
            <li>Good stuff, good price</li>
            <li>Loved the way it works.</li>
            <li>The surprising part was the feel of my face.</li>
            <li>If you can get it on a really good sale it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>This product feels good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others that are just as good</li>
            <li>Loved the subscribe and save option.</li>
            <li>The lubrication is superior to the foaming gels.</li>
            <li>Good lubrication and</li>
            <li>I thought this would be good because I like the razor and the blades...not the case.</li>
            <li>Good for keeping the chin hair while shaving the rest.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>would recommend it for anyone looking for a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>Good stuff;</li>
            <li>A true letdown by Gillette, STAY AWAY!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best change I&#x27;ve seen or more appropriately felt in the lubricant that facilitates the shave.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, very smooth when shaving with it.  </li>
            <li>product is a great value, I am just not giving it five stars, as I have just used it once, the jury is not out on it, and some of the reviews suggest there are better</li>
            <li>So far, I am impressed and quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li>U CAN SEE EVERYTHING BETTER TO SHAVE!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Better shaving with it!</li>
            <li>Glad that Amazon still carries this item!</li>
            <li>Works alot better than the foam cream!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and great glide with my razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaving gel, and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>WE BOTH THINKS ITS AMAZING</li>
            <li>I agree with most of the reviews that the gel is a really good product.  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers mentioned some kind of rash or burning.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best product for shaving if you are having to watch your lines.</li>
            <li>I tried this product kind of on a whim.</li>
            <li>so I can continue shaving the rest of my body, but I am so thrilled with this shaving gel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but not as good as some others</li>
            <li>The gel provides a nice layer of protection against scrapping and nicks.</li>
            <li>To compensate, I used a generous portion - but then it isn&#x27;t cost effective.  </li>
            <li>calling it out here, so make your own decisions before you buy the product.  </li>
            <li>liked it.</li>
            <li>great product if you need to make clean lines for beard configurations..</li>
            <li>Excellent product Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>The narrow head beard trimmer is very good and and the close shave trimmer is excellent.  </li>
            <li>It is a new and very welcome experience.</li>
            <li>It ships quickly and is a great price.</li>
            <li>This stuff has a very strong smell that reminds me the 1960&#x27;s manly man fragrances -- overpowering and obnoxious.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and he loves it , and 2 nice size squeeze bottles came instead of one, i love that.</li>
            <li>It makes my electric shaver glide smoothly and it just feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>bought this for my husband and he loves it , and 2 nice size squeeze bottles came instead of one, i love that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and a better lubricant than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>works great for me and worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best of all.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong and overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good lubricating gel but it should be known that this doesn&#x27;t foam up like the normal.  </li>
            <li>I love this shave gel by Gillette it allows me to lather up and get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>: Provides a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li>Much better than soap and makes your skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>when I went to remove the residue, it must have taken a gallon or more of water to do so.  </li>
            <li>I really think this is great stuff........</li>
            <li>and I would feel even better.</li>
            <li>able to see what you are shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>Just bought two more tubes</li>
            <li>better than shaving cream in shower</li>
            <li>/&gt;To date, this is the best shave gel I have found, and provides the smoothest possible shave, without clogging your blade.</li>
            <li>I love this as my shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I shave my head often and it works better then</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products I have lost count.</li>
            <li>but I have grown to love the scent of this shave gel.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for sixty years and have seen many changes over that time.</li>
            <li>I am always amazed how Gillette keeps coming up with better blades, etc.</li>
            <li>However the Proglide was better at protecting my face with better lubrication.</li>
            <li>I learned to rinse out the blades better by reversing the head as a</li>
            <li>and I switch it to a better container.</li>
            <li>so bought more and think this will replace foam shave cream for me.</li>
            <li>I love Fusion ProGlide Men&#x27;s Shaving Gel (5.9 oz.</li>
            <li>It is better than nothing</li>
            <li>Its especially best when you use it as 1st course &amp; you may use a cream/gel for the 2nd time shave.</li>
            <li>It seems most of the criticism for this product are from people that thought this was a lathering cream.  </li>
            <li>fragrance is merely okay for me, hence 4 stars, but otherwise I have had no issues with this gel.  </li>
            <li>, Target handles everything else from Gillette, but not this, my favorite shave gel</li>
            <li>but I have also used a lot better including from the Pro Glide line.</li>
            <li>The key to shaving is lubrication, and this is the best at it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t after using it myself.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff -</li>
            <li>so glad I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li>outstanding close shaves</li>
            <li>If it was the shaving gel on sale this week, sure :]</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been pleased with this shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I discovered this shaving gel and thought it would be nice to get a more precise shave around my goatee.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaving gel.</li>
            <li>In any case, the shaving cream is great, but the tube is not so much.</li>
            <li>I like this much better.</li>
            <li>I will be reordering when i need more.</li>
            <li>this reminds me I need to order more</li>
            <li>Gives me more of a control feel to it.</li>
            <li>This and King of Shaves are my two favorite gels.  </li>
            <li>I changed to foam which is way better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>*Top tip, invest in shower mirrors instead of breaking your bathroom mirror into shards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more once this tube runs out.</li>
            <li>Wish Gillette offed more options in this packaging.</li>
            <li>It is OK and does make it easier to see for shaving up to and around mustache.  </li>
            <li>burn more than once and when used</li>
            <li>Because based on the way the product is promoted you sure could have fooled me......</li>
            <li>so we can make a better informed decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ordered the shave gel to try &amp; it is better than anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The application of this gel takes more time than the foam gel you can spray out of a can, and I have gotten more knicks from shaving with this gel than the spray can.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get as many shaves as with shaving cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>gillette shaving gel helps me to getting a really nice and smooth shave</li>
            <li>Thus stuff is pricey but it does seem to get a better shave.</li>
            <li>I love this gel for shaving</li>
            <li>This product really helps you get a great shave without getting chaffed.</li>
            <li>Fusion Pro-Glide has a pleasant scent, and gives me a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li>#34;I guess you&#x27;re right.&amp;#34;  That kind of took the sting out of having a full can but no way of getting the contents out.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>On a bright note my wife said it is very moisturizing and enjoyed using it on her legs</li>
            <li>I use a safely razor and this is fine.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li>Great gel for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>all, I enjoy being able to have some type of vision to where my blade is shaving.</li>
            <li>No lather which allows you to shave more precisely.  </li>
            <li>This might not be the best or &amp;#34;smoothest&amp;#34; for shaving outside of the shower, but I must say it works great for being in the shower with the potential of getting water splashed in your face/body while shaving.  </li>
            <li>Lathers really well and does a good job of lubricating the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d get a closer and more comfortable shave if I used Comet!</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>My experience has been that this gel is better that the Barbasol Original that I have used for years.</li>
            <li>, I love and does leave a clean shave and 100%</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;re trying to shave.</li>
            <li>product easily gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li>it makes the razor easily glide along without cuts and scraps.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Seems like a problem they could solve easily.</li>
            <li>it is easy to see any hairs I may have missed on the 1st pass.</li>
            <li>This method was marginally better than nothing at all, but far superior to Fusion ProGlide.  </li>
            <li>Has a strong shaving cream type smell</li>
            <li>if U R a Prime Member FREE SHIPPING and if U do the math on becoming a Prime Member and order a lot like we do U save a ton</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something kinda satisfying about actually watching the hair getting shaved off, but that&#x27;s not the real reason I like this stuff the best.</li>
            <li>Most of them have been in the equipment we use to get a clean and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best shaving gel out there!!</li>
            <li>I use Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Power razor, but any good multi-blade razor should work fine, just trust the gel and shave like you would normally shave.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>Some shave gels quickly clog the razor, and I am pleased to see that this one does not.</li>
            <li>Smells good and no problems with my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After quickly burning through 3 blades in that jungle, I am happy to report that I was not only very smooth, but also noticeably cooler.</li>
            <li>Great shaves at last.</li>
            <li>Ultra smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Light scent.</li>
            <li>For someone with light colored hair, how do you know where you have shaved already?</li>
            <li>BTW, it&#x27;s doubly the shame because otherwise the product works great.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel smooth</li>
            <li>I enjoy it every day.</li>
            <li>this is for: Anybody who&#x27;s trying to be precise about what/where it is they&#x27;re</li>
            <li>My wife and I both like how smooth the face is after using the shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>While I like using this tube to dispense the gel and the gel works nicely, it leaves a very slippery film on my skin and hands.</li>
            <li>I grab this stuff and end up with a silk smooth face.  </li>
            <li>Its changing evrything in shaving, its so smooth and the fact</li>
            <li>it makes no foams helps the shaver to glide smoothly</li>
            <li>LEAVES MY FACE SMOOTH</li>
            <li>It also leaves my face smooth and moist.  </li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I was being cheap and this was one of the gels I saw on Amazon</li>
            <li>PROVIDES SMOOTH SHAVE, JUST A DAB</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s great when you want to keep some facial hair;</li>
            <li>Gives a pretty decent shave - the Gillette Foamy Gel does a better job and washes off easier-eh!!</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this on Amazon because I love using it in my gym bag as the gel holds up in extreme weather unlike the spray foams...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very worth the price to get the value.  </li>
            <li>I use EVERY time I shave and it provides a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to see where you need to shave, which is handy because double edge safety razors require a lot more tact than the brute force method of multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>I love this gel, it is better than normal gel shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It provides a good shave and allows you to see your cut line so you don&#x27;t mess up your precious beard!</li>
            <li>I thought the nozzle may be clogged and soaked the top of the can in hot water for a while but no change.  </li>
            <li>this unbelievable combination gives the greatest shave ever!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll pay for it because it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Although, the coolness might have been a result of having ran out of hot water 45 minutes into my shower (which ended up taking most of the weekend).</li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>I was excited to try a non-foaming gel</li>
            <li>It stays on your face pretty well under those conditions, much better than the foam type shaving gels.</li>
            <li>This product is not shaving cream, but rather a new kind of shaving &amp;#34;lubricant&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>For a person who prefers the clean shaven look</li>
            <li>Best new product i&#x27;ve gotten in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants a very smooth, close, shave without the hassle.</li>
            <li>It is not horrid but nothing special either.  </li>
            <li>I like this gel but its nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>This product is certainly see through, but does lack the lather that I know and love.</li>
            <li>where I purchased it, I paid full price.  </li>
            <li>Maybe Gillette could send me  a full can</li>
            <li>I could not use the product any more as it caused too much pain.  </li>
            <li>Its slimy and it doesn&#x27;t lubricate enough for a good shave.</li>
            <li>Need to rinse my hands occasionally, to maintain a good grip on the shaver.</li>
            <li>Love this product, very soothing</li>
            <li>And best of all, at least for me, it reduced shaving irritation to almost nothing.</li>
            <li>gel doesn&#x27;t lather up, making it easy to get your face covered and trimmed, while knowing exactly where</li>
            <li>So big points there for not just being handy for beard edging but for genuinely improving the shave in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The issue I have is that the remington product QUICKLY clogs multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>Great for shaving and getting near the bead without shaving it (as it is clear).</li>
            <li>Finally, I super glued an assortment of mirrors to my shower wall and door.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is the best shaving gel or cream I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m a clean-shaven white guy who recently turned 50, so I&#x27;ve been shaving a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One mention the Alphagel was second best and it rinsed out of the blades a little better.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>THE SOAP IS CLEAR AND EASY TO SHAVE WITH!</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s easy to use too much of this product when you&#x27;re accustomed to a product that foams up.</li>
            <li>It provides exceptional lubrication, and at the same time is water soluble enough that it washes out of the razor effectively.</li>
            <li>Amazing - better than any other shaving gel that I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>just wish there was a way to keep my family from squeezing out so much!!  </li>
            <li>love the way it makes you feel during the process and once complete!</li>
            <li>I have a fairly light beard, but I&#x27;ve loaned it to a buddy with a more typical beard, and he was impressed...perhaps needed a dollop more per shave than I use.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t get a smooth of a shave as I expected/used to.</li>
            <li>It does make it smooth to shave, but it really clog up your shave.</li>
            <li>Really an ingenious product since the gel is transparent, allowing you to be precise especially if your one to shape and touch your mug.</li>
            <li>Would be useful if you needed to see where the edge of your beard is</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about the product is that it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just bought a can of barbasol...shaving success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good product that I like better than foaming gel, if only because you can actually see how the shave is going.</li>
            <li>is worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>I love the clear gel for trimming around my goatee.  </li>
            <li>Either way it is worth giving it a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>When using this product, I got cuts using a brand new Fusion ProGlide razor -- the first time I&#x27;ve been cut with a ProGlide in more than a year of usage.  </li>
            <li>Despite the other reviews, I did feel like this provided a good amount of glide to the shave.  </li>
            <li>I like this gel because it goes onto the skin clear, allowing for easy visibility as to what you are shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, it doesn&#x27;t foam up much, and it feels more like sticky hair gel than shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Because the gel is transparent, it&#x27;s easy to see what you&#x27;re shaving in dim shower stall lighting, and I can imagine that would be an advantage for those who are shaving below the neckline.</li>
            <li>Clear and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I do think it more effectively lubricates than the foaming gel and deserves at least a 4-star rating.   </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t appear like it would protect your face very much.  </li>
            <li>Though not exactly what I am used to, this clear gel helps you get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>3 stars for the effort for making it smell good and making a texture a little dense.</li>
            <li>This gel is the best I&#x27;d used so far ,washes right off the blade also thick enough to stay where you use it ,also good for the private spots</li>
            <li>First of all, it comes out of the tube looking very much</li>
            <li>Yes, the gel is clear and allows the razor to move smoothly on the skin</li>
            <li>This one does not foam at all unless you use WAY more than what is necessary for the job.</li>
            <li>However - it really works!</li>
            <li>My face was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I go over some spots again with hot water and the brush without rinsing the ProGlide off the brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I don&#x27;t use it exactly as intended, this process is working quite well.</li>
            <li>I believe I will order a 20 year supply because I have a feeling that it will be discontinued because I have a hunch it is not popular, which is a shame because it is an a great product.</li>
            <li>My current favorite is Spelck&#x27;s product, a smell my wife loves as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and/or are consistent about shaving the neckline of your beard.</li>
            <li>With this though, that problem is solved, because you can see, and feel exactly what you intended to shave, and can shave accordingly.</li>
            <li>I have used for a few weeks now and could tell it was not as good as shaving cream after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Better go with a proper shaving cream.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I first saw it didn&#x27;t foam</li>
            <li>First time using this stuff.</li>
            <li>you can see exactly were you are shaving</li>
            <li>so you know exactly what areas of your face you have missed.  </li>
            <li>I am currently waiting for more replacement blades to arrive</li>
            <li>This is my first non-foaming shave gel and at first I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product of this type I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell of it, personally.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think that it is \\&quot;slick\\&quot; enough and produces more friction than the canned gel.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product</li>
            <li>to greasy and messy, not as good a product as I would like</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a little more effort to wash your face after shaving as this gel doesn&#x27;t come off as easy as a foam, but it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>If you want a great clear gel use Jack Black.</li>
            <li>Interestingly enough, it&#x27;s perfect for old school double edge safety razors, which really surprised me.</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased this for its &#x27;clear&#x27; effect</li>
            <li>The key to a good shave gel is for it to provide maximum lubrication on the face, but at the same time, not clog the razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Clear Shave Gel for a couple years, and it&#x27;s far better than any foam, gel, or lather that I&#x27;ve used over the decades.  </li>
            <li>If the tube had a cap that screwed down or locked down, it would have been perfect.</li>
            <li>I have notest that it is best to wet the razor before the first stroke and to only lightly shake off the water during rinsing between strokes because a little water on the razor seems to help with the smoothness of each stroke.</li>
            <li>Gel,\\&quot; make sure you understand that the gel itself is not clear.</li>
            <li>I take full responsibility for not paying attention, but note the gel is clear.  </li>
            <li>the shave is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>While it indicates clear, if you scrub it into the beard it will lather up and turn white, but its not the fluffy overbearing shaving foam that totally blocks your view of what you are trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy and best of all</li>
            <li>It allows you to see your facial hair while shaving and gives a pretty smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have known about this product years ago, One can pretty much shape up the goatee how one wants.</li>
            <li>this gel is great , it does not give you rash on your face and it is completely transparent , and before i was not able to shave upward but with this gel i can , and since i have been using it i have not gotten a rash on my face.</li>
            <li>Went back to shaving cream which works just fine.  </li>
            <li>The foam is better for those razors, and adds extra protection, while i felt like this gel doesn&#x27;t provide enough protection for 5 razors to scrape one patch of skin in quick succession.</li>
            <li>So much nicer than foam shaving creams.</li>
            <li>so I find this to be much cheaper than even bargain price foam.</li>
            <li>Much easier to trim beard neckline using this versus shaving cream</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works well but has way too much fragrance</li>
            <li>I conclusion I really like the ProGlide gel.</li>
            <li>so i was very disapointed</li>
            <li>and if you try to scrub it too much the foam appears which defeats the purpose of it being &amp;#34;CLEAR&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turns out it is very genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it was for me the price showd not be so high!</li>
            <li>I started shaving my face with this stuff and then started squirting it all over my body to see if I could get back to being baby smooth.</li>
            <li>, this stuff is very slippery and protects your face well from shave irritation.  </li>
            <li>You have to really lather it</li>
            <li>It seems to lubricate very well, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would expect.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>really get a close shave</li>
            <li>cheap price to pay for the initial kit but</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave with this product and I can use it in conjunction with my electric razor as well.</li>
            <li>I really like this get.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it goes on and how it works.</li>
            <li>I actually like using it more than my old school shaving cream and boar bristle brush</li>
            <li>Given the host of negativity in the other reviews, which I read after I purchased the gel, I was very surprised to find I enjoyed my shave very much.  </li>
            <li>Very like the idea that you can see where to shave, but don&#x27;t like how it feels and a main reason for 2 stars is it starts to drip from a blade and become very sticky on the surface.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, this product made those spots go by noticeably more smoothly due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up.</li>
            <li>The double pack makes for a great value and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>(There&#x27;s still that tricky area right under the nose that it&#x27;s hard to get shaved nice and close, but since a Hitler moustache isn&#x27;t really an option, I guess I&#x27;ll just live with that.)</li>
            <li>enjoy while you can(hopefully for a long time).</li>
            <li>This was the first clear gel I&#x27;ve tried to use.</li>
            <li>My wife later picked up the can and asked why I was throwing out a full can.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with the new battery operated gilette 5 blade straight razor</li>
            <li>It probably took twice as many strokes to get half as close a shave as I would have with Edge.  </li>
            <li>Less time shaving foam off my face more time</li>
            <li>So, you have to be careful where you shave with this because it is easy to lose track of where you have been.</li>
            <li>Used foam gel previously like this better once was used to it.</li>
            <li>Main reason for this purchase was to find something that didn&#x27;t have metal can that will rust and stain the shower...  </li>
            <li>I found it more difficult to use, not lathering as well, needing to use more water to try and make it lather.</li>
            <li>Blade glides smoothly across my face and since it goes on clear even though it is tinted slightly blue</li>
            <li>and it looked decent.</li>
            <li>One thing--even if it doesn&#x27;t look like you need to, rinse your razor as you always have, since the whiskers are getting cut and clogging the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose everybody&#x27;s face is different, but it seems to me the razor glides more smoothly with this clear gel, especially on the second pass.</li>
            <li>This shaving gel is my very first shaving substance that I have personally used.</li>
            <li>When I say smooth, I mean really smooth.</li>
            <li>Also it leaked out and made a mess on the sink top.</li>
            <li>I can recommend it highly</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So smart to have clear gel</li>
            <li>But it really isn&#x27;t a drawback, since the gel keeps your face slick and makes for a very smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>You need little more than they say but does spread all over.</li>
            <li>It does leave a rather slimy residue on my razor that makes it require a little more cleaning effort during shaving.</li>
            <li>So in my opinion the texture could have been a little more dense and scrub-able so you can prepare your skin before shaving.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to see after it&#x27;s applied but easier to remove and doesn&#x27;t clog the razor.</li>
            <li>I like that the gel is somewhat clear so you can trim without taking to much off</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive beard and I am really susceptible to razor burn and this seems to prevent that problem.</li>
            <li>Better than shaving cream, although if one rubs product on face overly long, it can lather up but not a big deal</li>
            <li>Never used this before; always the normal aerosol.</li>
            <li>Overall though the Gillette regular gel provides better lubrication and protection than the Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower, and a tiny blob of this gel spreads easily over my entire face.  </li>
            <li>Going right back to Nivea.</li>
            <li>but thise does leave your skin feeling smooth and doesn&#x27;t make as much of a mess as some that seem to lather up almost too much.</li>
            <li>It also drops into the sink and doesn&#x27;t wash down the drain as easily as the foam.</li>
            <li>I have very thick facial hair and this gel is great on it.</li>
            <li>It was a new sensation.</li>
            <li>I would expect when shaving a new part of the body.</li>
            <li>I could not find it in the stores where I live.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about a year now, and it&#x27;s worth the extra $ for me to have clear gel.  </li>
            <li>After using cream and regular gel, this was very slippery and hand was very lubricated.</li>
            <li>Great for shaving a VERY TOUGH beard that grows like wild.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Its very difficult to rate this product, on one hand it does a very good job on shaving my face, but here is the issue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol sorry they require a certain amount of words to leave a feed back</li>
            <li>It is blue-tinted; it goes on clear when applied to your face -- those of you with dye issues, take note!</li>
            <li>You have to realize that after you spread it on your face, it is CLEAR!  </li>
            <li>No more rust stains in the shower :)</li>
            <li>It did turn out to be more expensive, but depending on how much and how often you shave, you will get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It does no lather like shaving cream, but would probably be better suited for a male with facial hair they leave verses shaving entire face.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my legs and my significant other uses it to shave every day.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed that Target has not carried this product for months, but very happy to find it online.</li>
            <li>It is true you can see through the gel to where you are shaving, but that has never really been a problem with a face I shave almost everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, this gel is so slippery and messy, it leaks all over the razor and the hand holding it - making it easy to drop your razor unless you wash your hand</li>
            <li>you can cover the area which you INTEND to shave but also the area you DON&#x27;T INTEND to shave; basically you run the gamut of shaving too much or too little of what you were supposed to shave, unless you get lucky</li>
            <li>You end up with a little glob between blades that a fast stream of very hot water will not release.</li>
            <li>The product is not too harsh for my sensitive skin, and it provides an easy shave without the foamy residue.</li>
            <li>I find the Remington product to provide more lubrication, and perhaps an initial slight advantage in shave smoothness.</li>
            <li>I typically use The Art of Shaving or similar products to make my shave more of an event</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I was in a big hurry I would end up with hidden shaving cream in my ear for the better part of the morning</li>
            <li>I had been using Edge gel which worked fine, but there were always a few areas that felt &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; when I shaved.</li>
            <li>I shaved before with shaving cream, I would always after shaving, wash the shaving cream all off, to reveal certain parts I hadn&#x27;t shaved well enough, and then would have to do it over again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little more effort to rinse off, but no big deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Great for the dryness and cold temperatures of winter.</li>
            <li>Clear Shave gel</li>
            <li>It goes on clear</li>
            <li>Goes on practically clear</li>
            <li>...goes on clear...</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be clear (</li>
            <li>no pun intended): When you read \\&quot;Clear Shave</li>
            <li>As a matter of opinion, if/when you use this, you&#x27;ll ask yourself why you never used clear shave gel to begin with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slimy, but is as advertised, a relatively clear shaving gel for man-scaping.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>I ordered Gillette Clear Shave Gel because I like Gillette products</li>
            <li>B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz.</li>
            <li>Used to use old school shaving cream until I got this from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>With the Remington product, I end up having to frequently change blades.</li>
            <li>Turned my whole face red!</li>
            <li>Have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>this may not be for: Anybody who does a complete shave</li>
            <li>Get a reasonable priced razor, make it last longer with this gel!!</li>
            <li>Three choice beard length heads allow for a short to reasonable length of beard to be achieved.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam, which is strange at first, but this allows one to see any missed spots.</li>
            <li>I never have razor burn and it gives a baby soft result.</li>
            <li>Soft, I use it for my legs.</li>
            <li>Will be using this product a few more times and will update if I see different results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently in Afghanistan and a fresh shave is a requirement on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>More expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>FYI, if you apply enough and with the right amount of pressure, you can get it to lather and lose some of its transparency, but only marginally so.</li>
            <li>This is a little like putting sex lube on your face, I had to wash my hands really good after putting it on because they felt so slick afterward.  </li>
            <li>Cool product, it&#x27;s hard to get straight lines when trimming my face</li>
            <li>This is a unique experience &amp; beats any other similar products.</li>
            <li>I would rate it higher but it really didn&#x27;t perform above and beyond what other shaving products do.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty much what we&#x27;ve all come to expect from Gillette when given the chance to make a shave gel that could actually benefit men: a product full of unnecessary chemicals, fragrances and dyes.</li>
            <li>Stays slick and smooth throughout the shave.</li>
            <li>This product initially throws you off because it doesn&#x27;t foam up, but once you are used to it you fall in love with it because you can actually see what you are doing (hairs that you are missing etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Iv only used gillette shaving cream so the smell is nothing new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other nice thing is that you can go over the same spot with your razor and it remains slick.</li>
            <li>The key is the non-foaming clear application.</li>
            <li>The gel is slick, lubrication and glide were terrific, and my face is smooth.  </li>
            <li>No drag</li>
            <li>Works very well and is economical to use (a small amount goes a long way).</li>
            <li>If you shave out of the shower, I would just wet my hands really well</li>
            <li>product is convenient as far as its design and ease of application however, it has left me with razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m deployed to an FPO address where they don&#x27;t sell the pressurized Gillette shave gel, and there are apparently shipping restrictions as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this product, because I was using the canned foam before and it would always end up stuck in or behind my ears.  </li>
            <li>and/or on a constant basis; I mean you can use it, and it would feel and work incredibly, but it would possibly be redundant considering you may not be or may not need to be specific about what/where you&#x27;re shaving, unless you&#x27;re concerned about sideburns or any other facial hair.</li>
            <li>product states clearly on the back &amp;#34;NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN FACIAL HAIR TRIMMING&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up means you can see what you&#x27;ve cut off and what you have left very clearly, so it reduces potential irritation from re-working the same part of your face.</li>
            <li>Let me back off a minute and say that I am not allergic to any of the ingredients, I do not ever have dry skin, and I don&#x27;t dig, twist, scrape, or otherwise abuse my face with my razor in any way that is not commonly associated with shaving.</li>
            <li>not worth that much.</li>
            <li>Before using this, I&#x27;d never even known there was such a thing as clear shave gel, and when I did, I&#x27;d assumed it was more expensive.</li>
            <li>Also worth mentioning, a little goes a long way with this</li>
            <li>I have been using this and a lather type gel to shave my head the last few weeks and find they are pretty even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d run out of my usual Edge gel, which I love, and for a few shaves I was simply using bar soap to lather my beard.  </li>
            <li>This was the first gel I&#x27;d found in non-aerosol form, and despite the fact that it was the only product NOT marked down</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion shaving cream for years and decided to give Gillette Fusion Clear Shave Gel a try because the bottle is soft and takes less space than the traditional aerosol shaving cream in a</li>

            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li> This is a very good alternative to the pressurized can.  </li>

            <li> and I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> It also has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> The Proglide is the best for me it has more lubricants which is easier on my face.</li>
            <li> Nice gel!</li>
            <li> I find it to be a very good deal...and an even better deal when offered with a coupon.  </li>
            <li> but this makes it very easy to do!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, good price</li>
            <li> Loved the way it works.</li>
            <li> The surprising part was the feel of my face.</li>
            <li> If you can get it on a really good sale it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> This product feels good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others that are just as good</li>
            <li> Loved the subscribe and save option.</li>
            <li> The lubrication is superior to the foaming gels.</li>
            <li> Good lubrication and</li>
            <li> I thought this would be good because I like the razor and the blades...not the case.</li>
            <li> Good for keeping the chin hair while shaving the rest.</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> would recommend it for anyone looking for a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff;</li>
            <li> A true letdown by Gillette, STAY AWAY!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best change I&#x27;ve seen or more appropriately felt in the lubricant that facilitates the shave.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, very smooth when shaving with it.  </li>
            <li> product is a great value, I am just not giving it five stars, as I have just used it once, the jury is not out on it, and some of the reviews suggest there are better</li>
            <li> So far, I am impressed and quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li> U CAN SEE EVERYTHING BETTER TO SHAVE!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Better shaving with it!</li>
            <li> Glad that Amazon still carries this item!</li>
            <li> Works alot better than the foam cream!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great glide with my razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaving gel, and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> WE BOTH THINKS ITS AMAZING</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews that the gel is a really good product.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers mentioned some kind of rash or burning.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best product for shaving if you are having to watch your lines.</li>
            <li> I tried this product kind of on a whim.</li>
            <li> so I can continue shaving the rest of my body, but I am so thrilled with this shaving gel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but not as good as some others</li>
            <li> The gel provides a nice layer of protection against scrapping and nicks.</li>
            <li> To compensate, I used a generous portion - but then it isn&#x27;t cost effective.  </li>
            <li> calling it out here, so make your own decisions before you buy the product.  </li>
            <li> liked it.</li>
            <li> great product if you need to make clean lines for beard configurations..</li>
            <li> Excellent product Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> The narrow head beard trimmer is very good and and the close shave trimmer is excellent.  </li>
            <li> It is a new and very welcome experience.</li>
            <li> It ships quickly and is a great price.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a very strong smell that reminds me the 1960&#x27;s manly man fragrances -- overpowering and obnoxious.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it , and 2 nice size squeeze bottles came instead of one, i love that.</li>
            <li> It makes my electric shaver glide smoothly and it just feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband and he loves it , and 2 nice size squeeze bottles came instead of one, i love that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and a better lubricant than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> works great for me and worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best of all.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong and overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good lubricating gel but it should be known that this doesn&#x27;t foam up like the normal.  </li>
            <li> I love this shave gel by Gillette it allows me to lather up and get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> : Provides a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li> Much better than soap and makes your skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> when I went to remove the residue, it must have taken a gallon or more of water to do so.  </li>
            <li> I really think this is great stuff........</li>
            <li> and I would feel even better.</li>
            <li> able to see what you are shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Just bought two more tubes</li>
            <li> better than shaving cream in shower</li>
            <li> /&gt;To date, this is the best shave gel I have found, and provides the smoothest possible shave, without clogging your blade.</li>
            <li> I love this as my shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I shave my head often and it works better then</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products I have lost count.</li>
            <li> but I have grown to love the scent of this shave gel.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for sixty years and have seen many changes over that time.</li>
            <li> I am always amazed how Gillette keeps coming up with better blades, etc.</li>
            <li> However the Proglide was better at protecting my face with better lubrication.</li>
            <li> I learned to rinse out the blades better by reversing the head as a</li>
            <li> and I switch it to a better container.</li>
            <li> so bought more and think this will replace foam shave cream for me.</li>
            <li> I love Fusion ProGlide Men&#x27;s Shaving Gel (5.9 oz.</li>
            <li> It is better than nothing</li>
            <li> Its especially best when you use it as 1st course &amp; you may use a cream/gel for the 2nd time shave.</li>
            <li> It seems most of the criticism for this product are from people that thought this was a lathering cream.  </li>
            <li> fragrance is merely okay for me, hence 4 stars, but otherwise I have had no issues with this gel.  </li>
            <li> , Target handles everything else from Gillette, but not this, my favorite shave gel</li>
            <li> but I have also used a lot better including from the Pro Glide line.</li>
            <li> The key to shaving is lubrication, and this is the best at it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t after using it myself.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff -</li>
            <li> so glad I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li> outstanding close shaves</li>
            <li> If it was the shaving gel on sale this week, sure :]</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been pleased with this shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this shaving gel and thought it would be nice to get a more precise shave around my goatee.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaving gel.</li>
            <li> In any case, the shaving cream is great, but the tube is not so much.</li>
            <li> I like this much better.</li>
            <li> I will be reordering when i need more.</li>
            <li> this reminds me I need to order more</li>
            <li> Gives me more of a control feel to it.</li>
            <li> This and King of Shaves are my two favorite gels.  </li>
            <li> I changed to foam which is way better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> *Top tip, invest in shower mirrors instead of breaking your bathroom mirror into shards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more once this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> Wish Gillette offed more options in this packaging.</li>
            <li> It is OK and does make it easier to see for shaving up to and around mustache.  </li>
            <li> burn more than once and when used</li>
            <li> Because based on the way the product is promoted you sure could have fooled me......</li>
            <li> so we can make a better informed decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ordered the shave gel to try &amp; it is better than anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The application of this gel takes more time than the foam gel you can spray out of a can, and I have gotten more knicks from shaving with this gel than the spray can.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get as many shaves as with shaving cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> gillette shaving gel helps me to getting a really nice and smooth shave</li>
            <li> Thus stuff is pricey but it does seem to get a better shave.</li>
            <li> I love this gel for shaving</li>
            <li> This product really helps you get a great shave without getting chaffed.</li>
            <li> Fusion Pro-Glide has a pleasant scent, and gives me a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li> #34;I guess you&#x27;re right.&amp;#34;  That kind of took the sting out of having a full can but no way of getting the contents out.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> On a bright note my wife said it is very moisturizing and enjoyed using it on her legs</li>
            <li> I use a safely razor and this is fine.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> Great gel for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> all, I enjoy being able to have some type of vision to where my blade is shaving.</li>
            <li> No lather which allows you to shave more precisely.  </li>
            <li> This might not be the best or &amp;#34;smoothest&amp;#34; for shaving outside of the shower, but I must say it works great for being in the shower with the potential of getting water splashed in your face/body while shaving.  </li>
            <li> Lathers really well and does a good job of lubricating the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d get a closer and more comfortable shave if I used Comet!</li>
            <li> Sweet!</li>
            <li> My experience has been that this gel is better that the Barbasol Original that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> , I love and does leave a clean shave and 100%</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;re trying to shave.</li>
            <li> product easily gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> it makes the razor easily glide along without cuts and scraps.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Seems like a problem they could solve easily.</li>
            <li> it is easy to see any hairs I may have missed on the 1st pass.</li>
            <li> This method was marginally better than nothing at all, but far superior to Fusion ProGlide.  </li>
            <li> Has a strong shaving cream type smell</li>
            <li> if U R a Prime Member FREE SHIPPING and if U do the math on becoming a Prime Member and order a lot like we do U save a ton</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something kinda satisfying about actually watching the hair getting shaved off, but that&#x27;s not the real reason I like this stuff the best.</li>
            <li> Most of them have been in the equipment we use to get a clean and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaving gel out there!!</li>
            <li> I use Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Power razor, but any good multi-blade razor should work fine, just trust the gel and shave like you would normally shave.</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> Some shave gels quickly clog the razor, and I am pleased to see that this one does not.</li>
            <li> Smells good and no problems with my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After quickly burning through 3 blades in that jungle, I am happy to report that I was not only very smooth, but also noticeably cooler.</li>
            <li> Great shaves at last.</li>
            <li> Ultra smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Light scent.</li>
            <li> For someone with light colored hair, how do you know where you have shaved already?</li>
            <li> BTW, it&#x27;s doubly the shame because otherwise the product works great.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel smooth</li>
            <li> I enjoy it every day.</li>
            <li> this is for: Anybody who&#x27;s trying to be precise about what/where it is they&#x27;re</li>
            <li> My wife and I both like how smooth the face is after using the shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> While I like using this tube to dispense the gel and the gel works nicely, it leaves a very slippery film on my skin and hands.</li>
            <li> I grab this stuff and end up with a silk smooth face.  </li>
            <li> Its changing evrything in shaving, its so smooth and the fact</li>
            <li> it makes no foams helps the shaver to glide smoothly</li>
            <li> LEAVES MY FACE SMOOTH</li>
            <li> It also leaves my face smooth and moist.  </li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I was being cheap and this was one of the gels I saw on Amazon</li>
            <li> PROVIDES SMOOTH SHAVE, JUST A DAB</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s great when you want to keep some facial hair;</li>
            <li> Gives a pretty decent shave - the Gillette Foamy Gel does a better job and washes off easier-eh!!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this on Amazon because I love using it in my gym bag as the gel holds up in extreme weather unlike the spray foams...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very worth the price to get the value.  </li>
            <li> I use EVERY time I shave and it provides a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to see where you need to shave, which is handy because double edge safety razors require a lot more tact than the brute force method of multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, it is better than normal gel shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It provides a good shave and allows you to see your cut line so you don&#x27;t mess up your precious beard!</li>
            <li> I thought the nozzle may be clogged and soaked the top of the can in hot water for a while but no change.  </li>
            <li> this unbelievable combination gives the greatest shave ever!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll pay for it because it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Although, the coolness might have been a result of having ran out of hot water 45 minutes into my shower (which ended up taking most of the weekend).</li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> I was excited to try a non-foaming gel</li>
            <li> It stays on your face pretty well under those conditions, much better than the foam type shaving gels.</li>
            <li> This product is not shaving cream, but rather a new kind of shaving &amp;#34;lubricant&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> For a person who prefers the clean shaven look</li>
            <li> Best new product i&#x27;ve gotten in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants a very smooth, close, shave without the hassle.</li>
            <li> It is not horrid but nothing special either.  </li>
            <li> I like this gel but its nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> This product is certainly see through, but does lack the lather that I know and love.</li>
            <li> where I purchased it, I paid full price.  </li>
            <li> Maybe Gillette could send me  a full can</li>
            <li> I could not use the product any more as it caused too much pain.  </li>
            <li> Its slimy and it doesn&#x27;t lubricate enough for a good shave.</li>
            <li> Need to rinse my hands occasionally, to maintain a good grip on the shaver.</li>
            <li> Love this product, very soothing</li>
            <li> And best of all, at least for me, it reduced shaving irritation to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> gel doesn&#x27;t lather up, making it easy to get your face covered and trimmed, while knowing exactly where</li>
            <li> So big points there for not just being handy for beard edging but for genuinely improving the shave in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The issue I have is that the remington product QUICKLY clogs multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving and getting near the bead without shaving it (as it is clear).</li>
            <li> Finally, I super glued an assortment of mirrors to my shower wall and door.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is the best shaving gel or cream I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m a clean-shaven white guy who recently turned 50, so I&#x27;ve been shaving a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One mention the Alphagel was second best and it rinsed out of the blades a little better.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> THE SOAP IS CLEAR AND EASY TO SHAVE WITH!</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s easy to use too much of this product when you&#x27;re accustomed to a product that foams up.</li>
            <li> It provides exceptional lubrication, and at the same time is water soluble enough that it washes out of the razor effectively.</li>
            <li> Amazing - better than any other shaving gel that I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> just wish there was a way to keep my family from squeezing out so much!!  </li>
            <li> love the way it makes you feel during the process and once complete!</li>
            <li> I have a fairly light beard, but I&#x27;ve loaned it to a buddy with a more typical beard, and he was impressed...perhaps needed a dollop more per shave than I use.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t get a smooth of a shave as I expected/used to.</li>
            <li> It does make it smooth to shave, but it really clog up your shave.</li>
            <li> Really an ingenious product since the gel is transparent, allowing you to be precise especially if your one to shape and touch your mug.</li>
            <li> Would be useful if you needed to see where the edge of your beard is</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about the product is that it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just bought a can of barbasol...shaving success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a good product that I like better than foaming gel, if only because you can actually see how the shave is going.</li>
            <li> is worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> I love the clear gel for trimming around my goatee.  </li>
            <li> Either way it is worth giving it a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> When using this product, I got cuts using a brand new Fusion ProGlide razor -- the first time I&#x27;ve been cut with a ProGlide in more than a year of usage.  </li>
            <li> Despite the other reviews, I did feel like this provided a good amount of glide to the shave.  </li>
            <li> I like this gel because it goes onto the skin clear, allowing for easy visibility as to what you are shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, it doesn&#x27;t foam up much, and it feels more like sticky hair gel than shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Because the gel is transparent, it&#x27;s easy to see what you&#x27;re shaving in dim shower stall lighting, and I can imagine that would be an advantage for those who are shaving below the neckline.</li>
            <li> Clear and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I do think it more effectively lubricates than the foaming gel and deserves at least a 4-star rating.   </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t appear like it would protect your face very much.  </li>
            <li> Though not exactly what I am used to, this clear gel helps you get a great shave.  </li>
            <li> 3 stars for the effort for making it smell good and making a texture a little dense.</li>
            <li> This gel is the best I&#x27;d used so far ,washes right off the blade also thick enough to stay where you use it ,also good for the private spots</li>
            <li> First of all, it comes out of the tube looking very much</li>
            <li> Yes, the gel is clear and allows the razor to move smoothly on the skin</li>
            <li> This one does not foam at all unless you use WAY more than what is necessary for the job.</li>
            <li> However - it really works!</li>
            <li> My face was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I go over some spots again with hot water and the brush without rinsing the ProGlide off the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t use it exactly as intended, this process is working quite well.</li>
            <li> I believe I will order a 20 year supply because I have a feeling that it will be discontinued because I have a hunch it is not popular, which is a shame because it is an a great product.</li>
            <li> My current favorite is Spelck&#x27;s product, a smell my wife loves as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and/or are consistent about shaving the neckline of your beard.</li>
            <li> With this though, that problem is solved, because you can see, and feel exactly what you intended to shave, and can shave accordingly.</li>
            <li> I have used for a few weeks now and could tell it was not as good as shaving cream after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Better go with a proper shaving cream.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I first saw it didn&#x27;t foam</li>
            <li> First time using this stuff.</li>
            <li> you can see exactly were you are shaving</li>
            <li> so you know exactly what areas of your face you have missed.  </li>
            <li> I am currently waiting for more replacement blades to arrive</li>
            <li> This is my first non-foaming shave gel and at first I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product of this type I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the smell of it, personally.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think that it is \\&quot;slick\\&quot; enough and produces more friction than the canned gel.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product</li>
            <li> to greasy and messy, not as good a product as I would like</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a little more effort to wash your face after shaving as this gel doesn&#x27;t come off as easy as a foam, but it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> If you want a great clear gel use Jack Black.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, it&#x27;s perfect for old school double edge safety razors, which really surprised me.</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased this for its &#x27;clear&#x27; effect</li>
            <li> The key to a good shave gel is for it to provide maximum lubrication on the face, but at the same time, not clog the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Clear Shave Gel for a couple years, and it&#x27;s far better than any foam, gel, or lather that I&#x27;ve used over the decades.  </li>
            <li> If the tube had a cap that screwed down or locked down, it would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> I have notest that it is best to wet the razor before the first stroke and to only lightly shake off the water during rinsing between strokes because a little water on the razor seems to help with the smoothness of each stroke.</li>
            <li> Gel,\\&quot; make sure you understand that the gel itself is not clear.</li>
            <li> I take full responsibility for not paying attention, but note the gel is clear.  </li>
            <li> the shave is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> While it indicates clear, if you scrub it into the beard it will lather up and turn white, but its not the fluffy overbearing shaving foam that totally blocks your view of what you are trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy and best of all</li>
            <li> It allows you to see your facial hair while shaving and gives a pretty smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known about this product years ago, One can pretty much shape up the goatee how one wants.</li>
            <li> this gel is great , it does not give you rash on your face and it is completely transparent , and before i was not able to shave upward but with this gel i can , and since i have been using it i have not gotten a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> Went back to shaving cream which works just fine.  </li>
            <li> The foam is better for those razors, and adds extra protection, while i felt like this gel doesn&#x27;t provide enough protection for 5 razors to scrape one patch of skin in quick succession.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than foam shaving creams.</li>
            <li> so I find this to be much cheaper than even bargain price foam.</li>
            <li> Much easier to trim beard neckline using this versus shaving cream</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works well but has way too much fragrance</li>
            <li> I conclusion I really like the ProGlide gel.</li>
            <li> so i was very disapointed</li>
            <li> and if you try to scrub it too much the foam appears which defeats the purpose of it being &amp;#34;CLEAR&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turns out it is very genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it was for me the price showd not be so high!</li>
            <li> I started shaving my face with this stuff and then started squirting it all over my body to see if I could get back to being baby smooth.</li>
            <li> , this stuff is very slippery and protects your face well from shave irritation.  </li>
            <li> You have to really lather it</li>
            <li> It seems to lubricate very well, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would expect.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> really get a close shave</li>
            <li> cheap price to pay for the initial kit but</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave with this product and I can use it in conjunction with my electric razor as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this get.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it goes on and how it works.</li>
            <li> I actually like using it more than my old school shaving cream and boar bristle brush</li>
            <li> Given the host of negativity in the other reviews, which I read after I purchased the gel, I was very surprised to find I enjoyed my shave very much.  </li>
            <li> Very like the idea that you can see where to shave, but don&#x27;t like how it feels and a main reason for 2 stars is it starts to drip from a blade and become very sticky on the surface.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this product made those spots go by noticeably more smoothly due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up.</li>
            <li> The double pack makes for a great value and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> (There&#x27;s still that tricky area right under the nose that it&#x27;s hard to get shaved nice and close, but since a Hitler moustache isn&#x27;t really an option, I guess I&#x27;ll just live with that.)</li>
            <li> enjoy while you can(hopefully for a long time).</li>
            <li> This was the first clear gel I&#x27;ve tried to use.</li>
            <li> My wife later picked up the can and asked why I was throwing out a full can.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I was surprised.</li>
            <li> When used in conjunction with the new battery operated gilette 5 blade straight razor</li>
            <li> It probably took twice as many strokes to get half as close a shave as I would have with Edge.  </li>
            <li> Less time shaving foam off my face more time</li>
            <li> So, you have to be careful where you shave with this because it is easy to lose track of where you have been.</li>
            <li> Used foam gel previously like this better once was used to it.</li>
            <li> Main reason for this purchase was to find something that didn&#x27;t have metal can that will rust and stain the shower...  </li>
            <li> I found it more difficult to use, not lathering as well, needing to use more water to try and make it lather.</li>
            <li> Blade glides smoothly across my face and since it goes on clear even though it is tinted slightly blue</li>
            <li> and it looked decent.</li>
            <li> One thing--even if it doesn&#x27;t look like you need to, rinse your razor as you always have, since the whiskers are getting cut and clogging the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose everybody&#x27;s face is different, but it seems to me the razor glides more smoothly with this clear gel, especially on the second pass.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is my very first shaving substance that I have personally used.</li>
            <li> When I say smooth, I mean really smooth.</li>
            <li> Also it leaked out and made a mess on the sink top.</li>
            <li> I can recommend it highly</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend it  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So smart to have clear gel</li>
            <li> But it really isn&#x27;t a drawback, since the gel keeps your face slick and makes for a very smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> You need little more than they say but does spread all over.</li>
            <li> It does leave a rather slimy residue on my razor that makes it require a little more cleaning effort during shaving.</li>
            <li> So in my opinion the texture could have been a little more dense and scrub-able so you can prepare your skin before shaving.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to see after it&#x27;s applied but easier to remove and doesn&#x27;t clog the razor.</li>
            <li> I like that the gel is somewhat clear so you can trim without taking to much off</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive beard and I am really susceptible to razor burn and this seems to prevent that problem.</li>
            <li> Better than shaving cream, although if one rubs product on face overly long, it can lather up but not a big deal</li>
            <li> Never used this before; always the normal aerosol.</li>
            <li> Overall though the Gillette regular gel provides better lubrication and protection than the Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, and a tiny blob of this gel spreads easily over my entire face.  </li>
            <li> Going right back to Nivea.</li>
            <li> but thise does leave your skin feeling smooth and doesn&#x27;t make as much of a mess as some that seem to lather up almost too much.</li>
            <li> It also drops into the sink and doesn&#x27;t wash down the drain as easily as the foam.</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair and this gel is great on it.</li>
            <li> It was a new sensation.</li>
            <li> I would expect when shaving a new part of the body.</li>
            <li> I could not find it in the stores where I live.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a year now, and it&#x27;s worth the extra $ for me to have clear gel.  </li>
            <li> After using cream and regular gel, this was very slippery and hand was very lubricated.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving a VERY TOUGH beard that grows like wild.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Its very difficult to rate this product, on one hand it does a very good job on shaving my face, but here is the issue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lol sorry they require a certain amount of words to leave a feed back</li>
            <li> It is blue-tinted; it goes on clear when applied to your face -- those of you with dye issues, take note!</li>
            <li> You have to realize that after you spread it on your face, it is CLEAR!  </li>
            <li> No more rust stains in the shower :)</li>
            <li> It did turn out to be more expensive, but depending on how much and how often you shave, you will get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It does no lather like shaving cream, but would probably be better suited for a male with facial hair they leave verses shaving entire face.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my legs and my significant other uses it to shave every day.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that Target has not carried this product for months, but very happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> It is true you can see through the gel to where you are shaving, but that has never really been a problem with a face I shave almost everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, this gel is so slippery and messy, it leaks all over the razor and the hand holding it - making it easy to drop your razor unless you wash your hand</li>
            <li> you can cover the area which you INTEND to shave but also the area you DON&#x27;T INTEND to shave; basically you run the gamut of shaving too much or too little of what you were supposed to shave, unless you get lucky</li>
            <li> You end up with a little glob between blades that a fast stream of very hot water will not release.</li>
            <li> The product is not too harsh for my sensitive skin, and it provides an easy shave without the foamy residue.</li>
            <li> I find the Remington product to provide more lubrication, and perhaps an initial slight advantage in shave smoothness.</li>
            <li> I typically use The Art of Shaving or similar products to make my shave more of an event</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I was in a big hurry I would end up with hidden shaving cream in my ear for the better part of the morning</li>
            <li> I had been using Edge gel which worked fine, but there were always a few areas that felt &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; when I shaved.</li>
            <li> I shaved before with shaving cream, I would always after shaving, wash the shaving cream all off, to reveal certain parts I hadn&#x27;t shaved well enough, and then would have to do it over again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little more effort to rinse off, but no big deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great for the dryness and cold temperatures of winter.</li>
            <li> Clear Shave gel</li>
            <li> It goes on clear</li>
            <li> Goes on practically clear</li>
            <li> ...goes on clear...</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear (</li>
            <li> no pun intended): When you read \\&quot;Clear Shave</li>
            <li> As a matter of opinion, if/when you use this, you&#x27;ll ask yourself why you never used clear shave gel to begin with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slimy, but is as advertised, a relatively clear shaving gel for man-scaping.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> I ordered Gillette Clear Shave Gel because I like Gillette products</li>
            <li> B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz.</li>
            <li> Used to use old school shaving cream until I got this from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> With the Remington product, I end up having to frequently change blades.</li>
            <li> Turned my whole face red!</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> this may not be for: Anybody who does a complete shave</li>
            <li> Get a reasonable priced razor, make it last longer with this gel!!</li>
            <li> Three choice beard length heads allow for a short to reasonable length of beard to be achieved.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam, which is strange at first, but this allows one to see any missed spots.</li>
            <li> I never have razor burn and it gives a baby soft result.</li>
            <li> Soft, I use it for my legs.</li>
            <li> Will be using this product a few more times and will update if I see different results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in Afghanistan and a fresh shave is a requirement on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> More expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> FYI, if you apply enough and with the right amount of pressure, you can get it to lather and lose some of its transparency, but only marginally so.</li>
            <li> This is a little like putting sex lube on your face, I had to wash my hands really good after putting it on because they felt so slick afterward.  </li>
            <li> Cool product, it&#x27;s hard to get straight lines when trimming my face</li>
            <li> This is a unique experience &amp; beats any other similar products.</li>
            <li> I would rate it higher but it really didn&#x27;t perform above and beyond what other shaving products do.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty much what we&#x27;ve all come to expect from Gillette when given the chance to make a shave gel that could actually benefit men: a product full of unnecessary chemicals, fragrances and dyes.</li>
            <li> Stays slick and smooth throughout the shave.</li>
            <li> This product initially throws you off because it doesn&#x27;t foam up, but once you are used to it you fall in love with it because you can actually see what you are doing (hairs that you are missing etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Iv only used gillette shaving cream so the smell is nothing new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other nice thing is that you can go over the same spot with your razor and it remains slick.</li>
            <li> The key is the non-foaming clear application.</li>
            <li> The gel is slick, lubrication and glide were terrific, and my face is smooth.  </li>
            <li> No drag</li>
            <li> Works very well and is economical to use (a small amount goes a long way).</li>
            <li> If you shave out of the shower, I would just wet my hands really well</li>
            <li> product is convenient as far as its design and ease of application however, it has left me with razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deployed to an FPO address where they don&#x27;t sell the pressurized Gillette shave gel, and there are apparently shipping restrictions as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this product, because I was using the canned foam before and it would always end up stuck in or behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> and/or on a constant basis; I mean you can use it, and it would feel and work incredibly, but it would possibly be redundant considering you may not be or may not need to be specific about what/where you&#x27;re shaving, unless you&#x27;re concerned about sideburns or any other facial hair.</li>
            <li> product states clearly on the back &amp;#34;NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN FACIAL HAIR TRIMMING&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> The fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up means you can see what you&#x27;ve cut off and what you have left very clearly, so it reduces potential irritation from re-working the same part of your face.</li>
            <li> Let me back off a minute and say that I am not allergic to any of the ingredients, I do not ever have dry skin, and I don&#x27;t dig, twist, scrape, or otherwise abuse my face with my razor in any way that is not commonly associated with shaving.</li>
            <li> not worth that much.</li>
            <li> Before using this, I&#x27;d never even known there was such a thing as clear shave gel, and when I did, I&#x27;d assumed it was more expensive.</li>
            <li> Also worth mentioning, a little goes a long way with this</li>
            <li> I have been using this and a lather type gel to shave my head the last few weeks and find they are pretty even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d run out of my usual Edge gel, which I love, and for a few shaves I was simply using bar soap to lather my beard.  </li>
            <li> This was the first gel I&#x27;d found in non-aerosol form, and despite the fact that it was the only product NOT marked down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion shaving cream for years and decided to give Gillette Fusion Clear Shave Gel a try because the bottle is soft and takes less space than the traditional aerosol shaving cream in a</li>
            <li> I squeezed out the same amount I normally use, which only covered half my beard.  </li>
            <li> that some of the other clear shave gels I&#x27;ve used do.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, I like the fact that the shaving gel is clear.</li>
            <li> Not attesting to the product, just a warning to be very careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You have to use a large amount to shave a small area.</li>
            <li> Water really activates the gel and makes it really slick.  </li>
            <li> It also gives a much smoother, closer shave than anything I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It goes on almost clear (slight foam if you lather vigorously)</li>
            <li> I could do without the typical loud mens cologne scent, but it&#x27;s gone by the time I leave the shower.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it work really well by allowing my to see where I was shaving, but the gel was so slick that shaving became a breeze!  </li>
            <li> I love this clear Shaving Gel because I can see exactly what I&#x27;m shaving and doesn&#x27;t have the horrible smell</li>
            <li> It turned a little cloudy when I put it on, so it wasn&#x27;t perfectly clear, but it was not like I couldn&#x27;t see what I was doing while shaving.  </li>
            <li> Used the shave gel and can&#x27;t get past the feeling I&#x27;m using high end soap.</li>
            <li> [later I read the instructions and realized you only needed a little bit the size of a nickle or smaller].  </li>
            <li> After my mirror array was set up, I was able to see the thicket on my back and was genuinely shocked at how hairy it actually was.</li>
            <li> I still get random razor burns and shave doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it would with the cream.</li>
            <li> Closest shave in a long time.</li>
            <li> Its not necessarily what i expected.</li>
            <li> And what dangers does this product impose upon the user for long term use on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> In fact, if you use too much, it seems to work less well: apply a thin layer, and it goes on clear; rub it in, and it turns white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found much less post-shave irritation in general using this.</li>
            <li> I would never go back to shaving cream or other shaving gels again.  </li>
            <li> On my first use I got a pretty bad cut.</li>
            <li> My face still felt dry and I had cuts from using it.</li>
            <li> (dry shaves irritate my skin).</li>
            <li> Like the old Brill Cream add said, &amp;#34; a little dab will do you&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Only down side</li>
            <li> I felt like I left half of this Gillette gel still in the bottle even after squeezing the life out of it.</li>
            <li> No wonder I have been so hot for the past 20 years (even in the dead of winter!).</li>
            <li> My previous submittal related to the shaver.</li>
            <li> I typically use shaving traditional gel in an aerosol can, but I thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> My skin also got very dry each time I was using it.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well and lasts so long.</li>
            <li> Terrible product - needs your skin to be moist before applying and dries out quickly if you leave it on for more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> All I got was a little squirt, enough for one shave and that was the end.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to putting it on as it is different than what I am used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel that is hard to see and is quite slippery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it&#x27;s hard to see what parts of your face have been shaved because the gel is clear.  </li>
            <li> The clear gell makes it hard to see where you have shaved.</li>
            <li> So, I squeezed out a second dollop to cover the other half.  </li>
            <li> Further, my neck looked like I had taken a piece of steel wool and ground it into my skin repeatedly for at least ten minutes.</li>
            <li> This is also loaded with Gillette&#x27;s standard shave-gel fragrance which you&#x27;ll either love or hate but either way, serves absolutely no purpose.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and in 3 weeks I only used 1/3 of the bottle which is 1</li>
            <li> With careful practice, you can get a close shave with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> quite disliked this and prefer regular shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> This shaving gel performed just as expected.  </li>
            <li> I empty this into my dispenser I have in the shower.</li>
            <li> Quite a bit of the shaving cream gel leaked out when my luggage received rough handling by the airline.</li>
            <li> The product turned out to be a total waste for me, This is not a shaving gel or cream, it gives me no smoothness to my skin for shaving.</li>
            <li> Next, the skin on my neck began molting because it was so incredibly dried out.</li>
            <li> No real difference in shave.</li>
            <li> I found that this product did not prevent razor drag which is what I assumed it was for.  </li>
            <li> That turned out to be a mistake, because the cap does not lock down or screw down, and is only held in place by a plastic hinge.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed less razor burns and bleeding with this shave gel over previous foaming gels.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you have a tough beard or have problems with sensitivity and razorburn afterwards.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> And when you shave it off, there is very little residue left to rinse.    </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the gel several times over the past two months and considering  the fact that razors like the Gillette Mach3 are reusable and have three blades close together one must keep the tap running under pressure for some time to wash the greasy gel off.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I do not use this shave gel as much as other shave gels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t help the razor glide as smoothly as other shaving gels.</li>
            <li> and I noticed this Shaving Gel displayed with the other products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this stuff, but I swear it helps give me a closer shave than other gels or foams.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Amazon doubled the price between my first order and my renewal.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other &amp;#34;Gels&amp;#34;, but nothing is like this</li>
            <li> The first time you use this, it will just feel wrong.</li>
            <li> a sloppy mess, I really need to switch to \\&quot;clear\\&quot; everything: deodorant, toothpaste, shaving cream, etc...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the gold standard of clear shave gels, works well and isn&#x27;t loaded with all of Gillette&#x27;s fail.</li>
            <li> because one of the two was half empty</li>
            <li> I hate lather, but enjoy gels and creams for the lubrication, and to some degree smell, but you can actually whisk this up to a bit of a froth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Pack of 2 was only a single tube, either the description is wrong or only one of the two was shipped.  </li>
            <li> The reason it takes longer is because you have to apply it to your face and the blade, and then get both of them a little wet to make it work.</li>
            <li> Only negative</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide Clear Men&#x27;s Shaving Gel was &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but not great.</li>
            <li> He says it doesn&#x27;t create the same comfort as a thick foam.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my girlfriend so she can use it to shave her jungle down stairs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product at all, it left a film on my skin when I shaved the area that was very slick and slippery.  </li>
            <li> Fusion ProGlide was even less foamy than the bar of soap I&#x27;d used.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to traditional shaving creams or gels this is quite weird and different.</li>
            <li> I bought this for airline travel, because the tube weighs less.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference and must have told half the people at the convention about my discovery.  </li>
            <li> so you can see what you are doing in the morning while you are half asleep.  </li>
            <li> Also because its so concentrated you use a lot less and waste a lot less.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my delicate skin and doesn&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s less messy.</li>
            <li> A lot less messy than the foam.</li>
            <li> It might have done a little</li>
            <li> The gel itself does little to protect or lubricate my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no more drying than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If you want lather you can get with just a little water.</li>
            <li> I need to apply a lot of the gel to shave a little</li>
            <li> Wish it were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> My husband hated it so I&#x27;m using it on my legs and its OK.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t facilitate shaving so much as it hindered it.  </li>
            <li> were you can get a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> so I guess it won&#x27;t go completely to waste.</li>
            <li> maybe works if you are a teen with a few stray hairs to trim but worthless for real man hair.</li>
            <li> I increased my rating by one star after using this for a few months.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought a few tubes of this to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Here as it is very thin and clear when it is on you, you can see any hairs unshaved, and get them, without washing it off to see them.</li>
            <li> It is very slick and stays wet, but allows you to see your face underneath it so you can shave without messing up your beard.</li>
            <li> Seems to be runny and not easy to use.</li>
            <li> The only worse thing about this product than the protection it doesn&#x27;t give your face, is the fact that it comes with two bottles; now I have to find people that I don&#x27;t like to pawn the remaining gallon of this useless blue goop off on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You use very little; the packaging suggests just a nickel-sized amount on your palm.</li>
            <li> Takes VERY little amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li> in small print...</li>
            <li> Makes shaving a &#x27;slick&#x27; event.</li>
            <li> In the past, even after shaving, I could always feel a bit of underlying stubble and roughness.</li>
            <li> My upper lip and chin area just feel weirdly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No aerosol waste or environmental impact!</li>
            <li> I usually use Edge Gel.</li>
            <li> This made it difficult to pull the skin on my face to shave some of the harder areas (such as behind the angle of the jaw).  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m past the whipped-cream-effect of ordinary canned shave creams.  </li>
            <li> : I use an electric razor, usually in the shower</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a trick to that Gillette must educate us because I feel it&#x27;s a serious drawback and waste of water.</li>
            <li> Not very good for face shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this zero stars if I could, because it&#x27;s worse less than nothing.  </li>
            <li> I get a smoother, less irritating shave using this gel as well.</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> The gel clogs up between the blades and is hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> If your old or have bad eyes &amp; can&#x27;t see where to shave then</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t Gillette catch up with the times and offer fragrance-free (or at least lightly-scented) products?  </li>
            <li> but when I put it on it clogs my manual 5 blade razor and is too thick to wash off of the razor</li>
            <li> The problem is that I am probably half-gorilla, and I have hair that is thick like rope.</li>
            <li> Not intrusive or thick at all.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the clear shave gel.</li>
            <li> so I tried Amazon prime and it&#x27;s less expensive</li>
            <li> I maintain a beard, and regularly shave my neck beard to keep my actual beard from looking disgusting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on expensive razors.</li>
            <li> try it, let&#x27;s keep it in production for at least the rest of my lifetime!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to shave with this gel.</li>
            <li> Its the worse shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> so I suggest U get it on Amazon where U can get everything and 99% of the time the least expensive and</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of those symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot worse</li>
            <li> Actually worse, this takes longer to wash off than soap.  </li>
            <li> am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst shaving product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but I hate it less than I used to.</li>
            <li> It becomes difficult to use tap handle or shave after handling it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> , I thought there was something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Shaver works well though the replacement blades are expensive.  </li>
            <li> get me wrong, I like the product</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find it in stores.  </li>
            <li> gliding on it cutting hairs.  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars for a close show, however unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is not foaming at all, unlike the canned version, which makes shaving very painful and irritating.</li>
            <li> If I had known how bad this product was, I would not have paid any price for it, even if they were giving it away.    </li>
            <li> Its not so bad.</li>
            <li> Caused a horrible skin reaction on my neck, and I mean horrible.  </li>
            <li> I usually hate anything with a scent</li>
            <li> This shave gel was worthless.</li>
            <li> used to hate shaving--</li>
            <li> well, I still hate shaving--</li>
            <li> It is the worst shaving product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Once the blades become clogged, you start getting terrible shaves.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Beware this is the worst shaving gel/cream on the market</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s something kinda satisfying about actually watching the hair getting shaved off, but that&#x27;s not the real reason I like this stuff the best. I had been using Edge gel which worked fine, but there were always a few areas that felt &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; when I shaved. To my surprise, this product made those spots go by noticeably more smoothly due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up. So big points there for not just being handy for beard edging but for genuinely improving the shave in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little more effort to rinse off, but no big deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this product...just wish there was a way to keep my family from squeezing out so much!!  a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Tried saving money by purchasing this stuff and ended up wasting it. This is by far the worst shaving product I have ever used. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d get a closer and more comfortable shave if I used Comet! Going right back to Nivea.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Clear Shave gel, I love and does leave a clean shave and 100% recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My husband hated it so I&#x27;m using it on my legs and its OK.</li>
            <li> Great shaves at last.</li>
            <li> Once you get it...in small print...It says &amp;#34;not recommended for facial hair&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t see that in the online description! Who would buy shaving gel and not think it&#x27;s for facial hair. OMG! what hair is it for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this zero stars if I could, because it&#x27;s worse less than nothing.  I&#x27;d run out of my usual Edge gel, which I love, and for a few shaves I was simply using bar soap to lather my beard.  This method was marginally better than nothing at all, but far superior to Fusion ProGlide.  I was looking to try a non-aerosol that I could take in my carry-on on flights.  This was the first gel I&#x27;d found in non-aerosol form, and despite the fact that it was the only product NOT marked down where I purchased it, I paid full price.  If I had known how bad this product was, I would not have paid any price for it, even if they were giving it away.    First of all, it comes out of the tube looking very much like Edge does out of the can.  But that&#x27;s where the similarity ends.  I squeezed out the same amount I normally use, which only covered half my beard.  So, I squeezed out a second dollop to cover the other half.  Once you apply Edge gel to your beard, it foams up like traditional shaving creams.  And when you shave it off, there is very little residue left to rinse.    Fusion ProGlide was even less foamy than the bar of soap I&#x27;d used.  It didn&#x27;t facilitate shaving so much as it hindered it.  It probably took twice as many strokes to get half as close a shave as I would have with Edge.  But the final insult was at the end of the shave, when I went to remove the residue, it must have taken a gallon or more of water to do so.  And even then, my face felt greasy until I wiped the remaining goo off with a towel.    I can&#x27;t understand how anyone could give this 5 stars (or even 2 stars).  It is the worst shaving product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, good price</li>
            <li> Amazing - better than any other shaving gel that I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> this is the easyest smoothest shave gel/cream I have ever used.  I buy in bulk since I orginally bought at big box stores but it vanished one day.  I really think this is great stuff........enjoy while you can(hopefully for a long time).</li>
            <li> Yes, the gel is clear and allows the razor to move smoothly on the skin but it doesn&#x27;t wash off the blades well after shaving is done. I&#x27;ve used the gel several times over the past two months and considering  the fact that razors like the Gillette Mach3 are reusable and have three blades close together one must keep the tap running under pressure for some time to wash the greasy gel off. If there&#x27;s a trick to that Gillette must educate us because I feel it&#x27;s a serious drawback and waste of water. For that reason I can only award 3 stars.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than foam shaving creams. A little goes a long way so I find this to be much cheaper than even bargain price foam. I get a smoother, less irritating shave using this gel as well.</li>
            <li> This product is a gel and not a foam. I didnt like this product initially, particularly back when i was using gillette fusion proglide razors. The foam is better for those razors, and adds extra protection, while i felt like this gel doesn&#x27;t provide enough protection for 5 razors to scrape one patch of skin in quick succession. Interestingly enough, it&#x27;s perfect for old school double edge safety razors, which really surprised me. It goes on clear so it&#x27;s easy to see where you need to shave, which is handy because double edge safety razors require a lot more tact than the brute force method of multi blade razors. I actually like using it more than my old school shaving cream and boar bristle brush</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews that the gel is a really good product.  That being said,  the last can of the profusion proglide in a pressurized can did not have any pressure.  All I got was a little squirt, enough for one shave and that was the end.  I thought the nozzle may be clogged and soaked the top of the can in hot water for a while but no change.  I threw the can away.  My wife later picked up the can and asked why I was throwing out a full can.  I told her, but being a wife, she didn&#x27;t believe me.  She tried for a while but gave up and said &amp;#34;I guess you&#x27;re right.&amp;#34;  That kind of took the sting out of having a full can but no way of getting the contents out.  Maybe Gillette could send me  a full can and I would feel even better.</li>
            <li> It might have done a little but it did not replace shaving cream. My face still felt dry and I had cuts from using it.</li>
            <li> Ultra smooth shave. Light scent. Goes on practically clear so it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;re trying to shave. Only negative I can point out is that it&#x27;s easy to use too much of this product when you&#x27;re accustomed to a product that foams up. This one does not foam at all unless you use WAY more than what is necessary for the job.</li>
            <li> When used in conjunction with the new battery operated gilette 5 blade straight razor this unbelievable combination gives the greatest shave ever! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a very smooth, close, shave without the hassle.It is a new and very welcome experience.</li>
            <li> No more rust stains in the shower :)</li>
            <li> Great Product! Much easier to trim beard neckline using this versus shaving cream...goes on clear...able to see what you are shaving.</li>
            <li> Better than shaving cream, although if one rubs product on face overly long, it can lather up but not a big deal</li>
            <li> Literally one of the coolest shaving gels i&#x27;ve ever used. The product is not too harsh for my sensitive skin, and it provides an easy shave without the foamy residue. It&#x27;s simple to use and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much what we&#x27;ve all come to expect from Gillette when given the chance to make a shave gel that could actually benefit men: a product full of unnecessary chemicals, fragrances and dyes. It&#x27;s as underwhelming as the rest of the Gillette shave gel line.  Let&#x27;s be clear (no pun intended): When you read \\&quot;Clear Shave Gel,\\&quot; make sure you understand that the gel itself is not clear. It is blue-tinted; it goes on clear when applied to your face -- those of you with dye issues, take note! This is also loaded with Gillette&#x27;s standard shave-gel fragrance which you&#x27;ll either love or hate but either way, serves absolutely no purpose. The gel itself does little to protect or lubricate my face. When using this product, I got cuts using a brand new Fusion ProGlide razor -- the first time I&#x27;ve been cut with a ProGlide in more than a year of usage.  If you want a \\&quot;clear\\&quot; shave gel, consider [[ASIN:B005ACNPLO Remington King of Shaves Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz. (Pack of 2)]]. It&#x27;s the gold standard of clear shave gels, works well and isn&#x27;t loaded with all of Gillette&#x27;s fail.</li>
            <li> Caused a horrible skin reaction on my neck, and I mean horrible.  Not attesting to the product, just a warning to be very careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is excellent shave gel if you have a beard that you want to keep nicely groomed. It is very slick and stays wet, but allows you to see your face underneath it so you can shave without messing up your beard.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is my very first shaving substance that I have personally used. I like this gel because it goes onto the skin clear, allowing for easy visibility as to what you are shaving. I use this with the Gillette Fusion Proglide and the combination is great! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Always used foam. I decided to try Fusion Proglide system with gel and was impressed. Just bought two more tubes</li>
            <li> I noticed that another customer had a similar experience with this product.  Upon use of this product, my skin broke out in a burning rash.  I have never had this experience with any Gillette products.  I could not use the product any more as it caused too much pain.  I switched back to an aerosol gel product and the rash cleared up in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Cool product, it&#x27;s hard to get straight lines when trimming my face but this makes it very easy to do!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT FOR MY DAD AND I TO TRY PLEASE GET SOME IF U LIKE FOR YOUR HUSBAND OR BOYFRIEND OR FATHER OR JUST U! WE BOTH THINKS ITS AMAZING AS THE SOAP IS CLEAR AND EASY TO SHAVE WITH! U CAN SEE EVERYTHING BETTER TO SHAVE!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes that he can see what hair he needs to cut using this &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; gel.</li>
            <li> great product if you need to make clean lines for beard configurations.. A+</li>
            <li> Loved the way it works. No drag what so ever. The only problem was that you can&#x27;t get the whiskers washed out of the razor because of all the gel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. It allows you to see your facial hair while shaving and gives a pretty smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I used the goatee saver today and it was very good at shaping my van dyke, very good symmetry. Overall, I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Husband Didn&#x27;t like this at all</li>
            <li> My husband did not like this at all. It broke his face out.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it , and 2 nice size squeeze bottles came instead of one, i love that.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to traditional shaving creams or gels this is quite weird and different. It&#x27;s clear, it doesn&#x27;t foam up much, and it feels more like sticky hair gel than shaving cream. However - it really works! The fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up means you can see what you&#x27;ve cut off and what you have left very clearly, so it reduces potential irritation from re-working the same part of your face. I&#x27;ve found much less post-shave irritation in general using this. I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed with this product.  I take full responsibility for not paying attention, but note the gel is clear.  For someone with light colored hair, how do you know where you have shaved already? Also, if you use a shave brush, this doesn&#x27;t work well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought me this as a gift : http://www.stjamesoflondon.com/mandarin-patchouli-shave-tub and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Yes, it is significantly more expensive, but it lasts forever.  I felt like I left half of this Gillette gel still in the bottle even after squeezing the life out of it.</li>
            <li> Used to use old school shaving cream until I got this from Bzzagent.  Best shave gel ever,  I will not turn back</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to do and does it well. I prefer the tube over the aerosol foam were you can get a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like it. Its the worse shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. Its slimy and it doesn&#x27;t lubricate enough for a good shave.</li>
            <li> better than shaving cream in shower</li>
            <li> The key to a good shave gel is for it to provide maximum lubrication on the face, but at the same time, not clog the razor. This product hits the perfect balance. It provides exceptional lubrication, and at the same time is water soluble enough that it washes out of the razor effectively. Some shave gels quickly clog the razor, and I am pleased to see that this one does not. The aroma is pleasing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A key issue is to compare this to the Remington King of Shaves Alphagel product. I find the Remington product to provide more lubrication, and perhaps an initial slight advantage in shave smoothness. The issue I have is that the remington product QUICKLY clogs multi blade razors. You end up with a little glob between blades that a fast stream of very hot water will not release. Once the blades become clogged, you start getting terrible shaves. With the Remington product, I end up having to frequently change blades. So, I have to give this Gillette product the thumbs up over the Remington product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, this is the best shave gel I have found, and provides the smoothest possible shave, without clogging your blade.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good!</li>
            <li> Very like the idea that you can see where to shave, but don&#x27;t like how it feels and a main reason for 2 stars is it starts to drip from a blade and become very sticky on the surface. Not using it</li>
            <li> I love this as my shaving gel. It gives a great close shave and smells wonderful. I shave my head often and it works better then anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a very strong smell that reminds me the 1960&#x27;s manly man fragrances -- overpowering and obnoxious.  I should know to stay away from any Gillette \\&quot;fragrances\\&quot;.  Why can&#x27;t Gillette catch up with the times and offer fragrance-free (or at least lightly-scented) products?  BTW, it&#x27;s doubly the shame because otherwise the product works great.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving a &#x27;slick&#x27; event. Works very well and is economical to use (a small amount goes a long way). Need to rinse my hands occasionally, to maintain a good grip on the shaver. But it really isn&#x27;t a drawback, since the gel keeps your face slick and makes for a very smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> Turned my whole face red!</li>
            <li> My Package of Two was just one</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known about this product years ago, One can pretty much shape up the goatee how one wants.</li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s toughest beard. It hurts to shave. When I finish shaving, I still look like I need to shave. I have tried so many products I have lost count. Someone on Amazon recommended Billy Jealousy. I read about the product and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide was one of the products listed as a &amp;#34;similar product.&amp;#34; When I was at Kroger, I saw the Gillette ProGlide and decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I was surprised. I did lessen the discomfort some but not all. The surprising part was the feel of my face. My face was smooth and soft. I kept feeling it. It was a new sensation. In the past, even after shaving, I could always feel a bit of underlying stubble and roughness. Not now. I keep reaching up to my face just to feel the smoothness. When I say smooth, I mean really smooth. Girly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still prepping with soap/hot water/brush as a softening measure. I put a little(a nickle sized squirt) ProGlide in my cup and apply it with a brush. I don&#x27;t rinse the soap from my brush. I just kinda let it mix. During the shave, the ProGlide actually feels &amp;#34;gummy.&amp;#34; It starts to get kinda sticky. I go over some spots again with hot water and the brush without rinsing the ProGlide off the brush. I don&#x27;t shave over the same spots, just use my brush again to kinda rewet some spots.  It does not clog my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t use it exactly as intended, this process is working quite well. So far, I am impressed and quite happy with the results. Even my trouble spots, the places that seem the most difficult to remove stubble, are much smoother. My upper lip and chin area just feel weirdly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product easily gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It makes my electric shaver glide smoothly and it just feels good on my skin. I usually hate anything with a scent but I have grown to love the scent of this shave gel.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower and this product definitely improves the experience. I have been shaving for sixty years and have seen many changes over that time. Most of them have been in the equipment we use to get a clean and smooth shave. This is the best change I&#x27;ve seen or more appropriately felt in the lubricant that facilitates the shave.</li>
            <li> This shave gel was worthless. Way to slippery and slimey. I gave it to my girlfriend so she can use it to shave her jungle down stairs.</li>
            <li> to greasy and messy, not as good a product as I would like</li>
            <li> Very good product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am always amazed how Gillette keeps coming up with better blades, etc. This product falls into that category. U now can see were U R shaving without the foam in the way and the shave is just as good if not better. Hard to find so I suggest U get it on Amazon where U can get everything and 99% of the time the least expensive and if U R a Prime Member FREE SHIPPING and if U do the math on becoming a Prime Member and order a lot like we do U save a ton it get your stuff in two business days! Sweet!</li>
            <li> I love this shave gel by Gillette it allows me to lather up and get a good clean shave. This product is awesome!</li>
            <li> Love it! Best shaving gel I have ever used.  I can recommend it highly</li>
            <li> The best shaving gel I have found yet.</li>
            <li> Works well but has way too much fragrance</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide Clear Men&#x27;s Shaving Gel was &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but not great. Maybe it is just because I like to actually see where the shaving cream is on my face. I do not use this shave gel as much as other shave gels.</li>
            <li> I tried Fusion Proglide, King of Shaves Alphagel, and Niva Shave Cream. The Proglide is the best for me it has more lubricants which is easier on my face. Some reviewers mentioned some kind of rash or burning. I have not experienced any of those symptoms. My experience has been that this gel is better that the Barbasol Original that I have used for years. I am using the Fusion razor and perhaps this is why it is working so well for me. I shave in the direction of the hair growth and not against. I have notest that it is best to wet the razor before the first stroke and to only lightly shake off the water during rinsing between strokes because a little water on the razor seems to help with the smoothness of each stroke. One mention the Alphagel was second best and it rinsed out of the blades a little better. However the Proglide was better at protecting my face with better lubrication. I learned to rinse out the blades better by reversing the head as a I rinsed the blades so it pushed the hair out from the back through the front instead of pushing the hair through the front out the back. I conclusion I really like the ProGlide gel. I believe I will order a 20 year supply because I have a feeling that it will be discontinued because I have a hunch it is not popular, which is a shame because it is an a great product. I use it to travel with and I switch it to a better container. Basically I put it in a 3 oz St Ives travel body wash container. I shave everyday and in 3 weeks I only used 1/3 of the bottle which is 1 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck,&lt;br /&gt;Matthew</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s different than foam shave cream. Kind of hard to see after it&#x27;s applied but easier to remove and doesn&#x27;t clog the razor. You need little more than they say but does spread all over. Makes your face feel smooth so bought more and think this will replace foam shave cream for me.</li>
            <li> I love Fusion ProGlide Men&#x27;s Shaving Gel (5.9 oz. 2 pack).  I would never go back to shaving cream or other shaving gels again.  I&#x27;ve used this for about a year now, and it&#x27;s worth the extra $ for me to have clear gel.  Smells good and no problems with my very sensitive skin.  I save 15% off with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save Program.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;shaving gel&amp;#34; is not helpful. I tried using extra amounts just to use it up. I even used the matching disposable ProGlide razors. I tried different razors brands, different angles and varying amounts of gel. It is better than nothing but I found regular soap to be a smoother easier shave. It almost seems more difficult to rinse from the razor, if that is possible.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again and I would not recommend to anyone using disposable razors.</li>
            <li> 1st time using a gel to shave my head during the summertime. It&#x27;s awesome. The best. It only takes a lil squeeze.</li>
            <li> This is a unique experience &amp; beats any other similar products. I used one &amp; ordered 10 of them. Its especially best when you use it as 1st course &amp; you may use a cream/gel for the 2nd time shave. I enjoy it every day.</li>
            <li> because one of the two was half empty and i never had a problem with this before so i was very disapointed</li>
            <li> Didnt realize what this was when I ordered it. It doesn&#x27;t do a good job, unfortunately. Yes, you can see what your shaving...it just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the clear shave gel. After using cream and regular gel, this was very slippery and hand was very lubricated. I should have used a cup and a shaving brush. I will not use this again and will stick to traditional shaving cream or gel. It becomes difficult to use tap handle or shave after handling it. Had to wash hand thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Nice gel! Better shaving with it!</li>
            <li> It seems most of the criticism for this product are from people that thought this was a lathering cream.  It is a gel, but personally, I use creams without lather.  I hate lather, but enjoy gels and creams for the lubrication, and to some degree smell, but you can actually whisk this up to a bit of a froth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is merely okay for me, hence 4 stars, but otherwise I have had no issues with this gel.  My current favorite is Spelck&#x27;s product, a smell my wife loves as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- lubricates nicely&lt;br /&gt;- smells like soap</li>
            <li> Used to use the gillette hydra gel, decided to try this after hearing raving reviews. Really an ingenious product since the gel is transparent, allowing you to be precise especially if your one to shape and touch your mug. For a person who prefers the clean shaven look I really didn&#x27;t get a smooth of a shave as I expected/used to. Will be using this product a few more times and will update if I see different results. I&#x27;ll be switching back to the hydra gel if not.</li>
            <li> Another product Target quit handling so I tried Amazon prime and it&#x27;s less expensive, Target handles everything else from Gillette, but not this, my favorite shave gel</li>
            <li> Before using this, I&#x27;d never even known there was such a thing as clear shave gel, and when I did, I&#x27;d assumed it was more expensive. It did turn out to be more expensive, but depending on how much and how often you shave, you will get your money&#x27;s worth. I maintain a beard, and regularly shave my neck beard to keep my actual beard from looking disgusting. The problem is, with traditional shave gels/creams/lathers/soaps/etc. you can cover the area which you INTEND to shave but also the area you DON&#x27;T INTEND to shave; basically you run the gamut of shaving too much or too little of what you were supposed to shave, unless you get lucky and/or are consistent about shaving the neckline of your beard. With this though, that problem is solved, because you can see, and feel exactly what you intended to shave, and can shave accordingly. As a matter of opinion, if/when you use this, you&#x27;ll ask yourself why you never used clear shave gel to begin with. Have sensitive skin? SO-DO-I. Works just fine. FYI, if you apply enough and with the right amount of pressure, you can get it to lather and lose some of its transparency, but only marginally so. Indeed, it&#x27;ll probably never lather to the level of traditional shave gels/creams/lathers/soaps/etc. Also worth mentioning, a little goes a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who this is for: Anybody who&#x27;s trying to be precise about what/where it is they&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Who this may not be for: Anybody who does a complete shave and/or on a constant basis; I mean you can use it, and it would feel and work incredibly, but it would possibly be redundant considering you may not be or may not need to be specific about what/where you&#x27;re shaving, unless you&#x27;re concerned about sideburns or any other facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very good alternative to the pressurized can.  I actually prefer it now as I shave in the shower</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slimy, but is as advertised, a relatively clear shaving gel for man-scaping.  Fusion Pro-Glide has a pleasant scent, and gives me a pretty close shave.  It does leave a rather slimy residue on my razor that makes it require a little more cleaning effort during shaving.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream/gel there is!  My wife and I both like how smooth the face is after using the shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving and getting near the bead without shaving it (as it is clear).</li>
            <li> I have used for a few weeks now and could tell it was not as good as shaving cream after the first use.  However, I continue to use and think it is very good product.  It does no lather like shaving cream, but would probably be better suited for a male with facial hair they leave verses shaving entire face.  Since no lather, it is easier to see where you need to start.</li>
            <li> This is so-so.  It is not horrid but nothing special either.  If you can get it on a really good sale it gets the job done.  But I wouldn&#x27;t pay a lot for it nor go out of my way for it. I have used a lot worse but I have also used a lot better including from the Pro Glide line.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving a VERY TOUGH beard that grows like wild.  While it indicates clear, if you scrub it into the beard it will lather up and turn white, but its not the fluffy overbearing shaving foam that totally blocks your view of what you are trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy and best of all it makes the razor easily glide along without cuts and scraps.  The rashes i used to get are now totally gone.  Best new product i&#x27;ve gotten in a long time.  Highly recommend it if you have a tough beard or have problems with sensitivity and razorburn afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Clear Shave Gel for a couple years, and it&#x27;s far better than any foam, gel, or lather that I&#x27;ve used over the decades.  I shave in the shower, and a tiny blob of this gel spreads easily over my entire face.  It&#x27;s super-slick (like Astroglide for shaving) and doesn&#x27;t run, and doesn&#x27;t accidentally rinse off while before I&#x27;m done.  I could do without the typical loud mens cologne scent, but it&#x27;s gone by the time I leave the shower.  It&#x27;s no more drying than any other product I&#x27;ve used. I have a fairly light beard, but I&#x27;ve loaned it to a buddy with a more typical beard, and he was impressed...perhaps needed a dollop more per shave than I use. Because the gel is transparent, it&#x27;s easy to see what you&#x27;re shaving in dim shower stall lighting, and I can imagine that would be an advantage for those who are shaving below the neckline.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaving gel out there!! Makes your razor last longer! The key to shaving is lubrication, and this is the best at it! Don&#x27;t waste your time on expensive razors. Get a reasonable priced razor, make it last longer with this gel!!</li>
            <li> Lathers really well and does a good job of lubricating the skin. I use it on my legs and my significant other uses it to shave every day. It does also leave a tingly feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> best shaving cream I have ever used  i would highly recommend it  i have used it for several yrs. now</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT! I will never buy a gel shaving cream again. It is very hard to shave with this gel. I bought a two pack, and both ended up in the trash. STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great gel for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  Less time shaving foam off my face more time gliding on it cutting hairs.  Almost didn&#x27;t buy from everyone complaining about it not foaming.  I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t after using it myself.  If your old or have bad eyes &amp; can&#x27;t see where to shave then yeah that would be a problem, but thats not cause of the product its because of you.</li>
            <li> Never used this before; always the normal aerosol. But just slap it against your palm, squeeze and release, lift the palm and you have the perfect amount of cream for the shave. The almost perfect product--wish it cleaned faster from the razor in between swipes.</li>
            <li> This product feels good but when I put it on it clogs my manual 5 blade razor and is too thick to wash off of the razor so it sticks to one spot, creating a larger mound of gel in my razor.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband and he loves it , and 2 nice size squeeze bottles came instead of one, i love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks amazon for making it affordable , and possible.</li>
            <li> This was the first clear gel I&#x27;ve tried to use. I picked it up in preparation for Movember, as I wanted to try to get a close razor shave, without damaging the wonderful Moustache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel doesn&#x27;t lather up, making it easy to get your face covered and trimmed, while knowing exactly where/what you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little more effort to wash your face after shaving as this gel doesn&#x27;t come off as easy as a foam, but it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Not all shave gels are created equal and this one is definitely on the plus side.  I&#x27;ve used others that are just as good but thise does leave your skin feeling smooth and doesn&#x27;t make as much of a mess as some that seem to lather up almost too much.</li>
            <li> Much better than soap and makes your skin feel very smooth.  The double pack makes for a great value and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - so glad I was able to find it again. Please keep carrying it and I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> outstanding close shaves</li>
            <li> I have a mustache and side burns I have to keep trimmed and cut properly. This is absolutely the best product for shaving if you are having to watch your lines. I use EVERY time I shave and it provides a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Terrible product - needs your skin to be moist before applying and dries out quickly if you leave it on for more than a few seconds. Better go with a proper shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This product is not shaving cream, but rather a new kind of shaving &amp;#34;lubricant&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a clear gel that is hard to see and is quite slippery.  With careful practice, you can get a close shave with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s hard to see what parts of your face have been shaved because the gel is clear.  Additionally, this gel is so slippery and messy, it leaks all over the razor and the hand holding it - making it easy to drop your razor unless you wash your hand off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quite disliked this and prefer regular shaving cream.  I gave it two stars for a close show, however unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel performed just as expected.  I have very sensitive skin and this wasn&#x27;t an irritant.  I would rate it higher but it really didn&#x27;t perform above and beyond what other shaving products do.  Would I buy it again?  If it was the shaving gel on sale this week, sure :]</li>
            <li> This is a very good lubricating gel but it should be known that this doesn&#x27;t foam up like the normal.  So, you have to be careful where you shave with this because it is easy to lose track of where you have been.</li>
            <li> very good purchase)) exactly what I wanted.  arrived on time, actually this was my second order)) it comes in 2 pieces.</li>
            <li> This gel is the best I&#x27;d used so far ,washes right off the blade also thick enough to stay where you use it ,also good for the private spots lol sorry they require a certain amount of words to leave a feed back</li>
            <li> Not very good for face shaving</li>
            <li> 3 stars for the effort for making it smell good and making a texture a little dense. It lose the stars because the texture is not dense enough that it could prepare your skin and if you try to scrub it too much the foam appears which defeats the purpose of it being &amp;#34;CLEAR&amp;#34;. So in my opinion the texture could have been a little more dense and scrub-able so you can prepare your skin before shaving. Thats all!</li>
            <li> It´s just for the body</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been pleased with this shaving gel.  It is true you can see through the gel to where you are shaving, but that has never really been a problem with a face I shave almost everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t help the razor glide as smoothly as other shaving gels.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, it is better than normal gel shaving cream. Has a strong shaving cream type smell but I can handle it. Loved the subscribe and save option.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  When I would using regular shaving cream, I always had razor burn and it would hurt to shave.  I discovered this shaving gel and thought it would be nice to get a more precise shave around my goatee.  Not only did it work really well by allowing my to see where I was shaving, but the gel was so slick that shaving became a breeze!  I recommend shaving in the shower with a fog-free mirror.  Water really activates the gel and makes it really slick.  If you shave out of the shower, I would just wet my hands really well and then apply to it my face.  The other nice thing is that you can go over the same spot with your razor and it remains slick.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this on Amazon because I love using it in my gym bag as the gel holds up in extreme weather unlike the spray foams... Great Product and a Great Price :D</li>
            <li> The Pack of 2 was only a single tube, either the description is wrong or only one of the two was shipped.  Please explain or correct.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving gel. The lubrication is superior to the foaming gels. You can see what your doing with the razor better.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s less messy. Definitely try it out.</li>
            <li> I empty this into my dispenser I have in the shower. Works great.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Seems to be runny and not easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream and it appears to be the same as the canned [[ASIN:B004W6RZSS Fusion ProGlide]]. I bought this for airline travel, because the tube weighs less. That turned out to be a mistake, because the cap does not lock down or screw down, and is only held in place by a plastic hinge. Quite a bit of the shaving cream gel leaked out when my luggage received rough handling by the airline. If the tube had a cap that screwed down or locked down, it would have been perfect. In any case, the shaving cream is great, but the tube is not so much.</li>
            <li> What a great way to package a shaving cream!  No aerosol waste or environmental impact! Glad that Amazon still carries this item! Also provides an excellent shave!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product kind of on a whim. I usually use Edge Gel. I like this much better. It has a nice scent and a better lubricant than what I&#x27;m used to. I will be reordering when i need more.</li>
            <li> For information purposes this is NON-FOAMING shave gell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw it didn&#x27;t foam, I thought there was something wrong with it. I thought shave gell had to foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out it is very genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shaved before with shaving cream, I would always after shaving, wash the shaving cream all off, to reveal certain parts I hadn&#x27;t shaved well enough, and then would have to do it over again. Here as it is very thin and clear when it is on you, you can see any hairs unshaved, and get them, without washing it off to see them. You also can see things like your sideburns better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great value, I am just not giving it five stars, as I have just used it once, the jury is not out on it, and some of the reviews suggest there are better products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am not giving it five-stars as I think it is the responsibility of the manufacturer (Gillette) to inform people on the packaging and name for it, that it is not foaming.</li>
            <li> works great this reminds me I need to order more</li>
            <li> Clear and easy to use. See where you want to shave.  If you want lather you can get with just a little water.</li>
            <li> First time using this stuff. Didn&#x27;t expect a lot but I will be using this from now on. Closest shave in a long time.</li>
            <li> At age 72 I have been shaving for quite a while.  I was at a convention in Houston when I ran out of shaving cream.  A walk to the local Grocery at 7 AM and I noticed this Shaving Gel displayed with the other products.  Since it was not an aerosol can and I had never seen it before, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First shave I used a handful [later I read the instructions and realized you only needed a little bit the size of a nickle or smaller].  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference and must have told half the people at the convention about my discovery.  You have to realize that after you spread it on your face, it is CLEAR!  You can see what you are shaving because it isn&#x27;t buried in soapy foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, buy it! try it, let&#x27;s keep it in production for at least the rest of my lifetime!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this stuff, but I swear it helps give me a closer shave than other gels or foams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every lotion and lather out there, and this one is best for me.</li>
            <li> Good lubrication and you can see exactly were you are shaving</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product at all, it left a film on my skin when I shaved the area that was very slick and slippery.  This made it difficult to pull the skin on my face to shave some of the harder areas (such as behind the angle of the jaw).  On a bright note my wife said it is very moisturizing and enjoyed using it on her legs so I guess it won&#x27;t go completely to waste.</li>
            <li> I like that the gel is somewhat clear so you can trim without taking to much off</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even need a review from me. Anyone that tried it knows it works perfect! Excellent... If it was for me the price showd not be so high! But when I find a product that works and I need it, I&#x27;ll pay for it because it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Like shaving with soap instead of shaving cream.  Actually worse, this takes longer to wash off than soap.  Would be useful if you needed to see where the edge of your beard is</li>
            <li> Though not exactly what I am used to, this clear gel helps you get a great shave.  It allows you to see what you need to shave and the packaging allows you to use every last drop.  I find it to be a very good deal...and an even better deal when offered with a coupon.  It&#x27;s very worth the price to get the value.  It does take some getting used to, as I am used to the foaming shave gel.</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased this for its &#x27;clear&#x27; effect so i can see where I&#x27;m shaving. Its not necessarily what i expected. It does have a blue tint to it when squeezed on palm, but when applied to face it kinda just looks like soap on your face that has a slimy feel to it.  I like the smell. Iv only used gillette shaving cream so the smell is nothing new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I enjoy being able to have some type of vision to where my blade is shaving. Gives me more of a control feel to it. I enjoy the smell. Its not so bad. Only down side i can think of is the price, def. not worth that much. Might just be the only tube i&#x27;ll buy untill the price lowers.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be good because I like the razor and the blades...not the case. It doesn&#x27;t compare to foam. The gel clogs up between the blades and is hard to rinse out. It also drops into the sink and doesn&#x27;t wash down the drain as easily as the foam. On my first use I got a pretty bad cut. I&#x27;m sticking with foam!</li>
            <li> While I like using this tube to dispense the gel and the gel works nicely, it leaves a very slippery film on my skin and hands. It is so slippery that I am concerned my razor my slip out of my hand while shaving.</li>
            <li> I typically use The Art of Shaving or similar products to make my shave more of an event but it&#x27;s no surprise these guys dominate the market for all things shaving.  When I don&#x27;t feel like going through all the hoopla (pre-shave oil, badger brush, creme shave, etc) I grab this stuff and end up with a silk smooth face.  My favorite thing about the product is that it&#x27;s clear so you know exactly what areas of your face you have missed.  Excellent stuff.</li>
            <li> I thought it was an after shave gel.  But instead I used it was.  It does make it smooth to shave, but it really clog up your shave.</li>
            <li> The product turned out to be a total waste for me, This is not a shaving gel or cream, it gives me no smoothness to my skin for shaving. I need to apply a lot of the gel to shave a little area.&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This and King of Shaves are my two favorite gels.  Unfortunately, Amazon doubled the price between my first order and my renewal.  I am not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It says it is not for facial hair trimming on the back ... I changed to foam which is way better in my opinion. My skin also got very dry each time I was using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this and a lather type gel to shave my head the last few weeks and find they are pretty even. I like this gel but its nothing special.</li>
            <li> I started shaving my face with this stuff and then started squirting it all over my body to see if I could get back to being baby smooth. The problem is that I am probably half-gorilla, and I have hair that is thick like rope. When I started shaving my back, I found that the shaving gel helped me avoid the razor burn I would expect when shaving a new part of the body. In order to reach my back, I had to squirt the shaving gel on the floor of the shower, then roll around in it like a dog. Then I had to tape my razor to my back scratcher to get the additional reach shaving your back requires. Finally, I super glued an assortment of mirrors to my shower wall and door. ***Top tip, invest in shower mirrors instead of breaking your bathroom mirror into shards. The shards are not fog-proof.*** After my mirror array was set up, I was able to see the thicket on my back and was genuinely shocked at how hairy it actually was. Baffled, in fact. No wonder I have been so hot for the past 20 years (even in the dead of winter!). After quickly burning through 3 blades in that jungle, I am happy to report that I was not only very smooth, but also noticeably cooler. Although, the coolness might have been a result of having ran out of hot water 45 minutes into my shower (which ended up taking most of the weekend). I am currently waiting for more replacement blades to arrive so I can continue shaving the rest of my body, but I am so thrilled with this shaving gel and I wouldn&#x27;t shave my thighs, feet, or any of the rest of my body without it.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful Amazon still sells this. Yes, I overpay, but I can&#x27;t find this anywhere in Stores! The key is the non-foaming clear application. I have tried other &amp;#34;Gels&amp;#34;, but nothing is like this and it does not bother my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first non-foaming shave gel and at first I didn&#x27;t like it.  It goes on almost clear (slight foam if you lather vigorously) so it doesn&#x27;t appear like it would protect your face very much.  It almost feels like you&#x27;re rubbing body wash on your face.  I can confirm though, this stuff is very slippery and protects your face well from shave irritation.  I have definitely noticed less razor burns and bleeding with this shave gel over previous foaming gels.  I&#x27;ll be buying more once this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> I always use Gillette products but this didn&#x27;t work as well as the Hydra Gel. Also it leaked out and made a mess on the sink top.</li>
            <li> Best alternative ever to canned shave cream.  I&#x27;m a shower shaver and the metal cans of shave cream started to occasionally leave rust stains on the tile work in my bathroom.  I never have to worry about that with this product, and my shaves are smoother now that I&#x27;m past the whipped-cream-effect of ordinary canned shave creams.  This is a great product, Gillette!!!</li>
            <li> maybe works if you are a teen with a few stray hairs to trim but worthless for real man hair.</li>
            <li> No lather which allows you to shave more precisely.  Overall though the Gillette regular gel provides better lubrication and protection than the Clear Gel. Main reason for this purchase was to find something that didn&#x27;t have metal can that will rust and stain the shower...  Wish Gillette offed more options in this packaging.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s clear.  You have to really lather it and it works great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel! Works alot better than the foam cream!</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this gel won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Beware this is the worst shaving gel/cream on the market and I have tried a lot. A true letdown by Gillette, STAY AWAY!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first product of this type I have tried.  Oh boy!! My previous submittal related to the shaver. I haven&#x27;t tried the &amp;#34;Shave Gel&amp;#34; yet.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that Target has not carried this product for months, but very happy to find it online. This is the best shaving cream/gel I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My excitement of buying this product was almost immediately overwhelmed by pain as my face, turning red after my morning shave, felt as though it had been lit on fire. Further, my neck looked like I had taken a piece of steel wool and ground it into my skin repeatedly for at least ten minutes. Next, the skin on my neck began molting because it was so incredibly dried out. Let me back off a minute and say that I am not allergic to any of the ingredients, I do not ever have dry skin, and I don&#x27;t dig, twist, scrape, or otherwise abuse my face with my razor in any way that is not commonly associated with shaving. The only worse thing about this product than the protection it doesn&#x27;t give your face, is the fact that it comes with two bottles; now I have to find people that I don&#x27;t like to pawn the remaining gallon of this useless blue goop off on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bought a can of barbasol...shaving success.</li>
            <li> Good for keeping the chin hair while shaving the rest. Rub on then rub water. Used foam gel previously like this better once was used to it. Good price</li>
            <li> So smart to have clear gel so you can see/maintain the lines while shaving.</li>
            <li> Update: I increased my rating by one star after using this for a few months. I do think it more effectively lubricates than the foaming gel and deserves at least a 4-star rating.   Original review: I use an electric razor, usually in the shower (dry shaves irritate my skin). I was excited to try a non-foaming gel but, unfortunately, this gel does not work much better than foaming gel for me. It seems to lubricate very well, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would expect. It&#x27;s still a good product that I like better than foaming gel, if only because you can actually see how the shave is going. It also has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Don&#x27;t see big difference in shaving comfort compared to using regular soap.</li>
            <li> Given the host of negativity in the other reviews, which I read after I purchased the gel, I was very surprised to find I enjoyed my shave very much.  The gel is slick, lubrication and glide were terrific, and my face is smooth.  No nicks or cuts either.  I would suggest you try it for yourself, even just once.  It&#x27;s more expensive than a can of shave gel but the extra buck or two is worth it to me.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would be the same quality as the shaving gel that comes in a can. I found it more difficult to use, not lathering as well, needing to use more water to try and make it lather.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well and lasts so long. Not intrusive or thick at all. *After you&#x27;ve shaved an area the gel doesn&#x27;t just disappear. Theres still some there that you can work with- this feature is magnificent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but not as good as some others</li>
            <li> It is OK and does make it easier to see for shaving up to and around mustache.  However, I do not feel the save is as close as with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I really like it. The gel provides a nice layer of protection against scrapping and nicks. Also because its so concentrated you use a lot less and waste a lot less.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong and overwhelming.  The product needs diluting.</li>
            <li> really get a close shave</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it not as well as others I hanve used</li>
            <li> I typically use shaving traditional gel in an aerosol can, but I thought I would give this a try.  I enjoyed the smell of it, personally.  But I don&#x27;t think that it is \\&quot;slick\\&quot; enough and produces more friction than the canned gel.  To compensate, I used a generous portion - but then it isn&#x27;t cost effective.  So, I am sticking with the canned gel once I have finished these two bottles.</li>
            <li> Its changing evrything in shaving, its so smooth and the fact it makes no foams helps the shaver to glide smoothly</li>
            <li> Shaver works well though the replacement blades are expensive.  The narrow head beard trimmer is very good and and the close shave trimmer is excellent.  Three choice beard length heads allow for a short to reasonable length of beard to be achieved.&lt;br /&gt;A cheap price to pay for the initial kit but the price of replacement blades could be prohibitive - shop around, go on-line would be my advice!</li>
            <li> This might not be the best or &amp;#34;smoothest&amp;#34; for shaving outside of the shower, but I must say it works great for being in the shower with the potential of getting water splashed in your face/body while shaving.  It stays on your face pretty well under those conditions, much better than the foam type shaving gels.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good.  It goes on clear so you can see what you are doing in the morning while you are half asleep.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my delicate skin and doesn&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in Afghanistan and a fresh shave is a requirement on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion shaving cream for years and decided to give Gillette Fusion Clear Shave Gel a try because the bottle is soft and takes less space than the traditional aerosol shaving cream in a can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is convenient as far as its design and ease of application however, it has left me with razor burn more than once and when used the gel turns into what is comparable to shaving with soap and water. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for someone who needs to shave daily.</li>
            <li> This is a little like putting sex lube on your face, I had to wash my hands really good after putting it on because they felt so slick afterward.  It turned a little cloudy when I put it on, so it wasn&#x27;t perfectly clear, but it was not like I couldn&#x27;t see what I was doing while shaving.  Despite the other reviews, I did feel like this provided a good amount of glide to the shave.  I wonder if KY jelly would do the same.  I am going to have to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this product, because I was using the canned foam before and it would always end up stuck in or behind my ears.  Sometimes if I was in a big hurry I would end up with hidden shaving cream in my ear for the better part of the morning and that&#x27;s just embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a sloppy mess, I really need to switch to \\&quot;clear\\&quot; everything: deodorant, toothpaste, shaving cream, etc...</li>
            <li> This is the only shave gel I will use now.</li>
            <li> PUT IT ON, SHAVE, AND WIPE IT OFF! LEAVES MY FACE SMOOTH AS CAN BE. BUYING THE PACKAGE WITH THE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER PACK WAS A GREAT INVESTMENT.</li>
            <li> Like this a lot, non foaming gel allows shaving around facial hair. Easy to use. Smaller than can for travel.</li>
            <li> Seems as if you&#x27;re dry-shaving. This product does not replace shaving foam in any way. You have to use a large amount to shave a small area. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> yup this stuff is GREAT ... love the way it makes you feel during the process and once complete! Best bang bang bang for the buck imaginable. Like the old Brill Cream add said, &amp;#34; a little dab will do you&amp;#34;! lather up and go baby go!</li>
            <li> A lot less messy than the foam. Great stuff. I could not find it in the stores where I live.</li>
            <li> This product initially throws you off because it doesn&#x27;t foam up, but once you are used to it you fall in love with it because you can actually see what you are doing (hairs that you are missing etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is the only shaving cream (that I know of) that I can use in my Simplehuman Triple wall-mounted shampoo and soap dispenser. Its great to get the shaving cream canisters out of the shower to keep things uncluttered.</li>
            <li> Its very difficult to rate this product, on one hand it does a very good job on shaving my face, but here is the issue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets call it &amp;#34;deceptive advertising by Gillette&amp;#34;, and to think Apple is getting dragged through the courts for a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product states clearly on the back &amp;#34;NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN FACIAL HAIR TRIMMING&amp;#34;, so just what is it intended for?  And what dangers does this product impose upon the user for long term use on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the product but I would like to know specifically why it is not a mens facial hair shaving gel?  Because based on the way the product is promoted you sure could have fooled me......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just calling it out here, so make your own decisions before you buy the product.  Gillette, you have responded to others so please respond to this one so we can make a better informed decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> great productlove the shave I get with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible. You might as well rub soap on your face. If you want a great clear gel use Jack Black. More expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, very soothing and I like the smell too. Just wish it were easier to find locally.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t foam like I&#x27;d hoped , but great lube.</li>
            <li> He says it doesn&#x27;t create the same comfort as a thick foam.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is not foaming at all, unlike the canned version, which makes shaving very painful and irritating.</li>
            <li> The best shaving lubricant I have ever used.  It is now the only one I will use.  Easy to apply and great glide with my razor.  It also leaves my face smooth and moist.  Great for the dryness and cold temperatures of winter.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three tubes of fusion shaving cream and had problems with all three.  The tops come off, break and leak.  don&#x27;t ever pack a tube in a travel bag or sports bag, you will fill it with shaving gel.  Seems like a problem they could solve easily.</li>
            <li> I love this clear Shaving Gel because I can see exactly what I&#x27;m shaving and doesn&#x27;t have the horrible smell that some of the other clear shave gels I&#x27;ve used do. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, I like the fact that the shaving gel is clear. It gives a smooth shave. It takes a little getting used to putting it on as it is different than what I am used to. I have a sensitive beard and I am really susceptible to razor burn and this seems to prevent that problem. I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any of the stores locally so I ordered from here and I would do it again.</li>
            <li> this gel is great , it does not give you rash on your face and it is completely transparent , and before i was not able to shave upward but with this gel i can , and since i have been using it i have not gotten a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> Stays slick and smooth throughout the shave. Perfect! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair and this gel is great on it. Blade glides smoothly across my face and since it goes on clear even though it is tinted slightly blue it is easy to see any hairs I may have missed on the 1st pass.</li>
            <li> Makes for a great shaving experience. The fact that it&#x27;s clear, it allows you to perfect your shave, when styling.</li>
            <li> liked it. works great for me and worth the price. would recommend it for anyone looking for a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> Used the shave gel and can&#x27;t get past the feeling I&#x27;m using high end soap. No real difference in shave. I will stick to canned foam.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, very smooth when shaving with it.  Great scent as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deployed to an FPO address where they don&#x27;t sell the pressurized Gillette shave gel, and there are apparently shipping restrictions as well so I ordered this product.  It did not the provide comfort or protection I was hoping for.  Guess it&#x27;s back to Barbasol for $1.50 at the Exchange.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have not seen it in stores, but came across it when ordering Gillette Aerosol. I find that while the aerosol runs out, there is still gel in the can.  Ordered the shave gel to try &amp; it is better than anything I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t foam, which is strange at first, but this allows one to see any missed spots. It also gives a much smoother, closer shave than anything I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It ships quickly and is a great price.</li>
            <li> I love the clear gel for trimming around my goatee.  I have been unable to find it in stores.  It provides a good shave and allows you to see your cut line so you don&#x27;t mess up your precious beard!</li>
            <li> Gives a pretty decent shave - the Gillette Foamy Gel does a better job and washes off easier-eh!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as shaving cream. I still get random razor burns and shave doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it would with the cream.</li>
            <li> I was being cheap and this was one of the gels I saw on Amazon and it looked decent. The application of this gel takes more time than the foam gel you can spray out of a can, and I have gotten more knicks from shaving with this gel than the spray can. The reason it takes longer is because you have to apply it to your face and the blade, and then get both of them a little wet to make it work.</li>
            <li> Great for a well lubricated and close shave.  The clear gell makes it hard to see where you have shaved.</li>
            <li> Wish I could find this in stores!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a metal bottom, so no rust rings.  It&#x27;s a great shaving gel, and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> works well only reason for four stars instead of five is so use to a foam shave cream</li>
            <li> I found that this product did not prevent razor drag which is what I assumed it was for.  Went back to shaving cream which works just fine.  Even tried the Gillette Shave Gel under the shaving cream and found that it make no difference.</li>
            <li> The first time you use this, it will just feel wrong. You use very little; the packaging suggests just a nickel-sized amount on your palm. So men accustomed to applying a handful of foam, or even standard shaving gel, will take a look at the nickel-sized amount and think it couldn&#x27;t possibly be enough to shave these manly whiskers. But it is. In fact, if you use too much, it seems to work less well: apply a thin layer, and it goes on clear; rub it in, and it turns white. That&#x27;s all you need. I use Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Power razor, but any good multi-blade razor should work fine, just trust the gel and shave like you would normally shave. One thing--even if it doesn&#x27;t look like you need to, rinse your razor as you always have, since the whiskers are getting cut and clogging the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose everybody&#x27;s face is different, but it seems to me the razor glides more smoothly with this clear gel, especially on the second pass. And best of all, at least for me, it reduced shaving irritation to almost nothing. I used to get razor burn, because I like to shave close; now, I can shave just as close, but my jawline doesn&#x27;t turn red. (There&#x27;s still that tricky area right under the nose that it&#x27;s hard to get shaved nice and close, but since a Hitler moustache isn&#x27;t really an option, I guess I&#x27;ll just live with that.) All in all, this is the best shaving gel or cream I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m a clean-shaven white guy who recently turned 50, so I&#x27;ve been shaving a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to hate shaving--well, I still hate shaving--but I hate it less than I used to.</li>
            <li> Pro: Provides a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Can&#x27;t get as many shaves as with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t decided about reordering.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave with this product and I can use it in conjunction with my electric razor as well. My wife claims my skin is smoother and softer since I have been using it, but it may just be the nicer shave. Either way it is worth giving it a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I bought a few tubes of this to give it a try. On the Gillette web site it is called Gillette Body Shave Gel, and on this tube it states &amp;#34;Also sold as Gillette BODY shave gel&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Right under that on the back of the tube, at the end of the sentence it is written &amp;#34;Not intended for use in facial hair trimming&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go figure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every shaving gel. This is by far the best of all. I never have razor burn and it gives a baby soft result. It last forever. I wish they&#x27;d put it back on the shelves!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product and I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff; great price!</li>
            <li> gillette shaving gel helps me to getting a really nice and smooth shave it has a very pleasant smell and will get the job done</li>
            <li> Thus stuff is pricey but it does seem to get a better shave.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this shaving gel, uses it daily and has for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> This product is certainly see through, but does lack the lather that I know and love. Also, if used post shower, leaves a film on your skin that cannot be removed by a simple rinse.</li>
            <li> Nice!! Soft, I use it for my legs. Wish it were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I love this gel for shaving</li>
            <li> PROVIDES SMOOTH SHAVE, JUST A DAB WILL DO YA, LASTS MONTHS</li>
            <li> I really like this get. Takes VERY little amount to get the job done. You can see where you are shaving so that&#x27;s great when you want to keep some facial hair; beard, mustache. etc. Makes trimming a lot easier</li>
            <li> I ordered Gillette Clear Shave Gel because I like Gillette products and I needed some shave gel and ordered it from Amazon. I really like the way it goes on and how it works. I shave in the shower and with this product it&#x27;s a snap. I like the closeness I get and the ease it goes on with and the cost. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This product really helps you get a great shave without getting chaffed.</li>
            <li> This stuff packs well which is what I needed for traveling for work.  I use a safely razor and this is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent shave gel. I use it on every business days.</li>
