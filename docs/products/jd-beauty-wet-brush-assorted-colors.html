            <li>Now she can comb her own hair.  </li>
            <li>He can brush his own hair with this with no problem.  </li>
            <li>I think it works best if the person has fine hair, but overall very very good product.</li>
            <li>I would pay more for heavier, tougher plastic that would survive more crashes on the marble floor!</li>
            <li>My daughter is 3 and has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is a \\&quot;MUST\\&quot; for anyone with curly hair or hair that tangles easily!</li>

            <li>These work on Rapunzel length, baby fine hair!</li>
            <li>I have ordered 3 more of this item because I dont want to be anywhere without one.</li>
            <li>We have tried so many brushes, combs, detanglers, nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, and have told many people about it.</li>
            <li>I ordered two more for my daughters......</li>
            <li>This brush just works, unlike many others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I thought this based on the description of the product and the price since I don&#x27;t think I paid more than $8 for mine in the salon.</li>
            <li>Works like magic</li>
            <li>I have super-fine hair and it helps make my hair look more smoothe than frizzy.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than boar&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the &amp;#34;Luxor&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li>In fact, as soon as I finish writing this review, I&#x27;m buying two more.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist sold one to me and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is more for a wig, hair extensions etc.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is the best brush I have ever owned for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush takes them out without breaking off all my hair, love it straight out of the shower, love it when I get out of the car, love it!  </li>
            <li>With many hairbrushes running more than $100, one would not be faulted for feeling a little concern over the very attractive pricing of this brush.</li>
            <li>I decided to use Simply Smooth Magic Potion, sold here on Amazon, and my comb slid through my hair.</li>
            <li>Got one for my 4 year old granddaughter and it works great for her, too.</li>
            <li>These seem great so far.</li>
            <li>These Wet Brushes are the best ever.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST brush for wet hair -</li>
            <li>My oldest daughter loved hers so much that I bought another for my youngest.</li>
            <li>It is the best hair brush I have tried for my extremely tangly hair, and I prefer it over the Tangle Teezer which I have tried as well.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful with wet hair!</li>
            <li>This brush easily detangles</li>
            <li>It is easy on hair and scalp</li>
            <li>and it knots easily after a shower.</li>
            <li>durable waterproof and easily glide thru the hair in a jif.</li>
            <li>My son has curly hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I can say hands down that this is the best brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This brush has very flexible bristles so when it encounters any kind of tangle it lets go, this means easy on the scalp, doesn&#x27;t hurt but takes FOREVER to brush out your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser received one of these brushes to try for free from a vendor who sells him products.</li>
            <li>These brushes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>B001F51RJW Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner, 23.7-fluid ounces Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>The brush works great, especially after shower.</li>
            <li>Very ergonomic, with a nice feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought one for me</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the price of the brush at the salon and was glad that I found it on Amazon at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>no ripping, I have baby fine hair, but a lot, and this makes it so easy to brush right out of the shower..</li>
            <li>She let me use it and it worked great on brushing out knots in my long, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited about the price since I thought it was for 4 brushes.</li>
            <li>Even so, I&#x27;m pretty sure my hair is breaking a LOT when I&#x27;m using this brush.</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine, and tangles over NOTHING.</li>
            <li>I thought the true test would be my nieces.  </li>
            <li>NO painful pulling and trying to tease out every tangle.</li>
            <li>So I rated this a 4 because the price isn&#x27;t that good relatively speaking and for the deceiving description.</li>
            <li>This brush made it so easy when you first get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I bought a brush for me and two other family members and it work great for all 3 of us.</li>
            <li>This brush does go through your wet hair more easily and does not rip hair out like most brushes.  </li>
            <li>I received this item quickly however, was quite dismayed upon reading packaging info upon receipt.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different brushes over the years and &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; is the absolute best, no lie !</li>
            <li>Takes out knots even in my very curly hair that&#x27;s easily ripping and breaking when I brush it.</li>
            <li>I have really tangly long hair, and this brush certainly does do a good job of combing it all out and getting rid of mats and tangles (which I develop super easily).</li>
            <li>gentle on the scalp, this is the best brush i have found to get through my thick, curly tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>but TOTALLY WORTH</li>
            <li>I use it right after toweling off from the shower and it glides right through my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing to note is that the brush head is very large.</li>
            <li>However, I decided the risk was worth it, and ended up with a brush that does exactly as it claims.</li>
            <li>Love, love this brush!Could never find anything that didn&#x27;t hurt my extra fine long hair, but this glides through!Ordered for all my sisters cmas gifts</li>
            <li>and you can use it on dry hair, nice brush.</li>
            <li>I have thick, naturally curly shoulder length hair - and - this brush is theeee BEST for detangling after washing,.</li>
            <li>I have very very tangley hair, even after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush mainly due to all of the great reviews it had - easy to brush through wet hair after washing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first learned about this product from a hair stylist friend of mine.  </li>
            <li>I just happened to be the first client he tried it on.</li>
            <li>With this brush it glides straight through with no pain at all!</li>
            <li>I have ordered two before and finds not enough, so I ordered two more.</li>
            <li>- my hair never had tangles and it was so gentle!</li>
            <li>It is okay as a supplement to one of the heavier-duty traditional brushes, but that means that my knots are still a problem.</li>
            <li>I seem to have a lot more small breaky pieces on top of my head.</li>
            <li>Frankly I was skeptical, but this brush is awesome.  </li>
            <li>clumps of my hair end up in any other kind of brush I had used.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about how much we love it.</li>
            <li>Love this brush so much I had to buy a 2nd one for my travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been such a time-saver for me and allows me to brush my hair easily without using tons of product to make it smooth/brushable first.</li>
            <li>Bought this because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>4 girls with long tangly hair love it</li>
            <li>Love this brush my son and I and husband have long hair my daughter told me need to get it</li>
            <li>It works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>with a little de-tangler, my daughter&#x27;s curls brush out nicely without a lot of &amp;#34;ouchies.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Works great on wet or dry hair!</li>
            <li>Amazingly and at last a detangling brush that actually works.</li>
            <li>but this brush really does work and</li>
            <li>When I read the description, I really did not believe the claims made that this would take my tangles out.</li>
            <li>Girls, you know how when you just use shampoo  &amp; no conditioner how much of a hassle it is to brush through your hair afterwards?</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need a brush - I just wanted to see how much they were because someone was asking me about mine</li>
            <li>I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>It really does the things that it claims.</li>
            <li>I doubted a brush could really make a difference</li>
            <li>This brush does make brushing my hair much much easier than what I was using before.</li>
            <li>goes through hair gently,.</li>
            <li>This brush goes right through my 4 year old daughters curly hair.</li>
            <li>(I have long hair and it brushes easily without ripping my hair out).  </li>
            <li>My hair is very long, straight, and fine, yet very densely populated on my head.  </li>
            <li>Normally, my hair dresser has to put loads of detangler in my hair &amp; spends about 15-20 minutes brushing out my hair before a haircut, but not with DivaGlide!</li>
            <li>Totally works and worth it!</li>
            <li>bristles are thinner and more flexible than other brushes I have used.</li>
            <li>It does seem to de-tangle hair quite well without ripping the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric where the bristles come out of gets wet in the shower, and takes a long time to dry out - not what I would think would be a good thing for a brush claiming to be a good wet brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The result of this is that it will not snag knotted hair like a traditional brush would, but it also means that if you have more course or thick hair, the brush isn&#x27;t going to be strong enough to work though those knots easily.</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very long, baby fine hair and drive a convertible.  </li>
            <li>Now I can get a long smooth stroke from scalp to ends of my waist length hair.</li>
            <li>Feels solid, nice wide bristles, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>However, it does pull more than my previous brush, Ouchless by Goody.</li>
            <li>only the top section of my hair was even brushed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine brush, but it sure isn&#x27;t strong enough to get tangles out of my thick long hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s detangling properties particularly revolutionary.&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It also works great in wet or dry hair unlike some brushes which work well on only one.</li>
            <li>I recommend spraying your brush with a little bit of silicone &#x27;anti-frizz&#x27; spray if you get a lot of static during the winter.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the Diva brush are just a little more flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just detangles and moves through your wet hair smoothly.</li>
            <li>and since it&#x27;s a 2in1 the conditioner part doesn&#x27;t make your hair as soft and brush-able straight from the shower.</li>
            <li>If the primary purpose of this brush is that its a \\&quot;Wet</li>
            <li>We bought two more just in case one goes missing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the perfect brush for my hair, and if it breaks or I get bored with my pretty purple one, I&#x27;ll be back for another one.</li>
            <li>&quot; Ok, I might have yelled that a few times too.</li>
            <li>It went right back.</li>
            <li>This brush had no problems getting through it, along with my daughters super think long hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought 4 of these brushes for my granddaughters - they all have thick long hair and they loved them so much, I bought one for me.  </li>
            <li>This works better than a regular brush on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering 2 more one for my little one and one for my mom!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>quickly detangles wet hair as advertised.</li>
            <li>Solid comb, not as HUGE as some of the other review say... but pretty big.  </li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW.</li>
            <li>, it does pull straight through my hair without stopping (unlike the comb, which only makes it about an inch)...</li>
            <li>Bought one for my 10 year old daughter too.</li>
            <li>I can completely brush through my hair within under a minute.</li>
            <li>my old brush tore the hair out by the roots...</li>
            <li>I use it for myself, as well as my tender headed six year old.</li>
            <li>any one with tangled hair u must have its a wow</li>
            <li>This product really changed our daily routine.</li>
            <li>It is soft and confortable.</li>
            <li>Though if you have a sensitive scalp, you may not like the bristles.</li>
            <li>No crying or complaining about the brush hurting her head.</li>
            <li>If you have a child with a sensitive head who hates brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this brush and was a bit skeptical buying it thinking, \\&quot;How could it be so good at brushing tangled</li>
            <li>It works wet or dry, and seems to control those pesky grey hairs that have minds of their own.</li>
            <li>they glide right through wet hair....  LI NY</li>
            <li>It is way to light to last very long, but it is cheap enough to buy a few a year if needed.</li>
            <li>It is because of this condition, that I returned the brush, unused, wasn&#x27;t feeling to anxious to use it on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a very basic simple brush, that works exactly the way I like it.</li>
            <li>She has long, thick as heck hair, and could not seem to control it on her own.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and I usually hate brushes because most brushes actually cause more tangles than they tame</li>
            <li>I have really thick shoulder-length wavy hair that is always super snarly after washing (no matter how much conditioner I use).</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the DivaGlide doesn&#x27;t pull at my scalp like normal brushes.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair that Im trying to grow out farther, and I undertsand how important it is to be kind to your hair when its wet and vulnerable.</li>
            <li>There is almost no hair in the bristles of the brush even after many weeks of at least daily use.</li>
            <li>They work well for thick or fine hair.  </li>
            <li>For some people, that might not be a big deal, but if you struggle with knots after showering or have trouble brushing through without pulling and ripping fine hairs, definitely try this brush.</li>
            <li>Just a tip for hair brushing in general:</li>
            <li>I was looking for a brush to use on wet hair and this brush really works.  </li>
            <li>an absolute must for anyone with brushing wet tangled kid hair.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I think I may have expected too much.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very gentle and rips out less hairs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand exactly why this works so differently than other brushes</li>
            <li>/&gt;I found that it was just the same as my regular, everyday \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; brush that I received for free when I bought a drugstore hair dryer several years ago.</li>
            <li>He literally brushed right through my hair in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Again, this was not manufactured for the main purpose of being used on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on dry hair, but on wet it doesn&#x27;t do anything to detangle even when I use leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Well worth the few bucks!</li>
            <li>start at the tips and work your way up to your roots, this will hurt a lot less than if you begin brushing straight from the roots.</li>
            <li>It took 20 minutes to get through his hair with previous products and he screamed the whole time.</li>
            <li>it is better with dry hair or just a little wet, but not really for using inside the shower.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s great on my curly</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> Hers was great</li>
            <li> Packaging advertises to be great for use on wigs and extensions.  </li>
            <li> That would be great if my daughter had a wig or extensions...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to brush my hair without experiencing pain and it doesn&#x27;t take me forever!!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair SO smooth!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> So put on a good show, pull out this brush and give yourself a break from the pain.</li>
            <li> I was recommended it by a friend, I received it in the mail today and instantly loved it.</li>
            <li> It is good for us.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel good on my scalp, too.  </li>
            <li> My wife loved how effectively it untangles her hair; great Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;nothing gets through my tangles better and is easier to use than this brush!</li>

            <li> Love this brush!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing brush!</li>
            <li> I love this brush and would recommend this to anyone with troublesome naughts!</li>
            <li> Now she can comb her own hair.  </li>
            <li> He can brush his own hair with this with no problem.  </li>
            <li> I think it works best if the person has fine hair, but overall very very good product.</li>
            <li> I would pay more for heavier, tougher plastic that would survive more crashes on the marble floor!</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 and has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is a \\&quot;MUST\\&quot; for anyone with curly hair or hair that tangles easily!</li>
            <li> I did not have much hope, but this cheap brush eased thru her hair, and she was so happy!</li>
            <li> These work on Rapunzel length, baby fine hair!</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 more of this item because I dont want to be anywhere without one.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many brushes, combs, detanglers, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, and have told many people about it.</li>
            <li> I ordered two more for my daughters......</li>
            <li> This brush just works, unlike many others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I thought this based on the description of the product and the price since I don&#x27;t think I paid more than $8 for mine in the salon.</li>
            <li> Works like magic</li>
            <li> I have super-fine hair and it helps make my hair look more smoothe than frizzy.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than boar&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the &amp;#34;Luxor&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li> In fact, as soon as I finish writing this review, I&#x27;m buying two more.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist sold one to me and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is more for a wig, hair extensions etc.  </li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever owned for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush takes them out without breaking off all my hair, love it straight out of the shower, love it when I get out of the car, love it!  </li>
            <li> With many hairbrushes running more than $100, one would not be faulted for feeling a little concern over the very attractive pricing of this brush.</li>
            <li> I decided to use Simply Smooth Magic Potion, sold here on Amazon, and my comb slid through my hair.</li>
            <li> Got one for my 4 year old granddaughter and it works great for her, too.</li>
            <li> These seem great so far.</li>
            <li> These Wet Brushes are the best ever.  </li>
            <li> This is the BEST brush for wet hair -</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter loved hers so much that I bought another for my youngest.</li>
            <li> It is the best hair brush I have tried for my extremely tangly hair, and I prefer it over the Tangle Teezer which I have tried as well.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful with wet hair!</li>
            <li> This brush easily detangles</li>
            <li> It is easy on hair and scalp</li>
            <li> and it knots easily after a shower.</li>
            <li> durable waterproof and easily glide thru the hair in a jif.</li>
            <li> My son has curly hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> I can say hands down that this is the best brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This brush has very flexible bristles so when it encounters any kind of tangle it lets go, this means easy on the scalp, doesn&#x27;t hurt but takes FOREVER to brush out your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser received one of these brushes to try for free from a vendor who sells him products.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> B001F51RJW Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner, 23.7-fluid ounces Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> The brush works great, especially after shower.</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic, with a nice feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought one for me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the price of the brush at the salon and was glad that I found it on Amazon at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> no ripping, I have baby fine hair, but a lot, and this makes it so easy to brush right out of the shower..</li>
            <li> She let me use it and it worked great on brushing out knots in my long, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> and I was so excited about the price since I thought it was for 4 brushes.</li>
            <li> Even so, I&#x27;m pretty sure my hair is breaking a LOT when I&#x27;m using this brush.</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine, and tangles over NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I thought the true test would be my nieces.  </li>
            <li> NO painful pulling and trying to tease out every tangle.</li>
            <li> So I rated this a 4 because the price isn&#x27;t that good relatively speaking and for the deceiving description.</li>
            <li> This brush made it so easy when you first get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought a brush for me and two other family members and it work great for all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> This brush does go through your wet hair more easily and does not rip hair out like most brushes.  </li>
            <li> I received this item quickly however, was quite dismayed upon reading packaging info upon receipt.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different brushes over the years and &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; is the absolute best, no lie !</li>
            <li> Takes out knots even in my very curly hair that&#x27;s easily ripping and breaking when I brush it.</li>
            <li> I have really tangly long hair, and this brush certainly does do a good job of combing it all out and getting rid of mats and tangles (which I develop super easily).</li>
            <li> gentle on the scalp, this is the best brush i have found to get through my thick, curly tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> but TOTALLY WORTH</li>
            <li> I use it right after toweling off from the shower and it glides right through my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing to note is that the brush head is very large.</li>
            <li> However, I decided the risk was worth it, and ended up with a brush that does exactly as it claims.</li>
            <li> Love, love this brush!Could never find anything that didn&#x27;t hurt my extra fine long hair, but this glides through!Ordered for all my sisters cmas gifts</li>
            <li> and you can use it on dry hair, nice brush.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly shoulder length hair - and - this brush is theeee BEST for detangling after washing,.</li>
            <li> I have very very tangley hair, even after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush mainly due to all of the great reviews it had - easy to brush through wet hair after washing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product from a hair stylist friend of mine.  </li>
            <li> I just happened to be the first client he tried it on.</li>
            <li> With this brush it glides straight through with no pain at all!</li>
            <li> I have ordered two before and finds not enough, so I ordered two more.</li>
            <li> - my hair never had tangles and it was so gentle!</li>
            <li> It is okay as a supplement to one of the heavier-duty traditional brushes, but that means that my knots are still a problem.</li>
            <li> I seem to have a lot more small breaky pieces on top of my head.</li>
            <li> Frankly I was skeptical, but this brush is awesome.  </li>
            <li> clumps of my hair end up in any other kind of brush I had used.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough about how much we love it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush so much I had to buy a 2nd one for my travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been such a time-saver for me and allows me to brush my hair easily without using tons of product to make it smooth/brushable first.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> 4 girls with long tangly hair love it</li>
            <li> Love this brush my son and I and husband have long hair my daughter told me need to get it</li>
            <li> It works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> with a little de-tangler, my daughter&#x27;s curls brush out nicely without a lot of &amp;#34;ouchies.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works great on wet or dry hair!</li>
            <li> Amazingly and at last a detangling brush that actually works.</li>
            <li> but this brush really does work and</li>
            <li> When I read the description, I really did not believe the claims made that this would take my tangles out.</li>
            <li> Girls, you know how when you just use shampoo  &amp; no conditioner how much of a hassle it is to brush through your hair afterwards?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need a brush - I just wanted to see how much they were because someone was asking me about mine</li>
            <li> I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> It really does the things that it claims.</li>
            <li> I doubted a brush could really make a difference</li>
            <li> This brush does make brushing my hair much much easier than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> goes through hair gently,.</li>
            <li> This brush goes right through my 4 year old daughters curly hair.</li>
            <li> (I have long hair and it brushes easily without ripping my hair out).  </li>
            <li> My hair is very long, straight, and fine, yet very densely populated on my head.  </li>
            <li> Normally, my hair dresser has to put loads of detangler in my hair &amp; spends about 15-20 minutes brushing out my hair before a haircut, but not with DivaGlide!</li>
            <li> Totally works and worth it!</li>
            <li> bristles are thinner and more flexible than other brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> It does seem to de-tangle hair quite well without ripping the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric where the bristles come out of gets wet in the shower, and takes a long time to dry out - not what I would think would be a good thing for a brush claiming to be a good wet brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result of this is that it will not snag knotted hair like a traditional brush would, but it also means that if you have more course or thick hair, the brush isn&#x27;t going to be strong enough to work though those knots easily.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long, baby fine hair and drive a convertible.  </li>
            <li> Now I can get a long smooth stroke from scalp to ends of my waist length hair.</li>
            <li> Feels solid, nice wide bristles, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> However, it does pull more than my previous brush, Ouchless by Goody.</li>
            <li> only the top section of my hair was even brushed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine brush, but it sure isn&#x27;t strong enough to get tangles out of my thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s detangling properties particularly revolutionary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It also works great in wet or dry hair unlike some brushes which work well on only one.</li>
            <li> I recommend spraying your brush with a little bit of silicone &#x27;anti-frizz&#x27; spray if you get a lot of static during the winter.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the Diva brush are just a little more flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just detangles and moves through your wet hair smoothly.</li>
            <li> and since it&#x27;s a 2in1 the conditioner part doesn&#x27;t make your hair as soft and brush-able straight from the shower.</li>
            <li> If the primary purpose of this brush is that its a \\&quot;Wet</li>
            <li> We bought two more just in case one goes missing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the perfect brush for my hair, and if it breaks or I get bored with my pretty purple one, I&#x27;ll be back for another one.</li>
            <li> &quot; Ok, I might have yelled that a few times too.</li>
            <li> It went right back.</li>
            <li> This brush had no problems getting through it, along with my daughters super think long hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these brushes for my granddaughters - they all have thick long hair and they loved them so much, I bought one for me.  </li>
            <li> This works better than a regular brush on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering 2 more one for my little one and one for my mom!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> quickly detangles wet hair as advertised.</li>
            <li> Solid comb, not as HUGE as some of the other review say... but pretty big.  </li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW.</li>
            <li> , it does pull straight through my hair without stopping (unlike the comb, which only makes it about an inch)...</li>
            <li> Bought one for my 10 year old daughter too.</li>
            <li> I can completely brush through my hair within under a minute.</li>
            <li> my old brush tore the hair out by the roots...</li>
            <li> I use it for myself, as well as my tender headed six year old.</li>
            <li> any one with tangled hair u must have its a wow</li>
            <li> This product really changed our daily routine.</li>
            <li> It is soft and confortable.</li>
            <li> Though if you have a sensitive scalp, you may not like the bristles.</li>
            <li> No crying or complaining about the brush hurting her head.</li>
            <li> If you have a child with a sensitive head who hates brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this brush and was a bit skeptical buying it thinking, \\&quot;How could it be so good at brushing tangled</li>
            <li> It works wet or dry, and seems to control those pesky grey hairs that have minds of their own.</li>
            <li> they glide right through wet hair....  LI NY</li>
            <li> It is way to light to last very long, but it is cheap enough to buy a few a year if needed.</li>
            <li> It is because of this condition, that I returned the brush, unused, wasn&#x27;t feeling to anxious to use it on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a very basic simple brush, that works exactly the way I like it.</li>
            <li> She has long, thick as heck hair, and could not seem to control it on her own.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and I usually hate brushes because most brushes actually cause more tangles than they tame</li>
            <li> I have really thick shoulder-length wavy hair that is always super snarly after washing (no matter how much conditioner I use).</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the DivaGlide doesn&#x27;t pull at my scalp like normal brushes.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair that Im trying to grow out farther, and I undertsand how important it is to be kind to your hair when its wet and vulnerable.</li>
            <li> There is almost no hair in the bristles of the brush even after many weeks of at least daily use.</li>
            <li> They work well for thick or fine hair.  </li>
            <li> For some people, that might not be a big deal, but if you struggle with knots after showering or have trouble brushing through without pulling and ripping fine hairs, definitely try this brush.</li>
            <li> Just a tip for hair brushing in general:</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush to use on wet hair and this brush really works.  </li>
            <li> an absolute must for anyone with brushing wet tangled kid hair.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I think I may have expected too much.  </li>
            <li> This brush is very gentle and rips out less hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand exactly why this works so differently than other brushes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I found that it was just the same as my regular, everyday \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; brush that I received for free when I bought a drugstore hair dryer several years ago.</li>
            <li> He literally brushed right through my hair in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Again, this was not manufactured for the main purpose of being used on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on dry hair, but on wet it doesn&#x27;t do anything to detangle even when I use leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Well worth the few bucks!</li>
            <li> start at the tips and work your way up to your roots, this will hurt a lot less than if you begin brushing straight from the roots.</li>
            <li> It took 20 minutes to get through his hair with previous products and he screamed the whole time.</li>
            <li> it is better with dry hair or just a little wet, but not really for using inside the shower.</li>
            <li> Her hair was thick and to her waist and the brush went right through her hair</li>
            <li> I have thicker Asian hair that is very straight, and I simply found my hair too heavy for the Wet Brush to handle with ease.</li>
            <li> It does go through hair more smoothly and less painful than other brushes.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter who has very thick (full of tangles) hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty hard to brush out, even hair stylists tell me so when I go for a hair cut.  </li>
            <li> I used to dread washing my long hair because it was such a pain to brush out all the tangles!</li>
            <li> Maybe good for thin hair or kids, but be careful if you have thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a three year old with very curly hair and before this brush it was such a dramatic event to get her to let me brush her hair.  </li>
            <li> but...you have to repeatedly go over the same section of hair in order to untangle the entire area because it only takes the topmost layer of hair at a time (unlike the comb, which reaches down to the scalp).</li>
            <li> My hair is super naughty when wet, with a few strokes, the naughts disappear!  </li>
            <li> My long curly haired daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> My daugthers have long hair and the stylist at the salon recommended the brush.</li>
            <li> If you have girls that have long hair....</li>
            <li> It is a must  for anyone with long hair and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long hair, and do use this in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> how well it combs my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush for my long wavy hair, after doing some research and almost ordering the Mason Pearson brush for $100</li>
            <li> I personally did not find the Wet Brush to be life changing.</li>
            <li> I have long think curly hair and would only use a comb to get through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have against the brush so far is that the bristles feel really sharp against my scalp and the bare skin on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just another brush for me - nothing more, sadly!</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it works well on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> She refused to even try to brush her hair until it was dry.</li>
            <li> Has not the invigorating feel for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Please people, be honest with your reviews, I hate sending stuff back!</li>
            <li> This tore my hair out with a single swipe.</li>
            <li> I received a black brush, which what I actually prefer.  </li>
            <li> But not much difference on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Still snags on tangles regardless of wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry, tangles just come out easier and painlessly with this brush.  </li>
            <li> I and  my daughter used it when hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I definitely lose a lot less hair now.  </li>
            <li> As an adult with long thick hair...I could go either way.</li>
            <li> If I use this brush while my hair is wet I might as well not even bother.  </li>
            <li> With the wet brush.....5 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> these brushes when used on wet hair are a miracle.  </li>
            <li> so tangly that it forms giant mats if I don&#x27;t comb it out every few hours.</li>
            <li> and she recommended the \\&quot;Wet</li>
            <li> I saw one too, in a store, but the store was closed, so I couldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Name on front of package says nothing about being a Wet Brush.  </li>
            <li> The pack of packing towards the lower region says that it can be used on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> bristles of the brush are thin and very flexible.</li>
            <li> One of them has thick &amp; curly hair and the other has thin fine</li>
            <li> The tips are rounded uniformly, unlike my daughter&#x27;s Wet Brush where some tips are big blobs and some are too small.  </li>
            <li> My little girl has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> there was no pulling and very little hair on the brush when I was finished and that is a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> This brush looks like every other brush...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not like any other brush I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt your hair like other brushes do.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I not have tears in my eyes from the usual pain I was used to when I would brush with my usual brushes but all of my tangles came out with such ease.</li>
            <li> Other brushes snagged the hair until it broke or snapped into a tighter knot.</li>
            <li> Thank you wet brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is a miracle with absolutely no effort this brush just glides through my hair!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, down my back, long hair</li>
            <li> have fine, straight hair that likes to tangle something awful after I wash it.</li>
            <li> She was half way through her daughters wet hair before she knew her mom was even brushing it.  </li>
            <li> Now after their baths, my little girls specifically insist that we use this brush to brush the tangles out of their wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Anyone that has a daughter with long hair that screams when you brush out her wet hair needs to get this!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a few of these after my hair dresser used the wet brush on me.  </li>
            <li> I already have a wet brush, which I use everyday.....</li>
            <li> I also tried this product on my long, thick, wavy hair while it was wet.</li>
            <li> I am really not sure how this brush is different from other brushes, but it is a lot softer yet still manages my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it seems unnecessary for other hair types, but that&#x27;s obviously not an informed opinion.</li>
            <li> We have 3 girls with long hair and this brush is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> WE have long thin hair Always tangled after getting wet.  </li>
            <li> after 6 months or so, the little balls on the tips of the bristles had fallen off and now it kinda hurts to brush with this.</li>
            <li> She went from hating to brush her hair to brushing it everyday without hesitation.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now on my hair and my preschool daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> even their hair are quite messy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after using my roommate&#x27;s for a few months.</li>
            <li> (unfortunately -- I would like to use a natural substance).</li>
            <li> I immediately order it and had it in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Waking her up in the morning for school and the tears that used to always occur when brushing her hair is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> and I know it would usually say &amp;#34;set of 4,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this if you/your kid has thinner hair or if they hate getting their hair brushed.</li>

            <li> I have long hair that is usually very difficult to brush out after washing.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very thin and not strong.</li>

            <li> even her worst knots whether her hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> They hate having their hair brushed because it hurts when your scalped is pulled.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, course, wavy, difficult hair.  </li>

            <li> - ill never be without one again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it can&#x27;t handle the tangles in my hair, and it always leaves me feeling like</li>

            <li> I get tangles like crazy.  </li>

            <li> This brush looks like every other brush...but it&#x27;s not like any other brush I&#x27;ve ever seen. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. My daughter and I both have very thick long hair, it gets tangled and brushing it while wet is impossible. This brush easily detangles even her worst knots whether her hair is wet or dry. Waking her up in the morning for school and the tears that used to always occur when brushing her hair is a thing of the past. The brush doesn&#x27;t pull and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! There is almost no hair in the bristles of the brush even after many weeks of at least daily use. I really can&#x27;t say enough about how much we love it. I will definitely be buying more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we have found that they&#x27;re the one brush that you can use on American Girl Dolls. It doesn&#x27;t pull their hair or rip it out! Amazing!</li>
            <li> Hairbrush works great!!! I&#x27;m able to brush my hair without experiencing pain and it doesn&#x27;t take me forever!! I have very very tangley hair, even after shampooing and conditioning. Some days I would even give up on brushing my hair and just pull it back in a bun. I do not have that problem anymore! I bought a brush for me and two other family members and it work great for all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few of these after my hair dresser used the wet brush on me.  I have long think curly hair and would only use a comb to get through my wet hair.  This brush had no problems getting through it, along with my daughters super think long hair.  I thought the true test would be my nieces.  They hate having their hair brushed because it hurts when your scalped is pulled.  My sister wrote me thanking for the best thing ever.  She was half way through her daughters wet hair before she knew her mom was even brushing it.  The next day she brushed her hair without her mom nagging her to do it because it didn&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> Yes! These work on Rapunzel length, baby fine hair! I love these brushes and I usually hate brushes because most brushes actually cause more tangles than they tame but this brush really does work and it feels great on my tender scalp too. I recommend spraying your brush with a little bit of silicone &#x27;anti-frizz&#x27; spray if you get a lot of static during the winter.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product from a hair stylist friend of mine.  She let me use it and it worked great on brushing out knots in my long, wavy hair.  After using it, I had to have it!  It doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt your hair like other brushes do.  I would recommend this brush to almost anyone.  Just a tip for hair brushing in general: start at the tips and work your way up to your roots, this will hurt a lot less than if you begin brushing straight from the roots.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe there was such a thing as this item. When I read the description, I really did not believe the claims made that this would take my tangles out. I have very long, very thin  hair and every time I brush my hair it is very painful and clumps of my hair end up in any other kind of brush I had used. I received this brush yesterday and when I brushed my hair I about fell over in amazement. Not only did I not have tears in my eyes from the usual pain I was used to when I would brush with my usual brushes but all of my tangles came out with such ease. I have ordered 3 more of this item because I dont want to be anywhere without one. This item is a must have for anyone that hates to brush their hair because of the pain and agony of getting tangles out. This brush truly causes no pain and gets the tangles out in seconds. Yes I said seconds. I am so Amazed. WOW WOW WOW.</li>
            <li> Love this brush so much I had to buy a 2nd one for my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;nothing gets through my tangles better and is easier to use than this brush!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, straight, and fine, yet very densely populated on my head.  If I use this brush while my hair is wet I might as well not even bother.  I gave it 3 stars because it works well on dry hair.  It&#x27;s very gentle on dry hair, but on wet it doesn&#x27;t do anything to detangle even when I use leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser received one of these brushes to try for free from a vendor who sells him products. I just happened to be the first client he tried it on. I have long hair that is usually very difficult to brush out after washing. Normally, my hair dresser has to put loads of detangler in my hair &amp; spends about 15-20 minutes brushing out my hair before a haircut, but not with DivaGlide! He literally brushed right through my hair in less than 5 minutes. We were both seriously amazed! Not only that, but the DivaGlide doesn&#x27;t pull at my scalp like normal brushes. It didn&#x27;t even hurt. This brush works! Get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My daughter has 26 inches of thick wavy, self-tangling hair. We have tried so many brushes, combs, detanglers, nothing worked. She refused to even try to brush her hair until it was dry. Other brushes snagged the hair until it broke or snapped into a tighter knot. I did not have much hope, but this cheap brush eased thru her hair, and she was so happy! It did not pull or snag the hair. Some tangles were beyond it&#x27;s effort, but the brush just stopped and she worked them with her fingers instead of the brush just pulling out the hair in clumps. It is way to light to last very long, but it is cheap enough to buy a few a year if needed.I would pay more for heavier, tougher plastic that would survive more crashes on the marble floor!</li>
            <li> Takes out knots even in my very curly hair that&#x27;s easily ripping and breaking when I brush it. This brush is very gentle and rips out less hairs. Works for us best under running water, which is perfect when we return from a swim at the beach. Has not the invigorating feel for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair. It used to take me 30 painful minutes to comb it out after washing. With the wet brush.....5 minutes tops. NO painful pulling and trying to tease out every tangle. It just detangles and moves through your wet hair smoothly. I do use a detangler spray with it, but I did before also. Now I can get a long smooth stroke from scalp to ends of my waist length hair. I love this brush, and have told many people about it. Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> I have really thick shoulder-length wavy hair that is always super snarly after washing (no matter how much conditioner I use). I usually take my time with a wide-toothed comb...which works, but it&#x27;s not great. So when a friend recommended this, I was all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it does pull straight through my hair without stopping (unlike the comb, which only makes it about an inch)...but...you have to repeatedly go over the same section of hair in order to untangle the entire area because it only takes the topmost layer of hair at a time (unlike the comb, which reaches down to the scalp). But it is painless, so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s an advantage for brushing kids&#x27; hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this if you/your kid has thinner hair or if they hate getting their hair brushed. As an adult with long thick hair...I could go either way.</li>
            <li> Love, love this brush!Could never find anything that didn&#x27;t hurt my extra fine long hair, but this glides through!Ordered for all my sisters cmas gifts</li>
            <li> Amazingly and at last a detangling brush that actually works. My long curly haired daughter loves it. We bought two more just in case one goes missing - ill never be without one again.</li>
            <li> Best brush on the market! I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> This brush goes right through my 4 year old daughters curly hair. Before I used this brush she would scream every time I combed through her hair, but now, no screams at all! Works great on wet or dry hair! I love it too! Well worth the few bucks!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush to use on wet hair and this brush really works.  It is easy on hair and scalp</li>
            <li> I already have a wet brush, which I use everyday.....I love it! I ordered two more for my daughters......they are very happy with them......they glide right through wet hair....  LI NY</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Bought one for my 10 year old daughter too. She went from hating to brush her hair to brushing it everyday without hesitation.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic.  They work well for thick or fine hair.  It also works great in wet or dry hair unlike some brushes which work well on only one.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, wavy, difficult hair.  Bought this because of all of the positive reviews. (thank you, Amazon reviewers!) This brush just works, unlike many others I have tried.  Can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have these brushes stowed everywhere.  travel. swim bags, beach bags bathroom. WE have long thin hair Always tangled after getting wet.  these brushes when used on wet hair are a miracle.  they do not break hair.</li>
            <li> I can say hands down that this is the best brush I have ever used. Girls, you know how when you just use shampoo  &amp; no conditioner how much of a hassle it is to brush through your hair afterwards? With this brush it glides straight through with no pain at all! I use [[ASIN:B001F51RJW Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner, 23.7-fluid ounces Bottles (Pack of 2)]] and since it&#x27;s a 2in1 the conditioner part doesn&#x27;t make your hair as soft and brush-able straight from the shower. I can completely brush through my hair within under a minute. I have medium - thick hair that goes past my chest. I love this brush. 5/5</li>
            <li> I have very long, baby fine hair and drive a convertible.  I get tangles like crazy.  This brush takes them out without breaking off all my hair, love it straight out of the shower, love it when I get out of the car, love it!  Bought a second one for my daughter, she loves it!  Makes your hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li> gentle on the scalp, this is the best brush i have found to get through my thick, curly tangled hair.  my old brush tore the hair out by the roots... ouch!! and i ended up having to cut out the tangles... this brush glides!!</li>
            <li> I learned about the brush at my salon, it&#x27;s great on my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! Totally works and worth it!</li>
            <li> I read the glowing reviews and thought this was the brush that was going to work perfectly on my thick, wavy, midlength hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is meh...ok. The bristles are very thin and not strong. I imagine that they will break soon. It does seem to de-tangle hair quite well without ripping the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric where the bristles come out of gets wet in the shower, and takes a long time to dry out - not what I would think would be a good thing for a brush claiming to be a good wet brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a series of brushes that are all the same brush here on Amazon - I purchased several at the same time, and they are identical except for the branding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this brush and was a bit skeptical buying it thinking, \\&quot;How could it be so good at brushing tangled hair?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now on my hair and my preschool daughters&#x27; hair. I am impressed. They do not cry, complain, or try to run away from me anymore when it is time to brush hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are thinner and more flexible than other brushes I have used. It works great on wet or dry hair. The only complaint I have against the brush so far is that the bristles feel really sharp against my scalp and the bare skin on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daugthers have long hair and the stylist at the salon recommended the brush. I didn&#x27;t like the price of the brush at the salon and was glad that I found it on Amazon at a much more reasonable price. The brush works great, especially after shower. It gets all the tangles out without detangler. It&#x27;s the only brush they will use. I like using it too. I&#x27;m back to purchase another one as a spare.</li>
            <li> I received a black brush, which what I actually prefer.  Very ergonomic, with a nice feel in your hand.  The handle has a rubbery feel on it and it won&#x27;t slip in your hand.  The tips are rounded uniformly, unlike my daughter&#x27;s Wet Brush where some tips are big blobs and some are too small.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp at all; in fact it feels like a massage.  This is a very basic simple brush, that works exactly the way I like it.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows using a brush on your hair is damaging but if you just have to, this is the one. My hair is thick, to my waist, and rebellious. This brush has very flexible bristles so when it encounters any kind of tangle it lets go, this means easy on the scalp, doesn&#x27;t hurt but takes FOREVER to brush out your hair. If you deal with hair like mine, it takes forever anyway. So put on a good show, pull out this brush and give yourself a break from the pain.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need a brush - I just wanted to see how much they were because someone was asking me about mine (I bought one from my hair dresser). I saw that it was an add-on product and I was so excited about the price since I thought it was for 4 brushes. I thought this based on the description of the product and the price since I don&#x27;t think I paid more than $8 for mine in the salon. I am not a dumby and I know it would usually say &amp;#34;set of 4,&amp;#34; but in this case it doesn&#x27;t let you chose a color and it says &amp;#34;assorted colors.&amp;#34;  I was going to put one in my car; in my bathroom; my son&#x27;s bathroom, etc... So I rated this a 4 because the price isn&#x27;t that good relatively speaking and for the deceiving description. It is a very good brush otherwise.</li>
            <li> Solid comb, not as HUGE as some of the other review say... but pretty big.  Feels solid, nice wide bristles, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have three daughters so we go through a lot of brushes.  I really like this one.  It does go through hair more smoothly and less painful than other brushes.  I use it for myself, as well as my tender headed six year old.</li>
            <li> This works better than a regular brush on wet hair.  But not much difference on dry hair.  Still snags on tangles regardless of wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how anyone thought this brush detangles hair. I have thick, down my back, long hair and it knots easily after a shower. This tore my hair out with a single swipe. It went right back. Please people, be honest with your reviews, I hate sending stuff back! I decided to use Simply Smooth Magic Potion, sold here on Amazon, and my comb slid through my hair. Will stick with that!</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that both of my girls never complain about. Works like magic even their hair are quite messy. I have ordered two before and finds not enough, so I ordered two more. LOL</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after using my roommate&#x27;s for a few months. Hers was great - my hair never had tangles and it was so gentle! This one is not at all like hers. Unfortunately, it can&#x27;t handle the tangles in my hair, and it always leaves me feeling like only the top section of my hair was even brushed. It is okay as a supplement to one of the heavier-duty traditional brushes, but that means that my knots are still a problem. I&#x27;m was disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever owned for my long hair.  It really does the things that it claims.</li>
            <li> A hairdresser recommended this brush to me to help deal with my easily-tangled hair. It works amazing!! I use it right after toweling off from the shower and it glides right through my hair. For some people, that might not be a big deal, but if you struggle with knots after showering or have trouble brushing through without pulling and ripping fine hairs, definitely try this brush. It&#x27;s been such a time-saver for me and allows me to brush my hair easily without using tons of product to make it smooth/brushable first.</li>
            <li> I have a three year old with very curly hair and before this brush it was such a dramatic event to get her to let me brush her hair.  NOT ANYMORE I LOVE IT !!!!</li>
            <li> If you have girls that have long hair....these are a must. durable waterproof and easily glide thru the hair in a jif.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand exactly why this works so differently than other brushes but it does. Now after their baths, my little girls specifically insist that we use this brush to brush the tangles out of their wet hair.  It delivers on it&#x27;s promise.  Wet or dry, tangles just come out easier and painlessly with this brush.  It is a must  for anyone with long hair and an absolute must for anyone with brushing wet tangled kid hair.</li>
            <li> quickly detangles wet hair as advertised. Got one for my 4 year old granddaughter and it works great for her, too.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  We break brushes constantly.  These seem great so far. 4 girls with long tangly hair love it what else can I say?</li>
            <li> I was recommended it by a friend, I received it in the mail today and instantly loved it. It makes your hair SO smooth!!! If this one gets worn out or breaks, I would definitley buy it again!!! A bit on the pricey side but TOTALLY WORTH IT</li>
            <li> I have super-fine hair and it helps make my hair look more smoothe than frizzy. However, it does pull more than my previous brush, Ouchless by Goody.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews on this hair brush before buying it.  My hair is pretty hard to brush out, even hair stylists tell me so when I go for a hair cut.  I doubted a brush could really make a difference but now I&#x27;m convinced.  This brush does make brushing my hair much much easier than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> I am really not sure how this brush is different from other brushes, but it is a lot softer yet still manages my thick hair. The children don&#x27;t cry when I use the Diva Glide brush (and they cry whenever I get our numerous Goody brushes out). It works a lot better than boar&#x27;s hair (unfortunately -- I would like to use a natural substance). It&#x27;s actually the perfect brush for my hair, and if it breaks or I get bored with my pretty purple one, I&#x27;ll be back for another one. I&#x27;m not going back to Goody brushes again.</li>
            <li> I saw this brush on a girls YouTube video of how she creates her hair style. Her hair was thick and to her waist and the brush went right through her hair so I had to try it. We have 3 girls with long hair and this brush is unbelievable! We no longer need to use Miracle 10 after washing our hair to comb our hair out.&lt;br /&gt;A must have for longer thicker hair. I will be buying lots f these for Christmas gifts this year!</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these brushes for my granddaughters - they all have thick long hair and they loved them so much, I bought one for me.  It is great!  Make sure you get the &amp;#34;Luxor&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li> I have really tangly long hair, and this brush certainly does do a good job of combing it all out and getting rid of mats and tangles (which I develop super easily). Even so, I&#x27;m pretty sure my hair is breaking a LOT when I&#x27;m using this brush. I seem to have a lot more small breaky pieces on top of my head. For now, it&#x27;s the best solution I&#x27;ve found to having hair so tangly that it forms giant mats if I don&#x27;t comb it out every few hours. I&#x27;d say it seems unnecessary for other hair types, but that&#x27;s obviously not an informed opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush mainly due to all of the great reviews it had - easy to brush through wet hair after washing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it was just the same as my regular, everyday \\&quot;paddle\\&quot; brush that I received for free when I bought a drugstore hair dryer several years ago. The bristles on the Diva brush are just a little more flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, straight hair that likes to tangle something awful after I wash it. So I was hoping this brush would save me some time brushing it out - and save me some hair, since I tend to lose a lot when brushing. I lost about the same amount of hair as I do with my freebie brush that I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yea... it&#x27;s just another brush for me - nothing more, sadly!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this brush! It is the best hair brush I have tried for my extremely tangly hair, and I prefer it over the Tangle Teezer which I have tried as well.</li>
            <li> goes through hair gently,. no ripping, I have baby fine hair, but a lot, and this makes it so easy to brush right out of the shower..and you can use it on dry hair, nice brush.</li>
            <li> With many hairbrushes running more than $100, one would not be faulted for feeling a little concern over the very attractive pricing of this brush. However, I decided the risk was worth it, and ended up with a brush that does exactly as it claims. In fact, as soon as I finish writing this review, I&#x27;m buying two more.</li>
            <li> Love this brush my son and I and husband have long hair my daughter told me need to get it so I did and any one with tangled hair u must have its a wow</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 and has very fine hair.  I was telling a friend what a challenge it is when we brush her hair after bath and she recommended the \\&quot;Wet Brush\\&quot;.  I immediately order it and had it in a few days.  This has saved our relationship and now lets us brush her hair.  I think it works best if the person has fine hair, but overall very very good product.</li>
            <li> I was about to see about disowning my 9-year-old daughter. Her hair was making our lives miserable. She has long, thick as heck hair, and could not seem to control it on her own. She&#x27;d get dreads overnight. And swimming was a nightmare; even when she wore braids. I&#x27;d have battles with her every morning, which always ended with me thinking \\&quot;I&#x27;ll cut it off!\\&quot; Ok, I might have yelled that a few times too. Anyway, someone told me about this brush. I saw one too, in a store, but the store was closed, so I couldn&#x27;t buy it. It wasn&#x27;t impressive. I thought it was just a brush. But I threw it in my cart one day at amazon and waited to be wowed. Boy, I was blown away. It was incredible. I have no idea how it works, but somehow, some way, it gets rid of tangles. She uses it in the shower, and then daily when she puts her hair in a pony tail. I eventually got one for me too. It works wet or dry, and seems to control those pesky grey hairs that have minds of their own. This product really changed our daily routine. Thank you wet brush!</li>
            <li> I and  my daughter used it when hair is wet or dry. It is soft and confortable. It is good for us.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair that Im trying to grow out farther, and I undertsand how important it is to be kind to your hair when its wet and vulnerable. This brush made it so easy when you first get out of the shower. BUT. after 6 months or so, the little balls on the tips of the bristles had fallen off and now it kinda hurts to brush with this.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter who has very thick (full of tangles) hair.  The brush arrived...very flimsy bristles.  Packaging advertises to be great for use on wigs and extensions.  That would be great if my daughter had a wig or extensions...but she doesn&#x27;t.  I asked to return this brush and received NO response.  Would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> The Brussels fall out</li>
            <li> Love this brush! it is better with dry hair or just a little wet, but not really for using inside the shower.</li>
            <li> I will never use another brush. This thing is AWESOME! My hair is super fine, and tangles over NOTHING. This brush gets out the knots without tearing my hair out. Love it!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist sold one to me and I love it.  I definitely lose a lot less hair now.  Works wonderful with wet hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brushes over the years and &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; is the absolute best, no lie !</li>
            <li> My wife loved how effectively it untangles her hair; great Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Best price and best brush. This is the only brush I use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long hair, and do use this in and out of the shower. Works as advertised and promised.</li>
            <li> My little girl has long curly hair.  Brushing that hair was always a battle, even after soaking it with tangle spray she&#x27;d still cry that it pulled.  Buying this brush has saved me hours of whining.</li>
            <li> This brush does go through your wet hair more easily and does not rip hair out like most brushes.  The bristles feel good on my scalp, too.  Though if you have a sensitive scalp, you may not like the bristles.</li>
            <li> I received this item quickly however, was quite dismayed upon reading packaging info upon receipt.  This brush is listed as \\&quot;The West Brush Diva Glide Collection\\&quot;.  Not quite.  This is more for a wig, hair extensions etc.  If the primary purpose of this brush is that its a \\&quot;Wet Brush\\&quot; then why is this information not shown immediately on  the front of packaging.  Name on front of package says nothing about being a Wet Brush.  The pack of packing towards the lower region says that it can be used on wet hair.  Again, this was not manufactured for the main purpose of being used on wet hair.  It is because of this condition, that I returned the brush, unused, wasn&#x27;t feeling to anxious to use it on my fine hair.  It may work or it may not.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing brush! My son is biracial and I have tried multiple combs, brushes and specialty products (Hair Bean, Knot Genie, detanglers, etc.) for his hair type but nothing has worked as well as the Diva Glide. It took 20 minutes to get through his hair with previous products and he screamed the whole time. The Diva Glide works in about 2 minutes without even using any detanglers or leave-in conditioner. I also tried this product on my long, thick, wavy hair while it was wet. there was no pulling and very little hair on the brush when I was finished and that is a big deal for me. This product is a \\&quot;MUST\\&quot; for anyone with curly hair or hair that tangles easily!</li>
            <li> WOW! So happy! Love how well it combs my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter loved hers so much that I bought another for my youngest. They have held up well. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying I never write reviews but I had to let people know about my experience! This brush is absolutely fantastic! I was looking for a brush for my long wavy hair, after doing some research and almost ordering the Mason Pearson brush for $100+ I decided to give this brush a try and boy am I glad I did. I used to dread washing my long hair because it was such a pain to brush out all the tangles! This brush is a miracle with absolutely no effort this brush just glides through my hair! I don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews and how people don&#x27;t like this brush?! People just buy it you will not regret it. As soon as this review is over I&#x27;ll be ordering 2 more one for my little one and one for my mom! DON&#x27;T HESITATE GET IT NOW!</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! Anyone that has a daughter with long hair that screams when you brush out her wet hair needs to get this!!!! Glides through the hair!!!! NO MORE TEARS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I think I may have expected too much.  It&#x27;s a fine brush, but it sure isn&#x27;t strong enough to get tangles out of my thick long hair.  Maybe good for thin hair or kids, but be careful if you have thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is super naughty when wet, with a few strokes, the naughts disappear!  I love this brush and would recommend this to anyone with troublesome naughts!</li>
            <li> I personally did not find the Wet Brush to be life changing. As a hairbrush, it does what I need it to do, but I didn&#x27;t find it&#x27;s detangling properties particularly revolutionary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles of the brush are thin and very flexible. The result of this is that it will not snag knotted hair like a traditional brush would, but it also means that if you have more course or thick hair, the brush isn&#x27;t going to be strong enough to work though those knots easily. I have thicker Asian hair that is very straight, and I simply found my hair too heavy for the Wet Brush to handle with ease. I found myself wishing for a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to note is that the brush head is very large. It is definitely designed to be an overall detangler as opposed to a brush you can use to create fanciful hairstyles.</li>
            <li> it works well.  with a little de-tangler, my daughter&#x27;s curls brush out nicely without a lot of &amp;#34;ouchies.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these brushes for my daughter &amp; grandaughter.  They said it is the best brush they have ever had.  One of them has thick &amp; curly hair and the other has thin fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering them this brush again when needed !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> These Wet Brushes are the best ever.  It has been a week now that I have not been screamed at over brushing my daughters hair.  They are just amazing!!</li>
            <li> Works well on my childs thick hair.  Now she can comb her own hair.  No crying or complaining about the brush hurting her head.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading other reviews.  Frankly I was skeptical, but this brush is awesome.  My son has curly hair that tangles easily.  He can brush his own hair with this with no problem.  I liked it so much I bought one for me (I have long hair and it brushes easily without ripping my hair out).  Wish I&#x27;d had the product when my daughter was younger.  If you have a child with a sensitive head who hates brush I recommend this product.  Changed our brushing lives!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST brush for wet hair - I have thick, naturally curly shoulder length hair - and - this brush is theeee BEST for detangling after washing,.</li>
