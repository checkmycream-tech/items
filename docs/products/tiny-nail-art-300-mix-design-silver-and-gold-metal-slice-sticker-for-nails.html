            <li>But they r cute</li>
            <li>sliver cause ok have so many gold ones already.</li>
            <li>are cute...</li>
            <li>They are so tiny, in a perfect way.</li>
            <li>I meant to order from the same vender because these metal slices are awesome.</li>
            <li>Will order more when i need them again.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>AND THERE ARE SO MANY TO CHOSE FROM</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine their still cute.</li>
            <li>so I can;t say how they hold on gels and acrylics, but great on natural nails.</li>
            <li>I use them as embeds in my gel or acrylic because the do not bend to the the shape of the nail bed too easily.</li>
            <li>These are super cute and I received the ones In the picture.</li>
            <li>Super elegant.</li>
            <li>The metal logo slices looks SUPER CUTE on my nails</li>
            <li>These were nice looking, I was pretty excited to put them to use.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not mad:-)</li>
            <li>Very pretty though!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>They would fit a toddler&#x27;s nail size</li>
            <li>They were excited because they are so beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>One issue: They didn&#x27;t originally send me any LV charms or any silver-</li>
            <li>The size is just right for my nails and there easy to bend to the shape of your nail.</li>
            <li>If you can put it IN acrylic.. that&#x27;d be sweet.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty easy</li>
            <li>They did provide what they claimed and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I would however use nail glue instead of clear nail polish if you want it to stick for more than one day.</li>
            <li>I love to wear them and so does my 4 yr old</li>
            <li>However, no silver again which was quite ok with my 13 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>;( maybe i needed to apply more clear coats.</li>
            <li>Just okay, they catch on other things, you will need to apply lots of top coats</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get them to stick or stay on no matter how much I shaped them or how many hundred layers of clear coat I applied.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to apply, adheres well with clear polish.</li>
            <li>I suggest bending them against your nail first to curve them.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get many of the silver (which is really what I wanted) and a few more of the Hello Kitty than I would have wanted</li>
            <li>Love these last forever on the toes!!!!</li>
            <li>Tiny intricate and too adorable.</li>
            <li>This brand was not that good, you may use the other one better &#x3D; &amp;#34;350BUY 60pcs 12 Hollow Style DIY Gold Metal Sticker slices Charms Wheel Nail Art&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They are really cute came pretty fast to wish they was not all mixed together</li>
            <li>Just know that you will have to bend each one to sit nicely on your nail without sharp edges.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t really want those), but cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>the original shipment was nothing near 300 charms (these are not stickers you need to use clear nail polish to adhere these to the nails).</li>
            <li>Do not expect decent size designs.</li>
            <li>I love these little charms.</li>
            <li>These little nail art pieces are to cute.</li>
            <li>then what you normally would expect.</li>
            <li>Small and cute.</li>
            <li>use a clear gel polish on top of the slices...that will make them less likely to come off.</li>
            <li>I even tried putting some clear coat under them to make it sticky and they still just fell off.</li>
            <li>Anyways, after writing the seller I received the additional amount that was missing from my original package.  </li>
            <li>small, so good for small nails.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>Received earlier then expected, Very organized.</li>

            <li> small, so good for small nails.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> Received earlier then expected, Very organized.</li>
            <li> They came in all GOLD, the only difference is that the hello kitty face is hollow....</li>
            <li> The only down side was that they came all mixed up in one little packet I had to sort them my self</li>
            <li> Shipping was about 1 week or less and it came in a clear round case.</li>
            <li> Not even a single silver sticker!</li>
            <li> so you have to put them on a wide part of the nail to keep it from lifting.</li>
            <li> I been careful now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The description says tiny and they do mean tiny.</li>
            <li> I read this on other reviews but ignored those people.</li>
            <li> but other then that its alright</li>
            <li> i tried them with glue and the kitty heads stick out a little on the sides.</li>
            <li> but they also came off in a few days because the sides and corners will begin to lift up and get caught into thing.</li>
            <li> I wish the metal slices came with only the designs shown in the picture, but it also came with other weird designs that i don&#x27;t like and it becomes a waste.</li>
            <li> but the only thing is that it said gold and silver, and I didn&#x27;t got any silver ones I only got the gold ones :(</li>
            <li> I did end up getting the wrong designs, but when I contacted the seller they sent out the correct designs the next day at no charge.</li>
            <li> I hardly used force, but i guess cause i didnt anticipate the delicateness.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to put it on your nails by yourself.</li>
            <li> Use a drop of crazy glue then a thin clear coat over.  </li>
            <li> Because they are delicate i accidently rolled one of them like a bug.</li>
            <li> Very small decals and poorly made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep on the nail!</li>
            <li> not what I expected i thought that they were sticky very difficult to put on... not a good item to purchase</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY, AND WILL BE REPORTING THIS.</li>
            <li> I distributed them as gifts in tens to my nail art addicted friends.</li>
            <li> False advertisement.</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was unhappy that I didn&#x27;t get 300 pcs.</li>
            <li> I do not have artificial nails</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will try crazy glue!</li>
            <li> was disappointed with the quality of the product, but you get what you pay for.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are super cute and I received the ones In the picture. Very satisfied with them. Me and my daughter use them for nail decorations.</li>
            <li> I counted them and I got 391 nail decals:-) I got hello kitty,bows,chanel,butterflys,flowers and snowflakes all gold no silver it&#x27;s ok they sent more then 300 so I&#x27;m not mad:-)</li>
            <li> This are very cute and perfect size for nail art! but the only thing is that it said gold and silver, and I didn&#x27;t got any silver ones I only got the gold ones :(</li>
            <li> these are very cute, they are a good size that fits nails. i tried them with glue and the kitty heads stick out a little on the sides. i think they would work out better in gel.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! I DIDN&#x27;T RECEIVE ANYTHING IN THE PHOTO. DIDN&#x27;T GET SILVER, HELLO KITTY, OR THE LV. THE LV WAS THE REASON WHY I PURCHASED THIS! NOT HAPPY, AND WILL BE REPORTING THIS. WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN</li>
            <li> Good quality and enjoy the designs.  I would however use nail glue instead of clear nail polish if you want it to stick for more than one day.</li>
            <li> Received all three as shown, however only gold color, none were silver so I gave them 4 stars.  Still like them.  I suggest bending them against your nail first to curve them. Use a drop of crazy glue then a thin clear coat over.  Mine have been on for two weeks.  I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> not what I expected i thought that they were sticky very difficult to put on... not a good item to purchase</li>
            <li> Got lots of great pieces, just as advertised.  I immediately did &amp;#34;Louis Vuitton&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Chanel&amp;#34; nail designs and with enough topcoat, they&#x27;re brilliant!</li>
            <li> Got em before the estimated date.  Great packaging! They came in all GOLD, the only difference is that the hello kitty face is hollow.... no biggie.  I&#x27;m looking to order more ASAP.  Great for creating your favorite purse design on your nails... THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> The description says tiny and they do mean tiny. Do not expect decent size designs. The product is great and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It came with all the logo&#x27;s in the picture. Received earlier then expected, Very organized. The only thing is it was all gold so don&#x27;t expect silver.</li>
            <li> ALL of the items sent were gold...I never wear gold, so these will get tossed in the nail art box.  Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Two issues. One. I did NOT receive 300 stickers, I got 100 at most. And that assuming I&#x27;m being generous with the number. Two. They are NOT a mix of silver and gold. They are only gold. Not even a single silver sticker! False advertisement.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  I like to match my bags with my shoes and my nails so this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;thank you LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Great!!! I get alot of compliment on the sticker will recommend to others.  I will order some more Love it</li>
            <li> Love these excepted I wish it would of not came with Hello Kitty..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep on the nail! I will try crazy glue! Very pretty though!</li>
            <li> Did not get any sliver and that&#x27;s why I ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;And when I contacted the seller they said they do not get anymore sliver .so maybe you should just say gold. But they r cute but I really wanted sliver cause ok have so many gold ones already.</li>
            <li> I love these little charms. The size is just right for my nails and there easy to bend to the shape of your nail. The only down side was that they came all mixed up in one little packet I had to sort them my self but it was pretty easy</li>
            <li> Very small decals and poorly made. They fall apart within 10 minuets of applying them . Go to your nail salon instead</li>
            <li> Just okay, they catch on other things, you will need to apply lots of top coats</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them to stick or stay on no matter how much I shaped them or how many hundred layers of clear coat I applied. I even tried putting some clear coat under them to make it sticky and they still just fell off. I washed my hands and 3 came off. Finally I showered and they were all gone. Lame.</li>
            <li> I read this on other reviews but ignored those people. Should have listened.&lt;br /&gt;They did not sen any silver. This is the reason why I purchased the product.&lt;br /&gt;They are cute...just gold only....what a shame. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to apply, adheres well with clear polish. I especially like that they have a bit of flexibility, so that they can be applied at all different angles of the nail. I do not have artificial nails so I can;t say how they hold on gels and acrylics, but great on natural nails. I didn&#x27;t get many of the silver (which is really what I wanted) and a few more of the Hello Kitty than I would have wanted (I didn&#x27;t really want those), but cannot beat the price. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> You do not get silver pieces, and they are smaller then what you normally would expect. They would fit a toddler&#x27;s nail size</li>
            <li> I love them they&#x27;re great but they don&#x27;t bend well so you have to put them on a wide part of the nail to keep it from lifting. If you can put it IN acrylic.. that&#x27;d be sweet.</li>
            <li> Beautiful an delicated, easy to use and i recive so soon</li>
            <li> Love these last forever on the toes!!!!</li>
            <li> These were nice looking, I was pretty excited to put them to use. Unfortunately I was unhappy that I didn&#x27;t get 300 pcs. Also they don&#x27;t stay on at all. By the next day they were gone or a piece was broke off, so u had to replace it with another one, or take them all off and give up on the mani or pedi</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> Bought them for the Hello Kitty!&lt;br /&gt;Very small, so good for small nails.&lt;br /&gt;Gave to niece!</li>
            <li> I like it, but you need to put before you put the acrylic , because they not stay , so put glue or acrylic to put in the nail.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just as pictured!</li>
            <li> They are so tiny, in a perfect way. They did provide what they claimed and they arrived quickly. I distributed them as gifts in tens to my nail art addicted friends. Who absolutely loved them! They were excited because they are so beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At no fault of the product. I accidently damaged one of them. Because they are delicate i accidently rolled one of them like a bug. I hardly used force, but i guess cause i didnt anticipate the delicateness. I been careful now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I loved them. I would recommend them to all nail art lovers.</li>
            <li> I love these and love the fact they came in silver and gold....not very many places carry them in silver....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get alot of compliments and clients requesting these on their nails...</li>
            <li> This brand was not that good, you may use the other one better &#x3D; &amp;#34;350BUY 60pcs 12 Hollow Style DIY Gold Metal Sticker slices Charms Wheel Nail Art&amp;#34;. this product was easily to get off, though I had put 3 cot of transparent nail polish top to protect it!</li>
            <li> I have ordered a second set already! I meant to order from the same vender because these metal slices are awesome. I use them as embeds in my gel or acrylic because the do not bend to the the shape of the nail bed too easily. Just a suggestion for those who want to use them without acrylics....use a clear gel polish on top of the slices...that will make them less likely to come off.</li>
            <li> I did end up getting the wrong designs, but when I contacted the seller they sent out the correct designs the next day at no charge. Excellence customer service, and the product is great!</li>
            <li> Loved these they were metal an durable by suprise .. Tiny intricate and too adorable. I love to wear them and so does my 4 yr old</li>
            <li> They are nice.. I was expecting something a bit bigger, but I can&#x27;t complain based on the price and amount received,</li>
            <li> it took forever for it to be delivered and there were definitely NOT 300 in the tiny lil bag they came in. was disappointed with the quality of the product, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> They are really cute came pretty fast to wish they was not all mixed together but other then that its alright</li>
            <li> Looks awesome on pedicure!!!  Excellent price, too!!  The service was excellent and the pricing was excellent.  I would buy from again!</li>
            <li> These little nail art pieces are to cute. I thought I was going to get some silver pieces with the gold. but, I didn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s fine their still cute.</li>
            <li> its good you get what you paid</li>
            <li> I thought those where stickers that suck on but they aren&#x27;t. They are so tiny and it&#x27;s hard to put it on your nails by yourself. You need to get it done and have someone it for you.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with it all being gold tone.could have sworn the description stated both gold and silver tone.and there was only 3 desings</li>
            <li> I love them they are so cute.!!! I got hello kitty. LA and channel thankz. Will order more when i need them again.</li>
            <li> I will post a picture. Shipping was about 1 week or less and it came in a clear round case. One issue: They didn&#x27;t originally send me any LV charms or any silver- the original shipment was nothing near 300 charms (these are not stickers you need to use clear nail polish to adhere these to the nails). Anyways, after writing the seller I received the additional amount that was missing from my original package.  However, no silver again which was quite ok with my 13 year old daughter. I will post a picture of her nails with the CC charm.</li>
            <li> I got everything in the photo but only in Gold. I was hoping to get what they said I would get a mix of silver and gold. but I guess it will work. very tiny too!</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM AND THERE ARE SO MANY TO CHOSE FROM</li>
            <li> AWESOME! Just know that you will have to bend each one to sit nicely on your nail without sharp edges.</li>
            <li> Small and cute. Super elegant.</li>
            <li> This set it a must have, very nicely cut designs, easy to apply on nails, very good for the price.</li>
            <li> I wish the metal slices came with only the designs shown in the picture, but it also came with other weird designs that i don&#x27;t like and it becomes a waste. The metal logo slices looks SUPER CUTE on my nails but they also came off in a few days because the sides and corners will begin to lift up and get caught into thing. ;( maybe i needed to apply more clear coats.</li>
            <li> Some of the Hello Kitty and Chanel designs were bent.</li>
            <li> lots of gold ones and granddaughter just loved them</li>
