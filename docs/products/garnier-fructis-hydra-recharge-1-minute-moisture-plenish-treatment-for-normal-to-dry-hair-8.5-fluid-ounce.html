            <li>I was so impressed by the 1-Minute Moisture-Plenish treatment, and the rest of the Hydra Recharge system, that I am trashing my old hair products and switching to Garnier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who doesent want soft, sleek hair that smells good and looks great?  </li>
            <li>Much more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t like it, but I&#x27;ll use it.  </li>
            <li>It was okay for the money.</li>
            <li>The product does work best after a traditional wash+conditioning cycle, however.</li>
            <li>love the packaging.</li>
            <li>The longer I use it, the better my hair gets.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it instead of conditioner after each wash for years and have fooled many with how healthy my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I love the way Garnier&#x27;s products smell.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way this product smells, I know it has pictures of a bunch of tropical fruits on it</li>
            <li>it smelled great too and my hair felt very moisturized and light.</li>
            <li>My fingers went right through my hair after a minute which was amazing to untangle my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>This makes it really easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>The whole hydra recharge system is amazing :)</li>
            <li>and I was able to go two full days without having to shampoo/condition again</li>
            <li>it is also great for dry heels but be sure to stand on a towel in the shower it is slippery.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got my hydra recharge along with the shampoo and condition from buzzagent for free to try out.</li>
            <li>I love this whole line and will be purchasing when mine is gone :)</li>
            <li>I loved what it did for my hair, but had to quit using it because I was majorly allergic to it.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product for dry winter hair</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes my hair cut look full of life as well.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this product even on its own.</li>
            <li>Paired with the other products left me with great results!</li>
            <li>this was just right.</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this product based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried was the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle.</li>
            <li>Most hair systems make me feel like I am just wasting time and money, this one actually helps me achieve what it says it will.</li>
            <li>oh my gosh, my hair hasn&#x27;t had this much volume in forEVER!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling silky without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>Since using this I have seen a massive difference in how my hair feels; it&#x27;s silky, strong, and non-frizzy.</li>
            <li>It rinses out very easily and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling sleek and smooth, and can be used in place of standard conditioner in a time crunch.  </li>
            <li>really like this product alot.</li>
            <li>My hair has become much softer and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling smooth and sleek</li>
            <li>really recommend it</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair are much dryer than when I was using Aussie.  </li>
            <li>There are other Garnier Fructis products that are much better.</li>
            <li>(I probably could have went a third but that just didn&#x27;t feel right).  </li>
            <li>One unexpected surprise- the volume!</li>
            <li>The regular conditioner was nice- nothing out of the ordinary but this treatment has me sold.</li>
            <li>My only positive is that I like the smell.  </li>
            <li>my hair is fine and the 3 minute treatment was to heavy.</li>
            <li>It was silky, soft, manageable</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny considering my strange hair - thick with a fine texture, curly in the back and straight in the front (all natural).  </li>
            <li>, my hair is VERY greasy on a normal basis and wash my hair every night but since starting this it will last about 3 days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li>Why Garnier discontinued this product is beyond me, it actually works, it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and rinses clean leaving hair shiny.</li>
            <li>system left my hair so soft and minimized the visibility of damage.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see and feel a major difference in my hair since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky without weighing it down (making it oily), which is SO hard to find!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair daily</li>
            <li> Over the last few months, my  normally oily hair has become very dry, damaged, and brittle.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> it shines like it hasn&#x27;t in a long time.</li>
            <li> It calms my winter frizz, I don&#x27;t need to use any products after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> reference, I have thick, wavy, normal hair about shoulder length.</li>
            <li> It has saved my frizzy hair from a load of additional damage by taming it down finally!  </li>
            <li> Give this a try if you too have either dry, brittle and chemically damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I does dry after a few hours and get holds hair in place.</li>
            <li> Hands down a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s so much less damaging</li>
            <li> I do leave it on a little longer than the recommended 1 minute.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no greasy after feelings p and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy like some moisture treatments.</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in everyday.</li>
            <li> The scent stays for a few days and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the amount of split ends</li>
            <li> The Moisure Replenish Treatment really works in just a minute which shocked me-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past, so I had no reason to think this would disappoint.</li>
            <li> hard to find.</li>
            <li> Tried other expensive products and this one is the winner.</li>
            <li> I would estimate I leave it on approximately 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used Pureology (which is so expensive) because my hair was in horrible condition from heat damage and bleach.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product for years, but then I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  When I found it on Amazon, I bought 8 of them. It&#x27;s the same container, but with a different color cap.  It&#x27;s NOT the same.  Much more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t like it, but I&#x27;ll use it.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference, but it smells nice. It&#x27;s probably because I didn&#x27;t use it every day</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this product based on the reviews. At least it didn&#x27;t cost much. It was okay for the money.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  It has saved my frizzy hair from a load of additional damage by taming it down finally!  It leaves my hair feeling sleek and smooth, and can be used in place of standard conditioner in a time crunch.  The product does work best after a traditional wash+conditioning cycle, however.</li>
            <li> Over the last few months, my  normally oily hair has become very dry, damaged, and brittle. So I&#x27;ve been trying to find a deep conditioner that will fix it. The first one I tried was the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle. It worked great for about 2 weeks, then quit working. The next one I tried was the L&#x27;oreal Damage Erasing Balm. I loved what it did for my hair, but had to quit using it because I was majorly allergic to it.  I actually wanted to purchase this instead of the Damage Erasing Balm, but both Target and Ulta (the two stores I had easiest access to at the time) were both out of stock.  I ended up purchasing at Ulta about 2 weeks ago. I don&#x27;t remember what I paid for it, but I think it was around 7.99 I&#x27;ve always been very happy with the Garnier products (shampoo and BB cream) I&#x27;ve used in the past, so I had no reason to think this would disappoint. And it definitely did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging. You get a good amount of product (8 oz) for the price. It comes in a squeeze bottle with a fliptop cap. This makes it really easy to use in the shower. It also smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product alot. I can definitely see and feel a major difference in my hair since I&#x27;ve started using it. My hair has become much softer and looks healthier. I do leave it on a little longer than the recommended 1 minute. I leave it on the amount of time it takes to use my body wash and facial cleanser. I would estimate I leave it on approximately 3 minutes. It rinses out very easily and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or weighed down. The longer I use it, the better my hair gets. I highly recommend this product and will definitely repurchase when I run out. It&#x27;s a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> smells really good and works well</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner prior to using this.  But my hair felt AMAZING!  It was silky, soft, manageable and I was able to go two full days without having to shampoo/condition again (I probably could have went a third but that just didn&#x27;t feel right).  This product is worth every penny considering my strange hair - thick with a fine texture, curly in the back and straight in the front (all natural).  Most hair systems make me feel like I am just wasting time and money, this one actually helps me achieve what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this treatment! The whole hydra recharge system is amazing :) It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky without weighing it down (making it oily), which is SO hard to find!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I was so impressed by the 1-Minute Moisture-Plenish treatment, and the rest of the Hydra Recharge system, that I am trashing my old hair products and switching to Garnier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system left my hair so soft and minimized the visibility of damage. My hair was so weightless and free afterward, I felt like I got a hair cut!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It left my hair feeling smooth and sleek it smelled great too and my hair felt very moisturized and light. Paired with the other products left me with great results! I would totally recommend this product even on its own. It is amazing and it smells great too!! Give this a try if you too have either dry, brittle and chemically damaged hair!</li>
            <li> Who doesent want soft, sleek hair that smells good and looks great?  I know with this product I noticed a difference after one use, but now that I have been using it for a week its like my hair has gone through a total transformation!  I blow dry and straighten my hair daily so it just drinks up moisture and Hydra Recharge is there to quench its thrist.  My hair looks healthier than it ever has before!</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING PRODUCT. i LOVE LOVE LOVE this and i can not find it in stores anymore, my hair is VERY greasy on a normal basis and wash my hair every night but since starting this it will last about 3 days.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for overworked hair!  Love it.</li>
            <li> best stuff ever and i have tried from pantene to kerastase. hard to find. my hair is fine and the 3 minute treatment was to heavy. this was just right. hope they do not stop making it.</li>
            <li> Why Garnier discontinued this product is beyond me, it actually works, it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and rinses clean leaving hair shiny.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for dry winter hair it is also great for dry heels but be sure to stand on a towel in the shower it is slippery.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Leaves your hair feeling extra moisturized and silky! There&#x27;s no greasy after feelings p and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy like some moisture treatments. Smells amazing as well! Hands down a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I have used Pureology (which is so expensive) because my hair was in horrible condition from heat damage and bleach. I was too scared to leave that product once my hair got better. After using Garnier, I realize that I have been wasting my money. It smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling silky without feeling weighed down. I can&#x27;t say enough about how it&#x27;s helped my hair. It&#x27;s softer than it was before and when I straighten it- it shines like it hasn&#x27;t in a long time. The Moisure Replenish Treatment really works in just a minute which shocked me- they always have to sit forever! My fingers went right through my hair after a minute which was amazing to untangle my hair in the shower. I know that&#x27;s so much less damaging so that thrilled me as well. The regular conditioner was nice- nothing out of the ordinary but this treatment has me sold. One unexpected surprise- the volume! oh my gosh, my hair hasn&#x27;t had this much volume in forEVER! I feel like it makes my hair cut look full of life as well. I am sold on this product!</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in everyday. I does dry after a few hours and get holds hair in place. Doesn&#x27;t flake at all.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeee this product. It makes my hair so smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it with any shampoo and conditioner treatment. It calms my winter frizz, I don&#x27;t need to use any products after my hair is dry. This is a problem I have had forever &amp; never found the solution, this is it! (and now I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore!!)</li>
            <li> Love using this product. Does make my hair look and feel softer. And the smell is great!</li>
            <li> If you are a not-so-natural blond this product is a must.  I&#x27;ve been using it instead of conditioner after each wash for years and have fooled many with how healthy my hair looks.  Tried other expensive products and this one is the winner.</li>
            <li> I had my eye on this conditioner for a while.  I love the way Garnier&#x27;s products smell.  I was using Aussie conditioner for a while, and when I finally ran out, I bought this.  I immediately noticed a difference.  The ends of my hair are much dryer than when I was using Aussie.  My only positive is that I like the smell.  I probably wont keep using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have thick, wavy, normal hair about shoulder length.</li>
            <li> ALL OF THE FRUCTIS HAIR PRODUCTS ARE WONDERFUL</li>
            <li> Product strips hair of all gunk, conditioners etc.  Did not condition - left my hair drier than when I started.  There are other Garnier Fructis products that are much better.</li>
            <li> I got my hydra recharge along with the shampoo and condition from buzzagent for free to try out. I really love the way this product smells, I know it has pictures of a bunch of tropical fruits on it but it smells like an apple field to me. Since using this I have seen a massive difference in how my hair feels; it&#x27;s silky, strong, and non-frizzy. The scent stays for a few days and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the amount of split ends I have even! I love this whole line and will be purchasing when mine is gone :)</li>
