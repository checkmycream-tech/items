            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the many products that claim to freshen breath and whiten teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I found Targon here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I to love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try one more time.</li>
            <li>I like the taste, and it did a wonderful job helping keep my teeth white.  </li>
            <li>After I stopped smoking, I still love my Coffee, and Targon worked keeping the coffee stains away as well.    </li>
            <li>I really love this product...</li>
            <li>I loved this product when it first came out</li>
            <li>As long as Amazon has this mouthwash available I will continue to purchase this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>We are so glad that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this pleasant tasting mouthwash which is proven to prevent smoking stains.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled to see it up here recently, even though they have sold out again, but not before I was able to get some!</li>
            <li>Transaction went smoothly and would order again.</li>
            <li>Everything went smooth as could be with ordering this item off amazon.com and it being delivered timely and in tact.</li>
            <li>Great product for getting stains caused by coffee, red wine, etc.</li>
            <li>The orders that were cancelled were during a free shipping promotion.</li>
            <li>Now to re-order I have to pay the full shipping costs.</li>
            <li>FRESH AND CLEAN</li>
            <li>Thanks   Amazon for carrying Targon!!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH AMAZON your a life saver!!</li>
            <li>Amazon has been my best source for finding this product since local stores are limited in carrying this product.</li>
            <li>It really helps make your teeth feel smooth and</li>
            <li>but, it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>With Targon, my smile doesn&#x27;t give away my habits.</li>
            <li>:B001G7POTI Targon Smokers&#x27; Mouthwash, Fresh Mint, 24-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li>This stuff works exactly as advertised with a fresh taste and smell.</li>
            <li>Great product have used for along time and is hard to find until Amazon.com had it.</li>
            <li>since i can not find this targon mouthwash in any local stores any more, i have been ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It was also my first time ordering thru Amazon, and I defintely recommend you shop thru Amazon for this mouthwash &amp; anything esle; since I cannot find it out in the market.</li>
            <li>Targone Smokers Mouthwash really works!</li>
            <li>It costs a bit more than regular mouthwash</li>
            <li>I feel that I can&#x27;t be the only one that really misses having access to such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Targon since it first hit the market.</li>
            <li>This mouth wash really works.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>One thing I really like about Amazon.com is finding items you can&#x27;t find anywhere else.</li>
            <li>i really appreciate the price and speed with which i get my items.</li>
            <li>It really does perform as promised.  </li>
            <li>These 2 habits combined create real stain problems for my teeth.</li>
            <li>And indeed, it does this very well.</li>
            <li>If there is anyone out there that knows where I can purchase some Targon, it would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>But in my personal experience, it does seem to be an effective, overall, teeth whitening or cleansing</li>
            <li>You will see great results in a week and this mouthwash is not harsh at all-(like Rembrandt Whitening is harsh, did not like it at all!!)</li>
            <li>though about a dentist and getting my teeth whitened, but at $500.00 for one session, and within little time with my continued smoking, my teeth would return to the bright yellow</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s the only thing that I&#x27;ve found that actually works in removing cigarette tar from your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Better than any teeth whitening mouthwash and never made my teeth sensitive like other brands.</li>
            <li>Why is it most of the time when I finally find something, anything that works, it&#x27;s gone before long?</li>
            <li>I am a smoker and Targon helps keep my teeth white and my mouth fresh..</li>
            <li>Or did the market for it just disappear... or switch over to other, more general, teeth whitening products?  </li>
            <li>I discovered this product a number of years ago and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Great at removing other stains, such as coffee, red wine, etc., to keep teeth white.  </li>
            <li>Labeled as smokers mouthwash but works on all the above much better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li>The taste is refreshing and seems to last longer than other brands.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But certainly for smokers, this is an essential product if you are concerned about the appearance of your teeth.</li>
            <li>Husband is smoker and this is the only mouthwash he wants to use.</li>
            <li>Also, my New-Targon Mouthwash packages was completely sealed.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty strong and a friend of mine waters it down to about half strength.</li>
            <li>With my first order I had no problem receiving the mouthwash, but on the second order it was a different story.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I knew why it&#x27;s barely attainable anymore</li>
            <li>My dentist has told me they don&#x27;t even make a crown as white as my natural teeth.</li>
            <li>I believe the only negative aspect of this product is that it no longer appears to be available at any retail outlet.</li>
            <li>Probably because the product title includes the word \\&quot;smokers\\&quot; which is definitely off-putting to the socially correct.  </li>
            <li>I tried some of the new whitening mouthwashes, event though they didn&#x27;t have the same active ingredient in the same concentration.</li>

            <li> Is what is now available only online merely the last of remaining unsold inventory?  </li>
            <li> and I drink tea all day long.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get the same effect from other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I rushed to order it, only to get a message a few days later that the package had been damaged and my money was being refunded.</li>
            <li> I am having trouble finding this product in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> And it does seem to be one of the few, or perhaps only, remaining product targeted specifically for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I Googled my butt off but was not able to find anything definitive about the fate or future of this</li>
            <li> I also believe that it helps for other discoloration due to drinking coffee, tea and caramel colored soda.</li>
            <li> AND, it leaves your mouth feeling really clean and eliminates bad breath.</li>
            <li> It works for smokers, heavy coffee drinkers, and people who like ginger or onions or garlic in their food....</li>
            <li> This actually works, I got mad when they stopped selling it at wal-mart and now I have it on subscription at Amazon; I still get complements with how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s, and with age usually comes crowns.</li>
            <li> The dark stains I once had behind my lower front teeth have not been there since I began using Targon.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in drugstores... reverted to Internet ...</li>
            <li> if not as a smoker&#x27;s product...at least for tea or coffee drinkers.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has tough breath or teeth-whitening issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker and had a lot of tar buildup behind my lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> I hate that the local stores stopped carrying this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found out this product has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Company is no longer making it \\&quot;Marketing department thinks it does not sell well\\&quot; Very sorry to see it go.</li>
            <li> The performed so badly</li>
            <li> clean!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad the manufacturer discontinued the product.  </li>
            <li> was extremely disappointed when they removed it from all the stores.  </li>
            <li> Just wish I could find a way to order it again :(</li>
            <li> I received no notice and was very unhappy when I didn&#x27;t get</li>

This product effectively removed it within a week.  I use it daily as maintenance to avoid buildup.  Great at removing other stains, such as coffee, red wine, etc., to keep teeth white.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Targon for a number of years but it disappeared from the store shelves and I was bummed.  Nothing works to whiten tar stained and coffee/tea stains like this stuff. I was so happy to find the product on Amazon.  Thanks   Amazon for carrying Targon!!</li>
            <li> One thing I really like about Amazon.com is finding items you can&#x27;t find anywhere else. Also, buying in volume like this takes all the pressure off from looking and ordering every month. Transaction went smoothly and would order again.</li>
            <li> Great product have used for along time and is hard to find until Amazon.com had it. thank you Amazon for having it on line.</li>
            <li> It is not often that what is advertised, is actually what you receive. Targon actually works as advertised.  I am a veteran cigar smoker, and I smoke a minimum of six cigars per day, seven days a week.  Recently a friend tells me my teeth are getting yellow.  I though about a dentist and getting my teeth whitened, but at $500.00 for one session, and within little time with my continued smoking, my teeth would return to the bright yellow they were prior to the treatment.  So I ran across your product and figured what did I have to lose?  With the first use, I saw improvement, inside of a week my teeth looked great.  I saved hundreds of dollars, and found an inexpensive way to keep my teeth white.  All I can say is thank you Targon, for a job well done!</li>
            <li> since i can not find this targon mouthwash in any local stores any more, i have been ordering from Amazon. i really appreciate the price and speed with which i get my items. i will continue to order. thank you. Lynda sMITH</li>
            <li> I do smoke, and people don&#x27;t seem to see that fact in my teeth.  I like the taste/feeling from it.  I just don&#x27;t get the same effect from other mouthwashes.  Really glad I&#x27;m still able to get this.  All stores in the area quite carrying it.  I ordered it,, and despite an estimated delivery time of 2 weeks(went with the cheapest shipping option),,,, got it in a week!!!  Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome!! #1 mouthwash that removes coffee and smokers tabocco tar stains, this mouthwash works miracles.  I defintely recommended this product to non-smokers as well!!; There is no mouthwash that replaces Targon Smokers&#x27; Mouthwash..You will see great results in a week and this mouthwash is not harsh at all-(like Rembrandt Whitening is harsh, did not like it at all!!) It was also my first time ordering thru Amazon, and I defintely recommend you shop thru Amazon for this mouthwash &amp; anything esle; since I cannot find it out in the market. As long as Amazon has this mouthwash available I will continue to purchase this wonderful product.  Also, my New-Targon Mouthwash packages was completely sealed.  THANK YOU SO MUCH AMAZON your a life saver!!</li>
            <li> Targone Smokers Mouthwash really works! It costs a bit more than regular mouthwash but, it is well worth the price. Have used it from the day it hit Wal-Mart shelves and very happy with the results after using it. It does not burn my mouth nor leave \\&quot;bits\\&quot; of white congealed product in my mouth as some \\&quot;whitening mouthwashes\\&quot; do. AND, it leaves your mouth feeling really clean and eliminates bad breath. You can leave home confident knowing that close contact with people wont be a turn off because of offensive breath. Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> This actually works, I got mad when they stopped selling it at wal-mart and now I have it on subscription at Amazon; I still get complements with how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Everything went smooth as could be with ordering this item off amazon.com and it being delivered timely and in tact. We can&#x27;t buy this item any more in the stores in our area, so it&#x27;s good that we can still order it online. And, we didn&#x27;t even have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by others but is elusive at retail stores.  It has proven exceptional in removing caffeine and tea stains.  It really does perform as promised.  We are so glad that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff works exactly as advertised with a fresh taste and smell. The larger pack takes care of our need for about a year. It is pretty strong and a friend of mine waters it down to about half strength.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST TASTING MOUTHWASH ON THE MARKET.  I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY QUIT MAKING IT.  IF THE NAME IS A PROBLEM, CHANGE THE NAME.  PLEASE BRING THE PRODUCT BACK.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE PLEASE call GlaxoSmithKilne @ 1-866-640-1018. Voice your opinion. Maybe if they recieve thousands of complaints they will start making it again. This WAS the best mouthwash with the best taste you could find. If anyone knows of a good tasting mouthwash let me know. Cuz when my last 2 bottles of Targon is gone I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m gonna do.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when it first came out then it just disapeared from the shelves.  Now I have a subscrition on amazon and I love it.  People began noticing the difference on day three.  I smoke a pack a day and I drink tea all day long.  With Targon, my smile doesn&#x27;t give away my habits.</li>
            <li> I just dont get it, targon works great and people have been using it for years with no downside, so why would they stop making a product this good?</li>
            <li> Unlike the many products that claim to freshen breath and whiten teeth - Targon actually works.  It works for smokers, heavy coffee drinkers, and people who like ginger or onions or garlic in their food.... those of us who really need a \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; breath-freshening/tooth-stain fighting mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, Targon seems to have disappeared from the retail outlets in my area.  Probably because the product title includes the word \\&quot;smokers\\&quot; which is definitely off-putting to the socially correct.  I used to smoke, that&#x27;s how I learned about Targon... but I still use Targon post-smoking.  I recommend it to anyone who has tough breath or teeth-whitening issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I found Targon here on Amazon.  I order a year&#x27;s supply at a time, the shipping was prompt, the product arrived intact.</li>
            <li> I to love this product. Company is no longer making it \\&quot;Marketing department thinks it does not sell well\\&quot; Very sorry to see it go.</li>
            <li> Been using Taragon for YEARS .... even when I quit smoking .... I still drink coffee... This mouthwash keeps your pearly whites.. Pearly white ... Hard to find in drugstores... reverted to Internet ... much better prices on line .. make it VERY WELL WORTH IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT I&#x27;VE FOUND THAT ACTUALLY REMOVES STAINS AND TARTER FROM TEETH.  IT HAS ACTUALLY CUT MY TIME FOR TEETH CLEANING IN THE DENTIST OFFICE.  THIS IS NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO SMOKE BECAUSE I&#x27;M NOT A SMOKER AND FOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT USE ANYTHING WITH PEROXIDE THIS IS DEFINITELY THE SOLUTION.  LEAVES THE MOUTH FRESH AND CLEAN ALSO.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and all of a sudden you cannot find it anywhere or any information as to why. I was so thrilled to see it up here recently, even though they have sold out again, but not before I was able to get some! I wish I knew why it&#x27;s barely attainable anymore......results are awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s the only thing that I&#x27;ve found that actually works in removing cigarette tar from your teeth.  It has a really nice taste which makes it easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely disappointed when they removed it from all the stores.  I did find it on Amazon.  With my first order I had no problem receiving the mouthwash, but on the second order it was a different story.&lt;br /&gt;Something happened with the shipment, and it was sent back to the distributor.  I received no notice and was very unhappy when I didn&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would put it back in the stores.  I feel that I can&#x27;t be the only one that really misses having access to such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and I look forward to receiving your reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diane H. Voorhis&lt;br /&gt;2503 Harmony Road&lt;br /&gt;Rock Hill, SC  29730&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G7POTI Targon Smokers&#x27; Mouthwash, Fresh Mint, 24-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> Great product for getting stains caused by coffee, red wine, etc. off your teeth.  Labeled as smokers mouthwash but works on all the above much better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I smoke a pack a day and I also drink a lot of coffee. These 2 habits combined create real stain problems for my teeth. I have used this mouthwash for about 6 weeks now and am very pleased. One thing I would alert to however is that this mouthwash is designed for use BEFORE you brush, not after.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years. I&#x27;ve found nothing else like it on the market. When my local stores stopped carrying it I tried some of the new whitening mouthwashes, event though they didn&#x27;t have the same active ingredient in the same concentration. The performed so badly I had to schedule an extra cleaning with my dentist! When I found a case on Amazon I rushed to order it, only to get a message a few days later that the package had been damaged and my money was being refunded. I immediately re-ordered it, only to have my money again refunded without comment. I&#x27;m going to try one more time. I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s been discontinued by the manufacturer. Stay tuned!  Later:  Now I get it! The orders that were cancelled were during a free shipping promotion. Now to re-order I have to pay the full shipping costs.</li>
            <li> This product does as advertised, works and tastes great. The dentist thought I had quit smoking. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I believe the only negative aspect of this product is that it no longer appears to be available at any retail outlet. And that, of course, makes one wonder why. Was the product pulled from shelves for some reason? Or did the market for it just disappear... or switch over to other, more general, teeth whitening products?  I Googled my butt off but was not able to find anything definitive about the fate or future of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder... and worry... if the product is even still being produced. Is what is now available only online merely the last of remaining unsold inventory?  If so, then those of us who have relied on this product should probably think about stocking up. Purchasing in quantity (e.g.. the 6 pack), which obviously saves money, may also be the only means of ensuring a future personal supply of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Targon only claims to remove tooth stains and discoloring caused by smoking. And indeed, it does this very well. I also believe that it helps for other discoloration due to drinking coffee, tea and caramel colored soda. I can&#x27;t swear to this... and indeed it may not. But in my personal experience, it does seem to be an effective, overall, teeth whitening or cleansing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But certainly for smokers, this is an essential product if you are concerned about the appearance of your teeth. It does do what it advertises that it will do. And it does seem to be one of the few, or perhaps only, remaining product targeted specifically for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over 10 years with great success, even though I&#x27;m a non-smoker. Now I find it&#x27;s discontinued. So now what? Why is it most of the time when I finally find something, anything that works, it&#x27;s gone before long? Am I the only person on the planet who uses this product???</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Better than any teeth whitening mouthwash and never made my teeth sensitive like other brands. Just wish I could find a way to order it again :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Targon since it first hit the market. When it disappeared from retailer&#x27;s shelves, I panicked. Then, I found it on Amazon! This stuff is the BEST mouthwash out there for anyone who smokes. The dark stains I once had behind my lower front teeth have not been there since I began using Targon. My dentist still can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m a smoker. I&#x27;m in my 50s, and with age usually comes crowns. My dentist has told me they don&#x27;t even make a crown as white as my natural teeth. Thank you, Targon!! I highly recommend this pleasant tasting mouthwash which is proven to prevent smoking stains.</li>
            <li> I used to smoke, and that is when I started using Targon.  I like the taste, and it did a wonderful job helping keep my teeth white.  After I stopped smoking, I still love my Coffee, and Targon worked keeping the coffee stains away as well.    I hate that the local stores stopped carrying this product.  but happy that Amazon still sells it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it works great</li>
            <li> my wife could not understsnd why she couldn\\&quot;t buy it anymore after years of use. i am her hero now.</li>
            <li> Not finding this item in stores anymore, thought I&#x27;d give Amazon a shot. The order was promptly processed and was received in record time. Targon is a wonderful product for smokers.</li>
            <li> I am a smoker and Targon helps keep my teeth white and my mouth fresh..I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> If there is anyone out there that knows where I can purchase some Targon, it would be greatly appreciated. HELP! I love this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> Great mouth wash for smokers and nonsmokers.  The taste is refreshing and seems to last longer than other brands.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found out this product has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and it is without a doubt the BEST product for smokers!  Even my dentist and hygenist asked about it because my teeth and gums have never been in better shape!  Get it while you can, IF you can even get it!</li>
            <li> I really love this product...It not only works for smokers...but for tea drinkers.  It really helps make your teeth feel smooth and clean!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad the manufacturer discontinued the product.  I wish they would bring it back...if not as a smoker&#x27;s product...at least for tea or coffee drinkers.  Helps remove build up on teeth and freshens breath.</li>
