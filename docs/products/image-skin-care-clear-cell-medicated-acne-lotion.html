            <li>love that I can get it online b/c</li>

            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>i love this.</li>
            <li>Clear application makes it ideal to put under make up and wear all day.  </li>
            <li>it feels better.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t break out everywhere just mostly in my T zone and along the chin line.</li>
            <li>I put a dab of this on it 2 or more times a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Because you don&#x27;t know if its working or it was just better time of the month.</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>Mostly just around the chin and on my nose.  </li>
            <li>but I started using it right before my wedding and loved it</li>
            <li>It is really strong</li>
            <li>My skin is now glowing and clear, it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>My struggles have always been finding a fine balance between hair (implementing oil) and skin (eliminating oil).  </li>
            <li>HUGE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>Love their whole line!</li>
            <li>This helped clean up my skin significantly.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night to help keep my pores clean and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>It does dry out your skin so have some great moisturizer to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest using a good moisturizer in the day and this at night if you want to use it daily.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed and at such a good price.</li>
            <li>But Image Skin Care really has gentle and totally effective salicylic products.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!!</li>
            <li>The entire image skincare line is amazing.</li>
            <li>Image skin care has amazing products this is no different!</li>
            <li>It works for me and uses more natural ingredients as opposed to Proactiv that uses chemicals.</li>
            <li>Made my skin more sensitive at the areas of application, but acne are still there.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>, well worth your $$.</li>
            <li>I also use the Image Skincare Clear Cell Salicylic Gel Cleanser and just love it.  </li>
            <li>lotion, it has a distinct smell though, but transformed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cooling effect.</li>
            <li>Shipped right away.</li>
            <li>Within a day of a new breakout, it has diminished in size tremendously!</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast and was just as described</li>
            <li>Nothing else really has worked like this!</li>
            <li>Can sting at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that works for me! :-)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Will be coming back to buy more</li>
            <li>sure to use a white wash cloth, towel, pillowcase, and anything else.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>WILL LAST 3 MONTHS, MAYBE MORE.</li>
            <li>just one little dot and problem areas are gone within 2 days but dramatically better after first use (especially those under the skin pressure kind).</li>
            <li>This lotion really helps my break outs, and lightens my acne scars</li>
            <li>This stuff did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Not what I expect from Image, whose products are usually so gentle.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and item as described</li>
            <li>This product really works for acne.  </li>
            <li>really dries up acne.</li>
            <li>, it really dries them out</li>
            <li>very upset.</li>
            <li>If I use it too much it will start drying out my skin</li>
            <li>But this stuff really helps bring them to the surface</li>
            <li>This lotion really works!&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>/&gt;BRAND NEW, SEALED PACKAGES!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have not broken out from this at all.</li>
            <li>but I apply the lotion and it pretty much starts dissapearing the next day</li>
            <li>This lotion is strong enough to keep my skin clear of blemishes yet gentle enough</li>
            <li>It does sting a little when first applied, but it goes away fast and is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Instead, I received the new and improved version of the product.</li>
            <li>The new and improved is not so improved.</li>
            <li>Plus, it uses very natural ingredients, so you always know what you are putting on your face.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and breakout prone skin and</li>
            <li>During my pregnancy I started to break out more than usual</li>
            <li>I am so glad it wasn&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
            <li>you can only buy this in certain dr offices (you dont need a prescription to buy it)&lt;br /&gt;ALL of the Image Skin Care products</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any Clear Cell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helped clear it up.</li>
            <li>I started using this with the Clear Cell Salicylic Gel Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a looooonnnng time acne struggler until I was introduced to the Clear Cell Line.  </li>
            <li>Have been trying for years to find something to clear up the acne.</li>
            <li>I also purchased Image Skincare Clear Cell Medicated Acne Masque.</li>
            <li>(just bought my second bottle--it doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>The benzoyl peroxide will completely remove color out of your clothing, towels, and sheets.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think I wanted to use something that can possibly dry me out but in order to get rid of the acne you need ingredients that do just that!</li>
            <li>I went to the spa to get a facial and the ethitician highly recommended this for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to any person any age who has even the occasional outbreak.</li>
            <li>I have try proactive, murad, and many other otc product hands down</li>
            <li>I continued to use it everynight for the rest of the week, but it really started to dry my face</li>
            <li>This masque is super heavy duty and works well.</li>
            <li>I recently changed my facial routine and got rid of all harsh chemical, paraben filled products.</li>
            <li>I am a 36 year old African American female with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I played around with it and found that if I mainly use it as needed and only on the spots where I&#x27;m having issues then I don&#x27;t dry out and peel.</li>
            <li>It does burn a little at first after application</li>
            <li>Contains benzoyl peroxide which is super hard on my skin.</li>
            <li>The normal stuff usually reddens my face some due to the medicine in it after I first put on, but this one from Amazon did not.</li>
            <li>My breakouts are really toning down!</li>

            <li> And I would recommend purchasing the other image skin care clear cell medicated acne products as well.</li>
            <li> i only use it at night on my whole face, and it gets rid of all my acne and small pimples coming out  </li>
            <li> It does cause my skin to flush red for a minute or two but nothing that last long.</li>
            <li> Amount of the acne medication and the amount necessary for each application also makes the product long lasting; I purchase a replacement bottle every 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> Acne seem to calm down almost immediately and usually gone by the next day!  </li>
            <li> I USE IN COMBO WITH THE Image Skin Care Clear Cell Salicylic Gel Cleanser 6 oz , AND ORMEDICS SERUM, AND THEY ARE HALF THE PRICE</li>
            <li> It tends to dry out your face a bit so have an extra moisturizer on hand.</li>
            <li> My face became very red and irritated, then dry and swollen.</li>
            <li> As soon as I feel a blemish, I use some of the lotion and the blemish doesn&#x27;t get any worse, stops hurting and goes away rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> My nose has larger pores and my chin breaks out due to pre-menapausal problems.</li>
            <li> This lotion along with the skin cleanser is the only product(s) I have found that work on my extremely picky skin!</li>
            <li> And, you just need to use a little of the lotion, the bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This acne lotion made my skin very dry, and every time I would put it on, it would make my skin itchy.</li>
            <li> Only used a little and it looks like I have a sunburn.beware.</li>
            <li> so I can pop them if I need to without tearing my skin bad and causing more issues.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I just apply a small amount on my skin and the following day is gone!!!!!</li>
            <li> so therefore I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I have thrown away ALL my other products from Loreal to Origins to Merle Nermon etc</li>
            <li> I received my Image product expecting it to be the same product I have used for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews in that you have to give the product time to work.  </li>
            <li> I would use it everyday if it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out -</li>
            <li> This one from Amazon is in a different looking bottle than any previous bottle Ive purchased from the spa, and my face has completely broken out in big cystic acne in the days I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not full of Parabens or other carcinogens.</li>
            <li> Calms down your skin irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they always turn into black spots.</li>
            <li> Works very well for those ugly monsters that pop up out of the blue.</li>
            <li> I have to see little longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely embarrassed what&#x27;s happened with my face since I used this fake bottle.</li>
            <li> that it does not become dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a red, broken out, swollen face for 3 days now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working little but for the price, not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I got 2 for what I have in the past paid for 1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on just a small portion of my face.  </li>
            <li> I normally get zits that stay hard and painful but never surface.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a place to buy this.</li>
            <li> I am a Licensed Esthetician in my late 20s.  </li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t reacted negatively with me at all.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product and had a terrible reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30s</li>
            <li> This lotion can be a real life saver when it comes to those annoying breakouts from time to time.  </li>
            <li> I stand behind this product because it works for me.  </li>
            <li> Even the dermatologist made it worse.</li>
            <li> I get breakouts randomly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with Image Skin Care now, their products have truly transformed my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Image Clearcell for over 3 years and it always worked UNTIL I bought this one from Amazon, this one has got to be a FAKE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I was worried to try salicylic again after I had a terrible reaction to Murad&#x27;s salicylic cleanser, which left me with awful dermatitis that took months to heal.  </li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and my cheeks have gotten worst!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If I start to get a nasty one this stops it in it&#x27;s tracks.</li>
            <li> So after trying almost everything under the sun except for prescription meds....which I refuse to do....because they are horrible for your health.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lotion really helps my break outs, and lightens my acne scars</li>
            <li> Great for adolescent condition</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast and was just as described</li>
            <li> My breakouts are really toning down! I may get one here or there but I apply the lotion and it pretty much starts dissapearing the next day</li>
            <li> I have had for over 10 years to the point where I was going to have to go on accutane. Nothing else really has worked like this!</li>
            <li> Great product. Can sting at first. Used every morning and night does help. It&#x27;s the only thing that works for me! :-)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. She loves it! Love their whole line!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I went to an esthetician and got the image signature facial 3 days ago. I was pleased and I have been following the take home products religiously and I have applied this acne lotion on problem spots only 1-2 times daily as directed. Today I have 3 larger than pencil eraser burns on my face that are peeling and oozing. It looks like craters on my face! This medicine has ruined my skin and I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> Its a good product I&#x27;ve bought it from spas before. Its helpful with moderate-sever acne. The price was great I got 2 for what I have in the past paid for 1.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who is suffering from acne. It works for me and uses more natural ingredients as opposed to Proactiv that uses chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love this acne lotion.  I have purchased it before as I sometime will break out around my chin area.  As soon as I feel a blemish, I use some of the lotion and the blemish doesn&#x27;t get any worse, stops hurting and goes away rather quickly.  This lotion can be a real life saver when it comes to those annoying breakouts from time to time.  And, you just need to use a little of the lotion, the bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I went to the spa to get a facial and the ethitician highly recommended this for me. My cheeks are problematic. I get breakouts randomly and they always turn into black spots. Well, I&#x27;ve been using this almost a month now and my cheeks have gotten worst!!!!!! This stuff did absolutely nothing. I am so glad it wasn&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
            <li> The entire image skincare line is amazing. I have very sensitive skin and have not broken out from this at all. I use it as a spot treatment when I breakout and it heals overnight. It does sting a little when first applied, but it goes away fast and is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This has not worked for me and I&#x27;m not fond of the smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Works very well for those ugly monsters that pop up out of the blue. If I start to get a nasty one this stops it in it&#x27;s tracks. Brush washing my face has helped as well.</li>
            <li> I luv this, the minute u start to feel a bump I just apply a small amount on my skin and the following day is gone!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin</li>
            <li> This lotion along with the skin cleanser is the only product(s) I have found that work on my extremely picky skin!</li>
            <li> Maybe this cream helped out someone, but didn&#x27;t help me at all. Made my skin more sensitive at the areas of application, but acne are still there. I will be trying another products</li>
            <li> It actually works! And I would recommend purchasing the other image skin care clear cell medicated acne products as well.</li>
            <li> Contains benzoyl peroxide which is super hard on my skin. Not what I expect from Image, whose products are usually so gentle.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and I have never written a review before but this stuff cleared up my skin. I&#x27;m 39 and have cystic acne. I went on Accutane 6 years ago but my zits and bumps came back. This works what a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver for my son. He left for the summer and we were sharing a bottle and he asked men if he could take it with he &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;. So I had to order another bottle. I about panicked when I got a break out and I don&#x27;t have any Clear Cell. I would recommend this to all my friends a 100%.</li>
            <li> I have bought I don&#x27;t know how many acne products for my kids, and I cannot believe how this stuff works! Not only that but it does not burn. I wish I would have known about this stuff when my oldest son was going through puberty. Honestly folks, I am not being paid to say this, I am just a Nebraska mom who has just found the cure for acne, without seeing the dermatologist, and paying a fortune every month for face washes,lotions, pills , etc  I am so happy about this.</li>
            <li> I really like it!! its a great product, perfect for blemish and clear your skin quick. I will buy it again. I do recomended this item.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I would use it everyday if it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out - so therefore I use it every other day. I&#x27;ve been breaking out on my back and started using this lotion on it and it&#x27;s helped clear it up.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and item as described</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Works wonders! Switched from Bio Elements. It does cause my skin to flush red for a minute or two but nothing that last long.</li>
            <li> Please try this if you have Acne. I have tried TONS of Acne products and this is the BEST. Pricey but worth it. It is also great for fine lines and keeping your skin smooth &amp; youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can get it online b/c you can only buy this in certain dr offices (you dont need a prescription to buy it)&lt;br /&gt;ALL of the Image Skin Care products are AMAZING. You wont be disappointed. I have thrown away ALL my other products from Loreal to Origins to Merle Nermon etc</li>
            <li> During my pregnancy I started to break out more than usual and I asked my doctor about using this product. He said that the chemicals wouldn&#x27;t affect my baby so I gave it a shot. In 2 days, my acne was cleared! I continued to use it everynight for the rest of the week, but it really started to dry my face so I took a break and the acne didn&#x27;t come back like it was before. I now use it as a spot treatment when I feel a blemish popping up and once a week on the entire face. I suggest using a good moisturizer in the day and this at night if you want to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I am a Licensed Esthetician in my late 20s.  I&#x27;ve suffered with breakouts and oily skin my entire life.  I was introduced to Image Skin Care by a friend of mine who is also a licensed esthetician.  I started using this with the Clear Cell Salicylic Gel Cleanser.  I was worried to try salicylic again after I had a terrible reaction to Murad&#x27;s salicylic cleanser, which left me with awful dermatitis that took months to heal.  But Image Skin Care really has gentle and totally effective salicylic products.  This hasn&#x27;t reacted negatively with me at all.  I use it morning and night to help keep my pores clean and exfoliated.  I&#x27;m obsessed with Image Skin Care now, their products have truly transformed my skin.  My skin is now glowing and clear, it&#x27;s amazing!  Nothing has worked so effectively like the Image Skin Care products.</li>
            <li> This is the only acne medicated lotion that has worked for me in my twenties! Within a day of a new breakout, it has diminished in size tremendously! Definitely worth every penny. Plus, it uses very natural ingredients, so you always know what you are putting on your face.</li>
            <li> I received my Image product expecting it to be the same product I have used for the past 10 years. Instead, I received the new and improved version of the product. The new and improved is not so improved. It does not help heal my acne as well.</li>
            <li> This product really works for acne.  My daughter has had issues for years and tried everything.  Nothing worked until she got this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a looooonnnng time acne struggler until I was introduced to the Clear Cell Line.  I absolutely love it! I am a 36 year old African American female with very sensitive skin.  My struggles have always been finding a fine balance between hair (implementing oil) and skin (eliminating oil).  I stand behind this product because it works for me.  I agree with the other reviews in that you have to give the product time to work.  Trial and Error...if you find that it dries you out then reduce to once a day BUT DON&#x27;T STOP USING IT. Keep in mind that it takes atleast 6 weeks for your skin to go through a full cycle!!</li>
            <li> Excellent face product.</li>
            <li> Works great.....stings going on....really dries up acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Image Clearcell for over 3 years and it always worked UNTIL I bought this one from Amazon, this one has got to be a FAKE. This one from Amazon is in a different looking bottle than any previous bottle Ive purchased from the spa, and my face has completely broken out in big cystic acne in the days I&#x27;ve been using it. The normal stuff usually reddens my face some due to the medicine in it after I first put on, but this one from Amazon did not. I&#x27;m completely embarrassed what&#x27;s happened with my face since I used this fake bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is the best! If you have acne prone skin you must try.  A little goes a long way, well worth your $$. Can burn and tingles, but it feels like its doing what it needs to do. Acne seem to calm down almost immediately and usually gone by the next day!  I have try proactive, murad, and many other otc product hands down this is the best!</li>
            <li> This lotion is strong enough to keep my skin clear of blemishes yet gentle enough that it does not become dried out.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit more expensive than I&#x27;d like but I started using it right before my wedding and loved it so I purchased more! It tends to dry out your face a bit so have an extra moisturizer on hand.</li>
            <li> Love it! Have been trying for years to find something to clear up the acne. Nothing worked. Even the dermatologist made it worse. A friend gave me a bit of this and it helped instantly. The next day a lot of the redness was gone.</li>
            <li> I love Image Skin Care.  I have very sensitive and breakout prone skin and this lotion is just enough to treat it without drying my skin out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months (just bought my second bottle--it doesn&#x27;t take much so it&#x27;s a good value for the money) and have been blemish free.</li>
            <li> I love this cream i only use it at night on my whole face, and it gets rid of all my acne and small pimples coming out  , it really dries them out i love this.</li>
            <li> So if you have oily skin that you just can&#x27;t control and you break out from all of that oil this is the stuff for you. At first I didn&#x27;t think I wanted to use something that can possibly dry me out but in order to get rid of the acne you need ingredients that do just that! I&#x27;ve used everything and this has been the only product to help control my ace! Def recommend to anybody who has ace prone skin!!</li>
            <li> Clear application makes it ideal to put under make up and wear all day.  Amount of the acne medication and the amount necessary for each application also makes the product long lasting; I purchase a replacement bottle every 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> Burned my skin. Only used a little and it looks like I have a sunburn.beware. very upset. I am putting ice on my face now</li>
            <li> No issues. Shipped right away. Item was as described. Hard to find a place to buy this. Will be coming back to buy more</li>
            <li> i have oily combination skin that is prone to breakouts and this product has kept my sking balanced and cleared.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing....just one little dot and problem areas are gone within 2 days but dramatically better after first use (especially those under the skin pressure kind). I&#x27;d highly recommend this to any person any age who has even the occasional outbreak. It lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The Clear line by Image is great! Just what I needed and at such a good price. This helped clean up my skin significantly. It does dry out your skin so have some great moisturizer to use.&lt;br /&gt;**Make sure to use a white wash cloth, towel, pillowcase, and anything else. The benzoyl peroxide will completely remove color out of your clothing, towels, and sheets.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product and had a terrible reaction. My face became very red and irritated, then dry and swollen. I would recommend trying a small amount on one spot to test it first. I&#x27;ve had a red, broken out, swollen face for 3 days now.</li>
            <li> This acne lotion made my skin very dry, and every time I would put it on, it would make my skin itchy. Will never use it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m in my late 30s and I still get hormonal acne. It&#x27;s very frustrating. I recently changed my facial routine and got rid of all harsh chemical, paraben filled products. I still broke out even though I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin it feels better. But I wanted to tackle the pimples, I don&#x27;t break out everywhere just mostly in my T zone and along the chin line. So after trying almost everything under the sun except for prescription meds....which I refuse to do....because they are horrible for your health. I read reviews on this product and decided to try it. This stuff is the ONLY stuff that has ever worked. And it&#x27;s not full of Parabens or other carcinogens. It is really strong so I can&#x27;t use it all over my face. If I use it too much it will start drying out my skin and I will peel. It does burn a little at first after application but it goes away. I played around with it and found that if I mainly use it as needed and only on the spots where I&#x27;m having issues then I don&#x27;t dry out and peel. So now I use it as a spot treatment....as soon as I feel a zit coming I put a dab of this on it 2 or more times a day. Within a couple of days my zit is gone. I also noticed this stuff helps bring the zit to the surface faster. I normally get zits that stay hard and painful but never surface. It&#x27;s took weeks to get rid of them. But this stuff really helps bring them to the surface so I can pop them if I need to without tearing my skin bad and causing more issues. This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. It&#x27;s working little but for the price, not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again. Because you don&#x27;t know if its working or it was just better time of the month. I have to see little longer.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Image skin care has amazing products this is no different!</li>
            <li> AWESOME! I&#x27;M HOOKED ON THIS LINE! IT HAS BEEN MY SAVING GRACE. NOTHING ELSE WORKS ON MY SKIN. I USE IN COMBO WITH THE Image Skin Care Clear Cell Salicylic Gel Cleanser 6 oz , AND ORMEDICS SERUM, AND THEY ARE HALF THE PRICE IT WOULD BE IF I BOUGHT THEM FROM THE PERSON WHO DOES MY SKIN CARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRAND NEW, SEALED PACKAGES! FAST SHIPPING! HUGE BOTTLE. WILL LAST 3 MONTHS, MAYBE MORE. GREAT DEAL!</li>
            <li> Works great on problem area skin, it has both salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide which are both great for breakouts. This is the only product at works on my breakouts. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on just a small portion of my face.  Mostly just around the chin and on my nose.  My nose has larger pores and my chin breaks out due to pre-menapausal problems. So I&#x27;m not using it on my entire face.  I also purchased Image Skincare Clear Cell Medicated Acne Masque. This masque is super heavy duty and works well. I also use the Image Skincare Clear Cell Salicylic Gel Cleanser and just love it.  So all of these in combination seem to work quite well for the very short time I&#x27;ve been using them. (about 1 week).</li>
            <li> This lotion really works!&lt;br /&gt;Great lotion, it has a distinct smell though, but transformed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cooling effect. Calms down your skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;(sorry-bad english...)</li>
