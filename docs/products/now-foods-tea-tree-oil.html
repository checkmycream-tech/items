            <li>and I love the menthol smell that eventually has a peppermint smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love useing this in face and body care products I make at my house</li>
            <li>I use it most often in my laundry.</li>
            <li>It is magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see a subscribe and safe option for this.</li>

            <li>Love the dropper-top, great 2 ounce size, super fast shipping with Prime!  </li>
            <li>This is useful for so many things!  </li>
            <li>It smells strong yet really good, good enough for aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is pure and smell good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very potent and seems to be much more pure than the oils I&#x27;ve bought in stores.  </li>
            <li>good price- fast shipment  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its so strong.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>quality seemed potent and fresh.</li>
            <li>Smell is gone by AM and socks are scent free after washing.</li>
            <li>The absolute best essential oil for a variety of uses!</li>
            <li>Strong smell, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot!</li>
            <li>I bought the oil originally to put it on my gums.  </li>
            <li>I mix tea tree oil with distilled water to disinfect and clean my apartment.</li>
            <li>My dental health is consistently excellent and I attribute part of that to my brushing protocol that includes a natural toothpaste (errr...gel only, not paste) plus the TTO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER swallow any of this stuff</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Well, I decided to research more natural cures and found TTO was a top one for toenail fungus.  </li>
            <li>Buy the TRUE oil not a cream not \\&quot;contains tree oil\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It takes out all the excess oil better than any high priced toner I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good keep acne under control, I use it morning and night with a mixture of facial wash.</li>
            <li>It is a very potent oil, so its necessary to dilute this oil before using.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>But, the most useful for me thus far has been using it as an anti-fungal on my feet!  </li>
            <li>This product does not smell fresh and in fact has a machine oil smell to it.</li>
            <li>It can be used for so many things and is safe enough to put directly on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is one of the most used essential oils I use, so it was handy and cost-effective to buy it in this larger 2 oz size.  </li>
            <li>Great price too for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li>Tea tree  is really an all in one SUPER oil.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>More like Trader Joe&#x27;s products with Tea Tree as an ingredient rather than the actual oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>But always spot test with any tea tree oil to make sure it won&#x27;t bother &#x27;your&#x27; individual skin.    </li>
            <li>I use exactly two drops of TTO on my electric toothbrush each time I brush.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using tee tree oil</li>
            <li>Helps relieves that first official  face combat.</li>
            <li>I love tea tree essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed all of the Now brand essential oils I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li>I then rub it into my skin across my whole face, right after washing.  </li>
            <li>This particular brand is economical.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for adding to other essential oils and in baths, or laundry.</li>
            <li>and it was 100% pure NOW Foods  Tea Tree Oil..</li>
            <li>but my husband always remarks about it (doesn&#x27;t like it as much).</li>
            <li>The 2 oz bottle has a built-in dropper which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>hmm this doesn&#x27;t do much to my face.. doesn&#x27;t seem to heal acne either..</li>
            <li>cuz I have used the body shop brand, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell but</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very relaxing</li>
            <li>Its very versatile, I use it to make home made wipes or on pimples.</li>
            <li>This is very medicinal smelling, but it is pharmaceutical grade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality 100% pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Another fast shipment of a quality product!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this with another product (from another seller) on Friday 4/3 and it came early on Monday 4/6.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>-- I exchanged it for a new bottle and that&#x27;s what the review below is based</li>
            <li>The now brand tea tree oil is a high quality oiI. I use this product in making my natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I purchased this about two weeks ago as an additive for my skin products, I suffer from adult acne, its already started clearing my skin!</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional bennifits as a bug blocker as some other reviewers have said but its deffanitly worth the price anyway!</li>
            <li>When starting a wash that I need a extra clean boost I add tea tree oil when I add the detergent.</li>
            <li>This oil has endless uses, but the one that surprised  me the most was that it actually kills germs like Lysol.</li>
            <li>It has really helped to get rid of itchy scalp but as it is very potent, my eyes get uncomfortable while shampooing.  </li>
            <li>Smell is kinda strong for a few minutes after application</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and less expensive than the PM I was buying.</li>
            <li>I love it, you only have to use a little.</li>
            <li>It helps clear and prevent breakouts and is way cheaper than going to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li>natural oils are like that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using this for nail fungus and so far it seems like it is helping.</li>
            <li>Purchased directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>i put directly on my and my kid&#x27;s skin when got bitten by insect and it didn&#x27;t irritate us.</li>
            <li>I used it for various cosmetic items I make myself, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I initially used it alone after washing my face and now use it daily mixed along with my home-made toner (green tea +rose water).</li>
            <li>Well, 2 months later my fungus that I&#x27;ve had since summer is completely gone!!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I go through the smaller bottle too fast and this lasts without a giant bottle sitting around.</li>
            <li>Bought for a toe nail that cracked vertically for no apparent reason, applications to date have seemed to make nail more flexible and less dry looking</li>
            <li>It is the only product of this type that  I find clearly lives up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it clear my rash</li>
            <li>I purchased it after looking for \\&quot;natural remedies\\&quot; for acne, and read several suggestions for tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>Last summer I developed this white toenail fungus that spread on all my toenails.</li>
            <li>The size of the product was worth the money, since I only need a few drops each use.</li>
            <li>It has made minor infections clear up overnight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it frequently on cloth diapers also because you&#x27;re limited on what you can use to disinfect them.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good for bad gums and cuts ect.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It takes out all the excess oil better than any high priced toner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good keep acne under control, I use it morning and night with a mixture of facial wash.</li>
            <li> It is a very potent oil, so its necessary to dilute this oil before using.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> But, the most useful for me thus far has been using it as an anti-fungal on my feet!  </li>
            <li> This product does not smell fresh and in fact has a machine oil smell to it.</li>
            <li> It can be used for so many things and is safe enough to put directly on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is one of the most used essential oils I use, so it was handy and cost-effective to buy it in this larger 2 oz size.  </li>
            <li> Great price too for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> Tea tree  is really an all in one SUPER oil.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> More like Trader Joe&#x27;s products with Tea Tree as an ingredient rather than the actual oil.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> But always spot test with any tea tree oil to make sure it won&#x27;t bother &#x27;your&#x27; individual skin.    </li>
            <li> I use exactly two drops of TTO on my electric toothbrush each time I brush.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using tee tree oil</li>
            <li> Helps relieves that first official  face combat.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed all of the Now brand essential oils I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> I then rub it into my skin across my whole face, right after washing.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand is economical.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for adding to other essential oils and in baths, or laundry.</li>
            <li> and it was 100% pure NOW Foods  Tea Tree Oil..</li>
            <li> but my husband always remarks about it (doesn&#x27;t like it as much).</li>
            <li> The 2 oz bottle has a built-in dropper which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> hmm this doesn&#x27;t do much to my face.. doesn&#x27;t seem to heal acne either..</li>
            <li> cuz I have used the body shop brand, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell but</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very relaxing</li>
            <li> Its very versatile, I use it to make home made wipes or on pimples.</li>
            <li> This is very medicinal smelling, but it is pharmaceutical grade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality 100% pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Another fast shipment of a quality product!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this with another product (from another seller) on Friday 4/3 and it came early on Monday 4/6.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> -- I exchanged it for a new bottle and that&#x27;s what the review below is based</li>
            <li> The now brand tea tree oil is a high quality oiI. I use this product in making my natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about two weeks ago as an additive for my skin products, I suffer from adult acne, its already started clearing my skin!</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional bennifits as a bug blocker as some other reviewers have said but its deffanitly worth the price anyway!</li>
            <li> When starting a wash that I need a extra clean boost I add tea tree oil when I add the detergent.</li>
            <li> This oil has endless uses, but the one that surprised  me the most was that it actually kills germs like Lysol.</li>
            <li> It has really helped to get rid of itchy scalp but as it is very potent, my eyes get uncomfortable while shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Smell is kinda strong for a few minutes after application</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and less expensive than the PM I was buying.</li>
            <li> I love it, you only have to use a little.</li>
            <li> It helps clear and prevent breakouts and is way cheaper than going to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li> natural oils are like that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this for nail fungus and so far it seems like it is helping.</li>
            <li> Purchased directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> i put directly on my and my kid&#x27;s skin when got bitten by insect and it didn&#x27;t irritate us.</li>
            <li> I used it for various cosmetic items I make myself, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I initially used it alone after washing my face and now use it daily mixed along with my home-made toner (green tea +rose water).</li>
            <li> Well, 2 months later my fungus that I&#x27;ve had since summer is completely gone!!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I go through the smaller bottle too fast and this lasts without a giant bottle sitting around.</li>
            <li> Bought for a toe nail that cracked vertically for no apparent reason, applications to date have seemed to make nail more flexible and less dry looking</li>
            <li> It is the only product of this type that  I find clearly lives up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it clear my rash</li>
            <li> I purchased it after looking for \\&quot;natural remedies\\&quot; for acne, and read several suggestions for tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> Last summer I developed this white toenail fungus that spread on all my toenails.</li>
            <li> The size of the product was worth the money, since I only need a few drops each use.</li>
            <li> It has made minor infections clear up overnight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it frequently on cloth diapers also because you&#x27;re limited on what you can use to disinfect them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for bad gums and cuts ect.</li>
            <li> it came fast and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this tea tree oil for a little over a week, but my skin definitely is already starting to look clearer.  </li>
            <li> I use Tea Tree Oil in lotion, shampoo, and to treat minor acne/skin inflammation.  </li>
            <li> At this pace, this bottle lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Also help pimple dry out overnight</li>
            <li> Be careful around your eyes.</li>
            <li> but I do swish it thoroughly for a minute or two through my teeth with water to carefully rinse my mouth after brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different tea tree oils in retail stores and none match the quality of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This was what I expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The oil seems good,but lid was loose and half leaked out in pakage and lable was off.</li>
            <li> I prepare about 3 oz of  OCM oil mix using castor oil and some other carrier oils.</li>
            <li> Always remember to dilute this oil with some other carrier oil before using.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in cleaning products but it can serve a host of other uses at home</li>
            <li> I dabbed the TTO on my toenails in the morning, let it dry for a few mins, then put on socks.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is an awful smell...very loud and strong smell.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the solution does seem a little thinner than what I would expect from an oil.  </li>
            <li> and not even half way used.</li>
            <li> use this on my scalp with a mix of coconut oil and Jamaican black castor oil</li>
            <li> so needless to say I don&#x27;t know if it removes skin tags because I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to find out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Noteworthy:  Never an issue while traveling due to the small size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d put a little dab on the sore and it healed within a few days..</li>
            <li> I added a few drops to my shampoo.</li>
            <li> A Doctor told me to use Tea Tree Oil for a skin rash or small pimples.</li>
            <li> Usually buy Paul Mitchell brand but ordered this in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I live in fl and the mosquitos are really bad</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no more trace of it, and I can&#x27;t be happier!!  </li>
            <li> if you are looking into getting Tea Tree oil, you wont go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> #34;what is that awful smell&amp;#34;?  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started making my own cleaning products and this product is recommended in many of the cleaning solutions. I like the smell but my husband always remarks about it (doesn&#x27;t like it as much).</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my dandruff but works great as a healing ointment.  Buy the TRUE oil not a cream not \\&quot;contains tree oil\\&quot;.  Would buy definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is very effective but make sure to delute it before u use!!!</li>
            <li> The now brand tea tree oil is a high quality oiI. I use this product in making my natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Great product i use tea tree oil for many things this was a good price</li>
            <li> Strong smell, but not unpleasant. I have never used tea tree oil before so cannot compare. The 2 oz bottle has a built-in dropper which is very convenient. Overall I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> good price- fast shipment  Thank You</li>
            <li> NOW has excellent products.  I mix tea tree oil with distilled water to disinfect and clean my apartment.</li>
            <li> I like this brand and use it a lot.</li>
            <li> A Doctor told me to use Tea Tree Oil for a skin rash or small pimples. It worked great and I thought I&#x27;d keep some on hand, the best price was online at Amazon.com and it was 100% pure NOW Foods  Tea Tree Oil..</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a wonderful product and I use it for fungus on my feet.  This particular brand is economical.</li>
            <li> I love it, you only have to use a little. A little goes a long way. I have had mine for over a year now and it works great. I use it in my hair oil.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree is one of those essentials in the medicine box. Great quality and price.</li>
            <li> Love this product for helping remove acne scars and help even out my complexion. Smell is kinda strong for a few minutes after application but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. I initially used it alone after washing my face and now use it daily mixed along with my home-made toner (green tea +rose water).</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY OIL.  NOW IS THE BEST PRODUCT IN QUALITY.  I MIX IT IN MY HAIR OILS AND USE IT ON MY NAILS.</li>
            <li> I hates the smell of the this oil giving me headache.</li>
            <li> Comes in a glass bottle, which is a plus point for any essential/carrier oils. I use it in shampoo to get rid of dandruff and itchy scalp. It has really helped to get rid of itchy scalp but as it is very potent, my eyes get uncomfortable while shampooing.  It is a very potent oil, so its necessary to dilute this oil before using. I also add a drop of this oil in my oil cleansing method (OCM) oil mix. I prepare about 3 oz of  OCM oil mix using castor oil and some other carrier oils. Just one drop of tea tree oil is enough for my 3 oz. I keep this oil handy in case of insect bites. Always remember to dilute this oil with some other carrier oil before using.</li>
            <li> I bought a 1 ounce bottle of Tea Tree oil at Trader Joe&#x27;s. I really liked how it felt and how it worked.  This product feels thinner. More like Trader Joe&#x27;s products with Tea Tree as an ingredient rather than the actual oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using tea tree oil as an antiseptic for quite a while, and there is just nothing over the counter any better and it doesn’t sting</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil has so many great uses &amp; this one from NOW is a wonderful oil!  Love the dropper-top, great 2 ounce size, super fast shipping with Prime!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve read articles stating that tea tree helps with dandruff. I&#x27;ve used it once so far but I have noticed that my scalp isn&#x27;t as itchy so that&#x27;s a plus. I like the aroma personally but it&#x27;s not everyone cup of tea. ;p  All kidding aside it&#x27;s great for adding to other essential oils and in baths, or laundry.</li>
            <li> The size of the product was worth the money, since I only need a few drops each use. I love tea tree oil for my irritated skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> The absolute best essential oil for a variety of uses! I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Very potent!!!! Fast delivery!! Mixing it with olive oil can help dilute it. Its so strong. Be careful around your eyes. I added a few drops to my shampoo. Feels great.</li>
            <li> The perfect amount and price! if you are looking into getting Tea Tree oil, you wont go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> hmm this doesn&#x27;t do much to my face.. doesn&#x27;t seem to heal acne either.. maybe I just don&#x27;t respond to tea tree oil? cuz I have used the body shop brand, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much either.</li>
            <li> I use Tea Tree Oil in lotion, shampoo, and to treat minor acne/skin inflammation.  This product is very potent and does not cause irritation.  But always spot test with any tea tree oil to make sure it won&#x27;t bother &#x27;your&#x27; individual skin.    I love it.  Will continue to buy it as needed.</li>
            <li> Fine quality and great packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product....I use this oil in cleaning products but it can serve a host of other uses at home</li>
            <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li> The aroma is spot on.  My only complaint is that the solution does seem a little thinner than what I would expect from an oil.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I use it sometime, It work for me! It is pure and smell good.  Nice product! I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I soak my feet in a tub with it. It feels great. It&#x27;s refreshing and antibacterial. I don&#x27;t trust the salons.</li>
            <li> I use exactly two drops of TTO on my electric toothbrush each time I brush.  At this pace, this bottle lasts a very long time.  My dental health is consistently excellent and I attribute part of that to my brushing protocol that includes a natural toothpaste (errr...gel only, not paste) plus the TTO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER swallow any of this stuff but I do swish it thoroughly for a minute or two through my teeth with water to carefully rinse my mouth after brushing.  I try to get it to swish deeply between my teeth to let it reach the deeper gum recesses and kill some germs and bacteria where brushing can&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This regimen seems to work great for me as my hygienist consistently tells me if all her patients were like me she&#x27;d soon be out of business.  My cleanings are always a breeze.  Try it and see if it works for you, too.  NOW brand is as good as any I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noteworthy:  Never an issue while traveling due to the small size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using tee tree oil and I use this for my scalp and it tingles and felt nice. I don&#x27;t really like the smell but natural oils are like that so there&#x27;s nothing you can do about that expect mix it with another oil.</li>
            <li> I love my tea tree oil! Great price too for such a big bottle. So many uses for tea tree oil</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp tingle and I love the menthol smell that eventually has a peppermint smell. I love it. It is great for dryness or dandruff too.</li>
            <li> arrived timely and intact</li>
            <li> The oil seems good,but lid was loose and half leaked out in pakage and lable was off.</li>
            <li> This product works really well. I mix it with Almond oil use it as a toner. My skin breakouts and blackheads are clearing up nicely.  It takes out all the excess oil better than any high priced toner I have ever used! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this for nail fungus and so far it seems like it is helping.</li>
            <li> Got what I ordered. I like that it&#x27;s 2oz. We use tea tree oil for cosmetic as well as household cleaning purposes.</li>
            <li> I diffuse this every night. It&#x27;s very relaxing</li>
            <li> I purchased this about two weeks ago as an additive for my skin products, I suffer from adult acne, its already started clearing my skin! I live in fl and the mosquitos are really bad so I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional bennifits as a bug blocker as some other reviewers have said but its deffanitly worth the price anyway!</li>
            <li> its great it came fast and use it everyday! and not even half way used. had it for 4 months now use it for my face. smells great. once i run out will buy again!</li>
            <li> love useing this in face and body care products I make at my house</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a tea tree oil expert - this bottle/brand is just the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it. I have, however, used tea tree oil often. I use it most often in my laundry. When starting a wash that I need a extra clean boost I add tea tree oil when I add the detergent. The smell is still present when I put the wash into the dryer and I like that. I&#x27;ve also used it frequently on cloth diapers also because you&#x27;re limited on what you can use to disinfect them. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Purchased directly from Amazon. Note: if you&#x27;re ordering this during the summer, make a note during shipping to sign for your package (if your delivery guy was like mine, he may drop it off without ringing the doorbell and you&#x27;ll end up with a ruined product -- I exchanged it for a new bottle and that&#x27;s what the review below is based upon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality seemed potent and fresh. I called Now Foods to find out when the production date was, and it was made like a month before I bought it. Nice. Their customer service was knowledgeable and friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s a high quality 100% pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Helps relieves that first official  face combat.</li>
            <li> This product does not smell fresh and in fact has a machine oil smell to it. Not the pungent Tea Tree Oil fragrence.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for bad gums and cuts ect.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and so many uses for it</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo22SS75YNFLSPT]][[ASIN:B002N0MZLM Essential Oil Tea Tree 2 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BEST TEA TREE OIL EVER , SEE MY VIDEO , FOR MORE DETAILS, I WILL BE BUYING AGAIN............</li>
            <li> It took a while, but did the job .</li>
            <li> gets rid of jocks itch and foot fungus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this tea tree oil for a little over a week, but my skin definitely is already starting to look clearer.  I purchased it after looking for \\&quot;natural remedies\\&quot; for acne, and read several suggestions for tea tree oil.  To use it, I put some oil-free face lotion in my hand, and mix it with a drop or two of the tea tree oil.  I then rub it into my skin across my whole face, right after washing.  Worth a shot!</li>
            <li> It is the only product of this type that  I find clearly lives up to the hype.  It has made minor infections clear up overnight.  It is magic.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree essential oil.  It can be used for so many things and is safe enough to put directly on the skin.  I&#x27;d like to see a subscribe and safe option for this.</li>
            <li> I heard that tea tree oil removes skin tags......I bought a bottle and applied some to my skin tags.  as soon as I entered the living room, my hubby said &amp;#34;what is that awful smell&amp;#34;?  Yes it is an awful smell...very loud and strong smell. so needless to say I don&#x27;t know if it removes skin tags because I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to find out.  I did have a sore that wasn&#x27;t healing and I&#x27;d put a little dab on the sore and it healed within a few days..</li>
            <li> This product did wonders for my nose piercing. I definitely recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> Another fast shipment of a quality product!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this with another product (from another seller) on Friday 4/3 and it came early on Monday 4/6.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my scalp with a mix of coconut oil and Jamaican black castor oil and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with itching and flaking since. It smells strong yet really good, good enough for aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> love this scent but wish it was a cheaper price,use alot doing massages.I think I may prefer tea tree to this but is a good scent</li>
            <li> I had a bout with shingles and read that tea tree oil would help. Not only did it clear my rash but it helped soothe the soreness. I have since found a million ways to use this oil. I put it on my scalp for dandruff control. I use it on my face at night when I have a breakout and in the morning it&#x27;s gone. I put a couple of drops in my humidifier at work because we have no ventilation and it helps rid the stuffiness and germs. It&#x27;s also great at disinfecting. I cant get enough of it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good keep acne under control, I use it morning and night with a mixture of facial wash. Also help pimple dry out overnight</li>
            <li> Very happy with this produce</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed all of the Now brand essential oils I&#x27;ve ordered. This is useful for so many things!  Just wish they were easier to pour/use.</li>
            <li> I bought the oil originally to put it on my gums.  I&#x27;ve used tea tree before and my dentist complimented me on my teeth.  I gave a bottle to my friend who had a toothache and it helped sooth the pain.  Good product</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Good price</li>
            <li> Im a big fan of tea tree oil. Its very versatile, I use it to make home made wipes or on pimples. This is a good size.</li>
            <li> i feel this is well priced, and I like the smell of this tea tree oil. i put directly on my and my kid&#x27;s skin when got bitten by insect and it didn&#x27;t irritate us.</li>
            <li> I dilute this with water and apply as a toner for my skin. It helps clear and prevent breakouts and is way cheaper than going to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tea tree oil which I love and use for cleaning and tons of jobs around the house. I just figured out that I can get it cheaper in a store close to home. So no problems with the product, just the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different tea tree oils in retail stores and none match the quality of this stuff.  I used it for various cosmetic items I make myself, and it works very well. It&#x27;s very potent and seems to be much more pure than the oils I&#x27;ve bought in stores.  I will buy all my tea tree oil from this seller from now on.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is THE miracle oil it even kills germs. This oil has endless uses, but the one that surprised  me the most was that it actually kills germs like Lysol. It helps with dandruff, it helps with acne, it also promotes hair growth. You can also use it as an aroma therapy. Tea tree  is really an all in one SUPER oil.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT A LOT. I MIX IT WITH MY FOOT CREAM AND USE  IT ON MY FEET. SO THEY DO NOT BREAK OUT . I GO IN THE GARDEN AND SEEM TO BE EXPOSED TO THINGS THAT BOTHER ME..</li>
            <li> Great product, I use tea tree on a regular basis and this product is of good quality. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! So many great uses. Flea treatment (way cheaper than frontline etc.), dandruff treatment, add to shampoo to repel head lice and avoid infestation in school age/daycare kids, DIY facial toner, the list goes on. This is a good size too. I go through the smaller bottle too fast and this lasts without a giant bottle sitting around.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree is a one of the more popular EOs you can have in your home.  The amount you get at this price cannot be matched.  NOW essential oils are regularly on my Amazon orders.  Love &#x27;em all.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, excellent product.</li>
            <li> This was what I expected. I read many reviews and so far I am pleased. Bought for a toe nail that cracked vertically for no apparent reason, applications to date have seemed to make nail more flexible and less dry looking and I am hopeful nail will grow out. This is very medicinal smelling, but it is pharmaceutical grade. Smell is similar to camphor or menthol. I use it at bed time and wear cotton socks over it. Smell is gone by AM and socks are scent free after washing.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is one of the most used essential oils I use, so it was handy and cost-effective to buy it in this larger 2 oz size.  Tea Tree oil is a must have in any household!  There are soooo many wonderful uses for it, and it is all natural!  I love to dab some on a pimple....it&#x27;s a great antibacterial!  But, the most useful for me thus far has been using it as an anti-fungal on my feet!  Last summer I developed this white toenail fungus that spread on all my toenails. I went to the derm and she prescribed me a prescription topical, and she said it would probably take 6 months to heal, if it did.  Well, I decided to research more natural cures and found TTO was a top one for toenail fungus.  I dabbed the TTO on my toenails in the morning, let it dry for a few mins, then put on socks.  At night, I put organic virgin coconut oil (also a must have!) on my feet, then dabbed TTO on my toenails and put on socks and slept overnight this way.  Occasionally I&#x27;d wrap my feet in plastic bags or saran wrap after putting on the coconut oil/TTO and then put on the socks.  Well, 2 months later my fungus that I&#x27;ve had since summer is completely gone!!  There&#x27;s no more trace of it, and I can&#x27;t be happier!!  My toenails look healthy and perfect!  I&#x27;m so thankful for TTO and will always have it at my house!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have around the house at all times.  This is a great price for the amount that you get.  Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Usually buy Paul Mitchell brand but ordered this in a pinch. I mix tea tree with apple cider vinegar and water for a homemade face toner. This product is awesome and less expensive than the PM I was buying.</li>
            <li> This was a great value. I use tea tree oil in my homemade bath balls, on my face when I have breakouts and even in my baths. Now always provides the quality in looking for.</li>
