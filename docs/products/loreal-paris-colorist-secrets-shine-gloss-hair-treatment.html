    <ol>
            <li>Everything Is perfect, the product didn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t get the brilliant shine, it&#x27;s a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Since then, I started coloring my own hair (Preference by L&#x27;Oreal is the best!!).  </li>
            <li>I am very confident this will make your hair shine like it says.</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS get compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks when I use it!  </li>
            <li>After I treated my hair with this product the shine was amazing..</li>
            <li>Guys, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>In my case it worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li>My hair was kind of marginally softer for a couple of days</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how if your hair doesn&#x27;t look healthy</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this glossing treatment.  </li>
            <li>A miracle! :)</li>
            <li>so I figured this would be safe since no color was involved.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been dyed and I love it the way it is.</li>
            <li>I love the shine and softness this brings to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the shine that this product adds to my hair.  </li>
            <li>the most shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t look healthy.  </li>
            <li>It gives your hair a more sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love love this.</li>
            <li>maybe they will come out with a better one soon ....</li>
            <li>it is not always easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shine and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>started buying it here because they stopped carrying it in my grocery store (which is fine, it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
            <li>I have always had fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>The company was quick and responsive!</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product because I don&#x27;t dye my hair but wanted the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; benefit that hair coloring seems to give.</li>
            <li>If you take good care of your hair, you should be using deep conditioning once a week anyway (depending on hair type, of course)</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions, it is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>I wish i was brave enough to take it to the salon and ask them to use it when i need a full head of new color.</li>
            <li>But my hair was very shiny, very smooth, very silky.  </li>
            <li>the nice part is it only takes 10 minutes and does no color alteration.</li>
            <li>Just a clear coat of shine. :)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to ladies with long sleek hair or for those who want to control frizz while adding amazing shine.</li>
            <li>This was a great price for a hard to find favorite product that definitely extends the life of a hair-color.</li>
            <li>I went exactly by the instructions.</li>
            <li>will pay a lot more for a similar treatment at salons.</li>
            <li>And has stayed that way for several more weeks (about 5 to my recollection, with the usage of the conditioner as well).  </li>
            <li>When I went back to the salon, (which I did on a weekly basis), my hair dresser kept asking me what happened, because my hair was SO healthy before this.</li>
            <li>Followed directions exactly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this treatment 2 days before, and then the next day (the day before the event) use a conditioning mask for my hair and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, colored mid length hair.</li>
            <li>It just looks like a 60&#x27;s style Afro--a style, which was fine back in the day, but not the look</li>
            <li>My hair was not color-treated and was healthy already, and I expected a \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; look, but there was no additional shine whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone that wants shiny hair</li>
            <li>really like wearing it this way.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks very well conditioned and a lot healthier than it did before the treatment.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Fast service thanks.</li>
            <li>and really didn&#x27;t have anything happen.  </li>
            <li>adds shine for a brief period of time-good for special occasion.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, my hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>actually dried out my hair even more...</li>
            <li>My experience is that it is like getting all the harshness of dying hair without any of the hoped for shine or manageability that goes with using normal hair dye.</li>
            <li>SO IF IT CHANGES YOUR COLOR, DON&#x27;T EVEN BOTHER TRYING TO COLOR IT OVER THE NEW GLOSS).  </li>
            <li>I just want to look vibrant and young.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>I rinsed, put the conditioner on for two minutes and my hair was silky smooth and shiny - the only flaw - it showed all those broken hairs on my head.  : )  </li>
            <li>I used it as a hair gloss, if you should don&#x27;t want as a color get the CLEAR, what I use.</li>
            <li>no shine but hair was seriously soft.</li>
            <li>I dyed it within my natural color range and the shine lasted for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I am a African American female, who tried this product on my hair and each time I had my hair washed, large amounts were in the sink.</li>
            <li>I am African American and wear my hair natural although I do color it every six weeks or so.</li>
            <li>I like it because I dye my hair frequently but like to keep it long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Loreal for a long time now and every time I dye my hair it looks so shiny and silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair with some white, and this product did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Glad I hadn&#x27;t read the reviews first because some of the results were so bad that the low price wouldn&#x27;t have mattered.</li>

            <li> But some of  the other reviews make it clear that it&#x27;s not a product for everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I just wanted something to kind of shiny up my hair a little as it seems a little dull.  </li>
            <li> You constantly experience dry hair and massively split ends.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron twice a week, hence the reason for using this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered enough for a long while.</li>
            <li> I am a life long user.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and fine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair were extremely dry until I found this.  </li>
            <li> When i used the product as directed and just blew dry my hair -- it was frizzy and didn&#x27;t look like it did anything.</li>
            <li> or it will dry you out.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so dry it limits my styling options.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair with very little frizz and</li>
            <li> Not worth spending ten bucks on what you can get with a glossing spray.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde hair but choose to dye it black.</li>
            <li> It totally worked on me but less than 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> then it washes out so really expensive for a super temporary shine......</li>
            <li> It has always been hard to the touch and now it is soft and curly.</li>
            <li> It works but only for a few days</li>
            <li> This product was totally ineffective on my black hair as well as my daughters dark brown hair...</li>
            <li> I noticed what other reviews have said,  What do they want glass over ther hair?  </li>
            <li> $30 and up for a salon glossing so not worth it to me.....</li>
            <li> This item was a total waste!!</li>
            <li> It adds a coat over my hair that doesn&#x27;t CURE the split ends, but it smooths them over for about a month and a half</li>
            <li> I add a little conditioner to the solution and my hair comes out shiny and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out and made it frizzy.</li>
            <li> It says it will last approximately 6 weeks....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this was a waste of time and money for me and not a product I will buy again.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to leave it on no more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for 10 minutes, no more than that</li>
            <li> When hair gets dull between treatments this is an inexpensive way to brighten dull hair.</li>
            <li> As my hair has been regrowing I have found that the color is dull.  </li>
            <li> And then went dull again.  </li>
            <li> So I know at least it works well for this type of hair.</li>
            <li> (YOU CANNOT COLOR OVER THE GLOSS FOR AT LEAST FOUR WEEKS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m angry that I wasted my money on this and hope to spare others.  </li>
            <li> messy and difficult to use like you are putting dye in your hair....</li>
            <li> I went from loosing hair, to thin hair, to brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> product gets two stars as it also didn&#x27;t do anything bad or damage my hair, as some other reviewers have posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those of you who do dye, you know how difficult this is.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get the results</li>
            <li> in the end -- this isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> This was the worst product that I could have ever used.</li>
            <li> It was horrible!!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair is not colored and it works for me- adds shine for a brief period of time-good for special occasion.</li>
            <li> I used this but could not tell any difference in the shine.  I will not be ordering this product again.  It did not give the results as stated.</li>
            <li> This product was totally ineffective on my black hair as well as my daughters dark brown hair...actually dried out my hair even more...This item was a total waste!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this glossing treatment.  I ALWAYS get compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks when I use it!  It&#x27;s still chemicals, so it&#x27;s going to do a bit of drying no matter what you do.  However, I&#x27;ve found that if I have a big even coming up I&#x27;ll use this treatment 2 days before, and then the next day (the day before the event) use a conditioning mask for my hair and it works just fine.  If you take good care of your hair, you should be using deep conditioning once a week anyway (depending on hair type, of course) so I never had a big problem with this product drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product because I don&#x27;t dye my hair but wanted the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; benefit that hair coloring seems to give. However, this product gave no benefit to my hair. Did not make it shiny. Dried my hair out and made it frizzy. I went exactly by the instructions.</li>
            <li> This was a great price for a hard to find favorite product that definitely extends the life of a hair-color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for what it&#x27;s intended for (though it does give my hair some shine). I like it because I dye my hair frequently but like to keep it long. For those of you who do dye, you know how difficult this is. You constantly experience dry hair and massively split ends. Enter the gloss treatment. It adds a coat over my hair that doesn&#x27;t CURE the split ends, but it smooths them over for about a month and a half so my hair has a chance to grow without breaking off or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use it I can actually run a brush through my hair without tugging! A miracle! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started buying it here because they stopped carrying it in my grocery store (which is fine, it&#x27;s cheaper here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference: I have naturally blonde hair but choose to dye it black. It&#x27;s very thin and fine. So I know at least it works well for this type of hair. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I also use a conditioner meant for people who dye their hair (I switch between Garnier Fructis and Tresemme.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the nice part is it only takes 10 minutes and does no color alteration. Just a clear coat of shine. :)</li>
            <li> I have never even colored my hair at home so I figured this would be safe since no color was involved. It was alright and did seem to work but don&#x27;t think I will bother with it again. My hair has never been dyed and I love it the way it is.</li>
            <li> I have fine, colored mid length hair. This process, and the ability to use the leftover glosser every time you shampoo,&lt;br /&gt;gives my hair the body and shine it needs. I am a big fan of this- it is not always easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;You will pay a lot more for a similar treatment at salons. If you follow the instructions, it is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair were extremely dry until I found this.  I also color my hair every eight weeks and this stuff makes it last.  I love the shine and softness this brings to my hair.  I noticed what other reviews have said,  What do they want glass over ther hair?  I am a life long user.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with some white, and this product did absolutely nothing.

            <li> It did what the box says! My hair is shiny and soft! I recommend it to anyone that wants shiny hair</li>
            <li> I just used this L&#x27;Oreal shine product per instructions and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get the results I intended.&lt;br /&gt;The only part of my hair that benefitted for any shine was the underside at the back, which is not what&lt;br /&gt;is showing at all. I use a flat iron twice a week, hence the reason for using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my hair shine and is easy to use. Just remember to leave it on no more than 10 minutes. I add a little conditioner to the solution and my hair comes out shiny and conditioned. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the shine that this product adds to my hair.  I have naturally wavy/curly hair with very little frizz and really like wearing it this way.  After I treated my hair with this product the shine was amazing..but my curls lost their umph.  Some time has passed since I treated  and my curls are finally coming back the way that I like them.  I would recommend this product to ladies with long sleek hair or for those who want to control frizz while adding amazing shine.</li>
            <li> Guys, this product is amazing. It totally worked on me but less than 6 weeks. Here&#x27;s the thing. They add this gloss to the dye. I&#x27;ve been using Loreal for a long time now and every time I dye my hair it looks so shiny and silky and soft. And then within 2 weeks the shine goes away. This gloss is same as any Loreal dye except of it doesn&#x27;t have an actual dye in it</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything at all to your hair. perhaps just damage it or make it feel gross. wouldn&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
            <li> I used it as a hair gloss, if you should don&#x27;t want as a color get the CLEAR, what I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rewriting my initial review.  When i used the product as directed and just blew dry my hair -- it was frizzy and didn&#x27;t look like it did anything. Hair looked drier and had no body.  I had given it a 2 rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT last night - I washed my hair with my regular shampoo and conditioner and I can now see a difference.  My hair looks very well conditioned and a lot healthier than it did before the treatment. Looks like younger hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that a brunette is going to see the most shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end -- this isn&#x27;t bad.  Still can&#x27;t give it a final judgement until after a week - -but it does seem to do what it says it will do. Even if you don&#x27;t get the brilliant shine, it&#x27;s a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li> My experience is that it is like getting all the harshness of dying hair without any of the hoped for shine or manageability that goes with using normal hair dye.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged before trying this product. My hair would literally break off and then ends would never hold color. It was so nasty!&lt;br /&gt;After about two months, and two boxes of this product later, my hair is the softest, shiniest, smoothest, and prettiest it&#x27;s been in years! There&#x27;s no break off anymore, and my hair has even finally started growing out again!</li>
            <li> When hair gets dull between treatments this is an inexpensive way to brighten dull hair. Definitely cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li> no shine but hair was seriously soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by telling you that I am 33 and on blood thinners and antiseizure medications.  These medications have been murder on my hair.  I went from loosing hair, to thin hair, to brittle hair.  I have always had fine wavy hair.  As my hair has been regrowing I have found that the color is dull.  I dyed it within my natural color range and the shine lasted for about two weeks.  And then went dull again.  I just wanted the shine.  It&#x27;s amazing how if your hair doesn&#x27;t look healthy you don&#x27;t look healthy.  I just want to look vibrant and young.  So I tried the shine gloss treatment.  Leave it on for 10 minutes, no more than that or it will dry you out.  I rinsed, put the conditioner on for two minutes and my hair was silky smooth and shiny - the only flaw - it showed all those broken hairs on my head.  : )  But my hair was very shiny, very smooth, very silky.  And has stayed that way for several more weeks (about 5 to my recollection, with the usage of the conditioner as well).  The conditioner comes with it.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this product! I am a African American female, who tried this product on my hair and each time I had my hair washed, large amounts were in the sink. This was the worst product that I could have ever used. When I went back to the salon, (which I did on a weekly basis), my hair dresser kept asking me what happened, because my hair was SO healthy before this. I just wanted extra shine, and ended up having variations of lengths on my head (from 2 to 5 inches!!!!) It was horrible!! My hair was bottom neck length and now it had to be cut off! Please do not go through what I went through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost forgot, my sister used it also, and she had the same results!!! We both had to cut our hair VERY short to adjust!</li>
            <li> I used L&#x27;Oreal medium blonde to color my hair and this product did change the color to an ash blond look. (YOU CANNOT COLOR OVER THE GLOSS FOR AT LEAST FOUR WEEKS SO IF IT CHANGES YOUR COLOR, DON&#x27;T EVEN BOTHER TRYING TO COLOR IT OVER THE NEW GLOSS).  On the positive side, my hair is shiny and soft. It gives your hair a more sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have gloss done in the salon before, and it also changed my &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; hair color at the time. Since then, I started coloring my own hair (Preference by L&#x27;Oreal is the best!!).  I figured I would try to gloss myself too.  This gloss isn&#x27;t as shiny as the salon product, but it is close enough to it that I will do it again (and again).  It says it will last approximately 6 weeks....so we will see about that.</li>
            <li> I love love this. It really works. I ordered enough for a long while. I wish i was brave enough to take it to the salon and ask them to use it when i need a full head of new color. Fast service thanks.</li>
            <li> It wasnt what I thought it would be. The company was quick and responsive! Everything Is perfect, the product didn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Not worth spending ten bucks on what you can get with a glossing spray.  It works but only for a few days then it washes out so really expensive for a super temporary shine......maybe they will come out with a better one soon ....$30 and up for a salon glossing so not worth it to me.....messy and difficult to use like you are putting dye in your hair....</li>
            <li> This product was on sale at a local clearance store so I decided to give it a shot. Glad I hadn&#x27;t read the reviews first because some of the results were so bad that the low price wouldn&#x27;t have mattered. I am African American and wear my hair natural although I do color it every six weeks or so. My hair is so dry it limits my styling options.  It just looks like a 60&#x27;s style Afro--a style, which was fine back in the day, but not the look I want now. This product surpassed my expectations in that it brought out the curl pattern and added shine. It has always been hard to the touch and now it is soft and curly. I went back to the store and bought out the  remaining 12 boxes -- the entire stock. In my case it worked amazingly well. But some of  the other reviews make it clear that it&#x27;s not a product for everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I just wanted something to kind of shiny up my hair a little as it seems a little dull.  Followed directions exactly and really didn&#x27;t have anything happen.  My hair was kind of marginally softer for a couple of days but I did not notice any difference in the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets two stars as it also didn&#x27;t do anything bad or damage my hair, as some other reviewers have posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a waste of time and money for me and not a product I will buy again.  May work for some people but not me.</li>
            <li> This is a product recommended by Dr. Oz which I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use yet. I am very confident this will make your hair shine like it says. I would recommend this item.</li>
