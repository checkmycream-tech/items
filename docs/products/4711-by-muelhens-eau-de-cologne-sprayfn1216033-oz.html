            <li>I live in the USA for 59 years and always had to by 4711 in Germany, so you can see how happy I am to find it here, it is refreshing and Clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I think it is appropriate for any age or gender and anything in their line would make a  thoughtful gift.</li>
            <li>but there is something kind of fun about it.</li>
            <li>Love the mild, refreshing scent of this product…Has become “my fragrance ”..  </li>
            <li>it is the perfect everyday unisex cologne.  </li>
            <li>This product smells great, but it truly doesn&#x27;t last at all.  </li>
            <li>Smells cheap and it reeks of desperation.</li>
            <li>I like how the citrus scent becomes more prevalent during my workouts or on a hot day doing yard work.</li>
            <li>It truly is a unisex scent that smells clean.</li>
            <li>I tried this because I wanted something light and citrus scented that would blend well with Dove Fresh Scent soap for men.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>THIS PERFUME IS COOL AND RELAXING.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it was in existence any more, but Amazon found it for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>Such a bright, clean, fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have found when using the splash version, it quickly evaporates after opening the bottle.</li>
            <li>This perfume is super.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have used Muelhens products for many years and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>This is a classic refreshing, clean old world scent, to be enjoyed by men and women alike.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, though, I liked the memories better than the current, actual scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves my linens smelling fresh and crisp!</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells great but dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>also appreciated the quick shipment.</li>
            <li>A very gentle aroma</li>
            <li>My first perfume -</li>
            <li>In fact, Muelhens lists all the elements (essential oils) that make up this scent, a refreshingly truthful practice I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>In college I used to borrow it regularly, because my favorite scents like Calandre by Paco Rabanne or Diorissimo were too steep on a student&#x27;s budget.  </li>
            <li>For old times&#x27; sake I picked up a bottle recently and it is still fantastic and refreshing, and my husband likes it, too.  </li>
            <li>I actually smell better when I sweat.</li>
            <li>4711 is literally the first cologne to be marketed on the planet, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 30 years now.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just me.</li>
            <li>Love this german cologne for a man!  </li>
            <li>Classic, cool &amp; fresh without smelling overwhelming - especially if you live in a hot, humid area.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>fast ship and exactly as I remembered it</li>
            <li>Bottle is large and does not have spray.</li>
            <li>i really wanted to give 4 stars..</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, since it was so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh, natural scent that doesn&#x27;t annoy anyone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as I did then.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cologne!</li>
            <li>An old favorite worn by my German grandparents.</li>
            <li>An old classic, that makes you feel fresh, and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>This is an absolute classic.</li>
            <li>I live 4711!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite classic scents  Had been hard to find</li>
            <li>Not very common on these days...</li>
            <li>I realize that this is supposed to be &#x27;old fashioned&#x27;, but it smells like something that has been in my grandmother&#x27;s cabinet for 50 years.</li>
            <li>Far too medicine-y for me, I&#x27;m using it as a bathroom spray just to rid of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural as well.</li>
            <li>I have introduced it to the young people I know</li>
            <li>Does not last very long at all; probably since it is a cologne and not a perfume, so it evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Some things are better left in the past.</li>
            <li>My Dad used to use this a long time ago, a classic citrusy cologne.  </li>
            <li>, that will never lose its old European appeal.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like a high quality cologne or last a long time</li>
            <li>This is an old favorite and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>due to its short lasting and minimum sillage factors... however the smell is classic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very delicate, light fragrance.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but if you have no memories of this and just want something that is a unisex type of product and isn&#x27;t very heavy on floral or spicy notes, I would recommend this.</li>

            <li> Great refreshing scent, keep it in the glove box.</li>
            <li> I used 4711 all my grownup life</li>
            <li> I live in the USA for 59 years and always had to by 4711 in Germany, so you can see how happy I am to find it here, it is refreshing and Clean smelling.</li>
            <li> My first perfume - I have not worn it since I was 14.  I am now 68 and it is fab.  And my nose remembers it well.</li>
            <li> An interesting jasmine and pine with citrus peel sort of smell. It&#x27;s unisex. It does not smell like a high quality cologne or last a long time but there is something kind of fun about it.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I wore this scent many, many years ago....As I recall, I wore the &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; version, vs. the &amp;#34;spray.&amp;#34;  I still love this &amp;#34;familiar&amp;#34; scent...It is nice, without being overpowering!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, since it was so reasonably priced.  My sister had mentioned this to me, and I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bright, citrus perfume, with notes of citronella (yes, the smell they put in mosquito repelling candles).  In fact, Muelhens lists all the elements (essential oils) that make up this scent, a refreshingly truthful practice I appreciate.  Some people may associate this scent with an old style barbershop, but I happen to like that smell, for nostalgic reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it last?  Not really, but go ahead and spray again.  I&#x27;m taking this with me on vacation, since I associate the smell with being away from home on a trip, and if anything happens to the cologne, I am not going to cry over it -- I&#x27;ll just get another bottle, the price is so good.</li>
            <li> My Dad used to use this a long time ago, a classic citrusy cologne.  In college I used to borrow it regularly, because my favorite scents like Calandre by Paco Rabanne or Diorissimo were too steep on a student&#x27;s budget.  For old times&#x27; sake I picked up a bottle recently and it is still fantastic and refreshing, and my husband likes it, too.  (On me, and on him as well.)  I only gave it four stars because even for a cologne its staying power is very limited.</li>
            <li> Such a bright, clean, fresh fragrance.  It&#x27;s a treat for the senses and it&#x27;s not overpowering in the least.  It&#x27;s subtle and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Smells like brut!! Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My husband gave me a bottle of this in the 80&#x27;s. I loved the citrus piney smell. (It smells that way to me.)&lt;br /&gt;I bought it out of nostalgia and I&#x27;m glad I did. He thinks it&#x27;s the same bottle. So don&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for over 50 years and love the spray bottle - thank you!</li>
            <li> I grew up with this scent in the house since my mom was from Germany and she wore it and would gift me little bottles from time to time. It has a fresh, natural scent that doesn&#x27;t annoy anyone. I think it is appropriate for any age or gender and anything in their line would make a  thoughtful gift. I was so thoughtful, I gifted myself!</li>
            <li> I tried this because I wanted something light and citrus scented that would blend well with Dove Fresh Scent soap for men.&lt;br /&gt;This works well. It initially smells of citrus and citronella but fades to a suntan lotion sent. Makes me think of vacation at the beach. I like how the citrus scent becomes more prevalent during my workouts or on a hot day doing yard work. I actually smell better when I sweat. My wife even liked it. I usually don&#x27;t buy a scent before my significant other approves it. It truly is a unisex scent that smells clean. I will be purchasing again for the rest of the summer months.</li>
            <li> Love the mild, refreshing scent of this product…Has become “my fragrance ”..  I’m introducing it to others~ purchased as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! It&#x27;s all natural as well.</li>
            <li> 4711 is literally the first cologne to be marketed on the planet, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 30 years now.  Crisp, bright, and citrus-like it is the perfect everyday unisex cologne.  By the way, it is called cologne because it comes from &amp;#34;Cologne, Germany.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s how these fragrances got their product designation!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite and you can&#x27;t go wrong. Very fresh smelling and can be worn by either me or my husband!</li>
            <li> Very clean, citrus scent. Does not last very long at all; probably since it is a cologne and not a perfume, so it evaporates quickly. Love this as a linen spray, however. I use it as both a personal scent and a linen spray. It leaves my linens smelling fresh and crisp! Probably would not buy again as a perfume/cologne for personal scent, but would buy again to use it as an air freshener or linen spray!</li>
            <li> My brother loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Bottle is large and does not have spray. I have used 4711 for many years. I have found when using the splash version, it quickly evaporates after opening the bottle. The rest does not have the scent any more. It is a shame because this is a very nice scent. Must buy with vaporizer and smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> I gave up on perfumes long ago until I tried this.  It has a wonderful fresh citrus smell.  No wonder it has stood the test of time.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute classic. Don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t more popular. It&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t stick to you like glue. It refreshes when you want it, and wears off in an hour or so. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I live 4711!  So happy to have found it at this great price.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used Muelhens products for many years and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The best!&lt;br /&gt;And I get many compliments on smelling good. However it is very discreet and delicate. This perfume is super.</li>
            <li> This was a product that my grandparents used when I was growing up in Europe.  It has a very light scent and is perfect if you want something that is not heavy or spicy.  For me it brings back memories of my childhood but if you have no memories of this and just want something that is a unisex type of product and isn&#x27;t very heavy on floral or spicy notes, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I used to use it as a teenager 30 years ago.  I don&#x27;t like it as much as I did then.  It&#x27;s not bad.  It&#x27;s citrus-y.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS COOL AND RELAXING. I WANT TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR HOURS, HOW DO NOT TAKE WITHOUT ALL THE BOTTLE IN MY BAG.</li>
            <li> An old favorite worn by my German grandparents.</li>
            <li> The fragrance takes me back to the 60&#x27;s.  I used to wear it when I was in college.  I really didn&#x27;t think it was in existence any more, but Amazon found it for me.  It smells the same but I don&#x27;t think the fragrance lasts as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> My Mom loves this cologne and it has been her only cologne since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this cologne. If I could, there would be no stars. The fragrance smells great but dissipates within a few minutes. At first I thought it was just me. I had others try---same results.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but it truly doesn&#x27;t last at all.  By the time I reach my front door after spraying it, the smell is gone.  I have even tried using it as an air freshener because it&#x27;s an unfit body spray but still the scent doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Happy to find it again. My wife did not think it was a &amp;#34;Unisex&amp;#34; Cologne but I did. And, after a 15 minute warm-up on my face and neck, I did receive a compliment or two. Truthfully, though, I liked the memories better than the current, actual scent.</li>
            <li> 4711 Eau De Cologne is wonderful!  It&#x27;s a very delicate, light fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been using Nag Champa roll-on perfume oil for several years, which tends to be a somewhat heady scent.  The 4711 is a refreshing change of pace.  I highly recommend this cologne!</li>
            <li> This is a classic refreshing, clean old world scent, to be enjoyed by men and women alike. I have introduced it to the young people I know and they are thoroughly enthralled by its fragrance. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F. Poe</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, smells very nice (in a I have smelt this befor kinda way) I use it for anything from room fresher to hand wash.</li>
            <li> This is the Brut cologne of 1799. Smells cheap and it reeks of desperation. Some things are better left in the past.</li>
            <li> fast ship and exactly as I remembered it</li>
            <li> My wife loves, loves, loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I think she would drink it if it were a beverage!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Classic, cool &amp; fresh without smelling overwhelming - especially if you live in a hot, humid area.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite classic scents  Had been hard to find</li>
            <li> Love this german cologne for a man!  Not very common on these days...</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted and I will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciated the quick shipment.</li>
            <li> a xmas gift for my friend, she liked it a lot</li>
