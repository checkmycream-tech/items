            <li>Nice to see its availability through Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I liked...</li>
            <li>And by far the best at detangeling hair</li>
            <li>Deep Conditioner is a wonderful and effective product.  </li>
            <li>This time I was impressed and bought a refill locally.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>its cheaper. :)</li>
            <li>And the results have gotten better and better each time I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?  </li>
            <li>And the regular SM conditioner is excellent as well.  </li>
            <li>I am ecstatic that I&#x27;ve found such a wonderful hair product brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than Pantene.  </li>
            <li>I just wished I could use it more than once a week. .</li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works better.  </li>
            <li>I shampoo leaves my hair shiny, bouncy and healthy.  </li>
            <li>And SM is color safe as well as cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>And SM shampoos are sulfate free too and are therefore color safe.  </li>
            <li>It leaves her hair curly and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Great Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have type 3c/4a kinky curly hair and this deep conditioner is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazon has come to my rescue once again and kept a product accessible that I am in need of.</li>
            <li>It took the frizz out of my hair and made my hair feel so soft and nice.  </li>
            <li>This \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; seemed like nothing more than regular conditioner in a fancy block container with an appealing label.</li>
            <li>Pantene conditioners are pretty good, but next time I will just stick to purchasing my conditioner in one of those longer slimmer bottles....</li>
            <li>It really coats my hair and no matter how tangled it is, I can comb through it pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this product would be the most effective for someone with thinner hair but mine is so thick that I feel I need a product with a thicker texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a curly haired natural and needed a good moisturizing deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with long natural (un-permed) hair and the whole curly hair series works great for me (and it smells great too).</li>
            <li>I first received a group of the Pantene products for curly hair to use and review.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what my wife likes and has used for years.</li>
            <li>This product is thinner than most deep moisture treatments.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and curls are smooth.</li>
            <li>at first.  </li>
            <li>I definitely get better results with SM products than I ever did with Pantene.  </li>
            <li>I definitely get better results with SM products than I ever did with Pantene.  </li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>Such a good decision because I&#x27;m on the second one already.</li>
            <li>results were good but pretty much the same as my daily conditioner</li>
            <li>If you want true conditioning, not a heavy coating, then give SM masks a try.  </li>

            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t recommend this Pantene mask.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner</li>
            <li>Without changing the serum and gel, this conditioner really fights the dreaded &amp;#34;FRIZZIES&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and this REALLY helps.  </li>
            <li>I alway&#x27;s wanted straight hair, and then it started to happen.</li>
            <li>It is no longer available in our local stores, so I order three packs for her convenience.</li>
            <li>I now use this product every day and it really helps to maintain moisture and to keep my curls well formed.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy and curly hair.</li>
            <li>Only wish it had more natural ingredients</li>
            <li>The only good it does is make my hair easier to comb out when wet.  </li>
            <li>SM is available at Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Target, Ulta and Sally Beauty Supply and although it&#x27;s pricier than typical drugstore products, it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend and thank Pantene for making this.  </li>
            <li>would highly recomend this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair was hydrated, soft, supply and really shiny.  </li>
            <li>A good, deep conditioning treatment is usually a once a week thing to keep my hair from looking like straw.</li>
            <li>Instead of using this once in awhile, I just use it as my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>(Not enough for me to be willing to keep dealing with it though.)</li>
            <li>I sometimes leave a small trace amount of the product in my hair and my curls just love</li>
            <li>Wow I wanted my curls back ,I&#x27;ll use a Chi straightner for that temporary straight hair fix(lol).</li>
            <li>I was completely unimpressed with this product.</li>
            <li>It soft</li>
            <li>It leaves their hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My youngest has naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>One thing, however, is that if your hair is really damaged and/or dry/frizzy, then leave it on for 30 min to 1 hour using a shower cap or plastic bag for really deep treatment.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>SM contains no silicone, paraben, phlalates and is all natural.  </li>
            <li>My hair is never as soft as after using this product.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>They have stopped selling this at my local grocer and walmart which is absolutely HEART BREAKING.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft when I rinse it out.</li>
            <li>It is also much cheaper than other deep conditioners that you need to leave in your hair for much longer periods of time.  </li>
            <li>It seems like over time my hair grows a resistance to the product and I have to go back out and find something else new.  </li>
            <li>That being said a little bit of the product goes a long way and the scent is light, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gone from one product series to the next over my years battling it out with my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, dry/damaged, frizzy and naturally curly hair, and this did not help.</li>
            <li>But with my curly, frizzy long hair, almost none of the products, even professional lines, do the job.  </li>
            <li>I left it in for ten minutes and it brought life back to my natural curls.</li>

            <li> It rivals any other moisturizing treatment that costs up to $50.  </li>
            <li> Using this product every time or every other time</li>
            <li> I mean really it was looking dull and just limp.</li>

            <li> My oldest has thick thick thick hair with a slight wave</li>
            <li> I was told not to wash my hair everyday, because it&#x27;s not good for the curls.</li>
            <li> I saw this cool square jar on the shelf on sale for $4.99 at the grocery store on a very bad hair day and bought it.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that bursts into frizz at the least sign of humidity.</li>
            <li> I did some research on the ingredients and discovered that it&#x27;s almost entirely silicone and paraben (wax) which coats the hair shaft making it impossible for any beneficial ingredients to penetrate the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> but it is getting very hard to find.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; was extremely thin.</li>
            <li> It was thinner than normal conditioner and it smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> And it builds up something awful.  </li>

            <li> I really like this conditioner but it is getting very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have long, dry/damaged, frizzy and naturally curly hair, and this did not help. I was looking for something that would deep condition, detangle and help remove frizz and this did none of that. I used to use the pantene curly hair shampoo, conditioner, and gel but I stopped because it just didn&#x27;t help me. The only reason I actually have this is because my mom saw it on sale and thought I still used pantene. I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS FULL JAR!!!!  I DON&#x27;T WANT IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;And even though the pantene shampoo and such didn&#x27;t help me the way I wanted it to, at least there was still a little bit of improvement from what my hair was before. (Not enough for me to be willing to keep dealing with it though.) I was completely unimpressed with this product. It was thinner than normal conditioner and it smelled terrible. I didn&#x27;t leave it in overnight or anything, I actually just used it in the shower for probably 5 minutes and saw no results. Why would I even bother to leave it in overnight if I could just open the jar and tell it was not good?</li>
            <li> now I have this on whatever they call the program that just ships and bills on a regular basis.  I first received a group of the Pantene products for curly hair to use and review.  This was through a magazine that I inherited from my ex DIL.  I&#x27;m afraid I didn&#x27;t rate the products very high.  I used another product for deep conditioning and ran out so tried this again.  This time I was impressed and bought a refill locally.  For some reason I can&#x27;t get this locally anymore so Amazon to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 62  so have used lots and lot of products through the years either to promote my curls or to get rid of them.  This I now use every time I shampoo in place of a regular conditioner.  I also use a serum and a gel to style my curls after washing.  Without changing the serum and gel, this conditioner really fights the dreaded &amp;#34;FRIZZIES&amp;#34;.  I have given up the fight with the curls but I still fight frizz and this REALLY helps.  Highly recommend and thank Pantene for making this.  Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Not available at any store we frequent. This is exactly what my wife likes and has used for years. Nice to see its availability through Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It makes my hair more manageable. It soft and I can detangle with ease. I would buyt this product again.</li>
            <li> I use this weekly on my three girls&#x27; hair. Each of their hair is very different from texture to thickness but it works great on all of them! It leaves their hair shiny and soft. My youngest has naturally wavy hair and this keeps it manageable! My oldest has thick thick thick hair with a slight wave and it&#x27;s the ONLY product that I can use that will actually get through her hair. My middle child has thin and straight hair and while this is meant for \\&quot;curly\\&quot; hair, it works wonders on her straight hair. It keeps it from being limp and lifeless. Love this stuff! And by far the best at detangeling hair there is on the block!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always held Pantene as being one of the premier mass market products.  But with my curly, frizzy long hair, almost none of the products, even professional lines, do the job.  I saw this cool square jar on the shelf on sale for $4.99 at the grocery store on a very bad hair day and bought it.  I used it the next day and was amazed.   It took the frizz out of my hair and made my hair feel so soft and nice.  It&#x27;s my expectations that with further applications it will only improve my hair.  One thing, however, is that if your hair is really damaged and/or dry/frizzy, then leave it on for 30 min to 1 hour using a shower cap or plastic bag for really deep treatment.  It rivals any other moisturizing treatment that costs up to $50.  A great product at a fantastic price!  Try it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, thick, naturally curly hair. A good, deep conditioning treatment is usually a once a week thing to keep my hair from looking like straw. This product is thinner than most deep moisture treatments. In fact, it is thinner than my regular, daily conditioner. That being said a little bit of the product goes a long way and the scent is light, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked...&lt;br /&gt;-The scent is very appealing&lt;br /&gt;-Good coverage with a small amount of product&lt;br /&gt;-Effective to help de-tangle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like...&lt;br /&gt;-I prefer a richer texture for moisturizing treatments&lt;br /&gt;-The results were good but pretty much the same as my daily conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this product would be the most effective for someone with thinner hair but mine is so thick that I feel I need a product with a thicker texture.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; seemed like nothing more than regular conditioner in a fancy block container with an appealing label. This \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; was extremely thin. I though it was going to be richer, creamier, and thicker. It was not at all.  And I actually slept with my hair saturated in this stuff. I rinsed it out in the morning, &amp; I felt no difference in the texture of my hair. And if there was a difference, it was not noticeable to the naked eye.  Pantene conditioners are pretty good, but next time I will just stick to purchasing my conditioner in one of those longer slimmer bottles....its cheaper. :)</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that bursts into frizz at the least sign of humidity. I comb in a dab of this when my hair is wet and leave it in. It leaves my hair soft and curls are smooth.</li>
            <li> I have type 3c/4a kinky curly hair and this deep conditioner is amazing! It makes my hair so soft. It&#x27;s also great for detangling as well. My curls feel instantly moisturized and a little goes a LONG way. I will uses this for as long as Pantene makes it.</li>
            <li> This mask worked for me...at first.  My hair was soft, silky and shiny.  Then about a month later, my hair was less responsive to my styling efforts and it was dry and frizzy.  So I used a clarifying shampoo and the difference was like night and day.  So I went back to my regular regimen, which of course included this mask.  And the same thing happened.  So I switched shampoos.  But this made no difference at all.  So I decided that this mask must be the problem.  I did some research on the ingredients and discovered that it&#x27;s almost entirely silicone and paraben (wax) which coats the hair shaft making it impossible for any beneficial ingredients to penetrate the cuticle.  And it builds up something awful.  So I pitched it and decided to try Shea Moisture Manuka Honey mask, which was recommended to me on a hair forum, instead.  What a difference!!  My hair was hydrated, soft, supply and really shiny.  And it doesn&#x27;t build up or weigh my hair down at all.  And the results have gotten better and better each time I&#x27;ve used it.  I use it two ways:  for 45 minutes with a heat cap or for 10 minutes in the shower.  Either way, I get gorgeous results. My hair is dry, color treated, somewhat wavy and prone to frizz.  With SM I have no dryness and my hair has zero frizz.  And SM is color safe as well as cruelty free.  What more can you ask for?  SM contains no silicone, paraben, phlalates and is all natural.  And SM shampoos are sulfate free too and are therefore color safe.  And the regular SM conditioner is excellent as well.  SM is available at Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Target, Ulta and Sally Beauty Supply and although it&#x27;s pricier than typical drugstore products, it&#x27;s well worth it.  I am ecstatic that I&#x27;ve found such a wonderful hair product brand.  It&#x27;s definitely better than Pantene.  And there&#x27;s a SM formula for every hair issue.  I personally like the Manuka Honey shampoo/conditioner/mask/serum (only at Target) but I also use the Tahitian Noni and the Raw Shea Butter formulas and like them as well.  If you want true conditioning, not a heavy coating, then give SM masks a try.  They are thick and rich and a little is all that&#x27;s needed.  I definitely get better results with SM products than I ever did with Pantene.  Maybe they will work for you too.  I certainly don&#x27;t recommend this Pantene mask.formulas and like them as well.

            <li> My hair was losing it&#x27;s curl and I was told by a hair dresser that maybe it&#x27;s my medicine. I have Multiple Sclerosis and take a shot everyday, and of course I can&#x27;t give that up. I mean really it was looking dull and just limp. Funny I alway&#x27;s wanted straight hair, and then it started to happen. Wow I wanted my curls back ,I&#x27;ll use a Chi straightner for that temporary straight hair fix(lol). Well I was at walmart and bought the Pantene Deep moisturizing for curly hair.I actually went to You tube and watch the reviews, followed the advice. So I tried it and have to say it totally worked for me. One thing though I washed my hair the day before and so I decided to just use the product without shamponing. I was told not to wash my hair everyday, because it&#x27;s not good for the curls. I left it in for ten minutes and it brought life back to my natural curls. I just wished I could use it more than once a week. .</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Curl 2-Minute Conditioning Masque 10.2 Fl Oz (Pack of 3) ..&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff .it make the hair it look great .</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, curly hair.  She will only use this product. It leaves her hair curly and frizz free. It is no longer available in our local stores, so I order three packs for her convenience.</li>
            <li> Great Deep Conditioner. Does the job. Only wish it had more natural ingredients</li>
            <li> After my local Target stopped stocking this product, I turned to Amazon.  My hair is never as soft as after using this product.  I like it so well, I use it as my regular conditioner instead of a hair mask.</li>
            <li> I swim every day and my curly hair gets all dried out and frizzy.  I now use this product every day and it really helps to maintain moisture and to keep my curls well formed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my very dry hair for several months and my hair still looks like straw, even though I use it every time I wash my hair (about 2 times a week.)  I also use Pantene shampoo so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m drying my hair out with dish detergent or anything.  The only good it does is make my hair easier to comb out when wet.  I&#x27;m going to find another product.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.  Makes my hair so soft.  African American Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recomend this product.  I wish I could invest in this product.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy and curly hair. Instead of using this once in awhile, I just use it as my normal conditioner. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found in this price range!</li>
            <li> I have gone from one product series to the next over my years battling it out with my naturally curly hair. It seems like over time my hair grows a resistance to the product and I have to go back out and find something else new.  This product has stood the test of time. I sometimes leave a small trace amount of the product in my hair and my curls just love me.&lt;br /&gt; They have stopped selling this at my local grocer and walmart which is absolutely HEART BREAKING. Amazon has come to my rescue once again and kept a product accessible that I am in need of. I also get them in a 3 pack so it lasts a long time. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue selling, I would be devastated!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with long natural (un-permed) hair and the whole curly hair series works great for me (and it smells great too). The deep conditioner is even thicker and creamier than the regular curly hair conditioner.  It really coats my hair and no matter how tangled it is, I can comb through it pretty easily.  My hair is soft when I rinse it out. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works better.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a curly haired natural and needed a good moisturizing deep conditioner. I found it in this product! It leaves my hair feeling hydrated and smelling good. I bought the 3-pack just in case I really loved it and if it didn&#x27;t work, I would have given the others away. Such a good decision because I&#x27;m on the second one already. I wish there was a gigantic container lol</li>
            <li> The Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Series 2-Minute Deep Conditioner is a wonderful and effective product.  I have curly hair that tends to dry out.  Using this product every time or every other time I shampoo leaves my hair shiny, bouncy and healthy.  People at work have noticed.  Even my kids and husband have noticed!  It is also much cheaper than other deep conditioners that you need to leave in your hair for much longer periods of time.  Two minutes.  That&#x27;s it!  The results will amaze you.</li>
