            <li>This is the perfect toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and it was a great deal for a two-pack!  </li>
            <li>have had good results with improved gums also!  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush for the price</li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning and fits in your hand well.  </li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li>Really nice set of two that work quite well.</li>
            <li>Nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This one is effective and not overly jittery.</li>
            <li>Very good thanks execelent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this sonic technology, feels much better than the rotating brushes.</li>
            <li>Easy to brush....</li>
            <li>It is sonic yet light.</li>
            <li>With a gel toothpaste I literally get squeaky clean teeth.</li>
            <li>POWERFUL vibrating head.</li>
            <li>Fits in a standard travel toothbrush holder, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Motor provides just the right amount of vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean any better than a standard toothbrush, the vibrating bristles do nothing extra to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>For a little sonic toothbrush, this one is really quite good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of positive reports about this toothbrush so when I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li>but I tried it out and it cleaned my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrushes, otherwise, work real well.  </li>
            <li>I received them quickly and I will definitely re-order from this seller again!</li>
            <li>The bristles form a soft V so that those of us who have wisdom teeth can clean well way back at the gum line.  </li>
            <li>The battery compartment, unlike on some of the other brands, comes off and on easily for replacement.</li>
            <li>I found the oral B popular sonic toothbrush to be way too messy and made the bones of my skull and jaw vibrate to the extreme.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and quiet!</li>
            <li>If you just hold the brush and guide it, you will avoid brushing too hard and hurting your gums, but the back and forth power action gets your teeth clean</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really nice set of two that work quite well.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the price</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean any better than a standard toothbrush, the vibrating bristles do nothing extra to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> I think this is bulkier and me and my teenager both don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> And the 2-pack is a great price! POWERFUL vibrating head. Fits in a standard travel toothbrush holder, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  Would by again</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my dad and he likes it a lot. Easy to brush....he told me ☺️</li>
            <li> When I got these brushes I just had to try it out immediately.  I turned it on and was kinda disappointed in how weak it sounded but I tried it out and it cleaned my teeth very well.  All in all I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I thought these had moving parts but it just vibrates.  The toothbrushes, otherwise, work real well.  Shipment was just like it was posted.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite powered toothbrush.  It does a good job cleaning and fits in your hand well.  Not too big.  Motor provides just the right amount of vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go to toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush.  With a gel toothpaste I literally get squeaky clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect toothbrush. It is sonic yet light. The bristles form a soft V so that those of us who have wisdom teeth can clean well way back at the gum line.  The battery compartment, unlike on some of the other brands, comes off and on easily for replacement. And the price is right. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Replaceable battery, makes my teeth feel like i&#x27;ve had a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I love this sonic technology, feels much better than the rotating brushes.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes!  Soft bristles and quiet!</li>
            <li> not enough movement to take care of my plaque problem</li>
            <li> I have been using these toothbrushes for years.  If you just hold the brush and guide it, you will avoid brushing too hard and hurting your gums, but the back and forth power action gets your teeth clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of positive reports about this toothbrush so when I found it on Amazon I ordered it and it was a great deal for a two-pack!  My teeth were beginning to become sensitive lately and these brushes react differently than a manual brush and people have had good results with improved gums also!  I received them quickly and I will definitely re-order from this seller again!</li>
            <li> For a little sonic toothbrush, this one is really quite good. I found the oral B popular sonic toothbrush to be way too messy and made the bones of my skull and jaw vibrate to the extreme. This one is effective and not overly jittery.</li>
