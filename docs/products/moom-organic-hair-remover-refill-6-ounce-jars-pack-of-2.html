            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>A think layer will suffice and the fact that it is sugar based means that it washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best wax I have ever used.</li>

            <li>use my tips you will LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The best part, if you make a mistake you simply wipe off with a moist towel...</li>
            <li>I love the fact that 1) not tested on animals 2)</li>
            <li>I love this and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>, etc.)and found this to be a more cost-effective method that I could do myself.</li>
            <li>I love that it is microwavable, and after one use I can put it away neatly.</li>
            <li>I have been frequenting beaty saloons in Italy for more than 20 years, then I relocated in USA</li>
            <li>I was able to use this myself on even the most stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Moom for many years and have saved hundreds in trips to the beauty salon.  </li>
            <li>I love this,</li>
            <li>Granted, at home waxing isn&#x27;t for beginners, but if you are comfortable taking care of your business, you will be pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Good product that is gentle on the skin and fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It also washes off really easily from skin when done...</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and wash off as well.</li>
            <li>Love Moom!It works really well and cleans so easily!</li>
            <li>Enjoy your super smooth skin!</li>
            <li>and I primarily use this for under-arm waxing.</li>
            <li>Works great on the hair thats not too short.</li>
            <li>I found the starter pack in a local store and thought it was a great price for me to try it out.</li>
            <li>Just pop it in the microwave a few seconds and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>It is good being all naturally organic</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product, it has saved me money since I started using it, and it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Effective, easy, natural.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that you really don&#x27;t have to heat this up</li>
            <li>Con:  you have to watch how much moisture gets into the jar--when the top layer of the Moom in the jar appears lighter in color--that is moisture and</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who wants a product that works well and has a very easy clean up (since its natural and sugar-based its water soluble and super easy to clean up).</li>
            <li>and it works quickly.  </li>
            <li>you can use it warm or at room temp 3)hair regrowth is barely visible after two sessions</li>
            <li>It heats up well, goes on smooth and does a pretty efficacious job of stripping hair.</li>
            <li>The wax, once heated is very malleable and also easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Does not work very well on fine hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic, has minimal ingredients, and is easy to use and clean up.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Only kind of wax I&#x27;ve ever used ..</li>
            <li>The product works very well and is environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>The sugar washes right off in warm water, then just hang them to dry.</li>
            <li>And the other awesome part is, any wax/sticky remnants come right off with a wet towel, or if you spill any on the counter</li>
            <li>I run through it pretty quickly on large areas, but it still beats the price of paying someone to do it!</li>
            <li>Once you are done soak the used strips and your knife in hot water for a bit</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but can be thick</li>
            <li>I also recommend the starter kit, which comes with fabric strips and sticks, if you are taking your first go at it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, its the only thing i use.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t get it too hot or you will ruin the consistency as it is sugar.  </li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Only heat it up until its like smooth honey, it should not be super hot, HOT SUGAR+ SKIN &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I used to DREAD waxing with those regular waxes that seem to be made of super glue and did not ever come off with a clean finish.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone who is looking to do it on their own and looking to keep their waxing costs down.</li>
            <li>you should work in small areas until you are more comfortable with the task.</li>
            <li>Have to eat it very often.</li>
            <li>I have saved so much $$ and so much time.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really compare to anything else but does work.</li>
            <li>so you have to use a thin layer and be sure to have a clean, fresh face because your natural oils can keep the product from working to its full potential.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair (I do have to use a tweezer for some strays that I missed), it is the nicest, most natural way to remove hair other than plucking.    </li>
            <li>We have very sensitive skin, and it does not irritate the skin (besides the discomfort of pulling out hair).</li>
            <li>The refill pack was exactly what I needed, since I didn&#x27;t need to replace all the muslin strips and buy new wooden sticks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of at-home waxes, and this is by far the least painful, most environmentally responsible, cleanest, and most effective.</li>
            <li>You get the same smooth look with less skin damage and it is much cheaper than a sugar treatment at a spa.  </li>
            <li>when I have my legs done professionally, I manage at home.</li>
            <li>I use this for my bikini area and get a professional result every time.  </li>
            <li>and I use it for my face, all the sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>The trick to it is to make sure that you do not apply it too thick.  </li>
            <li>I still love it after repeated usage over the last few years and that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li>It gets hard very quick.</li>
            <li>Also remember to use a normal flat edged butter knife for application.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t want to try to go back to making this myself because (for some reason) this type of wax is less and less available.  </li>
            <li>I just cut up an old 100% cotton white shirt</li>
            <li>It does take a little while to get used to doing it yourself and some trial and error to find the temperature and speed that is right for you.</li>
            <li>It comes off easy, irritates my skin a lot less than previous products used</li>
            <li>No fuss, no mess - still the same amount of pain, but no big deal if you wax.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is organic, and I find that my skin is less sensitive to this stuff, I get less redness, and I also don&#x27;t &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; burn myself (like at nail salons, and such) I have also found that you don&#x27;t have to buy their special wax strips.</li>
            <li>Its easy to heat and is a lot less messy than wax.</li>

            <li> Its easy to heat and is a lot less messy than wax.</li>
            <li> Definitely test it on a less sensitive spot (like your arm) before actually waxing though; it is hotter than it looks sometimes.</li>

            <li> Have tried a bunch of hot and cold wax hair removers and so far this is my favourite.</li>
            <li> I think if it came in a bigger jar I would prefer buying that, since I like the product, but they only seem t make the small size jars</li>
            <li> I would suggest heating it slightly before using and purchase some wax strips and sticks from a local beauty supply (i.e. Sally Beauty Supply)</li>
            <li> It comes in a glass jar which you can put in your toaster oven or regular oven (we got rid of our microwave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to that sticky gooey messy Nair wax!</li>
            <li> Waxing can get pretty expensive so except for summer,</li>
            <li> Another helpful tip, use the little moom in the jar for delicate areas, I thought there was no difference between this and regular moom</li>

            <li> When people hear that I &#x27;wax&#x27; my legs, they are usually amazed that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very painful, but I attribute that to the sugar compound that Moom has created rather than the common wax compound others use which attaches to both your skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> I was turned on to this product by a friend and was skeptical until she used it on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> (sorry TMI!)</li>
            <li> BAD.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad when using because it&#x27;s not made with chemicals</li>
            <li> It is still painful like waxing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love Moom!It works really well and cleans so easily! And, it is a great price for the amount that you get!</li>
            <li> This is the best wax- it is THE BEST!! I am Indian and I have coarse hair and lots of it and I primarily use this for under-arm waxing. The three tricks to using this is&lt;br /&gt;1) it needs to be heated to just a step before too runny&lt;br /&gt;2) and you cannot mix any moisture with it, so if your leg/under arm area starts getting even a teeny bit sweaty (sorry TMI!) dab a bit of baby powder and continue&lt;br /&gt;3) don&#x27;t use the wooden applicator that comes with it, use a short butter knife (obviously with non-serrated edges).&lt;br /&gt;(4) Once you are done soak the used strips and your knife in hot water for a bit (I let it soak in sink) and then wash away and hang to dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes all my hair and I have tried literally every wax product you can find at sallys/ulta/sephora. And the other awesome part is, any wax/sticky remnants come right off with a wet towel, or if you spill any on the counter it comes off with water!! I used to DREAD waxing with those regular waxes that seem to be made of super glue and did not ever come off with a clean finish. use my tips you will LOVE MOOM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a couple of years now, still the best product out there. Another helpful tip, use the little moom in the jar for delicate areas, I thought there was no difference between this and regular moom but this formulation is meant for finer hair. Also remember to use a normal flat edged butter knife for application. This is the BEST product out there for waxing. I still love it after repeated usage over the last few years and that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that you really don&#x27;t have to heat this up and it works quickly.  Although it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair (I do have to use a tweezer for some strays that I missed), it is the nicest, most natural way to remove hair other than plucking.    Con:  you have to watch how much moisture gets into the jar--when the top layer of the Moom in the jar appears lighter in color--that is moisture and this needs to be removed because this wetter product will not remove hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of at-home waxes, and this is by far the least painful, most environmentally responsible, cleanest, and most effective. Granted, at home waxing isn&#x27;t for beginners, but if you are comfortable taking care of your business, you will be pleased with this. The refill pack was exactly what I needed, since I didn&#x27;t need to replace all the muslin strips and buy new wooden sticks. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for hair removal on arms and legs.  Does a great job.  Have reordered this at least once.  We have very sensitive skin, and it does not irritate the skin (besides the discomfort of pulling out hair).</li>
            <li> This hair remover is amazing!  I had never &#x27;waxed&#x27; my legs before and after a great deal of research, settled on using Moom which uses the sugar base instead.  When people hear that I &#x27;wax&#x27; my legs, they are usually amazed that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very painful, but I attribute that to the sugar compound that Moom has created rather than the common wax compound others use which attaches to both your skin and hair.  It takes a couple times to become good at removing all the hair, but stick with it and you should keep coming back to it - just as I did!</li>
            <li> It is still painful like waxing. It gets hard very quick. Have to eat it very often. It becomes as messy as wax. Not a big difference. Does not work with tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. Removes hair with such ease!! The best part, if you make a mistake you simply wipe off with a moist towel...NO MORE MESSES!! I love the fact that 1) not tested on animals 2) you can use it warm or at room temp 3)hair regrowth is barely visible after two sessions</li>
            <li> Good product that is gentle on the skin and fairly easy to use.  Have to follow up with tweezers but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Waxing can get pretty expensive so except for summer, when I have my legs done professionally, I manage at home. Have tried a bunch of hot and cold wax hair removers and so far this is my favourite. It heats up well, goes on smooth and does a pretty efficacious job of stripping hair. I think if it came in a bigger jar I would prefer buying that, since I like the product, but they only seem t make the small size jars</li>
            <li> I used the Moom to remove hair in my pubic area. Works great on the hair thats not too short. Just followed the instructions and worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Effective, easy, natural.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t stop making this!  I love this and have been using it for years.  I cannot find this anywhere else and I really don&#x27;t want to try to go back to making this myself because (for some reason) this type of wax is less and less available.  Especially organic and minimal ingredients.  If you know how to wax and have been doing it for years, I would definitely recommend this product.  It also washes off really easily from skin when done... no need for baby oil.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to this product by a friend and was skeptical until she used it on my eyebrows. It&#x27;s a great product and can be applied either warm or at room temperature. I have stubborn, dark hairs and have used various methods for my hair removal needs (creams, waxes, lasers, etc.)and found this to be a more cost-effective method that I could do myself. I would suggest heating it slightly before using and purchase some wax strips and sticks from a local beauty supply (i.e. Sally Beauty Supply) so you don&#x27;t contaminate and can apply it easier. This is a great product, but can be thick so you have to use a thin layer and be sure to have a clean, fresh face because your natural oils can keep the product from working to its full potential. I would suggest this to anyone who is looking to do it on their own and looking to keep their waxing costs down.</li>
            <li> I found the starter pack in a local store and thought it was a great price for me to try it out. Its awesome!!! I follow the instructions and get great results. Only heat it up until its like smooth honey, it should not be super hot, HOT SUGAR+ SKIN &#x3D; BAD. I used this on my legs, arms, and bikini. I will say that on coarser hair and around the bikini area (especially if you are going Brazilian) you should work in small areas until you are more comfortable with the task. Overall this is a great product, it has saved me money since I started using it, and it is super easy to use. I recommend this for anyone who wants a product that works well and has a very easy clean up (since its natural and sugar-based its water soluble and super easy to clean up). I also recommend the starter kit, which comes with fabric strips and sticks, if you are taking your first go at it. Enjoy your super smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I love that it is microwavable, and after one use I can put it away neatly. The wax, once heated is very malleable and also easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I will never pay to get waxed again!  This stuff is organic, and I find that my skin is less sensitive to this stuff, I get less redness, and I also don&#x27;t &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; burn myself (like at nail salons, and such) I have also found that you don&#x27;t have to buy their special wax strips. I just cut up an old 100% cotton white shirt and I have been using that for around 6mo + now. I have saved so much $$ and so much time. I love this product and would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Moom is a great alternative to waxing.  You get the same smooth look with less skin damage and it is much cheaper than a sugar treatment at a spa.  It does take a little while to get used to doing it yourself and some trial and error to find the temperature and speed that is right for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It heats up well and does a great job.  The price on line is much better than in stores and the process is definately less expensive than going to a salon.  I use only for my bikini area.  I haven&#x27;t been able to perfect the brow area yet.</li>
            <li> I love that it is organic, has minimal ingredients, and is easy to use and clean up.  Definitely recommend.  I have been using this for years.</li>
            <li> It is good being all naturally organic but I feel it doesn&#x27;t do the job right. I have to go over every area a couple of times. No irritation however which is great.</li>
            <li> I use this for my bikini area and get a professional result every time.  No fuss, no mess - still the same amount of pain, but no big deal if you wax.  Great product, ladies!</li>
            <li> Perfect as always. Thank you</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It works very well but I think the best part is that it washes off with water. No more ruining clothes or carpets. You can reuse the strips again and again! It comes in a glass jar which you can put in your toaster oven or regular oven (we got rid of our microwave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to that sticky gooey messy Nair wax!</li>
            <li> great stuff.. love how easy it is to work with and CLEAN UP is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have been frequenting beaty saloons in Italy for more than 20 years, then I relocated in USA and I had the problem of a good waxing. Finally I decided to do it by myself and this product made it. I am very pleased with this hair remover; it is very gentle and effective. My hair is very soft and never treated with anything but wax; I am not sure it will work on \\&quot;hard\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Moom for years and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  The trick to it is to make sure that you do not apply it too thick.  A think layer will suffice and the fact that it is sugar based means that it washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this myself on even the most stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> Hair takes several weeks to grow back, and it&#x27;s easier to remove and thinner each time! Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my hair is coarse, so I need to use a lot of Moom at the root at a time. I run through it pretty quickly on large areas, but it still beats the price of paying someone to do it!</li>
            <li> I have used tons of waxing agents and hair removal products.  This is my favorite.  It comes off easy, irritates my skin a lot less than previous products used and I love the reusable strips and that it washes off so easily with warm water.  It&#x27;s lasts a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this products for two years and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, its the only thing i use. Works great! Its easy to heat and is a lot less messy than wax. Easy to apply and wash off as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great its just that I only received one jar. When I went to e-mail the company about the mishap using my amazon e-mail, I never heard back. Then when using my personal e-mail account, I still did not got a reply. Finally I called them and nobody would answer. Its been 3 months since, so I would not recommend doing business with them ever again.</li>
            <li> Awesome price. Love this product.  It&#x27;s the best . Doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad when using because it&#x27;s not made with chemicals</li>
            <li> Love this wax! I started using it because I couldn&#x27;t find any of a kind I used to use, and I&#x27;m glad I found this! This is only the jars of wax; I had to buy popsicle sticks and fabric strips separately. Just pop it in the microwave a few seconds and it works perfectly! I&#x27;ve gone through like 4 jars of this stuff (which takes a long time). Have not been disappointed with it and I love that it&#x27;s organic. I have sensitive skin, and I think the tea tree oil helps lessen irritation a little. Definitely test it on a less sensitive spot (like your arm) before actually waxing though; it is hotter than it looks sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moom for many years and have saved hundreds in trips to the beauty salon.  The product works very well and is environmentally friendly.  The cloth strips that come with the kit last forever.  I&#x27;ve had mine almost 20 years!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Only kind of wax I&#x27;ve ever used .. so can&#x27;t really compare to anything else but does work. Does not work very well on fine hair.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t get it too hot or you will ruin the consistency as it is sugar.  Think candy making... if you overcook, then it will crystallize.  I love this, my daughters and I all use it for the bikini line and I use it for my face, all the sensitive areas.  It really works!  Also, I bought the linen strip because you save money and resources by reusing.  The sugar washes right off in warm water, then just hang them to dry.</li>
