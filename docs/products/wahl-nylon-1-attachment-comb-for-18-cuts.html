            <li>This one came in handy.</li>
            <li>So I use 1/8\\&quot; attachment comb in most time.  </li>
            <li>I have always cut my son&#x27;s hair at home because most barbershops just take too of my valuable time.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped fast and was in great shape when I received it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It seems to be better quality than the one that came with the Wahl clipper set I bought.</li>
            <li>I love Wahl products.</li>
            <li>Recommend for a very clean close cut</li>
            <li>It fits to the clipper just right and the attachment is wonderful if you looking for a nice low cut style for your head.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair better with this Wahl guard way better than the cheap one that you get at Sallys.  </li>
            <li>They seem to fit a bit more snug than the ones that came with my trimmer, which isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>Fits and works great on my 30 yr old trimmer.</li>
            <li>Not only does it fit perfectly, but it&#x27;s higher quality than the original 1/8 guard that came with my clippers!</li>
            <li>The length works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Great attachment for around the ears and keeping the short hair spots easy to cut evenly</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this replacement as an individual purchase</li>
            <li>I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit my model of Wahl, but it did just fine and is exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re original Wahl attachments, not clones.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, works fine.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this, I was using the original attachment that came with my clipper.  </li>
            <li>and i love it, very durable compared to the original one.</li>
            <li>so I did not have to buy a full set just to get it.</li>
            <li>Overall, good buy.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, too.</li>
            <li>this item is the exact fit to my clipper machine</li>
            <li>In fact, it fits more securely than the original (which recently broke) that came with with the clipper.</li>
            <li>He looks more professional.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly &amp; does exactly what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It fit on a very old Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li>This little attachment is responsible for giving me the best haircut I&#x27;ve ever had in my entire life.</li>
            <li>I like it the first time I use it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>An exact replacement.</li>
            <li>These were thicker and more solid than the attachments that came with the clippers.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple of years now pretty regularly and it has held up fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how smooth the new replacement attachment is at the the comb ends.  </li>
            <li>Decent comb, fits my Wahl 5-star series balding clippers, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Well as much as there is to write about a Attachment.</li>
            <li>This as absolutely needed with my sons close summer haircuts.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I like the look the #1 guide gives as opposed to just a straight shave.  </li>
            <li>Not much else to say :)</li>
            <li>He was very helpful when needed</li>
            <li>This replacement doesn&#x27;t fit the clippers well and rattles constantly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement for the previous Wahl attachment that was broken.</li>
            <li>It works... not much else to say about a simple clipper attachment :)</li>
            <li>I bought this because the picture was of the older soft plastic guard.</li>
            <li>The original attachment was sharp at the comb ends and always scratched my skin.  </li>
            <li>My attachment is still going strong after a few months of use but that also goes with care and maintenance of your attachment.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter in the functionality of the comb, but it vibrates loudly as a result.</li>
            <li>This is the smallest, thinest attachment so naturally it breaks the easiest.</li>
            <li>Next time, going to buy a whole clipper set with the guards...</li>
            <li>If you frequently use 1/8\\&quot; attachment comb, you&#x27;ll need an additional comb soon or later.  </li>
            <li>A couple of teeth on my 35 year old depth gage finally broke, so I got this one to replace it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an essential tool that I use every week and only after about 5 years did I have to order a new one because the plastic broke.</li>
            <li>Problem is that 1/8\\&quot; attachment comb is so thin and easy to break.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The guard I received is the newer style that is harder and thicker</li>
            <li> not cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;It attaches to my cutter properly and gets the job done.</li>

            <li> after a few years it became loose</li>
            <li> I took a shot in the dark and bought this for my set of Conair clippers.</li>
            <li> I recommend this attachment for anyone wishing to achieve a dark, low-cut look.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Fits my razor, no more puling on beard , will order again beofre its when its time to replace it</li>
            <li> As a result, I don&#x27;t believe that it is cutting properly either.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll, broken teeth make for a gap in the cut...</li>
            <li> But no problems and hasn&#x27;t broken at all.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> i was very disappointed</li>

            <li> Great attachment for around the ears and keeping the short hair spots easy to cut evenly</li>
            <li> Attachment fit perfectly on my Wahl hair cut machine.  no complaints , fuss, no muss.  Now I&#x27;m rambling to fill in words.</li>
            <li> I always keep my hair short. So I use 1/8\\&quot; attachment comb in most time.  Problem is that 1/8\\&quot; attachment comb is so thin and easy to break.  If you frequently use 1/8\\&quot; attachment comb, you&#x27;ll need an additional comb soon or later.  This product is good addtion for good price.</li>
            <li> Well as much as there is to write about a Attachment. It was great and the seller shipped it very quickly!</li>
            <li> works great and a good price</li>
            <li> I needed a couple of replacement 1/8&amp;#34; attachments for my Wahl trimmer. Wahl had them but they were more expensive and they had a shipping and handling charge. These were a lot cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re original Wahl attachments, not clones. They seem to fit a bit more snug than the ones that came with my trimmer, which isn&#x27;t a problem. They do the job and that&#x27;s what matters. Shipping was quick, too.</li>
            <li> My set of clippers came with a 1/16th and 1/4th guard.  This as absolutely needed with my sons close summer haircuts. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have always cut my son&#x27;s hair at home because most barbershops just take too of my valuable time. However, I couldn&#x27;t ever find the Wahl Nylon #1 Attachment Comb in any of my local barber/beauty supply shops. It arrived quickly &amp; does exactly what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair better with this Wahl guard way better than the cheap one that you get at Sallys.  The product was shipped fast and was in great shape when I received it.</li>
            <li> This replacement fits just a little loosely, causing a vibration.  It doesn&#x27;t matter in the functionality of the comb, but it vibrates loudly as a result.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I like it the first time I use it. The length works just fine for me. I love it!</li>

            <li> It works very well. It fits to the clipper just right and the attachment is wonderful if you looking for a nice low cut style for your head.</li>
            <li> This comb fits perfectly on my WHAL machine. Its really an amazing product and it works perfectly. I think this comb fits all the Whal groomers.</li>
            <li> This Attachment Comb for the 1/8th cuts is great. Granted, it isn&#x27;t a slide on, but it is does the job for clip ons. My attachment is still going strong after a few months of use but that also goes with care and maintenance of your attachment.</li>
            <li> This attachment works great. It fit on a very old Wahl clipper. I like the look the #1 guide gives as opposed to just a straight shave.  I have been using it for a couple of years now pretty regularly and it has held up fine.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly with my wahle clipper i&#x27;m a very satisfied customer. i thing i might order another one in the future.</li>
            <li> very nice, they do the job..........</li>
            <li> Perfectly fits my Precision Wahl clipper (model NAC).  In fact, it fits more securely than the original (which recently broke) that came with with the clipper.</li>
            <li> This replacement attachment comb is made by Wahl and it fits the clipper perfectly. It is a well made item.</li>

            <li> I took a shot in the dark and bought this for my set of Conair clippers. Not only does it fit perfectly, but it&#x27;s higher quality than the original 1/8 guard that came with my clippers! This is my third #1 guard as they&#x27;ve previously broke on me. Even though this one seems like it&#x27;s going to last, I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another.</li>
            <li> It works... not much else to say about a simple clipper attachment :)</li>
            <li> It works like one would expect it would.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Always a good thing.  :)</li>
            <li> Just received this and cut my hair with it. It seems to be better quality than the one that came with the Wahl clipper set I bought. It is made in USA and looks solid.</li>
            <li> this item is the exact fit to my clipper machine and i love it, very durable compared to the original one.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for the previous Wahl attachment that was broken. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Handy tool for. Those of us who cut our own and G.B.s hair. I ordered two only got one. Waiting!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for the one I managed to drop and break. Perfect!</li>
            <li> One of the teeth broke on my red 1/8 clipper guard. This one came in handy. I love Wahl products.</li>
            <li> An exact replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the picture was of the older soft plastic guard. The guard I received is the newer style that is harder and thicker and I don&#x27;t like working with them.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of construction, not cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;It attaches to my cutter properly and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is the smallest, thinest attachment so naturally it breaks the easiest. I was happy to find this replacement as an individual purchase so I did not have to buy a full set just to get it.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, works fine. I recommend this attachment for anyone wishing to achieve a dark, low-cut look. Overall, good buy.</li>
            <li> Fits on my Wahl and has been keeping up ever sense. It is not the same color like the one that came with my kit, so sometimes I forget which one is the shortest. I almost got it done. But no problems and hasn&#x27;t broken at all.</li>
            <li> Fits and works great.  Not much else to say :)</li>
            <li> He was very helpful when needed</li>
            <li> the item i received is not as the image shown. i was very disappointed and i cannot afford to return this item</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this, I was using the original attachment that came with my clipper.  The original attachment was sharp at the comb ends and always scratched my skin.  after a few years it became loose so I needed to get this replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how smooth the new replacement attachment is at the the comb ends.  It definitely is more comfortable to use and I am very happy I purchased this attachment.  Makes me wish I had ordered this long long ago.</li>
            <li> This replacement doesn&#x27;t fit the clippers well and rattles constantly.  As a result, I don&#x27;t believe that it is cutting properly either. Definitely not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> i cut my hair with this attached.. way better than going to the barber every month, this is really good!</li>
            <li> Lost mine, but this should work as a replacement.  Too expensive for what it is.  Next time, going to buy a whole clipper set with the guards...</li>
            <li> Happy with this.  These were thicker and more solid than the attachments that came with the clippers.  Sometimes they can be buzzy, but and repositioning a bit, that goes away.</li>
            <li> Decent comb, fits my Wahl 5-star series balding clippers, exactly as described. For the price I don&#x27;t know how anyone could complain. Its just a replacement comb, it dosent need to fancy.</li>
            <li> Fits my shaver and I can cut my husbands hair. He cuts his beard with the shaver too. He looks more professional.</li>
