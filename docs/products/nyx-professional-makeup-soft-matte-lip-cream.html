            <li>I loved it!!</li>
            <li>Great color.</li>
            <li>It stays on quite a while, and it does have a really gorgeous matte finish.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is a skin tone out there that this would look nice with</li>
            <li>but I love this gloss in any color</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LIP STICK</li>
            <li>I love the color and the finish.</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite lip shade.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s how most matte lipglosses are.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Usually I can&#x27;t find a color that suits me, but this one is great!</li>
            <li>Ok I received this pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Such a pretty color and smells so good</li>
            <li>Love this shade for its nude look, it&#x27;s natural with a tint of peach.</li>
            <li>I do want to buy the whole set.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and so soft on the lips!</li>
            <li>Not as dry as people are saying, matte lipstick and lip cream are supposed to be dry, just make sure you moisturize your lips ahead of time before putting this on.</li>
            <li>When I first got it I was skeptical and thought it was too light for my complexion</li>

            <li> When I first got it I was skeptical and thought it was too light for my complexion</li>
            <li> Also it does not wear very well, after about a half hour your lips look dry and cakey like you may have some server cotton mouth going on.</li>

            <li> shade was a little different than picture</li>
            <li> it was just how i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It becomes a little dry</li>
            <li> Color was NOT what I wanted or expected, it&#x27;s orange/peach/ pale?</li>
            <li> Has a fragrance of vanilla (which disappears once it has dried).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my everyday nude now</li>
            <li> , I could be wrong but hard to imagine.</li>

            <li> Liking it. Has a fragrance of vanilla (which disappears once it has dried). Easy to apply. It dries my lips a bit, but not much of a problem as I don&#x27;t wear it daily. (Though if it didn&#x27;t, maybe I would? I do want to buy the whole set. Gift for me?)</li>
            <li> this color is a perfect nude for medium skin tone ladies. the formula is not drying but has a hint of moisture.</li>
            <li> shade was a little different than picture but I love this gloss in any color</li>
            <li> Looooooved it a loooot!</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color and smells so good</li>
            <li> Looks Nothing like the color shown. It&#x27;s a peach color and I was looking for a nude shade. Too glossy as well.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  Check out her fashion blog at StyleDevotees.com</li>
            <li> Not as dry as people are saying, matte lipstick and lip cream are supposed to be dry, just make sure you moisturize your lips ahead of time before putting this on. It stays on quite a while, and it does have a really gorgeous matte finish. Love this shade for its nude look, it&#x27;s natural with a tint of peach.</li>
            <li> Great color. Smells yummy</li>

            <li> This is now my favorite lip shade. When I first got it I was skeptical and thought it was too light for my complexion but after I used it with the nyx lip liner in nutmeg I loved it!! It&#x27;s my everyday nude now and I&#x27;ll have to restock soon</li>
            <li> I love them! Very pigmented and so soft on the lips!</li>
            <li> it was just how i expected it to be. It becomes a little dry but that&#x27;s how most matte lipglosses are.</li>
            <li> Ok I received this pretty quickly and I thought it would be some what bigger it looks a sample. I line the color on my skin , you can see the matte buy it is water thin I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m suppose to put another nude color I before I use this though I was expecting not to</li>
