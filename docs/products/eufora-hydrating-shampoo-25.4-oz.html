            <li>Sure it cost more</li>
            <li>I saw this product in a salon for much more money.  </li>

            <li>I have fine hair that snarls easily and love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling soft and the smell is great.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it is very fine and naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a very fresh and clean smell.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but cleans your hair--doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li>You may pay a little more, but you use less because the quality of the product</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that I can use daily with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I use their Hydrating Shampoo, followed by a light towel dry and a small amount of the Daily Balancing Conditioner as a leave-in.  </li>

            <li> I like this shampoo. No itchy scalp and my hair needs little styling product and it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Eufora.</li>
            <li> I started using Eufora after a horrible salon experience. The hairdresser fried my hair, it was so severely damaged I thought I would have to cut it off. I found a new hair dresser , she recommended Eufora products and I&#x27;m never leaving this product. Sure it cost more but well work it !!!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  Leaves your hair feeling soft and the smell is great.  I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone who needs hydrating shampoo!</li>

            <li> I like this shampoo. It has a nice scent. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. It does seem a bit watery.</li>
            <li> I have been using shampoo&#x27;s for 55 years.  I have had 4 Keratin treatments over 2years and this is shampoo cleans and leaves my hair with no tangles or dryness.  I higly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, the scent is the best and it makes my hair,  shiney and full.</li>
            <li> The best product on the market!!!  I will never use any other brand  the conditioner is great to use as well</li>
            <li> If you want  great looking hair you can not find a better products than Eufora. You may pay a little more, but you use less because the quality of the product</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years - Great price and great product.  Bought this one for my friend.  She used some of mine one day and her hair did well with it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years. Really nice shampoo. Leaves hair clean, not over weighted with oils. Shinny and a soft light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love Eufora products!  I have excruciatingly dry hair.  On top of that, it is very fine and naturally curly.  Most hair care products result in my hair along the forehead breaking off and giving me a flapping unicorn spike.  Forget trying to get a comb or a pick to come through it unscathed!  Over the decades, I have found only a handful of products that didn&#x27;t cause my hair to break off.  (No, I don&#x27;t abuse my hair.  I just use a pick and let it air dry.)  Out of those, I have found ONE that my hair actually loves.  Yes, that&#x27;s right. . .  Eufora!  I use their Hydrating Shampoo, followed by a light towel dry and a small amount of the Daily Balancing Conditioner as a leave-in.  (Their volumizing shampoo is nice, too, and has a smell reminiscent of Juicy Fruit gum.  I stick with the hydrating formula, though, just to give my dry hair that extra bit of help.)  The combination leaves my hair soft, well managed, and not frizzy or straw-like, as so many have in the past.  Thank, you, Eufora!</li>
            <li> After decades of color treating my hair it is so damaged, this shampoo revitalized. You don&#x27;t need much for it to be effective. And by doing so it lasts a long time. My 10 oz bottle lasted 6 months.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  I swim 5 days a week and it&#x27;s great getting the chlorine out.</li>
