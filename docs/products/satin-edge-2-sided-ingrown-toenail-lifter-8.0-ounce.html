            <li>It can reach where most things can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>While I do use them both, I use this one way more.</li>
            <li>Thank you AMAZON.com for carrying this product!! :-)</li>
            <li>I guess i was expecting something more like a dental pick ...</li>
            <li>quality tool and cheap price so buy one !</li>
            <li>Make sure to soak your feet to make the nails a bit softer.  </li>

            <li>Also, this is a great seller, very prompt and accurate...</li>
            <li>I found that the end of the tool bent too easily to accomplish my task.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Other important tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would be happy to hear if anyone benefits from this posting!tart feeling total</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other important tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice tool, but thank goodness I have not had to give it too much use.</li>
            <li>Best to use after soaking or a long hot shower.</li>
            <li>I was able to get right to the problem with this tool.</li>
            <li>Very useful item.  </li>
            <li>Works great for getting under the toenail for cleaning, have to be careful you don&#x27;t hurt the skin, just go easy.</li>
            <li>For some really bizarre reason (and I STILL haven&#x27;t been able to find an explanation for this) trimming away more of my toenail increases the pain where the ingrown nail is located, even though it doesn&#x27;t really make a lick of sense exactly why this happens.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this, honestly.</li>
            <li>It also helps to clean out areas underneath the nail that I could not get to before.  </li>
            <li>After using this tool once, it illeviated the pressure and helped the nail to grow in a more positive position.</li>
            <li>I finally happened on a general practice doctor who gave me the THE BEST ADVICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seller is honest, dependable, reasonable and fast!</li>
            <li>Also good for pushing back cuticles.</li>
            <li>My toes have been much better, and the nail is growing straight out rather than in.</li>
            <li>Company was very quick with delivery, and the instrument is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I have finally been able to wear sandals after many years of hiding my feet because of my toes.</li>
            <li>This tool works pretty well and is cheaply priced.</li>
            <li>Great little gadget.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have this in my home for the future.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It is useful indeed.</li>
            <li>Scholl&#x27;s Ingrown Toenail Pain Reliever Kit &amp; after using that for 3 days my nail was soft enought that I could use this toenail lifter &amp; was able to loosen the nail up a bit before pulling it out.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>Was useful in taking care of my in-grown nails.  </li>
            <li>Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
            <li>I use a nail softener liquid for 4 or 5 days and then I can use this tool to lift the ingrown nail right out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using this the right way!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you get rid of an ingrown toenail your foot in general will feel better.</li>
            <li>You really must soak the toe in very warm water for 15-20 minutes to soften the nail and skin, in order to experience less discomfort when using this instrument.</li>
            <li>The lifter is perfect for pushing little cotton rolls under the nail to force it to grow above the skin.</li>
            <li>certainly works as advertised!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost the right size, though perhaps a slightly smaller one would have worked better.      </li>
            <li>It might even help you find the ingrown nail right away, and who knows, if all the trimming you do provides enough space between your toenail and the ingrown nail, you might even be able to use this tool to lift it up and out.     </li>
            <li>In other words, I&#x27;m not blaming this tool for not being able to fit underneath my ingrown nail and remove it.  </li>
            <li>I cant really rate this item,but I have to click on a star!</li>
            <li>Yes this product is exactly what it says, it lifts the toenail.  </li>
            <li>After the first use of this tool after taking a hot bath the pain was resolved.</li>
            <li>I consider this an essential piece to my repertoire to keep my toes and feet comfortable and not painful.</li>
            <li>product is exactly as described, was delivered sooner.</li>
            <li>My nail was softened enough that the hook on this tool was able to go under the ail bed, pull it up and over the tissue that had been growing over the nail.  </li>
            <li>The tool is exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Also, DO NOT shove the cotton straight into the infection!</li>
            <li>You want to place the cotton under the corner of the toe nail and close enough to the inflamed area to lift the toenail away from the infection and redirect the toenail in a more horizontal</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This was the first time that I had experience with an ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li>I try to keep all of my nails fairly trimmed (only a few millimeters), but for this to work I would have to let them grow out more.</li>
            <li>My whole family gets ingrown toenails and this is a must have at my house!  </li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an ingrown toenail</li>
            <li>Kinda big to get under things, would be a bit better if it was thinner.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again!</li>
            <li>I also use tea tree oil neat on each side of my big toes to make sure that any infections brewing are nipped in the bud.</li>
            <li>But it is good quality not cheap.</li>
            <li>they appear in a location that requires constant digging which means dealing with a gross amount of blood and a good amount of pain.  </li>
            <li>This tool was able to fit in between my regular toenail and skin area, which allowed the skin to separate enough for me to dig using *</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s more uncomfortable for you to walk after placing the cotton, this is a good tip that you have too much in there.</li>
            <li>I was able to get to the end of the nail and pull it up and out enough to deal with it, and faster than I used to be able to using other methods.</li>
            <li>both edges of this tool are large.</li>
            <li>A warm soak and the right tools: no more pain</li>
            <li>This has left me with less attractive toe nails.</li>
            <li>This is strong and works very well for my personal pedicures.</li>
            <li>This little tool is really handy, it&#x27;s not just for nails.</li>
            <li>This little tool comes in handy.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really have what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d be in just as much pain.</li>
            <li>Thanks item as described</li>
            <li>really does the job well of cleaning your toenails</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Looks to be very well made.</li>
            <li>no problems came in in time  thanks</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really tell by the picture</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised at how useful it was.</li>
            <li>A product like this is  something that really needs to be seen before purchasing.</li>
            <li>If so, you have too much in there.</li>
            <li>It looks like is is pointed, but it is really a rounded end.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>stainless steal</li>
            <li>I will be using this item alot as well thank you so much for selling this product.</li>
            <li>it really helps but the device is use to lift the nail out to trim with no pain</li>
            <li>Worked very well for what we needed it for.</li>
            <li>it arrives as expected.nice tool for lifting ingrown.painless.i like it and recommend to everyone who wants to buy this product.</li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li>My ingrown toenail was REALLY embedded</li>
            <li>The lifter helps move it away from the skin and makes adding an antibiotic to a sore area much easier.</li>
            <li>It really helps bring relief and keep infections at bay.  </li>
            <li>I was able to fix my ingrown nails, here is the trick, once you lift the nail put a tiny pad underneath like cotton or anything that is soft.</li>
            <li>With more than a small infection it makes the most sense to see a podiatrist and use something like this for future maintenance.  </li>
            <li>After a bath, I clean out the side of the nails and then use this to lift the toenail on each side of the big toe.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>This nail product seems to be high quality construction and it does the job quite well.  </li>
            <li>It is my own fault, but it&#x27;s really hard to see based on the one picture in the listing.  </li>
            <li>However, that said real hang nails sometimes require professional Podiatrist treatment for a permanent fix.</li>
            <li>Useful to have on hand, especially if you&#x27;re prone to ingrowns.  </li>
            <li>All it is, is a thin, smooth piece of metal, that slides easy, and can lift the ingrown toenail so you can cut it.</li>
            <li>Gets right in there and lifts nail enough to cut it!</li>
            <li>This did little more than a toothpick as far as helping with an ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li>I now think I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>BUT you should NOT feel like you have a hug wad of cotton under your nail that is causing a new discomfort.</li>
            <li>If you have an infection already, you may need to give yourself a couple of days of slight adjustments (although, the less touching the better in my experience) to start feeling total</li>
            <li>I always make sure I&#x27;m not doing anything important that requires constant walking the next day when I operate on myself just in case the pain lingers longer than usual.    </li>
            <li>And last step is let your toenail grow out for a month or so, when you finally trim it make sure it is not very short.</li>
            <li>The tip of the curved end of the tool works very well in gently lifting the toenail just a tad to make room for placing a tiny, soft, cotton ball under the nail to begin to coax the ingrown toenail to move up/away from the groove it had created that caused the toenail to grow into the skin.</li>
            <li>Nearly painless and a must have if you suffer as we do!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely important to wear loose shoes during this time, even though it&#x27;s not exactly enough to take the pain away completely.  </li>
            <li>I know all too well with every step you take, the pain kicks in and won&#x27;t let up at all until the ingrown nail is either completely taken out, or completely pushed away from any skin that might allow it to re-enter.    </li>
            <li>While this instrument has an unusual shape, it works like a charm lifting an ingrown toenail up so it can reseat itself in the proper growth channel.</li>
            <li>I then use my ingrown nail nipper to complete the task.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;People who are prone to ingrown toenails should NEVER cut their nails too short and should always cut nails STRAIGHT ACROSS.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People who are prone to ingrown toenails should NEVER cut their nails too short and should always cut nails STRAIGHT ACROSS.</li>
            <li>Works very well, I began having pain to big toe</li>
            <li>Well I waited for this Item, But they were out of stock, So I will have to get a refund, and check back in a few weeks to see if they have more in stock..</li>
            <li>Help to lift nail use gently can be sharp if too much pressure applied</li>
            <li>Though the tools work very well, I wish there were photos on the packaging to demonstrate how to use this fine instrument: My impression is that those who complain about the usefulness, or rather the lack of same, just are not able to use the tool correctly.</li>
            <li>I use hot water - as hot as I can handle - and allow it to cool; then repeat the process at least once so skin and nails soften enough to utilize the tool properly.</li>
            <li>I wanted a sharp tool similar to those used at spas for pedicures to clean under toenails.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll eat these and pay a little more and get the German or Italian one.</li>
            <li>This little tool is helping me tremendously in taking care of my chronic ingrown toe nails.  </li>
            <li>However the metal can bend at the end, it isn&#x27;t strong in the least.</li>
            <li>Every 3-5 months I have to cut the corner of my toenail all the way down to the very end using a pair of special toenail trimmers shaped like pliers, and for those of you who suffer the same misfortune as me, I recommend small pliers or specially-shaped nail trimmers that allow you to cut the toenail all the way down to the source of the problem without feeling significant pain, and just allow the ingrown nail to grow out by itself.  </li>
            <li>am not a doctor, so I am speaking only as a patient who has had ingrown toenails fixed and been advised by a doctor how to self treat when not infected..</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and it came quicker then expected.</li>
            <li>Constructed well with no rough edges.</li>
            <li>Both ends are thin and can slide under the toenail, unlike many lifters.</li>
            <li>but because I suffer from incredibly deep ingrown nails that come back at least 3 times a year, this toenail lifter wasn&#x27;t able to actually get underneath my ingrown nail and remove it.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a toenail lifter with super thin edge, most are to thick to get under your toenail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After taking a shower or soaking your foot so that your nail is soft, gently lift the corner of the toenail that is ingrown and using a tweezer or other pointed nail tool (like this product) GENTLY place a small wad of cotton (like from a cotton ball or q-tip) under the corner of the nail.</li>
            <li>DO NOT shove the cotton in too far and DO NOT put so much cotton that you bend the nail upwards past horizontal.</li>
            <li>But this really gets deep and down in the cracks like I need.  </li>
            <li>The flat side comes in use more often than the other angled side, it seems too thick to use.</li>
            <li>Good quality foot care instrument and much less expensive</li>
    </ol>

            <li> quality tool and cheap price so buy one !</li>
            <li> Make sure to soak your feet to make the nails a bit softer.  </li>

            <li> Also, this is a great seller, very prompt and accurate...</li>
            <li> I found that the end of the tool bent too easily to accomplish my task.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Other important tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would be happy to hear if anyone benefits from this posting!tart feeling total</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other important tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice tool, but thank goodness I have not had to give it too much use.</li>
            <li> Best to use after soaking or a long hot shower.</li>
            <li> I was able to get right to the problem with this tool.</li>
            <li> Very useful item.  </li>
            <li> Works great for getting under the toenail for cleaning, have to be careful you don&#x27;t hurt the skin, just go easy.</li>
            <li> For some really bizarre reason (and I STILL haven&#x27;t been able to find an explanation for this) trimming away more of my toenail increases the pain where the ingrown nail is located, even though it doesn&#x27;t really make a lick of sense exactly why this happens.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this, honestly.</li>
            <li> It also helps to clean out areas underneath the nail that I could not get to before.  </li>
            <li> After using this tool once, it illeviated the pressure and helped the nail to grow in a more positive position.</li>
            <li> I finally happened on a general practice doctor who gave me the THE BEST ADVICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seller is honest, dependable, reasonable and fast!</li>
            <li> Also good for pushing back cuticles.</li>
            <li> My toes have been much better, and the nail is growing straight out rather than in.</li>
            <li> Company was very quick with delivery, and the instrument is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I have finally been able to wear sandals after many years of hiding my feet because of my toes.</li>
            <li> This tool works pretty well and is cheaply priced.</li>
            <li> Great little gadget.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have this in my home for the future.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It is useful indeed.</li>
            <li> Scholl&#x27;s Ingrown Toenail Pain Reliever Kit &amp; after using that for 3 days my nail was soft enought that I could use this toenail lifter &amp; was able to loosen the nail up a bit before pulling it out.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Was useful in taking care of my in-grown nails.  </li>
            <li> Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
            <li> I use a nail softener liquid for 4 or 5 days and then I can use this tool to lift the ingrown nail right out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using this the right way!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you get rid of an ingrown toenail your foot in general will feel better.</li>
            <li> You really must soak the toe in very warm water for 15-20 minutes to soften the nail and skin, in order to experience less discomfort when using this instrument.</li>
            <li> The lifter is perfect for pushing little cotton rolls under the nail to force it to grow above the skin.</li>
            <li> certainly works as advertised!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost the right size, though perhaps a slightly smaller one would have worked better.      </li>
            <li> It might even help you find the ingrown nail right away, and who knows, if all the trimming you do provides enough space between your toenail and the ingrown nail, you might even be able to use this tool to lift it up and out.     </li>
            <li> In other words, I&#x27;m not blaming this tool for not being able to fit underneath my ingrown nail and remove it.  </li>
            <li> I cant really rate this item,but I have to click on a star!</li>
            <li> Yes this product is exactly what it says, it lifts the toenail.  </li>
            <li> After the first use of this tool after taking a hot bath the pain was resolved.</li>
            <li> I consider this an essential piece to my repertoire to keep my toes and feet comfortable and not painful.</li>
            <li> product is exactly as described, was delivered sooner.</li>
            <li> My nail was softened enough that the hook on this tool was able to go under the ail bed, pull it up and over the tissue that had been growing over the nail.  </li>
            <li> The tool is exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> Also, DO NOT shove the cotton straight into the infection!</li>
            <li> You want to place the cotton under the corner of the toe nail and close enough to the inflamed area to lift the toenail away from the infection and redirect the toenail in a more horizontal</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This was the first time that I had experience with an ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li> I try to keep all of my nails fairly trimmed (only a few millimeters), but for this to work I would have to let them grow out more.</li>
            <li> My whole family gets ingrown toenails and this is a must have at my house!  </li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an ingrown toenail</li>
            <li> Kinda big to get under things, would be a bit better if it was thinner.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again!</li>
            <li> I also use tea tree oil neat on each side of my big toes to make sure that any infections brewing are nipped in the bud.</li>
            <li> But it is good quality not cheap.</li>
            <li> they appear in a location that requires constant digging which means dealing with a gross amount of blood and a good amount of pain.  </li>
            <li> This tool was able to fit in between my regular toenail and skin area, which allowed the skin to separate enough for me to dig using *</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s more uncomfortable for you to walk after placing the cotton, this is a good tip that you have too much in there.</li>
            <li> I was able to get to the end of the nail and pull it up and out enough to deal with it, and faster than I used to be able to using other methods.</li>
            <li> both edges of this tool are large.</li>
            <li> A warm soak and the right tools: no more pain</li>
            <li> This has left me with less attractive toe nails.</li>
            <li> This is strong and works very well for my personal pedicures.</li>
            <li> This little tool is really handy, it&#x27;s not just for nails.</li>
            <li> This little tool comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really have what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be in just as much pain.</li>
            <li> Thanks item as described</li>
            <li> really does the job well of cleaning your toenails</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Looks to be very well made.</li>
            <li> no problems came in in time  thanks</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really tell by the picture</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised at how useful it was.</li>
            <li> A product like this is  something that really needs to be seen before purchasing.</li>
            <li> If so, you have too much in there.</li>
            <li> It looks like is is pointed, but it is really a rounded end.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> stainless steal</li>
            <li> I will be using this item alot as well thank you so much for selling this product.</li>
            <li> it really helps but the device is use to lift the nail out to trim with no pain</li>
            <li> Worked very well for what we needed it for.</li>
            <li> it arrives as expected.nice tool for lifting ingrown.painless.i like it and recommend to everyone who wants to buy this product.</li>
            <li> so I really didn&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li> My ingrown toenail was REALLY embedded</li>
            <li> The lifter helps move it away from the skin and makes adding an antibiotic to a sore area much easier.</li>
            <li> It really helps bring relief and keep infections at bay.  </li>
            <li> I was able to fix my ingrown nails, here is the trick, once you lift the nail put a tiny pad underneath like cotton or anything that is soft.</li>
            <li> With more than a small infection it makes the most sense to see a podiatrist and use something like this for future maintenance.  </li>
            <li> After a bath, I clean out the side of the nails and then use this to lift the toenail on each side of the big toe.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> This nail product seems to be high quality construction and it does the job quite well.  </li>
            <li> It is my own fault, but it&#x27;s really hard to see based on the one picture in the listing.  </li>
            <li> However, that said real hang nails sometimes require professional Podiatrist treatment for a permanent fix.</li>
            <li> Useful to have on hand, especially if you&#x27;re prone to ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> All it is, is a thin, smooth piece of metal, that slides easy, and can lift the ingrown toenail so you can cut it.</li>
            <li> Gets right in there and lifts nail enough to cut it!</li>
            <li> This did little more than a toothpick as far as helping with an ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li> I now think I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> BUT you should NOT feel like you have a hug wad of cotton under your nail that is causing a new discomfort.</li>
            <li> If you have an infection already, you may need to give yourself a couple of days of slight adjustments (although, the less touching the better in my experience) to start feeling total</li>
            <li> I always make sure I&#x27;m not doing anything important that requires constant walking the next day when I operate on myself just in case the pain lingers longer than usual.    </li>
            <li> And last step is let your toenail grow out for a month or so, when you finally trim it make sure it is not very short.</li>
            <li> The tip of the curved end of the tool works very well in gently lifting the toenail just a tad to make room for placing a tiny, soft, cotton ball under the nail to begin to coax the ingrown toenail to move up/away from the groove it had created that caused the toenail to grow into the skin.</li>
            <li> Nearly painless and a must have if you suffer as we do!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely important to wear loose shoes during this time, even though it&#x27;s not exactly enough to take the pain away completely.  </li>
            <li> I know all too well with every step you take, the pain kicks in and won&#x27;t let up at all until the ingrown nail is either completely taken out, or completely pushed away from any skin that might allow it to re-enter.    </li>
            <li> While this instrument has an unusual shape, it works like a charm lifting an ingrown toenail up so it can reseat itself in the proper growth channel.</li>
            <li> I then use my ingrown nail nipper to complete the task.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;People who are prone to ingrown toenails should NEVER cut their nails too short and should always cut nails STRAIGHT ACROSS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People who are prone to ingrown toenails should NEVER cut their nails too short and should always cut nails STRAIGHT ACROSS.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I began having pain to big toe</li>
            <li> Well I waited for this Item, But they were out of stock, So I will have to get a refund, and check back in a few weeks to see if they have more in stock..</li>
            <li> Help to lift nail use gently can be sharp if too much pressure applied</li>
            <li> Though the tools work very well, I wish there were photos on the packaging to demonstrate how to use this fine instrument: My impression is that those who complain about the usefulness, or rather the lack of same, just are not able to use the tool correctly.</li>
            <li> I use hot water - as hot as I can handle - and allow it to cool; then repeat the process at least once so skin and nails soften enough to utilize the tool properly.</li>
            <li> I wanted a sharp tool similar to those used at spas for pedicures to clean under toenails.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll eat these and pay a little more and get the German or Italian one.</li>
            <li> This little tool is helping me tremendously in taking care of my chronic ingrown toe nails.  </li>
            <li> However the metal can bend at the end, it isn&#x27;t strong in the least.</li>
            <li> Every 3-5 months I have to cut the corner of my toenail all the way down to the very end using a pair of special toenail trimmers shaped like pliers, and for those of you who suffer the same misfortune as me, I recommend small pliers or specially-shaped nail trimmers that allow you to cut the toenail all the way down to the source of the problem without feeling significant pain, and just allow the ingrown nail to grow out by itself.  </li>
            <li> am not a doctor, so I am speaking only as a patient who has had ingrown toenails fixed and been advised by a doctor how to self treat when not infected..</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and it came quicker then expected.</li>
            <li> Constructed well with no rough edges.</li>
            <li> Both ends are thin and can slide under the toenail, unlike many lifters.</li>
            <li> but because I suffer from incredibly deep ingrown nails that come back at least 3 times a year, this toenail lifter wasn&#x27;t able to actually get underneath my ingrown nail and remove it.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a toenail lifter with super thin edge, most are to thick to get under your toenail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After taking a shower or soaking your foot so that your nail is soft, gently lift the corner of the toenail that is ingrown and using a tweezer or other pointed nail tool (like this product) GENTLY place a small wad of cotton (like from a cotton ball or q-tip) under the corner of the nail.</li>
            <li> DO NOT shove the cotton in too far and DO NOT put so much cotton that you bend the nail upwards past horizontal.</li>
            <li> But this really gets deep and down in the cracks like I need.  </li>
            <li> The flat side comes in use more often than the other angled side, it seems too thick to use.</li>
            <li> Good quality foot care instrument and much less expensive</li>
            <li> Misshapen and sharp edges that I would not put anywhere near her feet.</li>
            <li> During this 7-10 day stretch, your skin will probably go through a wild assortment of problems such as itching, burning, throbbing, pinching, redness, dead skin turning white and peeling, shiny red skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I can definitely get under my ingrown nails much farther, easier, and with less pain than any other method I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something pointy and not blunt and flat.</li>
            <li> and if you react as soon as you believe you&#x27;re developing an ingrown nail (you&#x27;ll definitely know it because the painful and distinct signs are noticeable almost right away)</li>
            <li> but its actually flat!</li>
            <li> The ends are like paddles and very flat.  </li>
            <li> You must lift the nail with this tool daily for at least a week or until it doesn&#x27;t hurt much.</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly without any unnecessary packaging.</li>
            <li> I have been using this method for about 20 years, and as I mentioned above I have not had a single ingrown infected toenail</li>
            <li> I have been using this method for about 20 years, and as I mentioned above I have not had a single ingrown infected toenail</li>
            <li> I usually take something small like a toothpick or even a pin and scrape it back and forth in between my toenail and toe skin, and the ingrown nail is usually located in a spot that requires me to trim even *more* of my regular toenail in order to get to it.  </li>
            <li> 2-sided Ingrown Toenail Lifter that I bought last week (due to a sudden emergency of my ingrown toenail becoming almost unbearably painful and forcing me to react quickly by searching for absolutely *anything* that might work) is that, it did work, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.  </li>
            <li> The important part is that, if you&#x27;re someone who suffers constantly with ingrown nails, constant trimming and digging is going to be a given</li>
            <li> Have had issues with ingrown toenails for a long while and this tool always helps me lift the ingrown edges after shower.</li>
            <li> I wish it was smaller and not so wide to get under the nail.</li>
            <li> I have a problem big toe that was crushed in an accident.</li>
            <li> The actual lifter has very wide flat ends.</li>
            <li> one side flat the other curved and flat.</li>
            <li> but hey Im not the only active person out there with well used feet.</li>
            <li> If you use slow and steady pressure ad gently reposition it it will not hurt to get the toenail ready for cutting.</li>
            <li> Slow and steady pressure is used to raise up the toe nail and then cut it with a set of Nippers.</li>
            <li> I never new that this device existed.</li>
            <li> My method is to take a small pull of cotton from a q-tip or cotton ball and roll it gently between my forefinger and thumb with some neosporin into a little ball.</li>
            <li> My method is to take a small pull of cotton from a q-tip or cotton ball and roll it gently between my forefinger and thumb with some neosporin into a little ball.</li>
            <li> After some excruciating experiences as a child and teenager with ingrown toenails (both big toes once got so infected that I had to have a doctor cut the nails completely in half down the middle and the infected halves torn out)</li>
            <li> Hey, simply exposing the ingrown nail means you&#x27;re in less pain by about 50%.       </li>
            <li> I thought the tips were a different shape and think they would be easier to use if they were slightly thinner.</li>
            <li> Very sharp so be careful with this until you learn how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> Nice little tool for correcting my bad toenail clipping.</li>
            <li> Item was deliver on time and it was my life saver, great tool for nasty ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful to not be too aggressive.</li>
            <li> but I was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I expected to be sharper.</li>
            <li> Recommended by lady who cuts toenails at the senior citizen center.</li>
            <li> This has changed my lifelong fight to keep my toenails from ingrowing.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately if the toenail is already cut back too far this is not strong enough to lift it properly, and you just have to wait for it to grow out some or use stick cotton in the crease to keep the edge of the nail away from the flesh of the toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the flat side was a bit thinner.</li>
            <li> I got the Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail File, 8.1 Ounce along with this and when used together prying with one and filing with the other there was minimal pain.</li>
            <li> However, neither end is sharp nor has a sharp edge, which to me would be a benefit since I would like to scrape the underside of my nails.</li>
            <li> I have to wait up to 7-10 days to actually find it because the ingrown nail is so darn small.  </li>
            <li> , other times it takes 16-24 hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This small tool is a big help in caring for the toenails.  </li>
            <li> I have used the bent end to dig things out of small spaces and to open up sealed bottles to just named two.</li>
            <li> that on other sites.</li>
            <li> I still use it from time to time, but I usually end up having to bend the end back into shape.</li>
            <li> I had been experienceing some toe discomfort and realized it might be due to my toe nail begining to grow into the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> Thin and strong, not sharp, and I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s dangerous to use.</li>
            <li> i have gone through at least five different brands of toenail lifters from longs drugs, walgreens, wall-mart and other pop-and-mom establishments.  </li>
            <li> EVER cut down into the corners of your nail.</li>
            <li> EVER cut down into the corners of your nail.</li>
            <li> The curved end lifts the nail slightly so that I can use the other end to push a little piece of cotton under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Edges seem a little big &amp; thick.</li>
            <li> This lifter helps to work the toe nail out of the skin with less pain.  </li>
            <li> Ends are thicker than necessary and making lifting nail more difficult and painful.</li>
            <li> This thing is too big and hard to use on small feet....</li>
            <li> I would DEFINITELY recommend this little gadget because even though I felt some discomfort during the ingrown toenail removal, after it was over I felt SO RELIEVED!!!</li>
            <li> I like this little tool and it does what I wanted it for</li>
            <li> The ridges are SO far apart, I feel like it&#x27;s impossible to file anything properly.</li>
            <li> no really it can get in those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The reason it couldn&#x27;t fit underneath my ingrown nail is because I have quite possibly the worst case scenario when it comes to ingrown nails-</li>
            <li> Sometimes the pain goes away in a few hours</li>
            <li> Also helps pull up any dead skin.  </li>
            <li> thin enough to get under nails without damaging it underneath</li>
            <li> This instrument was nowhere thin enough to slide between nail and skin.</li>
            <li> Both nails continue to grow in even though they are narrow nails now.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure, give your toe half an hour or so to test it out and see how you feel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the little ball too tight and hard as this will hurt your toe.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the little ball too tight and hard as this will hurt your toe.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use when you only have a half a centimeter of nail to work with.</li>
            <li> I have bad toenail genes, apparently, and it requires tools outside of the ordinary nail clipper.</li>
            <li> This review is actually a message of hope to the other reviewers of this product who suffer with ingrown toenails and anyone else who might read this who suffers from this problem.</li>
            <li> This really helps if you have bad ingrowns like I do.</li>
            <li> This tool + Outgro &#x3D; no more issues.</li>
            <li> From the picture, I expected thin wire ends.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I would purchase this again or recommend it to any one</li>
            <li> &quot; this pain myself for a product that cost less than $5.00 instead of getting 2 or 3 pedicures a month which were actually not very relaxing since they were cutting out an ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li> If you can tolerate the discomfort without anesthetic or cold to numb the toe, lifting an ingrown toenail, cutting it and filing the leading edges smooth will give the toe a chance to heal as long as it is not too infected already for home care.  </li>
            <li> so it is hard to get under the nail and tends to slip for me at least.</li>
            <li> my case at least-</li>
            <li> It does help to left the ingrown nail for cutting.  </li>
            <li> medal edge is too thick to get under my toe nail..</li>
            <li> For me the implement was to thick to do what I needed.</li>
            <li> Tips are too thick to work property on my toe nails.</li>
            <li> The edges are rounded and thick</li>
            <li> I have had both side of my big toe nails cut out by a podiatrist which was very painful and took a long time to heal.  </li>
            <li> Mine are worse because I foolishly waited until it was too late</li>
            <li> Ingrown toenails are never pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I said, too thick for me, and it hurt to use it!</li>
            <li> It would hurt even to move my foot the wrong way in bed under the sheets.</li>
            <li> I feel silly reviewing a product like this, but I have to admit I have had ingrown toenails for over 38 years</li>
            <li> so maybe I am doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> It was painful and frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a tool like this for years, instead of cutting into my toenails.</li>
            <li> so you can use clippers to trim with out cutting yourself or digging</li>
            <li> It just makes that awful job of clipping ingrown toe nails so much less painful.  </li>
            <li> I get hang nails really bad and would use a finger nail file to assist me, which was painful.  </li>
            <li> GOODBYE ANNOYING DISCOMFORT....</li>
            <li> and this was the tool that repaired my painful ingrown nail!</li>
            <li> I decided to search AMazon for something that would help me deal with them when they are very bad, and bought this.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible ingrown toenail and bought this based on recommendations.  </li>
            <li> and they can get very painful!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great for getting under the toenail for cleaning, have to be careful you don&#x27;t hurt the skin, just go easy.</li>
            <li> This thing is too big and hard to use on small feet.... Seems like this was made for males</li>
            <li> Help to lift nail use gently can be sharp if too much pressure applied</li>
            <li> This tool does wonders for you if you have an ingrown toe nail. Gets right in there and lifts nail enough to cut it!</li>
            <li> not as I thought it would be, but its ok</li>
            <li> Well I waited for this Item, But they were out of stock, So I will have to get a refund, and check back in a few weeks to see if they have more in stock.. I cant really rate this item,but I have to click on a star! Guess its Okay??</li>
            <li> This definately helps to lift the edges of ingrown nails. However, neither end is sharp nor has a sharp edge, which to me would be a benefit since I would like to scrape the underside of my nails.</li>
            <li> My experience with this Satin Edge 2-sided Ingrown Toenail Lifter that I bought last week (due to a sudden emergency of my ingrown toenail becoming almost unbearably painful and forcing me to react quickly by searching for absolutely *anything* that might work) is that, it did work, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.  Let me explain-    This tool was able to fit in between my regular toenail and skin area, which allowed the skin to separate enough for me to dig using *another* tool in order to find the ingrown nail, but because I suffer from incredibly deep ingrown nails that come back at least 3 times a year, this toenail lifter wasn&#x27;t able to actually get underneath my ingrown nail and remove it.      The reason it couldn&#x27;t fit underneath my ingrown nail is because I have quite possibly the worst case scenario when it comes to ingrown nails- they appear in a location that requires constant digging which means dealing with a gross amount of blood and a good amount of pain.  In other words, I&#x27;m not blaming this tool for not being able to fit underneath my ingrown nail and remove it.  It&#x27;s almost the right size, though perhaps a slightly smaller one would have worked better.      Every 3-5 months I have to cut the corner of my toenail all the way down to the very end using a pair of special toenail trimmers shaped like pliers, and for those of you who suffer the same misfortune as me, I recommend small pliers or specially-shaped nail trimmers that allow you to cut the toenail all the way down to the source of the problem without feeling significant pain, and just allow the ingrown nail to grow out by itself.  Hey, simply exposing the ingrown nail means you&#x27;re in less pain by about 50%.       After the ingrown nail is exposed -in my case at least- I have to wait up to 7-10 days to actually find it because the ingrown nail is so darn small.  I usually take something small like a toothpick or even a pin and scrape it back and forth in between my toenail and toe skin, and the ingrown nail is usually located in a spot that requires me to trim even *more* of my regular toenail in order to get to it.  For some really bizarre reason (and I STILL haven&#x27;t been able to find an explanation for this) trimming away more of my toenail increases the pain where the ingrown nail is located, even though it doesn&#x27;t really make a lick of sense exactly why this happens.  THIS is when the pain intensifies dramatically.  Sometimes the pain goes away in a few hours, other times it takes 16-24 hours.  I always make sure I&#x27;m not doing anything important that requires constant walking the next day when I operate on myself just in case the pain lingers longer than usual.    Anyway I assume the ingrown nail reveals itself after you trim your toenail short enough because during this 7-10 day period, your ingrown nail is working itself out of your skin the same way a splinter does.  This is what I believe happens.  During this 7-10 day stretch, your skin will probably go through a wild assortment of problems such as itching, burning, throbbing, pinching, redness, dead skin turning white and peeling, shiny red skin, etc.  It&#x27;s extremely important to wear loose shoes during this time, even though it&#x27;s not exactly enough to take the pain away completely.  I know all too well with every step you take, the pain kicks in and won&#x27;t let up at all until the ingrown nail is either completely taken out, or completely pushed away from any skin that might allow it to re-enter.    However it&#x27;s possible this ingrown lifter tool would work for those of you who *didn&#x27;t* make the foolish decision that I made (letting the ingrown nail grow deeper into the side of my toe and assuming the problem would go away on its own- it WON&#x27;T go away by itself, trust me- it&#x27;s a recurring problem that you HAVE to get taken care of, either by your doctor or you giving yourself a bathroom floor toe operation) and if you react as soon as you believe you&#x27;re developing an ingrown nail (you&#x27;ll definitely know it because the painful and distinct signs are noticeable almost right away) this tool would probably be the perfect choice.  I don&#x27;t fall under this category though.  Mine are worse because I foolishly waited until it was too late and they grew in too deep.      So no- I&#x27;m not knocking this item just because it didn&#x27;t work the way it was advertised.  It *did* allow me to lift up on my skin in a way that was mostly painless, which allowed me access to the ingrown nail.  The important part is that, if you&#x27;re someone who suffers constantly with ingrown nails, constant trimming and digging is going to be a given and you already know that, and this toenail lifter will probably work to an extent.  It will lift up either your regular toenail, ingrown nail or your skin, which is definitely helpful.  It might even help you find the ingrown nail right away, and who knows, if all the trimming you do provides enough space between your toenail and the ingrown nail, you might even be able to use this tool to lift it up and out.     I just wish it worked for the reasons listed- that it actually got under the really deep ingrown nails and allowed instant lifting and removal.  No it doesn&#x27;t quite work that way.</li>
            <li> Yes this product is exactly what it says, it lifts the toenail.  Just what I ordered so very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really have what i was looking for.  Don&#x27;t see how one could use this for their toes.</li>
            <li> Thin and strong, not sharp, and I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s dangerous to use. Rounded edges, excellent handle. Another good tool for your set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with an ingrown toenail for the last year after I dropped an iron on my toe and it never healed properly. Luckily, I was able to save the nail. I&#x27;d go get a pedicure every 10 days or so but the in grown toenail would grow back and I&#x27;d be in just as much pain. It would hurt even to move my foot the wrong way in bed under the sheets. After the first use of this tool after taking a hot bath the pain was resolved. I&#x27;m happy to know I can \\&quot;cure\\&quot; this pain myself for a product that cost less than $5.00 instead of getting 2 or 3 pedicures a month which were actually not very relaxing since they were cutting out an ingrown toenail. Now I look forward to relaxing pedicures as time and money allows!</li>
            <li> This is like a microwave oven; you never need one until after you&#x27;ve had one... then you never want to be without one again.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I admit I didnt even know this existed but I am glad I found out about it.  I get hang nails really bad and would use a finger nail file to assist me, which was painful.  But this really gets deep and down in the cracks like I need.  Also helps pull up any dead skin.  This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Works well, would recommend if you have in grown nails. My only complaint is that I wish the flat side was a bit thinner. Otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time to self-operate on my toenails. I have bad toenail genes, apparently, and it requires tools outside of the ordinary nail clipper. I consider this an essential piece to my repertoire to keep my toes and feet comfortable and not painful. I can&#x27;t live without this, honestly. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I was looking for. ..I wanted a sharp tool similar to those used at spas for pedicures to clean under toenails.</li>
            <li> While this instrument has an unusual shape, it works like a charm lifting an ingrown toenail up so it can reseat itself in the proper growth channel.</li>
            <li> This is nice and slim, great for those right spaces between your toes and toenails.</li>
            <li> This small tool is a big help in caring for the toenails.  It is especially effective in cleaning under the big toenails. You just have to be careful to not be too aggressive. I thought it was overpriced, considering the shipping charge, but it seems to be a quality-made tool.</li>
            <li> Thanks item as described</li>
            <li> Excellent at lifting ingrown nails.</li>
            <li> Item was deliver on time and it was my life saver, great tool for nasty ingrown toenails. I was able to fix my ingrown nails, here is the trick, once you lift the nail put a tiny pad underneath like cotton or anything that is soft. You must lift the nail with this tool daily for at least a week or until it doesn&#x27;t hurt much. And last step is let your toenail grow out for a month or so, when you finally trim it make sure it is not very short.</li>
            <li> works good on ingrown toe nails.  Like it.</li>
            <li> Have had issues with ingrown toenails for a long while and this tool always helps me lift the ingrown edges after shower. Its a great tool, helps you relief the pain and also saves you the whole hassle with getting a pedicure in a salon. I would recommend it to anyone who has ingrown nail-problems.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve been looking for a toenail lifter with super thin edge, most are to thick to get under your toenail. This one is perfect and can get ingrown toenail out perfect.</li>
            <li> After warm soak, tool helps lift nail area easily.  I then use my ingrown nail nipper to complete the task.  For me it goes hand in hand....GOODBYE ANNOYING DISCOMFORT....Excellent price &amp; quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Good tool. Helps with my nail issues. The flat side comes in use more often than the other angled side, it seems too thick to use. The tool doesn&#x27;t come with suggested use guidelines so you&#x27;re left improvising.</li>
            <li> really does the job well of cleaning your toenails</li>
            <li> I have found this tool to be a wonder when one is dealing with ingrown toenails. Though the tools work very well, I wish there were photos on the packaging to demonstrate how to use this fine instrument: My impression is that those who complain about the usefulness, or rather the lack of same, just are not able to use the tool correctly. The tip of the curved end of the tool works very well in gently lifting the toenail just a tad to make room for placing a tiny, soft, cotton ball under the nail to begin to coax the ingrown toenail to move up/away from the groove it had created that caused the toenail to grow into the skin. I realize I am not explaining this well, so I apologize for that.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool. Perfect size and weight. I was going to a podiatrist every two weeks because a toenail that was cut all along the side (for a fungus) kept on going inside my skin. It was painful and frustrating. But then I bought this Toenail Lifter and the [[ASIN:B000VDAFHE Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail File]] and I have been able to tend to my nail myself! A warm soak and the right tools: no more pain, the nail is growing back again! The lifter is perfect for pushing little cotton rolls under the nail to force it to grow above the skin.</li>
            <li> This product should include some instructions on how to use. I thought it would be slimmer. But it is good quality not cheap.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> good quality, like this thing. if your toe hurts this might help. read some comment how to use it and put medicine, there are good tips.</li>
            <li> thin enough to get under nails without damaging it underneath</li>
            <li> This little tool is really handy, it&#x27;s not just for nails. I have used the bent end to dig things out of small spaces and to open up sealed bottles to just named two.</li>
            <li> Well I have used the satin and they are helpful with the ingrown and easy to clean .</li>
            <li> Good quality foot care instrument and much less expensive that on other sites.</li>
            <li> Well it is good for the money but I was not what I expected. I expected to be sharper.</li>
            <li> good quality well made</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I will cut my toenail too short and then will be bothered with an ingrown nail.  I use a nail softener liquid for 4 or 5 days and then I can use this tool to lift the ingrown nail right out.  Great little gadget.</li>
            <li> If you can tolerate the discomfort without anesthetic or cold to numb the toe, lifting an ingrown toenail, cutting it and filing the leading edges smooth will give the toe a chance to heal as long as it is not too infected already for home care.  With more than a small infection it makes the most sense to see a podiatrist and use something like this for future maintenance.  It seems appropriately designed but I have no immediate need thus no way to test it properly, which would be to lift up the leading edge that is sore.  Unfortunately if the toenail is already cut back too far this is not strong enough to lift it properly, and you just have to wait for it to grow out some or use stick cotton in the crease to keep the edge of the nail away from the flesh of the toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a doctor, so I am speaking only as a patient who has had ingrown toenails fixed and been advised by a doctor how to self treat when not infected..</li>
            <li> I never new that this device existed. I now think I can&#x27;t live without it.  It just makes that awful job of clipping ingrown toe nails so much less painful.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I love it! Thanks</li>
            <li> Useful to have on hand, especially if you&#x27;re prone to ingrowns.  Also good for pushing back cuticles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I can definitely get under my ingrown nails much farther, easier, and with less pain than any other method I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to ingrowns this works well to help lift them up so you can file the nail or clip it. Good item.</li>
            <li> I had an infected ingrown nail and did not want to go the antibiotics route again.  This treated my toe as quickly as the antibiotics and was a lot better for my body!  Very useful item.  I am thrilled to have this in my home for the future.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible ingrown toenail and bought this based on recommendations.  I am glad that I did.  I used a teeny tiny bit of cotton and put it under my ingrown nail by using antibiotic ointment to coat it.  Relief was immediate!</li>
            <li> Used it and it worked, just have to get used to using it, but it worked well to lift the nail so I could cut it. Relief at last. Best to use after soaking or a long hot shower.</li>
            <li> product is exactly as described, was delivered sooner. thank you.</li>
            <li> The picture does not do this tool justice.  The ends are like paddles and very flat.  Perfect for lifting an ingrown toenail that has been bothering me for months.  The curved end lifts the nail slightly so that I can use the other end to push a little piece of cotton under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality.</li>
            <li> Maybe this works for others, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medal edge is too thick to get under my toe nail..and I&#x27;m a women, that has manicure toe nails that&lt;br /&gt;are kept nice..Expect now I have a ingrown toe nail!&lt;br /&gt;Or I&#x27;m not using this the right way!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows the toenail lifter, but it shows a slim edge.&lt;br /&gt;As I said, too thick for me, and it hurt to use it!</li>
            <li> Good Product and Good Price</li>
            <li> Outgro Pain Relieving Liquid with Brush Applicator, 0.31 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Outgro&lt;br /&gt;What can I say? It works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about. Nice little tool for correcting my bad toenail clipping.</li>
            <li> This might be an over-specialized tool but it did its job well.  Instead of having to go to the doctor I was able to handle my ingrown toenail by myself. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the relief of lifting an ingrown toenail.  This lifter is fantastic.  I never knew that this even existed until I started to look for help with ingrown toenails.  It also helps to clean out areas underneath the nail that I could not get to before.  Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> I would say I &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34;, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it.  Looks to be very well made.</li>
            <li> I have well used feet. Hiking and running and dropping many things on my toes. This has left me with less attractive toe nails. I have to keep them trim and these tools help me get safely in places to keep the in groins at bay. May be TMI but hey Im not the only active person out there with well used feet. Its better then going after them with scissors that cut the skin and leave me hurting.</li>
            <li> Recommended by lady who cuts toenails at the senior citizen center.</li>
            <li> Excellent presentation!</li>
            <li> This was a nice buy on a hard-to-find tool. It looks as though it should last for ever.</li>
            <li> works well intact no problems came in in time  thanks i will continue buying fine products like this one meets expectations and compatible to my hdtv</li>
            <li> I thought the tips were a different shape and think they would be easier to use if they were slightly thinner. Still like it though, but could be better.</li>
            <li> Received on time. Prefect for use</li>
            <li> It truly is a very handy tool.  Curved end especially lifts the toe nail and lets you get in the groove.  It is useful indeed.</li>
            <li> I found this is quite helpful</li>
            <li> The ridges are SO far apart, I feel like it&#x27;s impossible to file anything properly.</li>
            <li> This tool in conjunction with Dr Scholl&#x27;s ingrown toe nail drops worked great.  My nail was softened enough that the hook on this tool was able to go under the ail bed, pull it up and over the tissue that had been growing over the nail.  I&#x27;ve also used tweezers which work well, but there is nothing like the perfect tool for the job at hand and this was the tool that repaired my painful ingrown nail!</li>
            <li> This makes the care ff ingrown toenails a breeze.</li>
            <li> Helped a lot with ingrown  toenails</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really tell by the picture but I wanted something pointy and not blunt and flat. Too big to go in my ingrown toenail</li>
            <li> Edges seem a little big &amp; thick. I wanted to push a bit of cotton under the edge of my nailbed &amp; this was too big to get under there</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a tool like this for years, instead of cutting into my toenails. This works great for lifting up the ends and setting the toenail to regrow the proper length. Company was very quick with delivery, and the instrument is exactly as pictured. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I had assumed that one of the ends would have a file on it...and foolishly so.  It is my own fault, but it&#x27;s really hard to see based on the one picture in the listing.  This did little more than a toothpick as far as helping with an ingrown toenail.</li>
            <li> I like tis product for mens cuticles but don&#x60;t like the hook part I wish it was smaller and not so wide to get under the nail.</li>
            <li> This has changed my lifelong fight to keep my toenails from ingrowing. I wish I had found this years ago. Both ends are thin and can slide under the toenail, unlike many lifters. After a bath, I clean out the side of the nails and then use this to lift the toenail on each side of the big toe. My toes have been much better, and the nail is growing straight out rather than in. I have finally been able to wear sandals after many years of hiding my feet because of my toes.</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver when using it with hydrogen peroxide. I got my toes in good shape using this tool.</li>
            <li> This tool I&#x27;d a must if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown nail.</li>
            <li> This tool + Outgro &#x3D; no more issues. :) Very happy.</li>
            <li> The tool is exactly as pictured.  I have problem nails on my big toes and I had hoped that this tool would permit me to lift the ingrown nail out enough to clip it.  I found that the end of the tool bent too easily to accomplish my task.  I still use it from time to time, but I usually end up having to bend the end back into shape.</li>
            <li> I feel silly reviewing a product like this, but I have to admit I have had ingrown toenails for over 38 years and they can get very painful! I decided to search AMazon for something that would help me deal with them when they are very bad, and bought this. I was actually surprised at how useful it was. I was able to get to the end of the nail and pull it up and out enough to deal with it, and faster than I used to be able to using other methods.</li>
            <li> A product like this is  something that really needs to be seen before purchasing. For me the implement was to thick to do what I needed.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help with my son&#x27;s ingrown toenail. It worked to help work the nail out. Would definately recommend to get for anyone&#x27;s toenail care kit.</li>
            <li> This review is actually a message of hope to the other reviewers of this product who suffer with ingrown toenails and anyone else who might read this who suffers from this problem. After some excruciating experiences as a child and teenager with ingrown toenails (both big toes once got so infected that I had to have a doctor cut the nails completely in half down the middle and the infected halves torn out) I finally happened on a general practice doctor who gave me the THE BEST ADVICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving this advice 20 years ago I HAVE NEVER HAD ANOTHER INFECTED INGROWN TOENAIL. It&#x27;s cheap, painless, and it WORKS. You will never have to \\&quot;dig\\&quot; or \\&quot;trim\\&quot; an infected nail again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking a shower or soaking your foot so that your nail is soft, gently lift the corner of the toenail that is ingrown and using a tweezer or other pointed nail tool (like this product) GENTLY place a small wad of cotton (like from a cotton ball or q-tip) under the corner of the nail. DO NOT shove the cotton in too far and DO NOT put so much cotton that you bend the nail upwards past horizontal. Also, DO NOT shove the cotton straight into the infection! You want to place the cotton under the corner of the toe nail and close enough to the inflamed area to lift the toenail away from the infection and redirect the toenail in a more horizontal direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have the cotton under your nail, you should feel relief from the digging corner of the nail. BUT you should NOT feel like you have a hug wad of cotton under your nail that is causing a new discomfort. If so, you have too much in there. If it&#x27;s more uncomfortable for you to walk after placing the cotton, this is a good tip that you have too much in there. If you&#x27;re not sure, give your toe half an hour or so to test it out and see how you feel. If you have an infection already, you may need to give yourself a couple of days of slight adjustments (although, the less touching the better in my experience) to start feeling total relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it is helpful to treat the bit of cotton with neosporin - it lubricates the placement of the cotton and fights germs. My method is to take a small pull of cotton from a q-tip or cotton ball and roll it gently between my forefinger and thumb with some neosporin into a little ball. Don&#x27;t make the little ball too tight and hard as this will hurt your toe. Keep it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I change out the cotton pieces about once every two or three weeks. I have been using this method for about 20 years, and as I mentioned above I have not had a single ingrown infected toenail since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other important tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who are prone to ingrown toenails should NEVER cut their nails too short and should always cut nails STRAIGHT ACROSS. NEVER EVER EVER cut down into the corners of your nail. This is GUARANTEED to cause you problems. I know this may seem counterintuitive, but trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this message reaches some people who suffer with this problem, because I know what it&#x27;s like to think that you will be dealing with something like this for the rest of your life without an end in sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be happy to hear if anyone benefits from this posting!tart feeling total relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it is helpful to treat the bit of cotton with neosporin - it lubricates the placement of the cotton and fights germs.

            <li> This is a nice tool, but thank goodness I have not had to give it too much use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I loved it, I recommend it, very good but very good. works great, and I like the finish color</li>
            <li> Very good product and use it all the time now. I like it a lot and so do my kids.</li>
            <li> Miracle tool for ingrown toenails!! So glad I purchased this!!!</li>
            <li> This is a toenail lifter?  I couldn&#x27;t get a response so maybe I am doing something wrong.  I was thinking this was a device that would go under the nail and lift out any debris or possible ingrown problems.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This tool is the best!  Efficient and great preventative care, too.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> This nail product seems to be high quality construction and it does the job quite well.  Recommend it.  However, that said real hang nails sometimes require professional Podiatrist treatment for a permanent fix.</li>
            <li> This was the first time that I had experience with an ingrown toenail. I ordered this product and was helped with just one&lt;br /&gt;usage...good product. Also, this is a great seller, very prompt and accurate...</li>
            <li> Bottom line is it does the job as described. I use it daily after a shower.</li>
            <li> Very sharp so be careful with this until you learn how to use it properly. It does the trick for that area along side the nail.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. It looks like is is pointed, but it is really a rounded end. There is no way I can get this under my toe nail.</li>
            <li> Ingrown toenails are never pleasant.  If you suffer from them repeatedly then you know you need to do something about it.  This toenail lifter is great for taking care of the problem.  Just soak the foot, then use this toenail lifter along with a [[ASIN:B000VDAFHE Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail File]] and [[ASIN:B001MP2P64 Satin Edge Nail Slicer # Se-2044]] to take care of the problem.  Once you get rid of an ingrown toenail your foot in general will feel better.</li>
            <li> Works awesomely! I got the Satin Edge 2 Sided Ingrown Toenail File, 8.1 Ounce along with this and when used together prying with one and filing with the other there was minimal pain.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I began having pain to big toe and after I used this all the pain went away</li>
            <li> Nice length.  Ends are thicker than necessary and making lifting nail more difficult and painful.</li>
            <li> muy buena herramienta para limpiar y empujar las uñas de los pies, es muy resistente y es especialmente lo que yo estaba buscando</li>
            <li> WORKING OUT VERY WELL FOR  ME HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li> Just the thing to handle an ingrown toenail.  Slow and steady pressure is used to raise up the toe nail and then cut it with a set of Nippers. If you use slow and steady pressure ad gently reposition it it will not hurt to get the toenail ready for cutting.</li>
            <li> If your like me then regular pedicures are a must ! This tool allows you to get the job done. The price was reasonable and it came quicker then expected.</li>
            <li> good tool to use for ingrown toenails stainless steal so will last forever wont brake easly cleaned, and easly carry</li>
            <li> I used it to push the cotton under the nail to give me some relief until I can see the Podiatrist</li>
            <li> From the picture, I expected thin wire ends. The actual lifter has very wide flat ends. It is difficult to use when you only have a half a centimeter of nail to work with. I try to keep all of my nails fairly trimmed (only a few millimeters), but for this to work I would have to let them grow out more.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Was shipped quickly without any unnecessary packaging. I bought this tool after my pedicurist used one so I would have one on hand if I needed it.</li>
            <li> This instrument was nowhere thin enough to slide between nail and skin. The price was very cheap, but I would have never ordered it if I had been able to enlarge the picture and examine the width.</li>
            <li> Good idea. Tips are too thick to work property on my toe nails.</li>
            <li> This tool is great for in grown toe nails just pops it out to cut</li>
            <li> It does help to left the ingrown nail for cutting.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> My whole family gets ingrown toenails and this is a must have at my house!  Can be used to prevent or to fix after it is ingrown.  Nearly painless and a must have if you suffer as we do!</li>
            <li> I had been experienceing some toe discomfort and realized it might be due to my toe nail begining to grow into the nail bed.  After using this tool once, it illeviated the pressure and helped the nail to grow in a more positive position.</li>
            <li> This does help relieve my ingrown toe nails. I&#x27;m very happy with it. I use it after I shower to lift nail off and it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I  will do buisness  again/very reputable/quick/ You can beat the price and  am extremely satisfied keep smilling and Thankyou  adieu</li>
            <li> did what I wanted great shape looked just like it said it would yes if asked would tell my friends.</li>
            <li> great price and it really does work unless you go to a pedicure everyday. no really it can get in those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I will be using this item alot as well thank you so much for selling this product. It will be used alot.</li>
            <li> This product is really great I have an ingrown toenail I use the dr scholls ingrown toenail reliever n it really helps but the device is use to lift the nail out to trim with no pain it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> the picture is a bit deceiving. i thought that it was pointed at the one end. like my drs was. but its actually flat! one side flat the other curved and flat. still did the job but not as good as the drs</li>
            <li> The Satin Edge 2-sided Ingrown Toenail Lifter works good and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! Really works!</li>
            <li> The tool isn&#x27;t skinny enough, did not work well for me. Broke my toenails.</li>
            <li> nice product, worked to help my sons ingrown toenail.  Would buy again and recommend to anyone looking for a similar product.</li>
            <li> this product lifts the ingrown nail out so you can use clippers to trim with out cutting yourself or digging</li>
            <li> i have gone through at least five different brands of toenail lifters from longs drugs, walgreens, wall-mart and other pop-and-mom establishments.  this product under review, however, beats them all; it feels like it was tailor-made for my problematic big toe.</li>
            <li> Well made.  Worked very well for what we needed it for.</li>
            <li> Better than having to go to a doctor; there&#x27;s no doubt about that. I ran across this tool by accident, but incredibly happy I did. Pay attention to your feet - take a bath once a week and tend to your toes. If you only have a shower, pamper yourself and soak your feet in Epsom salt once per week. Leave your feet in the water til it cools. I use hot water - as hot as I can handle - and allow it to cool; then repeat the process at least once so skin and nails soften enough to utilize the tool properly. If you check your feet once per week, the ingrown nail won&#x27;t embed to point of causing more problems. As soon as you feel any tenderness, take care of the issue!! This tool has kept me out of the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Good item for a great price.</li>
            <li> Great tool for pedicures!  Constructed well with no rough edges. Quality product!</li>
            <li> it arrives as expected.nice tool for lifting ingrown.painless.i like it and recommend to everyone who wants to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This tool got rusty when I left it in the bathroom but I love the functionality of this tool.</li>
            <li> I like this little tool and it does what I wanted it for</li>
            <li> This lifter helps to work the toe nail out of the skin with less pain.  You really must soak the toe in very warm water for 15-20 minutes to soften the nail and skin, in order to experience less discomfort when using this instrument.</li>
            <li> This little tool comes in handy. It can reach where most things can&#x27;t. I was able to get right to the problem with this tool.</li>
            <li> I have a problem big toe that was crushed in an accident. I use this tool to lift up embedded ingorwn nails exposing them for another tool to cut the ingrown nail out. I works just fine.</li>
            <li> This thing works awesome. I bought this and the Satin Edge 2 sided ingrown toenail file, 8.1 Ounce. While I do use them both, I use this one way more. All it is, is a thin, smooth piece of metal, that slides easy, and can lift the ingrown toenail so you can cut it. I had to go to the doc&#x27;s before and have him remove a portion of the nail... That hurt, this was easy.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I was in agonizing PAIN in my toe because of an ingrown toenail! This was my first experience with an ingrown toenail so I really didn&#x27;t know what to do. I was SO worried that I would have to go to the doctor to have it removed but I did a bit of research before so I could know what options I had, if any. My ingrown toenail was REALLY embedded so I purchased the DR. Scholl&#x27;s Ingrown Toenail Pain Reliever Kit &amp; after using that for 3 days my nail was soft enought that I could use this toenail lifter &amp; was able to loosen the nail up a bit before pulling it out. This worked like a charm &amp; I&#x27;m SO glad I purchased it!!! I would DEFINITELY recommend this little gadget because even though I felt some discomfort during the ingrown toenail removal, after it was over I felt SO RELIEVED!!! SUPER GREAT item &amp; certainly works as advertised! Thank you AMAZON.com for carrying this product!! :-)</li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet, but I am sur that it will do what it is intended for.</li>
            <li> Works great, love this item.</li>
            <li> I guess i was expecting something more like a dental pick ... both edges of this tool are large. Much larger than they appear in the picture</li>
            <li> Too small. Ineffective tools. Returned item.</li>
            <li> quality tool and cheap price so buy one !</li>
            <li> Great Product! Seller is honest, dependable, reasonable and fast!</li>
            <li> This tool works pretty well and is cheaply priced. However the metal can bend at the end, it isn&#x27;t strong in the least.</li>
            <li> Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
            <li> Different shoe styles promote ingrown toenails.  When I feel pressure on my big toe I use the toenail lifter on the corner of my toe and relieve the pressure and no ingrown toenail as a result.</li>
            <li> Precision made and effective tool for what ails you in conjunction with the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Ingrown Toenail Pain Reliever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend having one around if you suffer from this malady.</li>
            <li> This little tool is helping me tremendously in taking care of my chronic ingrown toe nails.  I have had both side of my big toe nails cut out by a podiatrist which was very painful and took a long time to heal.  In addition, one of the nails eventually fell off.  Both nails continue to grow in even though they are narrow nails now.  The lifter helps move it away from the skin and makes adding an antibiotic to a sore area much easier.</li>
            <li> Kinda big to get under things, would be a bit better if it was thinner.</li>
            <li> Solid surgical steel. Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Was useful in taking care of my in-grown nails.  Not sure that I would purchase this again or recommend it to any one</li>
            <li> Ordered this product to care for my wife&#x27;s feet(diabetic).It looks and feels like I finished this lifter in my basement.Misshapen and sharp edges that I would not put anywhere near her feet.I guess I&#x27;ll eat these and pay a little more and get the German or Italian one.These are made in Pakistan,if that matters to anyone.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly  and in great condition.  Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again! This really helps if you have bad ingrowns like I do. It cleans out any build up and helps to access any splinters that might occur.  I recommend getting the ingrown toenail filer to go along with this.  Make sure to soak your feet to make the nails a bit softer.  It really helps bring relief and keep infections at bay.  I also use tea tree oil neat on each side of my big toes to make sure that any infections brewing are nipped in the bud.</li>
            <li> This is strong and works very well for my personal pedicures.</li>
            <li> The edges are rounded and thick so it is hard to get under the nail and tends to slip for me at least.</li>
