            <li>I ordered the 547 Rose Pearl and was happier with that...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always put the glossy stuff on, but it adds a nice touch when I do.</li>
            <li>I was 100% happy would certainly order again.</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it, what can I say...</li>
            <li>Otherwise I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute color</li>
            <li>I love this color and Outlast.</li>
            <li>Received product quickly!  </li>
            <li>Product was new, as stated, and was exact color I asked for; applied excellently and only the top coat needed reapplied.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Pretty color and stays on lips well but is very drying to lips</li>
            <li>- pretty much looks just as it does in the picture.</li>

            <li>This is my new every day lip wear!</li>
            <li>just a little more &amp;#34;spark&amp;#34; in the color.</li>
            <li>This product is great, although this color was a little pale for me.  </li>
            <li>Usually if I wear lipstick it seems like it&#x27;s off within half an hour, so I like to use lip stain, and this is a good one.</li>
            <li>I love this color and it is very hard to find.</li>
            <li>For my busy schedule, this is the only one I can rely on.</li>

            <li> A little dryer  and lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle enough to go with everything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on other reviewers&#x27; notes, maybe I was send an old package :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look ugly when it starts fading either.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> Beautiful color, but chapped and shriveled my lips immediately. I even put on the accompanying lip balm and the color still shrunk off my lip line. My lips were so damaged I couldn&#x27;t even wear another lip color.&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviewers&#x27; notes, maybe I was send an old package :( Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> I have used this for a number of years and will continue to do so.  It truly does last all day, doesn&#x27;t smear (even at the dentist) and lasts through meals.  I have told many people about it and they are just as happy with it.  It is the only long-lasting product that doesn&#x27;t chap my lips.</li>
            <li> Best lip color ever.  The only one that will actually stay on and do what it says it will do.  I don&#x27;t bother with any other products now.  For my busy schedule, this is the only one I can rely on.</li>
            <li> Item was as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.  A little dryer  and lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> The color lasts all day. Usually if I wear lipstick it seems like it&#x27;s off within half an hour, so I like to use lip stain, and this is a good one. It&#x27;s a cute color - pretty much looks just as it does in the picture. I don&#x27;t always put the glossy stuff on, but it adds a nice touch when I do. The gloss does need to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My go to lip color. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love this color and Outlast.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly!  Product was new, as stated, and was exact color I asked for; applied excellently and only the top coat needed reapplied.</li>
