            <li>This is the best option for men available!</li>
            <li>very easy to apply and in no time hair just wipes away!  </li>
            <li>Good stuff - works as advertised and no burn or irritation.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Some what worked, still testing the duration for optimum result.</li>
            <li>It makes my husband feel good about himself.</li>
            <li>I tried ballsBALM because I heard good things</li>
            <li>still good..  </li>
            <li>The balm is good stuff too.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the balm that comes with this, however I have found the hair removal balm works great everywhere except where I wanted it to work the most!</li>
            <li>This product works great and the balls calm feels great after using hair removal cream.</li>
            <li>leaving me baby bottom smooth!!  </li>
            <li>The ladies love my balls!-</li>
            <li>Off product worked so much better!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>i have been using it on my chest and legs and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>works really great if you&#x27;re looking for smooth balls.</li>
            <li>say this because the product effectively removes hair.</li>
            <li>A warning to wait X amount of hours, or X amount of days would have been nice, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not hairy by any means, honestly I don&#x27;t have a problem with shaving with a razor, but I&#x27;d get irritation on my stomach from my pants</li>
            <li>If you follow the instrusctions the product does its job effectively.</li>
            <li>Does remove some hair, but i wouldn&#x27;t say its anymore effective than Nair or Veet.</li>
            <li>it gets warm then goes away</li>
            <li>: Rinse yourself off in a nice warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>THEN i&#x27;ll kind of use my fingers to remove any hair that didn&#x27;t just wipe off, sometimes the hair wills still SEEM attached and you just have to pull them off - no pain or anything involved.</li>
            <li>and I have to order my own supply.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>The Calm Balm is probably the best part; it feels like angels lightly blowing feathery kisses at your junk.</li>
            <li>If you follow the very clear directions, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>To be fair, not every product works for everyone, but also to be fair, realize there are a rash of products sold online that pay people to give them positive reviews, so I don&#x27;t know where this one fits.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it does exactly what it says, just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, no pain, great results.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t skip the lotion, very important.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and the by far the best hair removal product.</li>
            <li>make sure it penetrates it will leave your body like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves it :)</li>
            <li>The bair pair has arrived in Europe :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I chose Balls Balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with how after 15 minutes on each area...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>sac is silky smooth!</li>
            <li>tube when I cut the top off to get all the remaining cream out of the tube.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions as best as I could, and my initial impressions were that this was a 4 star product.  </li>
            <li>I left it on for about 20 minutes and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have found that using nitrile/latex gloves helps keep my hands from burning, and it helps to spread the cream more</li>
            <li>In fact you can rub the hairs off for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this item</li>
            <li>Will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li>Nothing else to do for two weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for better results from the product.</li>
            <li>Also it gets better with repeated use.</li>
            <li>I literally bled when I used Nair downstairs many years ago.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that the more you use this product (repeated uses over time)</li>
            <li>I sure had better that worked</li>
            <li>I am making my girlfriend use ballsbaum now :).</li>
            <li>, I would choose this product over shaving by many orders of magnitude.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>, I would choose this product over shaving by many orders of magnitude.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>At 12 I got most.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this stuff because I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this stuff - :)  </li>
            <li>My wife loves the results and that means I benefit : ).</li>
            <li>so I dont love using it downstairs</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love the product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part is not feeling embarrassed when my buddies find it.  </li>
            <li>Really worked great.  </li>
            <li>No problems with chemical burn works better than shaving</li>
            <li>I did get some razor bumps, but not as many as if I would have shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WAY better.</li>
            <li>More like a menthol feeling.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is Venus.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Much better than shaving.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It really works!!!!</li>
            <li>and it really works!!!!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, removed all the hair on my body.  </li>
            <li>worked good, no pain removed the hair pretty good&lt;br /&gt;way</li>
            <li>Would not use without Calm, works like it&#x27;s name!!</li>
            <li>Originally ordered the starter package, but after seeing how well it worked - no stinging, or irritation, I stepped up and bought the family pack!  </li>
            <li>and I encourage you to try it if you enjoy smooth wheels! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Fine , love with it .</li>
            <li>Very cool stuff fellas,</li>
            <li>My girlfriend was very pleased with the results ;)</li>
            <li>works great and doesn&#x27;t bother the sensitive areas at all.  </li>
            <li>Great Product Really Works Great in that Private Area!!</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, really works well.</li>
            <li>The balm does have a nice smell to it and it is more gentle on the skin compared to Nair for Men.</li>
            <li>Makes \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; easy.  </li>
            <li>no burn, just an easy process.  </li>
            <li>This prosuct is in my eyes the best hair removal for men hands down</li>
            <li>This stuff works just fine.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>So easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>If you want to avoid a clogged drain, remove most of the cream/hair, scraping it into the trash, then quickly shower in luke-warm water, using the glove to finish-up.</li>
            <li>The Bare Pair is amazing!</li>
            <li>I wonder why they didn&#x27;t have it available for a while</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and then just hop in the shower, wipe off, and be smooth -</li>
            <li>and in conjunction with the buttery smooth aftercare lotion.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Smooth as eggs.</li>
            <li>The after lotion is great and help prevent ingrown hairs and red bumps.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my ears to remove the growing hair and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>After using the glove, it came off smooth as baby skin.</li>
            <li>This will keep you from reapplying the balm to areas you&#x27;ve already done, resulting in your front side being as smooth as the day you popped into this world.</li>
            <li>the Calm Balm is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This stuff works wonders and leaves you smooth without burning.</li>
            <li>In areas that you can see while you are applying and using the glove, it&#x27;s razor blade smooth.</li>
            <li>For best results and efficiency, I suggest doing different areas at a time instead of doing your whole body, if you were planning that.</li>
            <li>I first bought the single bottle BB and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply liberally and often in the first day or two.</li>
            <li>better than hot wax</li>
            <li>This still doesn&#x27;t smell very nice at all, and I&#x27;d like to take away a star, but frankly nothing else comes close and the smell washes away with all the hairy remains of your less sexy, kempt self.</li>
            <li>I bought this in hopes of helping me stay clean bodied.</li>
            <li>I wasnt super accurate in my count</li>
            <li>My girlfriend sure does love how smooth Bare Pair makes me.</li>
            <li>After using both products, I will most certainly stick to this product exclusively.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, the hair was falling right off!</li>
            <li>this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling baby smooth, but it&#x27;s pretty dang close!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be in front of Santa&#x27;s sled shining his way with my ball bag leading the way from how bright and red it is.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t always get every last spot, but it does a good job for what it is.</li>
            <li>Products like Veet do it really fast, and the longer the stuff is on your skin the more it will react to your skin.  </li>
            <li>product has been a dream come true.</li>
            <li>product has been a dream come true.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough the rest of my body including my uh &amp;#34;coin purse&amp;#34; were completely fine; no pain or irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li>So glad to live in the 21&#x27;st century!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed and cannot believe it took me this long to find bare balm.</li>
            <li>Removed it as quickly as I could</li>
            <li>The part I love the most is no razor burn and no itching when the hair starts to grow back in.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying this more than once within 24 hours, it will most likely burn.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment too</li>
            <li>So glad to live in the</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate really well when rinsing off, this will help to &amp;#34;break off&amp;#34; any stubborn hairs and not have any stragglers the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li>Worked exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this with some skepticism, but was pleasantly surprised by the quick delivery, and even more so by the product performance.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for that baby smooth feel down under, do follow the instructions especially in the areas that don&#x27;t see the light often if you get my drift !!!!</li>
            <li>So it is amazing to me that people here who describe themselves as such have had luck with this product.  </li>
            <li>but I think any lotion would work to just help calm the skin.  </li>
            <li>And it you really want to have smooth balls, i recommend using the ladies razors (disposable ) for their legs.  </li>
            <li>Far better than the result of shaving.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the patience to take care of some man business.  </li>
            <li>Also found that if you put the paste directly on skin with the tube, then work it in with the stick, it grabs the hairs better as opposed to squeezing the stuff out of the tube onto the skin and trying to rub it in with the stick.  </li>
            <li>gives you soft, smooth skin that almost all women enjoy feeling.</li>
            <li>Before this I used an electric trimmer like the kind you use on your hair and it left lots of hair on.  </li>
            <li>but i also lift weights a lot and enjoy having my shirt off in nice weather, bought this to try and remove hair from my upper body (chest and back) and the first time i used it was was mildy pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this stuff so far!</li>
            <li>spread it on, wait, and then the hair wipes right off.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors and don&#x27;t really like many smells at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, and ofourse there will be past reviews that are written by ignorant people.  </li>
            <li>I could easily see how someone with sensitive skin would get a burning sensation tho.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, the instructions are clear, and I had no adverse reactions to using it.</li>
            <li>She felt a really mild burn near her most sensitive skin, but it was gone within an hour, and did not phase her from using it again and again.</li>
            <li>I used this EXACTLY as the instructions said to use it, and the good news is, I had little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Ok gents (and ladies?), here is my personal review.</li>
            <li>This was a first for me</li>
            <li>It works exactly like it says.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have ordered this product and I will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I needed drano.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly as it told me to and the side of my sack got singed like if I was asking the devil to poke his pitchfork on it.</li>
            <li>each tube is bigger than normal, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>LEFT A LOT OF STUBLE, NAIR WORKED BETTER</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT be tempted to re-apply the treatment if you don&#x27;t think it worked the first time.  </li>
            <li>I ignored it at first</li>
            <li>If you do the balls first, you will get burned since they will spend more time with the paste on, LEAVE THE BALLS FOR LAST!!!</li>
            <li>Does exactly as decribed and doesn&#x27;t make you cry over your family jewels.</li>
            <li>Unlike ballsbaum, which almost instantly disintegrates hair on contact :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any adverse reactions, rashes, redness, or skin problems</li>
            <li>Unlike ballsbaum, which almost instantly disintegrates hair on contact :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any adverse reactions, rashes, redness, or skin problems</li>
            <li>I put it on my chest first, then my abdomen, and waited 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain about that!</li>
            <li>I would not use it right before a date since you are virtually ensuring certain activities will not take place.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty liquidy</li>
            <li>The result was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is the first product like this I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>like the instructions say, it works better if your &amp;#34;pair&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t hanging low.</li>
            <li>What i really love about this compared to shaving - when the hair starts growing back in, it&#x27;s not all itchy and scratchy.</li>
            <li>The smell is great as well and the effect last a long time.</li>
            <li>They are easier to use then mens razors, are smoother to those sensitive areas, and I have never cut myself, and afterward, you have smooth balls and surrounding areas.  </li>
            <li>This is my first attempt at hair removal</li>
            <li>After several days everything is still as smooth as a babies butt!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li>Cheaper and more private than waxing.</li>
            <li>Safe enough for all skin including sack and crack.</li>
            <li>Now he&#x27;s so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back for more.</li>
            <li>Good product works well may miss a few but</li>
            <li>So far so good, I haven&#x27;t had the flasn&amp;go very long, and I realize it takes time to see the effects.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I haven&#x27;t had the flasn&amp;go very long, and I realize it takes time to see the effects.</li>
            <li>Much like most other products on the market, it simply burned off the part of the hair that it touched, which makes it pretty much as effective as shaving.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use enough of it, leave it on for about 15 minutes and gently take it off in the shower.</li>
            <li>, glad bought the whole package last me longer.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m clean down there my wife wants the D a lot more often, so I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li>I would suggest trimming first so not to have to use too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty straight</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter ready to remove it at the first sign of any burning.  </li>
            <li>I read all of the comments, and have really been looking for something that I could use in the &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34;  but the first time I tried the BALLS product it did not remove any hair.  </li>
            <li>The product left me hair free soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Hair removal requires an easy spread-on application, 12-14 minute wait time, then I recommend using the wooden applicators to scrape off the excess cream, including the loosened follicles, BEFORE hittin&#x27; the shower to then use of the exfoliating</li>
            <li>Even the hair that was left was easily removed afterward.  </li>
            <li>Balls Balm is pure awesomeness.</li>
            <li>Oh and I love the new bigger size!!!</li>
            <li>(my left foot looked completely fine), but I did not feel any burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use a very high end waterproof cordless shaver to shave much of my body.</li>
            <li>This product is an absolute winner.  </li>
            <li>After that, I hopped in the shower with my glove and began gently scrubbing my feet.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li>I used it on the pubic hair on the balls and stomach, and now im left with a completely smooth area there.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the product to leave my skin completely smooth, but it left my skin feeling prickly.</li>
            <li>I waited 24hrs and tried to get the remainder off and it really started to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>So smooth, and the results last days longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling smooth without the razor nicks and burns.</li>
            <li>Use the glove to remove the excess hair and gently rub in circles to keep from getting ingrowns.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes the hair off at the surface leaving a lot of stubble (felt very uncomfortable)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You get more than I expected with this combo...</li>
            <li>I received more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any man that is embarrassed about there unusual amount of body hair.</li>
            <li>A word of caution though, please make sure you read the directions carefully.</li>
            <li>Put it on, set a 13 min timer, then jumped in the shower and gently scrubbed off.</li>
            <li>Not to mention much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works very well for what it does.....</li>
            <li>I had no irritation and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I could give this product -5</li>
            <li>I find I do not get much removal at 10.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what else to say about</li>
            <li>Really, that&#x27;s step 5.</li>
            <li>, a really Amazon buy.</li>
            <li>Worked really well on chest hair as well.</li>
            <li>It left me free of hair and did not burn or smellnbad.</li>
            <li>the glove is what really sealed the deal.</li>
            <li>2nd time, waited a few more minutes longer and applied more, no improvement.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, does what it&#x27;s supposed to, just don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
            <li>That night and the next day my whole body was smooth and it felt nice, but after a day and a half my body had stubbles everywhere so essentially the smoothness wont last more than 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>It was effective and there was some tingling and very slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li>: Smells better than other lotion hair removers.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Read plenty of other reviews for why you should not do a treatment more than once every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>It works to much better than other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, although I had no adverse reactions the first time, I had to go back and do some detail work a second, and a third time, to get everything perfect down there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You may be able to do your own research and find out the truth but from what I can tell these kinds of topical hair removal products make your hair weak and willing to let go near the follicle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additional note to guys who are starting like I did - from full hair.</li>
            <li>Not terrible but not exactly worth it either.</li>
            <li>I waited the full 15 minutes, (and actually, contrary to the safety warnings, a bit longer..</li>
            <li>first time I used this, my skin was a bit sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>WAAAAAAAAAY better than shaving down there.</li>
            <li>The second time i used it (about 2 weeks later) i decided to do it when the hair was shorter than before hoping for better results...</li>
            <li>I would say to rub it about in the shower for a quick second before you begin to rinse you parts off.</li>
            <li>Red patch stayed for 4 more days, but definitely worked well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, so night before leaving, we do his entire back.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great and doesn&#x27;t have the same unpleasant smell that most do.</li>
            <li>Besides the holes in my fingers it worked fine but the smooth skin really only lasted a day and a half and because I needed 2 bottles to cover all my hairy areas</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t try using this immediately after a sweaty activity, but so long as i&#x27;m clean</li>
            <li>wow, i feel like a new man!!</li>
            <li>Worked great, as long as you follow the directions and the helpful comments left by other reviewers.</li>
            <li>The calm balm is absolutely great all over your body and doesn&#x27;t feel disgustingly greasy like most lotions made for men do.  </li>
            <li>As a guy with a mixture of moderately hairy areas (chest, legs), very hairy zones (pubes), and lightly hairy surfaces (back, butt, thighs), I have had every opportunity to try this hair removal system just about everywhere</li>
            <li>It has been a few days and still as smooth as a babies butt!  </li>
            <li>just make sure you do a test spot first to see if you have delicate skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review after a few more uses.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for any of you gents out there looking to do personal grooming the right way.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the results and my better half likes the difference; I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I should have taken a picture of what happened near my belly button area almost INSTANTLY after I put on this super sucking cream.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my right foot was slightly red</li>
            <li>While the application may not have removed the hair, it made it weak and willing to come off, so if your first application did not appear to remove all of the hair, even after you used the supplied gloves afterwards to grope yourself, you can easily manually pinch the hairs away.  </li>
            <li>The whole \\&quot;bare your balls\\&quot; thing doesn&#x27;t particularly appeal to women.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only small beef is I wish I could get more of the calm balm in the set.  </li>
            <li>I took more than expected when I actually used it, but I assume it was because my arms were hairy.</li>
            <li>The one major difference is that using BB was much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it when everything came back in</li>
            <li>There is a warning on the bottle that an allergic reaction could occur during the first, second, or any use for that matter, but I&#x27;ve had no issues and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>Again, this is only on the first session.</li>
            <li>The area around the anus is clearly the most difficult, but over the course of 3 applications spaced out over a week, it is 90% smooth.</li>
            <li>but if it burns a bit the first time, give is a second</li>
            <li>I used it according exactly to the directions...based on prior user comments.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I waited ten minutes, tested one area, and went to town with the glove.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that the end result lasts longer than shaving, but is certainly more convenient without the risk of nicks and razor burn.  </li>
            <li>pretty bad skin burn in the same area that before only experienced mild irritation.  </li>
            <li>The day i use it i wake up 15-20 minutes earlier than normal, use the applicator (Popsicle stick thing) to apply and decent coating to all areas -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using The Bare Pair.</li>
            <li>Subsequent uses it has been a little more whisker like.</li>
            <li>boys\\&quot; but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will take care of the other super sensitive regions... it works there too.</li>
            <li>have always had clear skin</li>
            <li>I am naturally a hairy guy</li>
            <li>it was soft, it was unlike when shaving.</li>
            <li>After applying directly on my balls, like after 1 min</li>
            <li>This a not for people with sensitive skin or have never done this before.</li>
            <li>Maybe my hair is too coarse but didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>If it really works for someone they must only have peach fuzz on there balls , because it did nothing.</li>
            <li>5 stars and a regular purchase from me, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and wow.....</li>
            <li>&quot; by far has my vote.  </li>
            <li>I could not get it off fast enough.</li>
            <li>Just things guys don&#x27;t think about - the crease of our &amp;#34;bikini area&amp;#34; is sensitive, guys.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately they do not include spreaders anymore, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Subsequent sessions have gone much smoother (pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leave it on for 12 minutes or more in one area and you guarantee some medium burning irritation for at least two days, but it will be nothing like what the men who tried Veet describe.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fotunately the redness has gone away, but the area near my belly where the reaction happened, isn&#x27;t completley gone yet.</li>
            <li>I have course legs hair but extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and wow, I have never seen skin turn that color and had pain like that.</li>
            <li>: after your shower, take some clippers to those not so sensitive areas to clear up where you&#x27;re going to apply this stuff.</li>
            <li>Looks like something a five year old lost on his way to kindergarten...in 1962.  </li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin this is just like nair...</li>
            <li>I think the second go round will work even better.</li>
            <li>Having 3 tubes should last quite a while considering the first application barely made a dent in my supply.</li>
            <li>I was nervous of course to spread a cream full of chemicals all over down there but except for a slight warming sensation that quickly faded I had no issues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be doing another application to clean up a couple spots I missed and to see if this product will remove the little bit of stubble that remains...</li>
            <li>I tried it on other areas instead of going right to the sensitive regions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Needed to apply a couple of times the first time but later only need to apply once</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the the most private area and no more cuts or razor bumps from shaving.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for the smoothest balls possible.</li>
            <li>- I essentially paid $40.00 for less than 2 days of smooth, hairless skin.  </li>
            <li>but I found that it works very well there as long as you limit your times.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, it did remove some of the hair, but left me with red bumps all over the place, and the whole genital area and anus area were extremely sensitive for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The balm helped desensitize the pain from using the hair removal cream, but the damage was done and took about two weeks for the skin to get back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It removes most of the hair and what it doesnt remove, it seems to reduce to thin white hair that doesnt really show up.  </li>
            <li>When used infrequently, it does an adequate job with little to no agitation to the skin, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to reccomend this product, for infrequent use, to anyone.</li>
            <li>Item is excellent now if you are new to the product order wax sticks the big ones, don&#x27;t be shy with the product spread in thick areas like it was frosting</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the reason, i&#x27;ve applied the cream to my... hanging parts, and if i just stand there, the cream will also wipe off on my inner things, this reduces the amount of cream where i wanted it and leads to removing hair on my inner things, which i didn&#x27;t really care about.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so easy, apply a thick layer, let sit 10-12 minutes, and then wash off in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure a second treatment will do the trick, but there were so very few hairs left (like 2 or 3 on each foot) that I just decided to pluck them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as results, it&#x27;s tends to leave a few little hairs around in nooks and crannies, but I suspect that&#x27;s more application technique than product performance.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is very soothing and after you use the first tube you hardly even notice the effects.</li>
            <li>I just recently bought this Threesome Pac, and am completely amazed on the work it did to my body.</li>
            <li>whatever,  I have to warn against using a bare hand to apply the balm; it carries the smell for a day or two...</li>
            <li>and it will not remove as much hair as expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work for me and burns if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Do your maintenance at night, sleep after you rinse it off, then shower in the morning with soap and smell is barely there.</li>
            <li>balls may use something different than Veet, or they simply use different concentrations, but what I found comparing my wife&#x27;s experience using Veet on her legs and my experience using this stuff on my intimate areas is that you need to give balls some time to work, and then get it off before it has time to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally after about SEVEN MONTHS the redness sensitive area on my belly has gone away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a 50 year old man who has been shaving his entire life either.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re using a chemical on your body (probably the sensitive bits) that essentially burns hair away.</li>
            <li>Apply Bare Balm liberally to the desired area.</li>
            <li>as for the sensitive areas i went 8 min the second time and still burned me</li>
            <li>My husband lost a bet and had to go bare.</li>
            <li>Not everyone has the same skin type, and different skin types react differently to products like this, so not everyone will have the same positive result as me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like a scrub brush except slightly softer for use on the body.</li>
            <li>I just received this package today and only tested it on my feet and toes, since they&#x27;re pretty hairy and annoying (and also since you&#x27;re supposed to test it before getting to the good stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It only kept me smooth for a few days, but after two weeks, it&#x27;s coming back slowly and feels pretty soft.</li>
            <li>It removed most of the hair leaving only a few small spots i had to shave after with only mild irritation to my chest and upper stomach that subsided in about a day, but the hair grew back a lot faster than i had expected.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about this product at first.  </li>
            <li>The first time it got all of the hair down to a stubble, the second time removed what was left.  </li>
            <li>Waited 24 hours, did again, to whole legs, hips down.</li>
            <li>No problem, just put the Calm Balm on it that night, then 3 times the next day, and very little irritation.</li>
            <li>This product is not gentle in any way and caused chemical burns in very sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>The first few uses may make your junk feel like a Normandy bunker getting lit up with napalm, but it stops after the first use or two and is a small price to pay for deforesting the Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair doesnt really grow quickly in general but I only need to use the product every few weeks.  </li>
            <li>My hair also grows back insanely fast, so I only get to experience the hairless feeling for less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if you want painless intimate hair removal you need to do a little work.  </li>
            <li>if you leave the body cream on too long you will have to put up with some major skin irritation.</li>
            <li>the base and balls handled it perfect with little discomfort</li>
            <li>This product, whole process went down in under 20 minutes, including a shower!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say the ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL BAD.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>

            <li> This is the best option for men available!</li>
            <li> very easy to apply and in no time hair just wipes away!  </li>
            <li> Good stuff - works as advertised and no burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> Some what worked, still testing the duration for optimum result.</li>
            <li> It makes my husband feel good about himself.</li>
            <li> I tried ballsBALM because I heard good things</li>
            <li> still good..  </li>
            <li> The balm is good stuff too.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the balm that comes with this, however I have found the hair removal balm works great everywhere except where I wanted it to work the most!</li>
            <li> This product works great and the balls calm feels great after using hair removal cream.</li>
            <li> leaving me baby bottom smooth!!  </li>
            <li> The ladies love my balls!-</li>
            <li> Off product worked so much better!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> i have been using it on my chest and legs and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> works really great if you&#x27;re looking for smooth balls.</li>
            <li> say this because the product effectively removes hair.</li>
            <li> A warning to wait X amount of hours, or X amount of days would have been nice, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not hairy by any means, honestly I don&#x27;t have a problem with shaving with a razor, but I&#x27;d get irritation on my stomach from my pants</li>
            <li> If you follow the instrusctions the product does its job effectively.</li>
            <li> Does remove some hair, but i wouldn&#x27;t say its anymore effective than Nair or Veet.</li>
            <li> it gets warm then goes away</li>
            <li> : Rinse yourself off in a nice warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> THEN i&#x27;ll kind of use my fingers to remove any hair that didn&#x27;t just wipe off, sometimes the hair wills still SEEM attached and you just have to pull them off - no pain or anything involved.</li>
            <li> and I have to order my own supply.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> The Calm Balm is probably the best part; it feels like angels lightly blowing feathery kisses at your junk.</li>
            <li> If you follow the very clear directions, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> To be fair, not every product works for everyone, but also to be fair, realize there are a rash of products sold online that pay people to give them positive reviews, so I don&#x27;t know where this one fits.  </li>
            <li> Great product, it does exactly what it says, just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, no pain, great results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t skip the lotion, very important.  </li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and the by far the best hair removal product.</li>
            <li> make sure it penetrates it will leave your body like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it :)</li>
            <li> The bair pair has arrived in Europe :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I chose Balls Balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with how after 15 minutes on each area...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> sac is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> tube when I cut the top off to get all the remaining cream out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions as best as I could, and my initial impressions were that this was a 4 star product.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for about 20 minutes and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have found that using nitrile/latex gloves helps keep my hands from burning, and it helps to spread the cream more</li>
            <li> In fact you can rub the hairs off for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this item</li>
            <li> Will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> Nothing else to do for two weeks or more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for better results from the product.</li>
            <li> Also it gets better with repeated use.</li>
            <li> I literally bled when I used Nair downstairs many years ago.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that the more you use this product (repeated uses over time)</li>
            <li> I sure had better that worked</li>
            <li> I am making my girlfriend use ballsbaum now :).</li>
            <li> , I would choose this product over shaving by many orders of magnitude.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> , I would choose this product over shaving by many orders of magnitude.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> At 12 I got most.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff because I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this stuff - :)  </li>
            <li> My wife loves the results and that means I benefit : ).</li>
            <li> so I dont love using it downstairs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love the product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part is not feeling embarrassed when my buddies find it.  </li>
            <li> Really worked great.  </li>
            <li> No problems with chemical burn works better than shaving</li>
            <li> I did get some razor bumps, but not as many as if I would have shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WAY better.</li>
            <li> More like a menthol feeling.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is Venus.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Much better than shaving.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It really works!!!!</li>
            <li> and it really works!!!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, removed all the hair on my body.  </li>
            <li> worked good, no pain removed the hair pretty good&lt;br /&gt;way</li>
            <li> Would not use without Calm, works like it&#x27;s name!!</li>
            <li> Originally ordered the starter package, but after seeing how well it worked - no stinging, or irritation, I stepped up and bought the family pack!  </li>
            <li> and I encourage you to try it if you enjoy smooth wheels! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Fine , love with it .</li>
            <li> Very cool stuff fellas,</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was very pleased with the results ;)</li>
            <li> works great and doesn&#x27;t bother the sensitive areas at all.  </li>
            <li> Great Product Really Works Great in that Private Area!!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, really works well.</li>
            <li> The balm does have a nice smell to it and it is more gentle on the skin compared to Nair for Men.</li>
            <li> Makes \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; easy.  </li>
            <li> no burn, just an easy process.  </li>
            <li> This prosuct is in my eyes the best hair removal for men hands down</li>
            <li> This stuff works just fine.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> So easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li> If you want to avoid a clogged drain, remove most of the cream/hair, scraping it into the trash, then quickly shower in luke-warm water, using the glove to finish-up.</li>
            <li> The Bare Pair is amazing!</li>
            <li> I wonder why they didn&#x27;t have it available for a while</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and then just hop in the shower, wipe off, and be smooth -</li>
            <li> and in conjunction with the buttery smooth aftercare lotion.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Smooth as eggs.</li>
            <li> The after lotion is great and help prevent ingrown hairs and red bumps.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my ears to remove the growing hair and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> After using the glove, it came off smooth as baby skin.</li>
            <li> This will keep you from reapplying the balm to areas you&#x27;ve already done, resulting in your front side being as smooth as the day you popped into this world.</li>
            <li> the Calm Balm is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders and leaves you smooth without burning.</li>
            <li> In areas that you can see while you are applying and using the glove, it&#x27;s razor blade smooth.</li>
            <li> For best results and efficiency, I suggest doing different areas at a time instead of doing your whole body, if you were planning that.</li>
            <li> I first bought the single bottle BB and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply liberally and often in the first day or two.</li>
            <li> better than hot wax</li>
            <li> This still doesn&#x27;t smell very nice at all, and I&#x27;d like to take away a star, but frankly nothing else comes close and the smell washes away with all the hairy remains of your less sexy, kempt self.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of helping me stay clean bodied.</li>
            <li> I wasnt super accurate in my count</li>
            <li> My girlfriend sure does love how smooth Bare Pair makes me.</li>
            <li> After using both products, I will most certainly stick to this product exclusively.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, the hair was falling right off!</li>
            <li> this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling baby smooth, but it&#x27;s pretty dang close!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be in front of Santa&#x27;s sled shining his way with my ball bag leading the way from how bright and red it is.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t always get every last spot, but it does a good job for what it is.</li>
            <li> Products like Veet do it really fast, and the longer the stuff is on your skin the more it will react to your skin.  </li>
            <li> product has been a dream come true.</li>
            <li> product has been a dream come true.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough the rest of my body including my uh &amp;#34;coin purse&amp;#34; were completely fine; no pain or irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> So glad to live in the 21&#x27;st century!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed and cannot believe it took me this long to find bare balm.</li>
            <li> Removed it as quickly as I could</li>
            <li> The part I love the most is no razor burn and no itching when the hair starts to grow back in.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying this more than once within 24 hours, it will most likely burn.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment too</li>
            <li> So glad to live in the</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate really well when rinsing off, this will help to &amp;#34;break off&amp;#34; any stubborn hairs and not have any stragglers the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li> Worked exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this with some skepticism, but was pleasantly surprised by the quick delivery, and even more so by the product performance.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for that baby smooth feel down under, do follow the instructions especially in the areas that don&#x27;t see the light often if you get my drift !!!!</li>
            <li> So it is amazing to me that people here who describe themselves as such have had luck with this product.  </li>
            <li> but I think any lotion would work to just help calm the skin.  </li>
            <li> And it you really want to have smooth balls, i recommend using the ladies razors (disposable ) for their legs.  </li>
            <li> Far better than the result of shaving.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the patience to take care of some man business.  </li>
            <li> Also found that if you put the paste directly on skin with the tube, then work it in with the stick, it grabs the hairs better as opposed to squeezing the stuff out of the tube onto the skin and trying to rub it in with the stick.  </li>
            <li> gives you soft, smooth skin that almost all women enjoy feeling.</li>
            <li> Before this I used an electric trimmer like the kind you use on your hair and it left lots of hair on.  </li>
            <li> but i also lift weights a lot and enjoy having my shirt off in nice weather, bought this to try and remove hair from my upper body (chest and back) and the first time i used it was was mildy pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this stuff so far!</li>
            <li> spread it on, wait, and then the hair wipes right off.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors and don&#x27;t really like many smells at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, and ofourse there will be past reviews that are written by ignorant people.  </li>
            <li> I could easily see how someone with sensitive skin would get a burning sensation tho.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, the instructions are clear, and I had no adverse reactions to using it.</li>
            <li> She felt a really mild burn near her most sensitive skin, but it was gone within an hour, and did not phase her from using it again and again.</li>
            <li> I used this EXACTLY as the instructions said to use it, and the good news is, I had little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Ok gents (and ladies?), here is my personal review.</li>
            <li> This was a first for me</li>
            <li> It works exactly like it says.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product and I will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I needed drano.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as it told me to and the side of my sack got singed like if I was asking the devil to poke his pitchfork on it.</li>
            <li> each tube is bigger than normal, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> LEFT A LOT OF STUBLE, NAIR WORKED BETTER</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT be tempted to re-apply the treatment if you don&#x27;t think it worked the first time.  </li>
            <li> I ignored it at first</li>
            <li> If you do the balls first, you will get burned since they will spend more time with the paste on, LEAVE THE BALLS FOR LAST!!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as decribed and doesn&#x27;t make you cry over your family jewels.</li>
            <li> Unlike ballsbaum, which almost instantly disintegrates hair on contact :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any adverse reactions, rashes, redness, or skin problems</li>
            <li> Unlike ballsbaum, which almost instantly disintegrates hair on contact :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any adverse reactions, rashes, redness, or skin problems</li>
            <li> I put it on my chest first, then my abdomen, and waited 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain about that!</li>
            <li> I would not use it right before a date since you are virtually ensuring certain activities will not take place.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty liquidy</li>
            <li> The result was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the first product like this I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> like the instructions say, it works better if your &amp;#34;pair&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t hanging low.</li>
            <li> What i really love about this compared to shaving - when the hair starts growing back in, it&#x27;s not all itchy and scratchy.</li>
            <li> The smell is great as well and the effect last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are easier to use then mens razors, are smoother to those sensitive areas, and I have never cut myself, and afterward, you have smooth balls and surrounding areas.  </li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at hair removal</li>
            <li> After several days everything is still as smooth as a babies butt!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li> Cheaper and more private than waxing.</li>
            <li> Safe enough for all skin including sack and crack.</li>
            <li> Now he&#x27;s so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back for more.</li>
            <li> Good product works well may miss a few but</li>
            <li> So far so good, I haven&#x27;t had the flasn&amp;go very long, and I realize it takes time to see the effects.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I haven&#x27;t had the flasn&amp;go very long, and I realize it takes time to see the effects.</li>
            <li> Much like most other products on the market, it simply burned off the part of the hair that it touched, which makes it pretty much as effective as shaving.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use enough of it, leave it on for about 15 minutes and gently take it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> , glad bought the whole package last me longer.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m clean down there my wife wants the D a lot more often, so I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I would suggest trimming first so not to have to use too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty straight</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter ready to remove it at the first sign of any burning.  </li>
            <li> I read all of the comments, and have really been looking for something that I could use in the &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34;  but the first time I tried the BALLS product it did not remove any hair.  </li>
            <li> The product left me hair free soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Hair removal requires an easy spread-on application, 12-14 minute wait time, then I recommend using the wooden applicators to scrape off the excess cream, including the loosened follicles, BEFORE hittin&#x27; the shower to then use of the exfoliating</li>
            <li> Even the hair that was left was easily removed afterward.  </li>
            <li> Balls Balm is pure awesomeness.</li>
            <li> Oh and I love the new bigger size!!!</li>
            <li> (my left foot looked completely fine), but I did not feel any burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use a very high end waterproof cordless shaver to shave much of my body.</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute winner.  </li>
            <li> After that, I hopped in the shower with my glove and began gently scrubbing my feet.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li> I used it on the pubic hair on the balls and stomach, and now im left with a completely smooth area there.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the product to leave my skin completely smooth, but it left my skin feeling prickly.</li>
            <li> I waited 24hrs and tried to get the remainder off and it really started to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> So smooth, and the results last days longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling smooth without the razor nicks and burns.</li>
            <li> Use the glove to remove the excess hair and gently rub in circles to keep from getting ingrowns.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes the hair off at the surface leaving a lot of stubble (felt very uncomfortable)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You get more than I expected with this combo...</li>
            <li> I received more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any man that is embarrassed about there unusual amount of body hair.</li>
            <li> A word of caution though, please make sure you read the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> Put it on, set a 13 min timer, then jumped in the shower and gently scrubbed off.</li>
            <li> Not to mention much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Works very well for what it does.....</li>
            <li> I had no irritation and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I could give this product -5</li>
            <li> I find I do not get much removal at 10.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what else to say about</li>
            <li> Really, that&#x27;s step 5.</li>
            <li> , a really Amazon buy.</li>
            <li> Worked really well on chest hair as well.</li>
            <li> It left me free of hair and did not burn or smellnbad.</li>
            <li> the glove is what really sealed the deal.</li>
            <li> 2nd time, waited a few more minutes longer and applied more, no improvement.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, does what it&#x27;s supposed to, just don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> That night and the next day my whole body was smooth and it felt nice, but after a day and a half my body had stubbles everywhere so essentially the smoothness wont last more than 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> It was effective and there was some tingling and very slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li> : Smells better than other lotion hair removers.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Read plenty of other reviews for why you should not do a treatment more than once every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> It works to much better than other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, although I had no adverse reactions the first time, I had to go back and do some detail work a second, and a third time, to get everything perfect down there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You may be able to do your own research and find out the truth but from what I can tell these kinds of topical hair removal products make your hair weak and willing to let go near the follicle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additional note to guys who are starting like I did - from full hair.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not exactly worth it either.</li>
            <li> I waited the full 15 minutes, (and actually, contrary to the safety warnings, a bit longer..</li>
            <li> first time I used this, my skin was a bit sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li> WAAAAAAAAAY better than shaving down there.</li>
            <li> The second time i used it (about 2 weeks later) i decided to do it when the hair was shorter than before hoping for better results...</li>
            <li> I would say to rub it about in the shower for a quick second before you begin to rinse you parts off.</li>
            <li> Red patch stayed for 4 more days, but definitely worked well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, so night before leaving, we do his entire back.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great and doesn&#x27;t have the same unpleasant smell that most do.</li>
            <li> Besides the holes in my fingers it worked fine but the smooth skin really only lasted a day and a half and because I needed 2 bottles to cover all my hairy areas</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t try using this immediately after a sweaty activity, but so long as i&#x27;m clean</li>
            <li> wow, i feel like a new man!!</li>
            <li> Worked great, as long as you follow the directions and the helpful comments left by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The calm balm is absolutely great all over your body and doesn&#x27;t feel disgustingly greasy like most lotions made for men do.  </li>
            <li> As a guy with a mixture of moderately hairy areas (chest, legs), very hairy zones (pubes), and lightly hairy surfaces (back, butt, thighs), I have had every opportunity to try this hair removal system just about everywhere</li>
            <li> It has been a few days and still as smooth as a babies butt!  </li>
            <li> just make sure you do a test spot first to see if you have delicate skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for any of you gents out there looking to do personal grooming the right way.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the results and my better half likes the difference; I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I should have taken a picture of what happened near my belly button area almost INSTANTLY after I put on this super sucking cream.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my right foot was slightly red</li>
            <li> While the application may not have removed the hair, it made it weak and willing to come off, so if your first application did not appear to remove all of the hair, even after you used the supplied gloves afterwards to grope yourself, you can easily manually pinch the hairs away.  </li>
            <li> The whole \\&quot;bare your balls\\&quot; thing doesn&#x27;t particularly appeal to women.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only small beef is I wish I could get more of the calm balm in the set.  </li>
            <li> I took more than expected when I actually used it, but I assume it was because my arms were hairy.</li>
            <li> The one major difference is that using BB was much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it when everything came back in</li>
            <li> There is a warning on the bottle that an allergic reaction could occur during the first, second, or any use for that matter, but I&#x27;ve had no issues and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Again, this is only on the first session.</li>
            <li> The area around the anus is clearly the most difficult, but over the course of 3 applications spaced out over a week, it is 90% smooth.</li>
            <li> but if it burns a bit the first time, give is a second</li>
            <li> I used it according exactly to the directions...based on prior user comments.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I waited ten minutes, tested one area, and went to town with the glove.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the end result lasts longer than shaving, but is certainly more convenient without the risk of nicks and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> pretty bad skin burn in the same area that before only experienced mild irritation.  </li>
            <li> The day i use it i wake up 15-20 minutes earlier than normal, use the applicator (Popsicle stick thing) to apply and decent coating to all areas -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using The Bare Pair.</li>
            <li> Subsequent uses it has been a little more whisker like.</li>
            <li> boys\\&quot; but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will take care of the other super sensitive regions... it works there too.</li>
            <li> have always had clear skin</li>
            <li> I am naturally a hairy guy</li>
            <li> it was soft, it was unlike when shaving.</li>
            <li> After applying directly on my balls, like after 1 min</li>
            <li> This a not for people with sensitive skin or have never done this before.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too coarse but didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> If it really works for someone they must only have peach fuzz on there balls , because it did nothing.</li>
            <li> 5 stars and a regular purchase from me, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and wow.....</li>
            <li> &quot; by far has my vote.  </li>
            <li> I could not get it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> Just things guys don&#x27;t think about - the crease of our &amp;#34;bikini area&amp;#34; is sensitive, guys.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately they do not include spreaders anymore, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Subsequent sessions have gone much smoother (pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leave it on for 12 minutes or more in one area and you guarantee some medium burning irritation for at least two days, but it will be nothing like what the men who tried Veet describe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fotunately the redness has gone away, but the area near my belly where the reaction happened, isn&#x27;t completley gone yet.</li>
            <li> I have course legs hair but extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and wow, I have never seen skin turn that color and had pain like that.</li>
            <li> : after your shower, take some clippers to those not so sensitive areas to clear up where you&#x27;re going to apply this stuff.</li>
            <li> Looks like something a five year old lost on his way to kindergarten...in 1962.  </li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin this is just like nair...</li>
            <li> I think the second go round will work even better.</li>
            <li> Having 3 tubes should last quite a while considering the first application barely made a dent in my supply.</li>
            <li> I was nervous of course to spread a cream full of chemicals all over down there but except for a slight warming sensation that quickly faded I had no issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be doing another application to clean up a couple spots I missed and to see if this product will remove the little bit of stubble that remains...</li>
            <li> I tried it on other areas instead of going right to the sensitive regions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needed to apply a couple of times the first time but later only need to apply once</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the the most private area and no more cuts or razor bumps from shaving.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for the smoothest balls possible.</li>
            <li> - I essentially paid $40.00 for less than 2 days of smooth, hairless skin.  </li>
            <li> but I found that it works very well there as long as you limit your times.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, it did remove some of the hair, but left me with red bumps all over the place, and the whole genital area and anus area were extremely sensitive for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The balm helped desensitize the pain from using the hair removal cream, but the damage was done and took about two weeks for the skin to get back to normal.  </li>
            <li> It removes most of the hair and what it doesnt remove, it seems to reduce to thin white hair that doesnt really show up.  </li>
            <li> When used infrequently, it does an adequate job with little to no agitation to the skin, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to reccomend this product, for infrequent use, to anyone.</li>
            <li> Item is excellent now if you are new to the product order wax sticks the big ones, don&#x27;t be shy with the product spread in thick areas like it was frosting</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the reason, i&#x27;ve applied the cream to my... hanging parts, and if i just stand there, the cream will also wipe off on my inner things, this reduces the amount of cream where i wanted it and leads to removing hair on my inner things, which i didn&#x27;t really care about.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so easy, apply a thick layer, let sit 10-12 minutes, and then wash off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure a second treatment will do the trick, but there were so very few hairs left (like 2 or 3 on each foot) that I just decided to pluck them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as results, it&#x27;s tends to leave a few little hairs around in nooks and crannies, but I suspect that&#x27;s more application technique than product performance.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is very soothing and after you use the first tube you hardly even notice the effects.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this Threesome Pac, and am completely amazed on the work it did to my body.</li>
            <li> whatever,  I have to warn against using a bare hand to apply the balm; it carries the smell for a day or two...</li>
            <li> and it will not remove as much hair as expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me and burns if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Do your maintenance at night, sleep after you rinse it off, then shower in the morning with soap and smell is barely there.</li>
            <li> balls may use something different than Veet, or they simply use different concentrations, but what I found comparing my wife&#x27;s experience using Veet on her legs and my experience using this stuff on my intimate areas is that you need to give balls some time to work, and then get it off before it has time to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally after about SEVEN MONTHS the redness sensitive area on my belly has gone away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a 50 year old man who has been shaving his entire life either.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re using a chemical on your body (probably the sensitive bits) that essentially burns hair away.</li>
            <li> Apply Bare Balm liberally to the desired area.</li>
            <li> as for the sensitive areas i went 8 min the second time and still burned me</li>
            <li> My husband lost a bet and had to go bare.</li>
            <li> Not everyone has the same skin type, and different skin types react differently to products like this, so not everyone will have the same positive result as me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like a scrub brush except slightly softer for use on the body.</li>
            <li> I just received this package today and only tested it on my feet and toes, since they&#x27;re pretty hairy and annoying (and also since you&#x27;re supposed to test it before getting to the good stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only kept me smooth for a few days, but after two weeks, it&#x27;s coming back slowly and feels pretty soft.</li>
            <li> It removed most of the hair leaving only a few small spots i had to shave after with only mild irritation to my chest and upper stomach that subsided in about a day, but the hair grew back a lot faster than i had expected.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about this product at first.  </li>
            <li> The first time it got all of the hair down to a stubble, the second time removed what was left.  </li>
            <li> Waited 24 hours, did again, to whole legs, hips down.</li>
            <li> No problem, just put the Calm Balm on it that night, then 3 times the next day, and very little irritation.</li>
            <li> This product is not gentle in any way and caused chemical burns in very sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> The first few uses may make your junk feel like a Normandy bunker getting lit up with napalm, but it stops after the first use or two and is a small price to pay for deforesting the Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair doesnt really grow quickly in general but I only need to use the product every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> My hair also grows back insanely fast, so I only get to experience the hairless feeling for less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you want painless intimate hair removal you need to do a little work.  </li>
            <li> if you leave the body cream on too long you will have to put up with some major skin irritation.</li>
            <li> the base and balls handled it perfect with little discomfort</li>
            <li> This product, whole process went down in under 20 minutes, including a shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say the ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL BAD.</li>
            <li> After leaving this stuff on for 15 minutes and obtaining less than half @ssed results, it&#x27;s not even worth the time or effort.  </li>
            <li> The product works as described, doesn&#x27;t last long, costs 40 dollars, you only get enough for one use and it will burn holes through the skin on your hand.  </li>
            <li> : Can be a bit &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; if left directly on your huevos too long, so I recommend adding the lotion/cream to any other place you&#x27;re needing it, and then add it to your huevos last</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trimming up the sensitive areas, I suggest small scissors to clear away the bulk (gotta protect your junk, right?)&lt;br /&gt;4:</li>
            <li> Then, and i apologize if this sounds crass, but then i sit on the toilet, not to do anything but potentially read or play games on my phone.</li>
            <li> #34;it works great&amp;#34;... you may have many little hairs left behind after the application and feel like this product did not work.  </li>
            <li> Clearly it was on slightly longer than the recommended time, counting the application time, and i could definitely tell when i went to wipe it off my chest.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems at all, though I suggest not using too much in a short period of time (i.e. two days in a row) or leaving it on too long as it will burn.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s why I gave it only 2 stars, because it&#x27;s not completely lying as a product when it says that.  </li>
            <li> I left it on to long.</li>
            <li> I cant wait for the hairs to get long enough to wax andother depilatories</li>
            <li> In hindsight I think I hadn&#x27;t waited long enough and the &#x27;burning&#x27; sensation was from basically plucking not quite softened hairs out.  </li>
            <li> Removed all hair from down there easilly and completely in one try.</li>
            <li> I would suggest not trying this if your skin is the least bit sensitive and even if its not because mine is not that sensitive.</li>
            <li> On the bottle it does state that on sensitive areas leave for less time.</li>
            <li> I have one area that was a little sensitive, but overall it wasn&#x27;t bad at all and the balm does feel nice</li>
            <li> After reading a million reviews on other &amp;#34;lady specific&amp;#34; no shave treatments i stumbled upon Bare Balls.</li>
            <li> I usually have pretty tough skin but not tough enough for this.</li>
            <li> Afterwards jump in a warm shower not hot or cold cause that might hurt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other products to remove hair, always with the same results...</li>
            <li> and I was uncomfortable ordering a product originally designed for women that simply changed the label to say \\&quot;For Men\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> So I have just moved it up a little bit to get the action I need.  </li>
            <li> Overall, i highly recommend, One tube has gotten me through at least four applications, but a couple of those applications were two separate applications and learning experiences.</li>
            <li> product is definitely strong bulso gentle and doesnt smell as bad as other depilatories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cutting yourself with a razor is better than using this.  </li>
            <li> could not get this stuff off of me fast enough, It should come with a neutralizing agent otherwise it is difficult to remove completely</li>
            <li> (so it&#x27;s not on them too too long).  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions, don&#x27;t leave this on to long</li>
            <li> Too long</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that works this well and lasts as long as this one does.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money and I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> His entire back was flaming red, with small red dots.  </li>
            <li> It WILL BURN YOU if you leave it on just a minute too long.</li>
            <li> My skin got a bit irritated, but that&#x27;s my fault for leaving it on too long.  </li>
            <li> The product was a complete waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other creams with mixed results.</li>
            <li> but on other parts such as my lower leg, and arms it worked like a charm</li>
            <li> It only does the equivalent of an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> It only does the equivalent of an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy the calm balm again, but unfortunately the boys will need to put up with the razor</li>
            <li> Mainly because of the reviews that complained of burning.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting from the reviews I read before buying, it didn&#x27;t decimate every single hair on the applied area.</li>
            <li> but this created a lot of ingrown hair down low....</li>
            <li> I even used it when my nose got red during flu season and it cut the recovery time way down and cooled the burning feeling on all injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is leave the more difficult areas for last, meaning put on the skin patches first, then the balls (also leave the base of the neck for last if you&#x27;re using it for that).  </li>
            <li> So if you are a perfectionist, you might have to do some odd plucking or try a second</li>
            <li> It definitely smelled and felt like it was working, but when I went in the shower to wipe away, little to nothing came off.  </li>
            <li> The included moisturizer did help this a little bit, but not enough to raise it another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Area got a little red but that cleared up by morning.  </li>
            <li> I got the nerve up to try it again 2 weeks later and waited a little bit longer</li>
            <li> After a third use in a few days, the skin became agitated from the product.  </li>
            <li> But after some careful testing, I can say I have now used it under my arms,</li>
            <li> So, stay to the recommended time period carefully.</li>
            <li> I ordered it a few months ago and I am back!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t get too rough with it</li>
            <li> i have very coarse leg hair and using this product left all the roots still in my leg and many turned into ingrown hairs (very painful)</li>
            <li> For fear of being vulgar here, I would like to point out that not only does this stuff clean up \\&quot;the</li>
            <li> First off, I am a man, late 20&#x27;s, white skinned, with thick, dark black</li>
            <li> While the product did not burn as other hair removal products, it took off hair in spots and not very well where it didn&#x27;t take it off at all.</li>
            <li> My last use I got distracted and left this on longer than the max time, not by much, maybe 2 minutes, but I got a bad burning on my ball sack and an aggressive rash that took about 3 weeks of Hydrocortisone to stop.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is due to how diligent I was at using the care cream afterwards.</li>
            <li> For balls area I waited like 8 mins and for other areas it was like 10 mins.</li>
            <li> Also try not to walk around because the cream will get onto other areas of body</li>
            <li> also, no burn like other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hours bent over dealing with the man garden!</li>
            <li> I have tried other products on the market,  and \\&quot;Balls\\</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to take any longer to use or work then the other products do.  </li>
            <li> I just may be a lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> I had no issues that the other reviewers did no pain on the sack</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I want for that area.</li>
            <li> The glove is pretty lame too.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount of hair came off.  </li>
            <li> Stinks, but not nearly as bad as Nair for Men or Veet.</li>
            <li> I had been looking around for a hair removal cream that would work for my thick hair and after trying The Bare Pair system I could not have been happier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s major drawback is that it can&#x27;t get in and around small places, and tends to nick and cut if there is any uneven skin.</li>
            <li> After my shower, I dried off and patted my feet dry, according to instructions.</li>
            <li> my personal experience with this product was not a very good one it did take the hair off</li>
            <li> Tried other products that didn&#x27;t work down there or anywhere...</li>
            <li> also have a shower scrubbing tool, I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called, it&#x27;s a fixed metal wire with tough, course fibers all over it.</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little skeptical because it didn&#x27;t take anything off when I did the test part.</li>
            <li> this is a bit tedious but it really works.  </li>
            <li> Either way, definitely not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Was not worth the pain and embarrassment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22, so i feel like the hair shouldn&#x27;t really be that difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t but this it is not worth it at all.  </li>
            <li> so work was really really uncomfortable in the heat with my whole downstairs having been in a firefight.</li>
            <li> Give your skin at least a break of a day before trying again, my skin was still too tender, and it kinda hurt when i tried applying again the next day.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d say i still have at least one application left.</li>
            <li> I will say that I have dark, course hair, so if you do as well, this may not work for you.  </li>
            <li> Go slow, stick to the outside rim, and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a hair might dare, from the shoulders on down.</li>
            <li> bottles to get all the hair on my legs, crotch, arms and chest - even after using clippers to trim all the hair down.  </li>
            <li> I felt a little warmth but not hot or burning also some effect on my chest.</li>
            <li> This is a typical hair removal product.  </li>
            <li> I have been waxed on my chest before and that was less pain.  </li>
            <li> I could see hair at the skin level immediately after use, and I had serious stubble the very next day.  </li>
            <li> There was a little bit of a learning curve, but once I got that under control, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> any remaining little stragglers will eventually come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a little funky to me</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done well with hair removal products in the past, but this isn&#x27;t like other products.</li>
            <li> and you have missing hair elsewhere as well.</li>
            <li> Well, there&#x27;s no free ride</li>
            <li> Just apply, wait for a few minutes and then rinse with a towel.</li>
            <li> A few days before leaving for vacation, we did a patch test.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy a bodygroomer from Noreclo.</li>
            <li> If you miss a spot wait a few days and use again.</li>
            <li> It says on the label not to use anything with perfume or soaps to remove this product so in theory you have to wait a few hours before you use soap to rinse the smell</li>
            <li> I tried shaving in the past, but between razor bumps, resurgent stubble, blades and foam, and it frankly was never worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> The only time this system has failed me is if, after doing it once, i feel there&#x27;s still some hair there that could be removed, so i&#x27;ll do it again the NEXT day - not a good idea.</li>
            <li> By no means am I extremely hairy, nor is my hair thick or anything.  </li>
            <li> This stuff just plain works.</li>
            <li> no strong smell, and no chemical&lt;br</li>
            <li> To avoid burn, just rinse extremely well, I mean a lot.</li>
            <li> It gave me a first degree burn that was so bad I would rather get in a car accident.</li>
            <li> when i first used this product i was shocked to see how well it took the body hair off.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re basically like small blisters and were a bit painful that first day.  </li>
            <li> I said to my wife (who wanted me to go to a doctor) how horrible it would have been if I was a single guy trying to clean up for a date.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, because I was sick of shaving certain areas, and getting nicks and bumps.</li>
            <li> Small issue this time.</li>
            <li> There is no better product I&#x27;ve found for the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying the product to your skin, you wait the 8-15 minutes, then what I usually do is jump in the shower.</li>
            <li> USE GLOVES instead of the pointless applicator stick they include.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my crotch toughened up or just adjusted</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that electric razors work well in some areas but are terrible for certain specific jobs.  </li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> Word of warning at least with me, avoid your nipples.</li>
            <li> I do have thick body hair, so that may have something to with it.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thick</li>
            <li> So I am not very experienced in hair removal products.  </li>
            <li> If you are as frustrated with the Bare Pair products, try Venus blades for women.</li>
            <li> Not better or worse than Nair.</li>
            <li> Was a total waste of my money, they couldn&#x27;t even pay me money to use this crap.</li>
            <li> That just seems a little weird to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have shaved, but shaving your \\&quot;private areas\\&quot; is a bit tricky.. and can be painful.</li>
            <li> so I took the glove off and noticed small, bloody red spots on a couple fingers.  </li>
            <li> Does what it says but - it burns afterwards - it also stinks and is just straight painful.  </li>
            <li> but I have used it to treat some chaffing after a long summer hike and some bad sunburns.  </li>
            <li> Nothing too horrible in my experience and works much easier than alternatives!</li>
            <li> it was very hard on my legs, would never think about using it on the boys</li>
            <li> but then it got worse</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get confused, this isn&#x27;t a 100% hair removal tool.  </li>
            <li> and it just got worse.  </li>
            <li> so i will have to shave those areas and use this product only around the base and balls area..</li>
            <li> As you can tell by now I think this product SUCKS!!</li>
            <li> I give this crap two thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to spread using these tounges depressors</li>
            <li> I used it for 10 minutes and wasn&#x27;t at all uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> or you may have an uncomfortable day or two depending on your sensitivity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is difficult to apply (if you insist on trying it get some nitrile gloves to apply)</li>
            <li> You do not want to be careless in application there.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions, they won&#x27;t steer you wrong.  </li>
            <li> This product left me with a horrible chemical burn.</li>
            <li> Once the cream is all washed off (don&#x27;t get it on your fingers, they&#x27;ll feel all weird afterwards)</li>
            <li> I get terrible razor burn with the traditional shaving cream and razor and things like nair and veet</li>
            <li> I used it twice (2 nights consecutively) and it failed to get all the hair, but burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> That sucks!!!  </li>
            <li> (what a mess like the worst acne you can</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> thing I found annoying is that after one use, the paste seemed to solidify in the tube opening (which is quite small!!!)</li>
            <li> BAD IDEA.  </li>
            <li> I got some really bad skin burn from this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is bad.  </li>
            <li> this stuff will literally burn holes in your fingers and it can be painful.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and was disappointed until I understood what this stuff did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate using Nair for Men because it gets EVERYWHERE dripping all over everything.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my worst enemy...</li>
            <li> well, maybe my worst enemy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it absolutely terrible product.</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I have ever came across, take my word on this and do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> And none of the nasty hair removal chemical smells, burns and irritation, just a well kept &amp;#34;garden&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but it also gave me the worst skin irritation I have ever had this year</li>
            <li> Horrible burning sensation as soon as I applied it.</li>
            <li> Completely horrible product.  </li>
            <li> For three days he looked like he had an awful disease.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT IS ONE OF THE WORST PRODUCTS I HAVE USED FOR ANYTHING EVER.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.....</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product. I guess I don&#x27;t have the skin allergies that some have.  My list of know allergies has 84 items on it</li>
            <li> Item is excellent now if you are new to the product order wax sticks the big ones, don&#x27;t be shy with the product spread in thick areas like it was frosting make sure it penetrates it will leave your body like a baby&#x27;s bottom. Again great product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove hair like I had hoped and burned my skin. Removed hair in patches. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ballsbalm is not just some repackaged Men&#x27;s Nair.  After using both products, I will most certainly stick to this product exclusively.  It applies nicely, doesn&#x27;t run like Nair does, and does the trick wonderfully.  My only small beef is I wish I could get more of the calm balm in the set.  The calm balm is absolutely great all over your body and doesn&#x27;t feel disgustingly greasy like most lotions made for men do.  It&#x27;s also great after being out in the sun.  This product is an absolute winner.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to order!</li>
            <li> I am naturally a hairy guy but i also lift weights a lot and enjoy having my shirt off in nice weather, bought this to try and remove hair from my upper body (chest and back) and the first time i used it was was mildy pleased.  It removed most of the hair leaving only a few small spots i had to shave after with only mild irritation to my chest and upper stomach that subsided in about a day, but the hair grew back a lot faster than i had expected.  The second time i used it (about 2 weeks later) i decided to do it when the hair was shorter than before hoping for better results...BAD IDEA.  I ended up with pretty bad skin burn in the same area that before only experienced mild irritation.  I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be trying this a third time. Might as well just bite the bullet and try wax strips.  I would suggest not trying this if your skin is the least bit sensitive and even if its not because mine is not that sensitive.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - works as advertised and no burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> Ok gents (and ladies?), here is my personal review. Please note: I just received this package today and only tested it on my feet and toes, since they&#x27;re pretty hairy and annoying (and also since you&#x27;re supposed to test it before getting to the good stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I spread some out as evenly as possible over my feet and toes and then let the stuff sit for about 15 minutes (that&#x27;s the max!). While it was sitting, I did not feel any type of sensation, like burning or tingling, it was like nothing. After that, I hopped in the shower with my glove and began gently scrubbing my feet. To my surprise, the hair was falling right off! After my shower, I dried off and patted my feet dry, according to instructions. I did notice that my right foot was slightly red (my left foot looked completely fine), but I did not feel any burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was expecting from the reviews I read before buying, it didn&#x27;t decimate every single hair on the applied area. I&#x27;m sure a second treatment will do the trick, but there were so very few hairs left (like 2 or 3 on each foot) that I just decided to pluck them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling baby smooth, but it&#x27;s pretty dang close! Far better than the result of shaving. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this stuff so far! Tomorrow I will try it on the parts that the name implies, hoping for the same results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Note: Not everyone has the same skin type, and different skin types react differently to products like this, so not everyone will have the same positive result as me. Just use caution with this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does the trick. First time I used it when everything came back in it was soft, it was unlike when shaving. Subsequent uses it has been a little more whisker like. I believe this is due to how diligent I was at using the care cream afterwards. Be sure to apply liberally and often in the first day or two.</li>
            <li> This product works great and the balls calm feels great after using hair removal cream. I will purchase this item again</li>
            <li> Excellent hair removal product! No irritation either!</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this Threesome Pac, and am completely amazed on the work it did to my body. I used it on the pubic hair on the balls and stomach, and now im left with a completely smooth area there. For those who are worried about it stinging and stuff here is my experience. After applying directly on my balls, like after 1 min I felt a little warmth but not hot or burning also some effect on my chest. For balls area I waited like 8 mins and for other areas it was like 10 mins. Afterwards jump in a warm shower not hot or cold cause that might hurt but some places i had to like pull the grouped hair off. After shower it says to use the cream to help your skin but I tried not, and have no problems. I dont have any irritation on my skin or anything. This prosuct is in my eyes the best hair removal for men hands down</li>
            <li> I had to send this back because it whatever skin it touches it will burn for days like sunburn! It is difficult to spread using these tounges depressors you&#x27;re supposed to use and then keep it on there for several minutes to work. This a not for people with sensitive skin or have never done this before.</li>
            <li> This stuff just plain works. I have tried other creams with mixed results. This stuff works great and doesn&#x27;t have the same unpleasant smell that most do.</li>
            <li> I have only used this stuff one time since I bought it. it&#x27;s crazy. The pubes just wash off. I didn&#x27;t get the sticks, but whatever,  I have to warn against using a bare hand to apply the balm; it carries the smell for a day or two... I used it for 10 minutes and wasn&#x27;t at all uncomfortable. I would say to rub it about in the shower for a quick second before you begin to rinse you parts off.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, really works well. Just throw the sticks away and put it on with your fingers. I go about 15 minutes from the time I start putting it on, and it takes everything off. To avoid burn, just rinse extremely well, I mean a lot. I then wash with soap, and do not get the burns. I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too coarse but didn&#x27;t work very well. I still needed to shave to get &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product, it does exactly what it says, just follow the instructions. My girlfriend loves it :)The bair pair has arrived in Europe :)</li>
            <li> So this product was out-of-stock from the manufacturer for quite some time, which is why I bought the 3 pack.  I wonder why they didn&#x27;t have it available for a while (the only thing I can think of is that they were changing the formula of the product).&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells better than other lotion hair removers.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can be a bit &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; if left directly on your huevos too long, so I recommend adding the lotion/cream to any other place you&#x27;re needing it, and then add it to your huevos last (so it&#x27;s not on them too too long).  And, it still doesn&#x27;t get everything, so I still end up having to shave the stragglers.</li>
            <li> I have never tried any hair removal stuff EVER in my lifetime. This was a first for me and I&#x27;m glad I chose Balls Balm. It works exactly like it says. I was nervous of course to spread a cream full of chemicals all over down there but except for a slight warming sensation that quickly faded I had no issues. There is a warning on the bottle that an allergic reaction could occur during the first, second, or any use for that matter, but I&#x27;ve had no issues and will continue using it. When I&#x27;m clean down there my wife wants the D a lot more often, so I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Works good. Follow the directions, don&#x27;t leave this on to long or you may have an uncomfortable day or two depending on your sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with The sticks. It also burned my hoohah.</li>
            <li> Some what worked, still testing the duration for optimum result. Too long and you will get irritation, too short and it will not remove as much hair as expected.</li>
            <li> I read through the warnings but went for it anyway. I&#x27;m glad that I did. If you follow the very clear directions, it works perfectly. I had no problems at all. My wife was so impressed that she tried it, too. She felt a really mild burn near her most sensitive skin, but it was gone within an hour, and did not phase her from using it again and again.</li>
            <li> Did it&#x27;s job, butter it was very hard on my legs, would never think about using it on the boys</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the balm that comes with this, however I have found the hair removal balm works great everywhere except where I wanted it to work the most! Will definitely buy the calm balm again, but unfortunately the boys will need to put up with the razor</li>
            <li> This is a great hair removal product that won&#x27;t burn you or cause any discomfort. This is the second time I have ordered this product and I will continue to buy more. Its a Great value for the quality of the product, others will either burn you or not take off the hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Guys 5-min done and believe me all it took is 5 minutes to get the job done. I suggest you take some time to cover your member because it may get inside your hole and it will burn. Also try not to walk around because the cream will get onto other areas of body you may not want to remove hair. You wont find out till you shower it off and you have missing hair elsewhere as well. LOL</li>
            <li> Works without issues.  I will be ordering more.  I have been looking for a product that works this well and lasts as long as this one does.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the product to leave my skin completely smooth, but it left my skin feeling prickly. I waited 24hrs and tried to get the remainder off and it really started to irritate my skin. The balm does have a nice smell to it and it is more gentle on the skin compared to Nair for Men. However, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with how after 15 minutes on each area...I still had stubbles of hair on my skin. I do have thick body hair, so that may have something to with it.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with several others. I used it twice (2 nights consecutively) and it failed to get all the hair, but burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> i have very coarse leg hair and using this product left all the roots still in my leg and many turned into ingrown hairs (very painful) but on other parts such as my lower leg, and arms it worked like a charm</li>
            <li> This product is not gentle in any way and caused chemical burns in very sensitive areas.  The balm helped desensitize the pain from using the hair removal cream, but the damage was done and took about two weeks for the skin to get back to normal.  This is a terrible product and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my worst enemy...well, maybe my worst enemy!</li>
            <li> This stuff totally works. I ordered this, because I was sick of shaving certain areas, and getting nicks and bumps. This stuff is so easy, apply a thick layer, let sit 10-12 minutes, and then wash off in the shower. So smooth, and the results last days longer than shaving. I love this stuff. also, no burn like other products. Awesome</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. There was a little bit of a learning curve, but once I got that under control, it works like a charm. It left my skin feeling smooth without the razor nicks and burns. Highly recommended for any of you gents out there looking to do personal grooming the right way.</li>
            <li> very easy to apply and in no time hair just wipes away!  leaving me baby bottom smooth!!  no strong smell, and no chemical&lt;br /&gt;burn. sac is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about strategy in application. This product works well, has but a trace of odor, and is followed-up by a soothing aloe lotion.  Hair removal requires an easy spread-on application, 12-14 minute wait time, then I recommend using the wooden applicators to scrape off the excess cream, including the loosened follicles, BEFORE hittin&#x27; the shower to then use of the exfoliating glove.&lt;br /&gt;I say this because the product effectively removes hair. If you want to avoid a clogged drain, remove most of the cream/hair, scraping it into the trash, then quickly shower in luke-warm water, using the glove to finish-up. The first time I used it, I needed drano. I&#x27;m not a gorilla, but again, the product worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I got two full-body (arms, legs, chest/back, and under-carriage) uses out of one 8 oz. tube when I cut the top off to get all the remaining cream out of the tube. The three pack seems to be the best value. The company website is also informative/humorous.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. The first few uses may make your junk feel like a Normandy bunker getting lit up with napalm, but it stops after the first use or two and is a small price to pay for deforesting the Amazon. Use the glove to remove the excess hair and gently rub in circles to keep from getting ingrowns. The Calm Balm is probably the best part; it feels like angels lightly blowing feathery kisses at your junk.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it absolutely terrible product. It gave me a first degree burn that was so bad I would rather get in a car accident. I followed the directions exactly as it told me to and the side of my sack got singed like if I was asking the devil to poke his pitchfork on it. One of the worst products I have ever came across, take my word on this and do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for that baby smooth feel down under, do follow the instructions especially in the areas that don&#x27;t see the light often if you get my drift !!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me and burns if you&#x27;re not careful. I would never recommend this for anyone who was considering alternatives to razor-shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hours bent over dealing with the man garden! This product, whole process went down in under 20 minutes, including a shower! And none of the nasty hair removal chemical smells, burns and irritation, just a well kept &amp;#34;garden&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m very impressed and cannot believe it took me this long to find bare balm. Great product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money on this ! It does not work . I cant believe its even on the market.If it really works for someone they must only have peach fuzz on there balls , because it did nothing.I give this crap two thumbs down.</li>
            <li> As a guy with a mixture of moderately hairy areas (chest, legs), very hairy zones (pubes), and lightly hairy surfaces (back, butt, thighs), I have had every opportunity to try this hair removal system just about everywhere a hair might dare, from the shoulders on down. I tried shaving in the past, but between razor bumps, resurgent stubble, blades and foam, and it frankly was never worth the trouble. But give me something I can slather and leave on for 10 minutes (while I browse my phone or eat cereal or whatever) and then just hop in the shower, wipe off, and be smooth - well, I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a REPEAT, (rinse) REPEAT customer of this product, you bet yer bottom dollar (heh) this stuff works like a dream, used properly ( nips, bum hole, cuts/broken skin, go around them) and in conjunction with the buttery smooth aftercare lotion. This still doesn&#x27;t smell very nice at all, and I&#x27;d like to take away a star, but frankly nothing else comes close and the smell washes away with all the hairy remains of your less sexy, kempt self. 5 stars and a regular purchase from me, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It really works.  Needed to apply a couple of times the first time but later only need to apply once</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and wow..... thank god I tried it on other areas instead of going right to the sensitive regions.&lt;br /&gt;it is difficult to apply (if you insist on trying it get some nitrile gloves to apply) if you get it on your hands it will affect your sense of touch/things will feel slippery for days.&lt;br /&gt;It takes the hair off at the surface leaving a lot of stubble (felt very uncomfortable)&lt;br /&gt;I have always had clear skin but this created a lot of ingrown hair down low.... (what a mess like the worst acne you can imagine)&lt;br /&gt;I could not get this stuff off of me fast enough, It should come with a neutralizing agent otherwise it is difficult to remove completely so if you are feeling the burn it will keep on burning.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t always get every last spot, but it does a good job for what it is. Easier to remove longer hair. You get more than I expected with this combo... each tube is bigger than normal, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions as best as I could, and my initial impressions were that this was a 4 star product.  However, although I had no adverse reactions the first time, I had to go back and do some detail work a second, and a third time, to get everything perfect down there.  After a third use in a few days, the skin became agitated from the product.  A warning to wait X amount of hours, or X amount of days would have been nice, but I&#x27;ve learned to use it infrequently.  When used infrequently, it does an adequate job with little to no agitation to the skin, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to reccomend this product, for infrequent use, to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is approx. my fourth order of \\&quot;Balls\\&quot;.  I have tried other products on the market,  and \\&quot;Balls\\&quot; by far has my vote.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to take any longer to use or work then the other products do.  The quality of the product after the hair removal is awesome.  The time frame after the application, to the next time for use is weeks after.  I enjoy this product and will continue to use it.  Thank you for letting me go \\&quot;BALLS\\&quot; to the wall!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> my personal experience with this product was not a very good one it did take the hair off but it also gave me the worst skin irritation I have ever had this year I&#x27;m going to be in front of Santa&#x27;s sled shining his way with my ball bag leading the way from how bright and red it is.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does what it&#x27;s supposed to, just don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 20 minutes and it worked perfectly. My girlfriend was very pleased with the results ;)</li>
            <li> I received more than I expected.  Works very well just follow directions.  Would recommend to anyone to get rid of hair in the nether regions.</li>
            <li> when i first used this product i was shocked to see how well it took the body hair off. This product is well worth the patience to take care of some man business.  I would recommend this to any man that is embarrassed about there unusual amount of body hair. A word of caution though, please make sure you read the directions carefully. if you leave the body cream on too long you will have to put up with some major skin irritation.</li>
            <li> LEFT A LOT OF STUBLE, NAIR WORKED BETTER</li>
            <li> Horrible,&lt;br /&gt;Burns, burns, burns. I could not get it off fast enough. They should change the name. It created a 3rd degree burn. blistered the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, as I was looking for an alternative to shaving twice a week. While the product did not burn as other hair removal products, it took off hair in spots and not very well where it didn&#x27;t take it off at all.</li>
            <li> Fan of the Balls! Worked great, as long as you follow the directions and the helpful comments left by other reviewers. I started with a &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; area on one thigh. Put it on, set a 13 min timer, then jumped in the shower and gently scrubbed off. Worked like a charm. Waited 24 hours, did again, to whole legs, hips down. Small issue this time. Just things guys don&#x27;t think about - the crease of our &amp;#34;bikini area&amp;#34; is sensitive, guys. That one burned for a day. No problem, just put the Calm Balm on it that night, then 3 times the next day, and very little irritation. Red patch stayed for 4 more days, but definitely worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately they do not include spreaders anymore, and I have sensitive skin. I have found that using nitrile/latex gloves helps keep my hands from burning, and it helps to spread the cream more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional note to guys who are starting like I did - from full hair. Bring an extra washcloth or 2 with you into the shower. The glove quits after 4 swipes. Again, this is only on the first session. Subsequent sessions have gone much smoother (pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the part guys want to know about - Balls, Bilson Bridge, and the Butt. YMMV, but I found that it works very well there as long as you limit your times. I found that for my initial application, I chickened out and once there was a tingle at around 8 minutes, I was NOT having what happened to my bikini area happen to the holy places aforementioned. It only removed ~1/3 of the hair. I waited 3 days for a second attempt, left it on for 11 minutes, and viola. Smooth as eggs. The area around the anus is clearly the most difficult, but over the course of 3 applications spaced out over a week, it is 90% smooth. You do not want to be careless in application there. A chemical burn there will make you consider walking into traffic. Go slow, stick to the outside rim, and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrapping this up, great product. Stinks, but not nearly as bad as Nair for Men or Veet. Do your maintenance at night, sleep after you rinse it off, then shower in the morning with soap and smell is barely there.</li>
            <li> I did not try to use Veet.  I read enough reviews to know I should not do that.  I bought this and was disappointed until I understood what this stuff did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be able to do your own research and find out the truth but from what I can tell these kinds of topical hair removal products make your hair weak and willing to let go near the follicle.  Products like Veet do it really fast, and the longer the stuff is on your skin the more it will react to your skin.  balls may use something different than Veet, or they simply use different concentrations, but what I found comparing my wife&#x27;s experience using Veet on her legs and my experience using this stuff on my intimate areas is that you need to give balls some time to work, and then get it off before it has time to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8-10 minutes works great for me, and leaving it on longer increases the chance for irritation.  Leave it on for 12 minutes or more in one area and you guarantee some medium burning irritation for at least two days, but it will be nothing like what the men who tried Veet describe.  The soothing balm works great too, so much I&#x27;m actually trying to replicate the formula at home myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the catch for &amp;#34;it works great&amp;#34;... you may have many little hairs left behind after the application and feel like this product did not work.  Well, there&#x27;s no free ride and if you want painless intimate hair removal you need to do a little work.  While the application may not have removed the hair, it made it weak and willing to come off, so if your first application did not appear to remove all of the hair, even after you used the supplied gloves afterwards to grope yourself, you can easily manually pinch the hairs away.  this is a bit tedious but it really works.  In fact you can rub the hairs off for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT be tempted to re-apply the treatment if you don&#x27;t think it worked the first time.  Read plenty of other reviews for why you should not do a treatment more than once every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done and my girl loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Horrible burning sensation as soon as I applied it. Removed it as quickly as I could but my skin was still red and irritated for a week.</li>
            <li> Completely horrible product.  I tried using it on two separate occasions with similar results-chemical burns and the hair still stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the directions say to use spreader sticks, which I assume are basically tongue depressors or popsicle sticks to apply the cream.  However, none of them were included in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to some back hair and my sack, and waited the allotted time (about 12 minutes on the back and 10 on the balls).  It definitely smelled and felt like it was working, but when I went in the shower to wipe away, little to nothing came off.  I ensured to get all of it off, and all I was left with was a stinging/burning sensation.  The included moisturizer did help this a little bit, but not enough to raise it another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and read some reviews and tried it again, but I had the same results.  This is a complete waste of money and I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works just fine. I have had no problems at all, though I suggest not using too much in a short period of time (i.e. two days in a row) or leaving it on too long as it will burn. Nothing too horrible in my experience and works much easier than alternatives!</li>
            <li> Not better or worse than Nair. I got some really bad skin burn from this product. No chemical hair remover on my skin ever again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, I wanted it to work, but the results were dismal and subpar at best.  Do yourself a favor and save your money, because this stuff doesn&#x27;t work that well at all.  Does it remove some hair?  Yes, that&#x27;s why I gave it only 2 stars, because it&#x27;s not completely lying as a product when it says that.  I&#x27;m not hairy by any means, honestly I don&#x27;t have a problem with shaving with a razor, but I&#x27;d get irritation on my stomach from my pants so I wanted to try something else.  Using this, you will end up looking like a mangy animal afterwards.  By no means am I extremely hairy, nor is my hair thick or anything.  So it is amazing to me that people here who describe themselves as such have had luck with this product.  I actually ended up getting irritated and I guess what would be considered chemical burns from this stuff.  Either that or the glove provide diced me up.  Either way, definitely not worth it.  Cutting yourself with a razor is better than using this.  Not to mention much quicker.  After leaving this stuff on for 15 minutes and obtaining less than half @ssed results, it&#x27;s not even worth the time or effort.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product, and ofourse there will be past reviews that are written by ignorant people.  If you follow the instrusctions the product does its job effectively. I used it on my Chest, stomach, groin, butt, buttcrack and testicals.  and the only area that got irritated was my testicals. On the bottle it does state that on sensitive areas leave for less time. I left it on to long.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to recommend this product!  It really works!!!! I removed hair from my back, butt, and the private areas!!!  It has been a few days and still as smooth as a babies butt!  Thanks</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, removed all the hair on my body.  I used the glove in the shower and was rubbing the stuff off and noticed my fingers started hurting.  I ignored it at first but then it got worse so I took the glove off and noticed small, bloody red spots on a couple fingers.  They&#x27;re basically like small blisters and were a bit painful that first day.  Oddly enough the rest of my body including my uh &amp;#34;coin purse&amp;#34; were completely fine; no pain or irritation of any kind. That night and the next day my whole body was smooth and it felt nice, but after a day and a half my body had stubbles everywhere so essentially the smoothness wont last more than 48 hours.  I had to use 2 of the 8 oz. bottles to get all the hair on my legs, crotch, arms and chest - even after using clippers to trim all the hair down.  I&#x27;d recommend wearing protective gloves in addition to the cloth glove they give you - this stuff will literally burn holes in your fingers and it can be painful.  Besides the holes in my fingers it worked fine but the smooth skin really only lasted a day and a half and because I needed 2 bottles to cover all my hairy areas I&#x27;m only gonna get 1 use out of this package deal. - I essentially paid $40.00 for less than 2 days of smooth, hairless skin.  The product works as described, doesn&#x27;t last long, costs 40 dollars, you only get enough for one use and it will burn holes through the skin on your hand.  Not terrible but not exactly worth it either.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and still had 2nd and 3rd degree burns as a result in some areas of the body.</li>
            <li> From the couple of times I&#x27;ve used it, it works well.  The only thing is leave the more difficult areas for last, meaning put on the skin patches first, then the balls (also leave the base of the neck for last if you&#x27;re using it for that).  If you do the balls first, you will get burned since they will spend more time with the paste on, LEAVE THE BALLS FOR LAST!!! (shouldn&#x27;t be more than 10 minutes!!!).  Also found that if you put the paste directly on skin with the tube, then work it in with the stick, it grabs the hairs better as opposed to squeezing the stuff out of the tube onto the skin and trying to rub it in with the stick.  Leaves fewer random hairs and does a better job of clearing the area of unwanted hair...&lt;br /&gt;One thing I found annoying is that after one use, the paste seemed to solidify in the tube opening (which is quite small!!!) so using it the second time was a bit of a chore.  Going to use a nail to see if I can loosen up the paste in the opening.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the results and my better half likes the difference; I have sensitive skin and I had no problems.</li>
            <li> Love this item&lt;br /&gt;It woks just. Fine , love with it .</li>
            <li> Balls Balm is pure awesomeness. This product is so easy to use and the by far the best hair removal product. Just apply, wait for a few minutes and then rinse with a towel. That&#x27;s all you have to do! This is my third time buying Balls Balm and it always does the job. Will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other products to remove hair, always with the same results...burns and stubble.  Finally I found something that works!  The Bare Pair is amazing!</li>
            <li> Works very well for what it does.....No skin issues for me after using it.</li>
            <li> This product works well not only in its namesake but everywhere...i have been using it on my chest and legs and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Makes \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; easy.  There is no better product I&#x27;ve found for the money.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the the most private area and no more cuts or razor bumps from shaving.  In 10 minutes I can apply, allow time for the product to go to work, and shower. Nothing else to do for two weeks or more.  Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a typical hair removal product.  I was impressed with all 5 star reviews.  This product works 1/2 way (it doesn&#x27;t take the hair off 100%--you&#x27;ll still have to shave).  You will have to use alot of the product and you&#x27;ll be out of product before long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for better results from the product.</li>
            <li> The ladies love my balls!-</li>
            <li> works great and doesn&#x27;t bother the sensitive areas at all.  great product all around.  gives you soft, smooth skin that almost all women enjoy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Originally ordered the starter package, but after seeing how well it worked - no stinging, or irritation, I stepped up and bought the family pack!  Very cool stuff fellas, and I encourage you to try it if you enjoy smooth wheels! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> We got this to get rid of the hair on his back.  This was a nightmare.  A few days before leaving for vacation, we did a patch test.  Area got a little red but that cleared up by morning.  Ok, so night before leaving, we do his entire back.  For three days he looked like he had an awful disease.  His entire back was flaming red, with small red dots.  He wore a shirt at the pool because he was so embarrassed.  Who set went into the trash.  Was not worth the pain and embarrassment.</li>
            <li> Holy Sh!t. It works. Does exactly as decribed and doesn&#x27;t make you cry over your family jewels. Word of warning at least with me, avoid your nipples. It was the only place that actually kinda hurt. Also it gets better with repeated use.</li>
            <li> I first bought the single bottle BB and it worked perfectly! I bought the 3 pack this time. I just may be a lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> For fear of being vulgar here, I would like to point out that not only does this stuff clean up \\&quot;the boys\\&quot; but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will take care of the other super sensitive regions... it works there too. I literally bled when I used Nair downstairs many years ago. As a result, I was hesitant to use this product. But after some careful testing, I can say I have now used it under my arms, \\&quot;my boys\\&quot; and the space between my legs and pelvis and... yes, the bum.  I had no irritation and it worked very well.  I did eventually wind up leaving it on a bit longer than the \\&quot;maximum\\&quot; time. There was an initial tingle that made me nervous but it subsided even before I wiped it off. Bought the bulk package as soon as I had used it twice. Highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well for me.  I have also noticed that the more you use this product (repeated uses over time) the longer you can go between sessions before the hair grows back.  The part I love the most is no razor burn and no itching when the hair starts to grow back in.  The after lotion is great and help prevent ingrown hairs and red bumps.  Don&#x27;t skip the lotion, very important.  Follow the directions, they won&#x27;t steer you wrong.  I leave the remover on for 10-12 minutes and works great with no burn, but follow the directions and figure out what works best for you.  Make sure to exfoliate really well when rinsing off, this will help to &amp;#34;break off&amp;#34; any stubborn hairs and not have any stragglers the first couple of times.  My girlfriend sure does love how smooth Bare Pair makes me.</li>
            <li> Just did not work for me  wished I just bought one will not buy again I sure had better that worked</li>
            <li> I really wish I could give this product -5, yes, one might think this is a joke. I only used this product twice, and will never use it again, because IT SUKCKS!!!  I should have taken a picture of what happened near my belly button area almost INSTANTLY after I put on this super sucking cream. If you have senseitive skin like I do, DO NOT USE THIS PRODCUT. It sucks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fotunately the redness has gone away, but the area near my belly where the reaction happened, isn&#x27;t completley gone yet. That sucks!!!  As you can tell by now I think this product SUCKS!! Was a total waste of my money, they couldn&#x27;t even pay me money to use this crap. I&#x27;m all done with the hair removal gels, creams, and sprays. Some of them also stink. I&#x27;d have to say the ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL BAD. Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy a bodygroomer from Noreclo. Finally after about SEVEN MONTHS the redness sensitive area on my belly has gone away. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT IS ONE OF THE WORST PRODUCTS I HAVE USED FOR ANYTHING EVER. HORRIBLE.....</li>
            <li> Tried other products that didn&#x27;t work down there or anywhere... Don&#x27;t know why this one is different but it is. Just mind the recommended times... It works in the time allotted. If you miss a spot wait a few days and use again. Extra time above the 8-12 minutes is...not recommended.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a man, late 20&#x27;s, white skinned, with thick, dark black hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like body hair and remove it however possible. I have shaved, but shaving your \\&quot;private areas\\&quot; is a bit tricky.. and can be painful. I used to use a very high end waterproof cordless shaver to shave much of my body. It&#x27;s major drawback is that it can&#x27;t get in and around small places, and tends to nick and cut if there is any uneven skin. My hair also grows back insanely fast, so I only get to experience the hairless feeling for less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great! It works to much better than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Part of why it works so well is it&#x27;s consistency. It has almost a jel like consistency once you place it on your skin. I hate using Nair for Men because it gets EVERYWHERE dripping all over everything. Because my hair is so thick I waited the full 15 minutes, (and actually, contrary to the safety warnings, a bit longer.. NOT that I&#x27;m recommending anyone do that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying the product to your skin, you wait the 8-15 minutes, then what I usually do is jump in the shower. The hair won&#x27;t just wash off, I had to scratch it off a bit. I used my nails to scratch at the area where the product was applied and the hair evaporated! It was so amazing.(Yes they do include a glove for rubbing the hair off, I just didn&#x27;t use it.) I am making my girlfriend use ballsbaum now :). (I wish there was a lady&#x27;s branded version? The whole \\&quot;bare your balls\\&quot; thing doesn&#x27;t particularly appeal to women.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a shower scrubbing tool, I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called, it&#x27;s a fixed metal wire with tough, course fibers all over it. It&#x27;s exactly like a scrub brush except slightly softer for use on the body. It works great with this product because it is so thorough. Any hair you miss, will no longer be attached or have any cohesiveness, so even after you are done your treatment and go about your day any remaining little stragglers will eventually come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balls Baum does not inhibit the re-growth of hair. It only does the equivalent of an extremely close shave. I just recently purchased a [[ASIN:B00859DIFM Silk&#x27;n SN-008 Flash&amp;Go All-Over Hair Removal Handheld Device.]] to follow up my use of this product. So far so good, I haven&#x27;t had the flasn&amp;go very long, and I realize it takes time to see the effects. Unlike ballsbaum, which almost instantly disintegrates hair on contact :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any adverse reactions, rashes, redness, or skin problems whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to summarize, I would choose this product over shaving by many orders of magnitude.&lt;br /&gt;This product has been a dream come true. So glad to live in the 21&#x27;st century!loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balls Baum does not inhibit the re-growth of hair. It only does the equivalent of an extremely close shave.

            <li> Great pubic hair removal</li>
            <li> Does remove some hair, but i wouldn&#x27;t say its anymore effective than Nair or Veet. It WILL BURN YOU if you leave it on just a minute too long. USE GLOVES instead of the pointless applicator stick they include. I put it on my chest first, then my abdomen, and waited 8 minutes. Clearly it was on slightly longer than the recommended time, counting the application time, and i could definitely tell when i went to wipe it off my chest. Even with this, it still didn&#x27;t remove all the hair. I&#x27;m not a 50 year old man who has been shaving his entire life either. I&#x27;m 22, so i feel like the hair shouldn&#x27;t really be that difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All i can say is, i will never use this on my balls, nor would i recommend you do. Go with Nair or Veet, as they are cheaper, and work just as well (which isn&#x27;t well to begin with).</li>
            <li> I had no issues that the other reviewers did no pain on the sack it gets warm then goes away just make sure you do a test spot first to see if you have delicate skin</li>
            <li> Well I have used the product three times now.  I get a warmth but no burning and no adverse effects.  The directions provide for possible use up to I think 15 minutes. I find I do not get much removal at 10.  At 12 I got most.  But at 13 I think I got all the hair.  So I have just moved it up a little bit to get the action I need.  I followed the directions, used the glove and washed it off.  After I have used the lotion in the kit but I think any lotion would work to just help calm the skin.  Before this I used an electric trimmer like the kind you use on your hair and it left lots of hair on.  Update December, 2015. My last use I got distracted and left this on longer than the max time, not by much, maybe 2 minutes, but I got a bad burning on my ball sack and an aggressive rash that took about 3 weeks of Hydrocortisone to stop.  The rash came on like zits. So, stay to the recommended time period carefully. I treated the ball sack burn with Neosporin ointment and that worked well.  I also use it on my ears to remove the growing hair and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of helping me stay clean bodied. At first, I was a little skeptical because it didn&#x27;t take anything off when I did the test part. I took more than expected when I actually used it, but I assume it was because my arms were hairy. After using the glove, it came off smooth as baby skin. I would suggest trimming first so not to have to use too much. It has been 3 weeks and my hair is just now noticeably showing.</li>
            <li> I have course legs hair but extremely sensitive skin.  If i shave I get irratation a couples days later when the hair grows back.  I cant wait for the hairs to get long enough to wax andother depilatories leave my skin irratated, burned and still hairy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely strong bulso gentle and doesnt smell as bad as other depilatories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomened!! Oh and I love the new bigger size!!!</li>
            <li> 10X better than nair, when used as directed its awesome!  The lotion is very soothing and after you use the first tube you hardly even notice the effects.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff because I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this stuff - :)  It works - and he doesn&#x27;t have any pain or sensitivity.  Can&#x27;t really complain about that!</li>
            <li> Burns lower part of sack even at 10 minutes. Would not use without Calm, works like it&#x27;s name!!</li>
            <li> It makes my husband feel good about himself. Have to&lt;br /&gt;do it about every two to three weeks if you don&#x27;t want&lt;br /&gt;any nubs.</li>
            <li> Does what it says but - it burns afterwards - it also stinks and is just straight painful.  I have been waxed on my chest before and that was less pain.  Very Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Burn baby burn.  I&#x27;m sticking to shaving.</li>
            <li> Great Product Really Works Great in that Private Area!! My wife loves the results and that means I benefit : ). Would recommend to all A+++</li>
            <li> So I am not very experienced in hair removal products.  I learned the hard way that electric razors work well in some areas but are terrible for certain specific jobs.  I tried ballsBALM because I heard good things and I was uncomfortable ordering a product originally designed for women that simply changed the label to say \\&quot;For Men\\&quot;.  You know who you are Nair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here are my experiences with this product.  The smell is bad.  I would not use it right before a date since you are virtually ensuring certain activities will not take place.  It says on the label not to use anything with perfume or soaps to remove this product so in theory you have to wait a few hours before you use soap to rinse the smell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, my skin was a bit sensitive to it.  However, I have not had this problem since.  Not sure if my crotch toughened up or just adjusted but if it burns a bit the first time, give is a second try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great for me.  It removes most of the hair and what it doesnt remove, it seems to reduce to thin white hair that doesnt really show up.  So if you are a perfectionist, you might have to do some odd plucking or try a second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps the hair away for awhile.  My hair doesnt really grow quickly in general but I only need to use the product every few weeks.  I wasnt super accurate in my count but I think I got around 10 applications from 1 tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is awesome.  Its pretty liquidy so I dont love using it downstairs but I have used it to treat some chaffing after a long summer hike and some bad sunburns.  I even used it when my nose got red during flu season and it cut the recovery time way down and cooled the burning feeling on all injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the product.  My favorite part is not feeling embarrassed when my buddies find it.  It happened and they responded \\&quot;Do you use a product called Ballz???  Thats Awesome!\\&quot;.  This is not how the conversation would have gone if it was Nair or Sally Hansen</li>
            <li> Really worked great.  I used it according exactly to the directions...based on prior user comments.  Even the hair that was left was easily removed afterward.  The result was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This product left me with a horrible chemical burn. I usually have pretty tough skin but not tough enough for this. I put it on and left it for the recommended time and wow, I have never seen skin turn that color and had pain like that. Not exactly what I want for that area. I said to my wife (who wanted me to go to a doctor) how horrible it would have been if I was a single guy trying to clean up for a date. Don&#x27;t but this it is not worth it at all.  Not to mention I did this during the summer so work was really really uncomfortable in the heat with my whole downstairs having been in a firefight.</li>
            <li> Great product. No problems with chemical burn works better than shaving and you don&#x27;t get burnt Luke waxing. Removed all hair from down there easilly and completely in one try.</li>
            <li> READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND WARNINGS BEFORE USE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, on to the review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great, just as advertised. No bullcrap. I don&#x27;t really know what else to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some tips on use.&lt;br /&gt;1: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND WARNINGS! You&#x27;re using a chemical on your body (probably the sensitive bits) that essentially burns hair away. You might want to pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;2: Rinse yourself off in a nice warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;3: after your shower, take some clippers to those not so sensitive areas to clear up where you&#x27;re going to apply this stuff. If you&#x27;re trimming up the sensitive areas, I suggest small scissors to clear away the bulk (gotta protect your junk, right?)&lt;br /&gt;4: Apply Bare Balm liberally to the desired area. Probably want to keep this stuff off your shaft, anything that tingles and burns off hair probably shouldn&#x27;t be on you&#x27;re willy as it might desensitize it (That&#x27;s just my two cents, do what you want).&lt;br /&gt;5. Follow the instructions on the bottle. Really, that&#x27;s step 5. It&#x27;s pretty straight forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If done correctly, there should be no requirement for follow-up &amp;#34;spot applications&amp;#34; as those will probably result in a rash. For best results and efficiency, I suggest doing different areas at a time instead of doing your whole body, if you were planning that. For instance, one day is your junk, day two is your abs, day three is your chest and underarms, etc. This will keep you from reapplying the balm to areas you&#x27;ve already done, resulting in your front side being as smooth as the day you popped into this world.</li>
            <li> This is the first product like this I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I chose it based off the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely coarse body hair and BB removed it without a problem.  I waited about 15 mins to remove from chest/abdominal area.  I should have removed after 10 mins.  My skin got a bit irritated, but that&#x27;s my fault for leaving it on too long.  I did get some razor bumps, but not as many as if I would have shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to wait until my skin heals and try another application in about a week just to see if it removes the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the skin irritaion, razor bumps, and stubble, the experience was extremely similar to shaving with a razor.  The one major difference is that using BB was much easier and faster.  I recommend this product and will use it from now on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get confused, this isn&#x27;t a 100% hair removal tool.  I used it twice in a one week period.  The first time it got all of the hair down to a stubble, the second time removed what was left.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying this more than once within 24 hours, it will most likely burn.</li>
            <li> WAAAAAAAAAY better than shaving down there. WAY better. Here&#x27;s what i do... i wouldn&#x27;t try using this immediately after a sweaty activity, but so long as i&#x27;m clean i don&#x27;t worry about showering AGAIN before using. The day i use it i wake up 15-20 minutes earlier than normal, use the applicator (Popsicle stick thing) to apply and decent coating to all areas - like the instructions say, it works better if your &amp;#34;pair&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t hanging low. Then i set a timer for 9 minutes once i&#x27;ve applied thoroughly to all areas. Then, and i apologize if this sounds crass, but then i sit on the toilet, not to do anything but potentially read or play games on my phone. Here&#x27;s the reason, i&#x27;ve applied the cream to my... hanging parts, and if i just stand there, the cream will also wipe off on my inner things, this reduces the amount of cream where i wanted it and leads to removing hair on my inner things, which i didn&#x27;t really care about. After the 9 minutes i hop in the shower and rinse off the cream while using a loufa (dedicated for this purpose only) to remove the cream and hair. Once the cream is all washed off (don&#x27;t get it on your fingers, they&#x27;ll feel all weird afterwards) THEN i&#x27;ll kind of use my fingers to remove any hair that didn&#x27;t just wipe off, sometimes the hair wills still SEEM attached and you just have to pull them off - no pain or anything involved. The only time this system has failed me is if, after doing it once, i feel there&#x27;s still some hair there that could be removed, so i&#x27;ll do it again the NEXT day - not a good idea. Give your skin at least a break of a day before trying again, my skin was still too tender, and it kinda hurt when i tried applying again the next day. What i really love about this compared to shaving - when the hair starts growing back in, it&#x27;s not all itchy and scratchy. Overall, i highly recommend, One tube has gotten me through at least four applications, but a couple of those applications were two separate applications and learning experiences. Plus i apply it rather generously. i&#x27;d say i still have at least one application left.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about this product at first.  Mainly because of the reviews that complained of burning.  I followed the directions to the letter ready to remove it at the first sign of any burning.  There was a sensation but not of burning per se.  More like a menthol feeling.  Kinda like how vicks vapo rub feels.  I could easily see how someone with sensitive skin would get a burning sensation tho.  All in all it works great for me and the Calm Balm is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Good product works well may miss a few but still good..  If you do miss some wait a day before reapplication</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  spread it on, wait, and then the hair wipes right off.  No smell, no burn, just an easy process.  Quick shipment too, a really Amazon buy.</li>
            <li> I get terrible razor burn with the traditional shaving cream and razor and things like nair and veet smell awful/ burn. After reading a million reviews on other &amp;#34;lady specific&amp;#34; no shave treatments i stumbled upon Bare Balls. I &amp;#34;bought&amp;#34; it for my boyfriend so I could try it out. This stuff works wonders and leaves you smooth without burning. My boyfriend also uses it and loves it. The smell is great as well and the effect last a long time.</li>
            <li> I read all of the comments, and have really been looking for something that I could use in the &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34;  but the first time I tried the BALLS product it did not remove any hair.  So i thought I would try it again, leaving it on the maximum time as stated from the Manufacturer.  Then I used the glove in the lukewarm shower as per instructions and rub, and so I did.  Afterwards, it did remove some of the hair, but left me with red bumps all over the place, and the whole genital area and anus area were extremely sensitive for 2 weeks.  And guess what?  It did not remove the hair as advertised.  I am back to razor blades.  And it you really want to have smooth balls, i recommend using the ladies razors (disposable ) for their legs.  They work great.  My favorite is Venus.  They are easier to use then mens razors, are smoother to those sensitive areas, and I have never cut myself, and afterward, you have smooth balls and surrounding areas.  If you are as frustrated with the Bare Pair products, try Venus blades for women.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Feels great.  And then it takes off your skin.  You have lost your mind if you put this on the coin purse.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely delighted to recommend this product! This is my first attempt at hair removal and it really works!!!! I removed hair from my back, butt, and the privats!!! I ordered it a few months ago and I am back! After several days everything is still as smooth as a babies butt! NOW my wife is using it and I have to order my own supply. Great find!!!!</li>
            <li> works really great if you&#x27;re looking for smooth balls. I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for the smoothest balls possible.</li>
            <li> I used this EXACTLY as the instructions said to use it, and the good news is, I had little to no irritation.  The problem was, it removed zero hair under the surface of the skin.  Much like most other products on the market, it simply burned off the part of the hair that it touched, which makes it pretty much as effective as shaving.  I could see hair at the skin level immediately after use, and I had serious stubble the very next day.  The product was a complete waste of money for me.  To be fair, not every product works for everyone, but also to be fair, realize there are a rash of products sold online that pay people to give them positive reviews, so I don&#x27;t know where this one fits.  Could be either way.  I will say that I have dark, course hair, so if you do as well, this may not work for you.  On a side note, it looks like this company is run out of someone&#x27;s basement.  It came in a Ziploc bag, and the instructions were photocopied.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  They were actually photocopied.  The glove is pretty lame too.  Looks like something a five year old lost on his way to kindergarten...in 1962.  Overall, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work. It didn&#x27;t burn at all. Worked really well on chest hair as well. I&#x27;m not taking a razor to myself, and I didn&#x27;t want to experiment with waxing at this point. It isn&#x27;t going to take everything off, but it does a great job. I think the second go round will work even better. Again, no burn at all. Follow the instructions and you will be fine. Make sure you use enough of it, leave it on for about 15 minutes and gently take it off in the shower. Just don&#x27;t get too rough with it or I can imagine you would end up irritated. The balm is good stuff too. I was worried that there were &#x27;planted&#x27; reviews here, but I got it anyway and I&#x27;m glad I did. It only kept me smooth for a few days, but after two weeks, it&#x27;s coming back slowly and feels pretty soft. I&#x27;ll update my review after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> The product left me hair free soft and smooth. My girlfriend loved it. It left me free of hair and did not burn or smellnbad.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, no pain, great results.</li>
            <li> wow, i feel like a new man!!</li>
            <li> worked good, no pain removed the hair pretty good&lt;br /&gt;way better than hot wax</li>
            <li> This product works miracles. It doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful, but smells better than Nair! It was effective and there was some tingling and very slight burning sensation. the glove is what really sealed the deal. Using it made all the difference. The lotion that is included also helped a lot. I would recommend using this product at the end of your day, or until you know how you will react.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I waited ten minutes, tested one area, and went to town with the glove.  It started to feel like it was burning so I panicked and started trying to rapidly get it off and it just got worse.  In hindsight I think I hadn&#x27;t waited long enough and the &#x27;burning&#x27; sensation was from basically plucking not quite softened hairs out.  I got the nerve up to try it again 2 weeks later and waited a little bit longer and it was a different experience.  I have one area that was a little sensitive, but overall it wasn&#x27;t bad at all and the balm does feel nice afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little funky to me but I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors and don&#x27;t really like many smells at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change about the packaging would be extra tongue depressors.  You apply the stuff with it and you only get 2 or 3 of them which means you are going to be using the same one over and over again if you go through the three bottles of stuff.  That just seems a little weird to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far as results, it&#x27;s tends to leave a few little hairs around in nooks and crannies, but I suspect that&#x27;s more application technique than product performance.  In areas that you can see while you are applying and using the glove, it&#x27;s razor blade smooth.</li>
            <li> Applied and waited as instructed.  Only a small amount of hair came off.  2nd time, waited a few more minutes longer and applied more, no improvement.  The Spray and Shower Off product worked so much better!  I will try to sell the 2 unopened bottles plus the lotion to recover some $.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Better then Nair!!!</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as advertised!  Much better than shaving.  Love it</li>
            <li> Awesome for men. I liked it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with some skepticism, but was pleasantly surprised by the quick delivery, and even more so by the product performance.  The hair simply wiped away with no irritation. I&#x27;m not sure that the end result lasts longer than shaving, but is certainly more convenient without the risk of nicks and razor burn.  Having 3 tubes should last quite a while considering the first application barely made a dent in my supply. I&#x27;ll be doing another application to clean up a couple spots I missed and to see if this product will remove the little bit of stubble that remains...I&#x27;m optimistic...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done well with hair removal products in the past, but this isn&#x27;t like other products. Leaves skin soft and smooth without irritation. Cheaper and more private than waxing. The only problem is getting enough on back. Safe enough for all skin including sack and crack.</li>
            <li> burns baby it burns.. if you have sensitive skin this is just like nair... be carefull i went 10 min and still got the inside of the leg burned.. the base and balls handled it perfect with little discomfort i did have to do those areas twice at 12 min.  as for the sensitive areas i went 8 min the second time and still burned me so i will have to shave those areas and use this product only around the base and balls area..</li>
            <li> I had been looking around for a hair removal cream that would work for my thick hair and after trying The Bare Pair system I could not have been happier. This product is easy to use, the instructions are clear, and I had no adverse reactions to using it. I highly recommend using The Bare Pair.</li>
            <li> Leaves no smell and works.... no red marks or irritation from it. Will continue to buy this, glad bought the whole package last me longer.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My husband lost a bet and had to go bare. I chose this product for him and haven&#x27;t regretted it. He even likes the way it works and the results. So easy and comfortable. Now he&#x27;s so soft and smooth. I love it! I&#x27;m back for more.</li>
            <li> This product works great. This is the best option for men available! I Will use from now on! Do not even consider anything else!</li>
