            <li>The nails polish is very cute and changes color</li>

            <li>It has not that much of a change but is a great color</li>
            <li>but it chips way to easy.i love the color</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>Took a lot of coats to give ok coverage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Just seemed kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li>the nail polish was ok</li>
            <li>But I love the idea</li>
            <li>but it chips away easily, unless you put on a top coat.</li>
            <li>but like i said chips way to easy.</li>
            <li>Streaky and chips to easily</li>
            <li>Yes, it changed colors but chipped easily.</li>
            <li>Also chipped away very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT GO ON SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the mood colors and have purchased some for friends too.</li>
            <li>fun to wear, but chips easy</li>
            <li>Love the nail polish so much</li>
            <li>Quick shipment ..</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty</li>
            <li>chips real easy but fun while it last</li>
            <li>Unique and really meet expectation !</li>
            <li>Thought it would be fun</li>
            <li>I guess this polish is worth the price though...</li>
            <li>She stated that the colors were not what she expected and the polish not of good quality.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a fun product.  </li>
            <li>The positive - I loved the actual color of the polish and it does really change colors based on the warmth of your body.  </li>
            <li>There is only a slight change in the color, if you want a polish that has a drastic change in the color, I suggest you buy a gel type color changing polish, those work best.</li>
            <li>Gave this to a little girl as a present and she loved it!!</li>
            <li>this is a very cheap type nail paint, reminded me of regular paint.</li>
            <li>Very fast at shipping.</li>
            <li>Worked great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t last on my nails for more than a day before it started chipping.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a pretty polish with noticeable changes based on temperature.</li>
            <li>Cute color and definitely works!</li>
            <li>For example, the tips of my nails were a different color than the cuticle area which gave a very cool effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having fun with the product and my 10 year old....</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li>The nail polish was very matte finish</li>
            <li>and it covers the nail fast ,</li>
            <li>there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of change of color</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference in the changing colors.  </li>
            <li>The polish dries very quickly, but the texture is chalky once dry.</li>
            <li>cheap prices usually means cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I put it on an hour ago (2 coats with a clear coat on top) and it chipped on almost every single one of my nails.</li>
            <li>There is no shine to this product and it needed 3 coats to look halfway decent.</li>
            <li>I tried painting twice and once dry, the paint chips from normal activity on first day!</li>
            <li>I was excited about it, but only last one day.</li>
            <li>Hard to remove since you have to put so many coats on.</li>
            <li>but i can clearly see when it changes.</li>
            <li>The nail polish seemed old.</li>
            <li>peel of quickly, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The dry polish looked cheap and dry.</li>
            <li>You can hardly tell the difference in the color change which is more of a pink to light pink.  </li>
            <li>The only big negative to it is that it chips very easily.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, it&#x27;s not even worth the 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>Not dark enough</li>
            <li>This polish was very flat, took minimum 2 coats, and the color difference was barely visible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> perfect everyone loves this  Thank you</li>
            <li> Definitely changes color. When you are in the shower it shows a drastic change.If you hands are cold it is one color and when the warm up it is another.Needs a top coat unless you want a matte color.</li>
            <li> Thank You for such a rapid delivery. Having fun with the product and my 10 year old....</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. Color pigment is awful</li>
            <li> Not much of a color change between two pinks</li>
            <li> Happy just as described</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover your nails even with two coats.  You can hardly tell the difference in the color change which is more of a pink to light pink.  The polish is a matt finish and was chipping off by the next day.  Thought it would be fun but it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The color was nice but the texture was terrible, it was like wet chalk. There is no shine to this product and it needed 3 coats to look halfway decent. The color change was less than depicted and not as dramatic as posted. Shipping was fast. I was just disapointed in the consistency of the polish and the color change. It chipped in two days even with a top coat.  ***disapointed, no fault of the shipper/supplier*****</li>
            <li> No color change and chipped off</li>
            <li> The colors did not show as they do in the picture. this is a very cheap type nail paint, reminded me of regular paint. I would never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this nail polish. Other reviews say there isn&#x27;t a difference in color but i can clearly see when it changes. It is really dull when it sets so a clear coat is necessary. The only big negative to it is that it chips very easily. I put it on an hour ago (2 coats with a clear coat on top) and it chipped on almost every single one of my nails. If you could find a way to prevent that than its a great nail polish.</li>
            <li> Need minimum of 3 coats to cover and even then it chips almost instantly</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work like the other mood polish that I had seen... Its a Toss-it item.</li>
            <li> Color change not noticeable. Polish peels off after a day. Would not recommend. Bad product.  A waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it does change colors. You have to apply like 3 coats before it starts to cover the nail. It dry very dull. Doesn&#x27;t look nice. I would not wait my money buying it.</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty but it&#x27;s flat with no shine.  And if you use an overcoat it won&#x27;t change color.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Worked great but doesn&#x27;t last long. Also the color doesn&#x27;t look that great. It would be great on a kid though.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT CHANGE COLOR, CHIPS AFTER 10 MINUTES.  DOES NOT GO ON SMOOTH.  COLOR IS UGLY,  WORST NAIL POLISH EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> The nail polish was very matte finish and I expected it to be glossy. I was very disappointed and wish I had ordered only one instead of wasting money on three bottles.</li>
            <li> Colors is way off. Very disappointed. Painted my fingernails with it and took it off five minutes later. The dry polish looked cheap and dry.</li>
            <li> Would be a great product if lasted longer. I was excited about it, but only last one day.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful but the polish cracked and chipped each time I attempted to wear it. The nail polish seemed old.</li>

            <li> It has not that much of a change but is a great color</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it&#x27;s not even worth the 5 bucks. Started chipping (even with under and over coats) the SAME DAY.</li>
            <li> Great color and it did change color but it chips way to easy.i love the color and it covers the nail fast , but like i said chips way to easy.</li>

            <li> When I put it on it was a 1980&#x27;s peach color. As it warmed up it became a silvery peach. Either way it&#x27;s matte and not very pretty. Your mileage may vary. It does dry fast and hard. My two stars mean I don&#x27;t like it, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> This is a polish that is advertised  incorrectly. This polish goes on and dries matte in the color of a flurecent pink. Totally not what this is here.</li>

            <li> Love the nail polish so much I gave a 6 piece set to my daughter and granddaughter and bought another one for myself.  The colors are awesome!!</li>
            <li> not what its cracked up to be</li>
            <li> Cute color and definitely works!</li>
            <li> The nails polish is very cute and changes color but it chips away easily, unless you put on a top coat. With the top coat it&#x27;s the best. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I painted my nails with this and it was like putting on flat paint. Didnt last a day. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference in the changing colors.  Also chipped away very quickly.  Just seemed kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li> the nail polish was ok</li>
            <li> This item was purchased by my daughter. She stated that the colors were not what she expected and the polish not of good quality.  Also the order was broken up into 3 shipments-one of which arrived too late for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the mood colors and have purchased some for friends too. The peach color seems to chip after 2 weeks whereas the purple seemed to stay longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It started cracking and peeling as soon as the polish dried.</li>
            <li> Paint chips very very easily.  I tried painting twice and once dry, the paint chips from normal activity on first day!</li>
            <li> Gave this to a little girl as a present and she loved it!! Changes colors in hot or cold water</li>
            <li> its bull**** so dont waste yr money on it ....its matte colour n if u wash yr hand change ittle bit  ....if u have extra money u can try it ...overall i did mistake</li>
            <li> peel of quickly, doesn&#x27;t last long. Buy it and try and you will be the judge. after few hours paint coming off.</li>
            <li> chips real easy but fun while it last</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves them .. Quick shipment ..</li>
            <li> This nail polish chips almost at once.  But I love the idea and it&#x27;s a fun product.  Hard to remove since you have to put so many coats on.</li>
