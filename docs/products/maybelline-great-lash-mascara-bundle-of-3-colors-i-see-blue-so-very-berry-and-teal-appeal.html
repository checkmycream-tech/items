            <li>It was a great purchase and I am so pleased that I decided to make it.  :-)</li>
            <li>Great item fast shipment</li>
            <li>But I would have like brighter colors so we can see them more.</li>
            <li>Well, I have now worn all three colors and get so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Recommend this purchase for some fun!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little light in color, but 2 coats is perfect!  </li>
            <li>Very fun with coordinating eyeliner.</li>
            <li>So much fun for the Holiday season!</li>
            <li>Maybelline has done a great job with this limited addition.  </li>
            <li>Would like more of the very berry</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smear or come off when exercising, and was pretty easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, happy with it though I wish the red was a little more intense!</li>
            <li>So, when I found the Bundle of three colors on Amazon, I thought it would be worthwhile to buy them, even thinking I would only use the blue.  </li>
            <li>These are fun colors - a throw back to the 70s.  </li>

            <li> For years I have only used Royal Blue Maybelline Mascara, which I could not longer find (disappointing, but true) in the stores where I now shop.  </li>
            <li> Wish the color had been a BIT brighter for the berry color, but the other two show up well.</li>
            <li> Brush is small, so you need to apply a couple times.</li>
            <li> Colored mascara looks silly at work or any formal function, though, in my opinion.</li>

            <li> Wish the color had been a BIT brighter for the berry color, but the other two show up well. Brush is small, so you need to apply a couple times. But it does go on in a couple layers without causing any clumping, though it does add length.  Didn&#x27;t smear or come off when exercising, and was pretty easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, happy with it though I wish the red was a little more intense!</li>
            <li> So much fun for the Holiday season!</li>

            <li> I now have a rainbow of colors.  Maybelline has done a great job with this limited addition.  Perfect mix and match.  Recommend this purchase for some fun!!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. But I would have like brighter colors so we can see them more.</li>
            <li> These are fun colors - a throw back to the 70s.  But once in a while, I&#x27;ll wear them when going to a bar or a girlfriend thing.  Colored mascara looks silly at work or any formal function, though, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Greatest mascara ever</li>
            <li> nice colors, stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Perfect colors to add depth to your mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the brush on this mascara. I had to do 4-5 coats a couple of times throughout the day to see the color.</li>
            <li> Love them and wear them often!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Lasts all day and I have received very nice compliments when wearing!</li>
