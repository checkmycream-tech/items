            <li> We only comb it out when it is wet with conditioner.</li>
            <li> Definitely beyond what I expected.</li>
            <li> I expected 12 combs I only got</li>
            <li> Only comes with 1 comb, but I expected that because of another reviewer on here.</li>
            <li> I think I actually prefer my Conair wide tooth comb that&#x27;s shaped like this: E</li>
            <li> The comb is very sturdy and works well with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I found it awkward to use, but I also don&#x27;t blow-dry my hair straight very often.</li>
            <li> &amp; Black....</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t like the comb too much either though :(</li>
            <li> Also the teeth had little plastic things on them, so when you brush your hair gets tangled in the teeth and breaks off.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have thick, rough, and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> not really sure what I should say.</li>
            <li> a little disappointed because I was going to give out some:(  I can&#x27;t wait to use it , but really wanted to share the experience...</li>
            <li> I decided not to contact the company cause someone on here has already :(and... well go back and read for yourselves:( Don&#x27;t want the drama....</li>

            <li> My daughter and I have thick, rough, and curly hair.  We only comb it out when it is wet with conditioner. These are the only combs I use for combing!</li>
            <li> This comb is excellent for thick hair, especially curly or natural African hair. Great for the shower. You only get one comb, don&#x27;t read &amp;#34;12 count&amp;#34; and think this is an amazing deal. Still this comb is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Really helps with detangling and it makes blow drying my hair much easier. High recommend lite weight comb, even though it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be like me: realize you&#x27;re getting a box of 12 combs! They are like the ones my hairdresser uses to blow out my hair. I found it awkward to use, but I also don&#x27;t blow-dry my hair straight very often. YMMV.</li>
            <li> I take this and 1 other comb to the beauty salon with me and ask the stylist to use it on my hair as it is long and gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> I cut up this product to use at cat whiskers on my wood carvings. So use as a comb I have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;JJK</li>
            <li> I was so glad to receive my rake cause no stores or beauty supply has them. And this&lt;br /&gt;was a great price. It came in black and made of strong plastic and the teeth are strong as well. The only thing is I regret not buying an extra.</li>
            <li> Got my COMB today was supposed to be a 12ct. &amp; Black.... but instead I only received one / and the COMB was Orange... a little disappointed because I was going to give out some:(  I can&#x27;t wait to use it , but really wanted to share the experience... I decided not to contact the company cause someone on here has already :(and... well go back and read for yourselves:( Don&#x27;t want the drama.... BUT SOO EXCITED FOR THE FIRST TIME USE&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> However, This item is listed as a twelve count in two variety.  I only got one large rake which usually only cost $1.99 where I live.  I only purchase this because it came with more than one comb.</li>
            <li> This is a good comb. I purchased Maya Beauty&#x27;s 12 count lot.  Instead they sent me only 1 comb and would not honor their listing even after Amazon CS advised them they need to properly fulfill the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comb is good but do not buy it from Maya Beauty.  I did find another seller and got my lot of 12 which I happily shared with friends and family since it is a good comb.</li>
            <li> Definitely beyond what I expected. This comb is unique, soft and of great quality. I highly recommend this product to anyone. I&#x27;m so happy to get it...</li>
            <li> This was great love it I use it on my daughters hair.  This was so worth the money spent worth more.</li>
            <li> Thought I was buying wholesale...maybe...I expected 12 combs I only got one.you will only get one comb. Very unsatisfied only because I was mislead but it is a great comb...</li>
            <li> This comb was overpriced. It&#x27;s $1 at Walmart. Also the teeth had little plastic things on them, so when you brush your hair gets tangled in the teeth and breaks off. Its a shame I was really looking forward to loving it.</li>
            <li> Only comes with 1 comb, but I expected that because of another reviewer on here. I actually don&#x27;t like the comb too much either though :( It seem to take a lot more of my hair out than my other combs. It&#x27;s awkward to hold. I don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about. I think I actually prefer my Conair wide tooth comb that&#x27;s shaped like this: E</li>
            <li> Love this comb for my natural hair after shampoo.  Really helps with detangling and it makes blow drying my hair much easier.  High recommend lite weight comb,  even though it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Um this is a comb.. not really sure what I should say. I guess it is like coming your hair with your fingers(in a good way). Works well for me.</li>
            <li> The comb is very sturdy and works well with thick hair. However, there were not 12 like the item description says, there was only one comb.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could say I loved a comb; it&#x27;s kind of like saying &amp;#34;I love lamp&amp;#34; but this comb proved me wrong. Way better than any of the wide tooth combs I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
