            <li>The case is nice too to keep them together orderly.</li>
            <li>There are a nice range of brushes in this set.</li>
            <li>I had heard that this was a reputable brand who made good quality brushes and cosmetics</li>
            <li>but i kind of was.</li>
            <li>I wanted to spend about $10-15 but decided to spend a couple more ($17) because this one sounded good from the reviews.</li>
            <li>Good price, I love it.</li>
            <li>The eye brushes are nice</li>
            <li>These are really nice brushes.</li>
            <li>Good selection for a  good price -  would recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t need a huge amount of brushes</li>
            <li>I did not expect great thing from this order but it is worth!</li>
            <li>You get to know what kind of brushes you use the most.</li>
            <li>For the most part, i&#x27;m loving these brushes.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and totally worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed too much shedding, falls apart easily..</li>
            <li>Overall, great value and a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li>the set is great for the money, everything works great except for the larger angled brush, I use for foundation but it was shedding</li>
            <li>super affordable !!</li>
            <li>The handles are a beautiful matte black, and all the brushes are sleek and scream \\&quot;good quality!&#x27;</li>
            <li>The packing is nice and the set is easy to carry.</li>
            <li>I especially liked the blush brush and how small it was, perfect for applying the right amount of blush.  </li>
            <li>but I love it anyway.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Love the variety I have now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with them</li>
            <li>Its an awesome set, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I love this..</li>
            <li>she isn&#x27;t quite sure what the purpose of a couple of them are, but knowing her, she&#x27;ll figure it out.</li>
            <li>The set was wrapped in plastic but the smell was overwhelming as soon as the box was opened.  </li>
            <li>The eye brushes are great,  but the face brushes and lash/brow brush leave much to be desired.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of brushes for the price, and the quality is ok.</li>
            <li>My biggest gripe is that the bristles aren&#x27;t more dense.</li>
            <li>I bought the 22 piece and fell in love</li>
            <li>The brushes worked perfectly the first time I used them but after the first cleaning, they started to shed from there.</li>
            <li>I love how compact and how well the snap snaps without any struggle.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Just got these brushes and I already love them.</li>
            <li>since I&#x27;ve had these, my makeup comes out looking much better than before :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush set.</li>
            <li>I wanted this set specifically  because of the many eye shadow brushes..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I can definitely say these have been great!</li>
            <li>, the description about both real and synthetic hair sounded good and the picture shows really nice brushes.</li>
            <li>Great gift idea for anyone who loves to do makeup and wants quality brushes that don&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>Compact size and love the case</li>
            <li>There are so many brushes</li>
            <li>~ she loves these brushes! :)</li>
            <li>Love love love these.</li>
            <li>I would love them even more if they came with a guide to what each brush was for.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>i bought these, i told the wife she didn&#x27;t need new brushes because she&#x27;s beautiful without makeup.</li>
            <li>Plus we both love the brush holder, it is worth the money all by itself!!</li>
            <li>Decent brushes for a great price</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The angled blending brush (I think) is pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Pointed brush(?) works pretty good as well&lt;</li>
            <li>Really good brushes, hair falls out at first.</li>
            <li>This brush set arrived and I was initially excited the &amp;#34;carrying case&amp;#34; that holds the brushes looked very nice and the first couple of times I used the brushes</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t be disappointed...and the rollup travel case is super handy</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and the cute lil case makes it easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>Good quality brushes so far, concealer brush was a lot softer than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>These are great brushes; no shedding and they are very soft.</li>
            <li>first off they are gorgeous so soft and look great</li>
            <li>Great replacement for my old set!</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful set full of all the necessary brushes.</li>
            <li>And multiple brushes beautiful and priced appropriately , but I noticed some  do not pick up the make-up materials</li>
            <li>this was my first time buying a brush set form coastal scents... very cheap!</li>
            <li>These brushes are great &amp; incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use brushes, but after seeing all the good reviews about this, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>If you have a budget and can&#x27;t afford $30 a brush this set comes in handy and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Great price, nice brushes, and a perfect set to own when your higher priced favs get dirty.</li>
            <li>I also love the numerous eye brushes that are great for precision work in the outer corners and lash lines.</li>
            <li>Easy to pack colors on&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I prefer to have my brushes in a mug for easy access.</li>
            <li>overall I am more than happy with the brushes.</li>
            <li>just smell strong plastic.</li>
            <li>People on here were talking about a strong smell when they recieved it</li>
            <li>It wasnt that strong</li>
            <li>I have had these brushes for a few months now and they are very easy to clean, also they are in great shape!</li>
            <li>Beautiful and fast delivery Thanks</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;she says they&#x27;re very soft, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Wicked soft with awesome application and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>my wife doesn&#x27;t really seem to enjoy doing her own makeup, but she&#x27;s always helping others with their hair and makeup for formal events.</li>
            <li>Great starter brush set for those starting to dabble.  </li>
            <li>and when you order through CS,  you get free samples.  </li>
            <li>But like I said they are such great quality</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given this set 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the light shedding of the powder brush.</li>
            <li>This set includes a lot of the brushes you would need to do your eye make-up, but they are really cheap.</li>
            <li>it appears that in her opinion, these brushes seem to fit the bill of &amp;#34;nice things&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>also keeps them clean and so easy to pack.</li>
            <li>The case is genuine leather and well constructed.  </li>
            <li>For such a great price, these are a steal.</li>
            <li>I couldnt be more pleased soft to the touch no shedding :) even after i washed them holds</li>
            <li>You are definitely getting a great deal..</li>
            <li>This set is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>the case is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This brush set has more brushed than I will ever use, but the quality is good for the money.</li>
            <li>blush brush is absolutely perfect&lt;br /&gt;-The flat shader brush is absolutely perfect, lots of pigment.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like these, but I am very pleased with the overall quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes feels very smooth and looks very professional, i use the eyeliner ones mostly.</li>
            <li>Had an older coastal scents set for four years that I washed and kept nice</li>
            <li>those are my first brushes and they dont really shed which is good</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and are of quality the case is handy and they are easy to carry around if your on the go or traveling.</li>
            <li>These brushed are amazing!</li>
            <li>Worth buying!</li>
            <li>My first brush kit and I love it.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable price and excellent quality.</li>
            <li>My daughter was so excited to use the brushes.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t wither when i clean them</li>
            <li>Brushes are super soft and works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>I will say I wanted to clean my brushes before use.</li>
            <li>Obviously not absolute top quality, but feel good and have held up well for 2 years.</li>
            <li>daughter, who is nearly brushless in the makeup department, now has an incredible array of useful and decent quality brushes with which to apply her makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The big brushes don&#x27;t smell too pleasant even after washing but still tolerable.  </li>
            <li>This brush set is an amazing value and was delivered within a week, even during the busy Christmas season!</li>
            <li>love the case which is very user friendly</li>
            <li>Well i&#x27;m super excited about this buy.</li>
            <li>they are really nice brushes, they are soft.</li>
            <li>These are cool brushes to put makeup.</li>
            <li>So I got them and they are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Some fall out of bristels but overall good.</li>
            <li>And I started using a Lancome gel eyeliner and this tiny angled brush does a good job of picking up gel eyeliner and drawing lines at my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The brushes overall are good quality.</li>
            <li>It has all the brushes you need for a full face of makeup and</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>but they are soft and dont shed they take the make up pretty good.</li>
            <li>But yes, the case does have a strong chemical smell at first.  </li>
            <li>They come in a nice carrying case that is flat and easy to store.</li>
            <li>My favorite brushes are the angled brush and the bigger found brush,it could use more eyeshadow brushes though.</li>
            <li>Made a quick vid of the brushes on my YouTube channel britzoobabyy, I am planning on making a tutorial to show how well they work..</li>
            <li>Some brushes worked good for a while now they are not as good not great quality</li>
            <li>I am glad that I bought these to replace my older MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>my junior year of high school), and started watching makeup tutorials on youtube, subscribing to gurus, and investing in some more makeup.</li>
            <li>Though this is certainly not top of the line quality, it is very good for the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that I am IN lOVE!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cheap &amp; work very well!</li>
            <li>For the amount of money you&#x27;re paying, these brushes are pretty sturdy!</li>
            <li>Better than my old MAC brushes!  </li>
            <li>I love how soft all of the brushes are!</li>
            <li>But overall, I love my brushes!</li>
            <li>decided to look up on amazon and found this set pretty soon, all the brushes I was looking for to make a perfect makeup, the price is unbelievable!</li>
            <li>Oh and shipping was fast!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with the eyebrow grooming brush, especially since the fine tooth comb is metal.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, and as usual Amazon had the best price</li>
            <li>Coastal scents is an amazing brand, i always saw on YouTube that all the big makeup artists had gotten these or MAC.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup newbie or an expert artist when it comes to cosmetics and makeup related items, but these are amazing...</li>
            <li>Have used most of them every day for the last year and they are still in fantastic shape.</li>
            <li>Def worth the price even with replacing two of them.</li>
            <li>decided against the, I think, 34 pc brush set because there were far too many brushes than I even knew what to do with.</li>
            <li>Quality, softness, elegant, leather pouch, almost all of the sizes and types, extremely soft brush hairs.</li>
            <li>overall it is a nice set of brushes and it includes all the essentials.</li>
            <li>, IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li>so far no shedding ..recommended to all who are on a budget :)</li>
            <li>Nice package to protect and carry them, the powder brush is not my favorite don&#x27;t like how it applies make-up, love the other brushes especially the blush brush and the eyebrow groomer.</li>
            <li>They have a great variety of brushes and it even comes with an eyebrow brush which was something I really wanted but couldn&#x27;t find in a lot of other ones.</li>
            <li>all i know is that the wife told me she was in need of some good brushes, and i thought i would get her these because of their high amazon rating and low price.</li>
            <li>this is a okay brush set i feel as though they are missing some important brushes, which gives me the impression that maybe this brush set is just suppose to be an add on, meaning if you already have brushes that are necessary and you are just trying to build your collection up then this is a good set, but for beginners i would rather recommend the 22 set.</li>
            <li>Does a great job to apply my make up being the amateur that I am.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, they are high quality and they are very soft too!</li>
            <li>The stink is there of course but just wash the brushes with DAWN dish soap and wipe down the case with clorax wipes and then your good to go.</li>
            <li>Also, the brush case had a very strong scent that I can only describe as smelling industrial when I first got them.</li>
            <li>Long story short is that they are very soft, and they seem awesome from the start.</li>
            <li>First off, people were right when they talked about the smell of the packaging.</li>
            <li>do have an odor similar to a kind of industrial cleanser, but that fades away fast.</li>
            <li>but I would have liked to have had a fluffy blending blush; I just went out and bought a cheap one I think from Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>I just received them today, they are two days before expected date, which made it amazing from the start.</li>
            <li>First of all I did not receive an angle brush and a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush set</li>
            <li>I love the smaller brushes in this set.</li>
            <li>it was first set of brushes in my life</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Don&#x27;t use many of the smaller brushes&lt;br /&gt;-Stiff</li>
            <li>When I received the brushes the first thing i  was wash them...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought these brushes for my teen daughter.</li>
            <li>Im going to order the 22 piece set of brushes next amazon has amazed me again :)</li>
            <li>I might be a tab too ambitious at the time I purchased this set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Stay pretty ladies.</li>
            <li>One of my first purchases from Amazon</li>
            <li>I had it for a few months now and they are still in good condition.</li>
            <li>, i have had it a few months with frequent use, and i haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding at all.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only experienced minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>Even the case (which I usually throw out) is very sturdy and nice!</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft, not very much shedding, and AFFORDABLE. :)</li>
            <li>the blush and foundation brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li>If you are someone who wants to improve the appearance of their make-up but not want to break the bank, these are a good starter kit before upgrading to more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m not sure how good they are</li>
            <li>THESE REALLY CAN BE COMPARED TO MAC BRUSHES, THE bristles ARE SO SOFT BUT stand FIRM, they pick shadows up and actually leave it on the skin, u can blend etc.. IM HAPPY WiTH MY PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>I only use three of the other brushes on a daily basis and I am very happy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use for the  the different areas in the face.</li>
            <li>came nicely wrapped and the case did say coastal scents which from a previous review i thought I was going to have a problem.</li>
            <li>All the Coastal Scents brushes cleaned beautifully and even some of my other brushes, however my MAC brushes held soooo much product and were the most difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>, the brushes are quite large, if you&#x27;re looking for something to take in your purse or to travel, these are not what you want.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t any positive thing that I can say about these brushes.</li>
            <li>When I originally purchased them, I had the intention of purchasing a higher quality foundation brush from a different company, but after using the one that came with this</li>
            <li>she scoffed at my little brownie points remark, and then told me i couldn&#x27;t talk my way out of buying her nice things.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely high quality and you get everything you need for your makeup, exactly what shown in the picture and none of the brushes get no use like so often in a brush set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They arrived sooner then expected too :)</li>
            <li>They arrived very timely.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>All the brushes do what they&#x27;re meant to do very well.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really have any idea what i&#x27;m doing when i buy makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>They are also very sleek looking and seem to be well constructed.</li>
            <li>I threw that away and bought a Real Techniques powder brush, which I loooooove.</li>
            <li>one of them the liner brush broke really fast</li>
            <li>These are an absolute steal for the price.  </li>
            <li>appliers (haha)</li>
            <li>Brushes shed too much for me..</li>
            <li>but in all honestly it is high quality leather and all!</li>
            <li>They have very sturdy bristles and look and feel like MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>anyway I really like the foundation brush</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care about that part.</li>
            <li>But the actually brush end is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Im very budget savvy</li>
            <li>so I was really looking for some quality</li>
            <li>These brushes are great-my daughter worked in makeup sales and asked me to get her some, and she is very picky.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t regret it , these brushes are very reliable.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and the brushes I have used so far are very soft and apply my makeup smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I needed some good blending brushes along with small tip brushes to add color on the lash line, which are all included in this set!  </li>
            <li>The 12pc brush set offers the right amount of brushes for beginning to intermediate makeup</li>
            <li>Very soft, but still apply makeup very well!</li>
            <li>This product is so much better quality then i expected!</li>
            <li>only good thing is that the brushes are soft, but they are not high quality.</li>
            <li>small angled brush is AMAZING for adding eyeshadow to the bottom lash line</li>
            <li>I am very beginner though but even for me it is obvious that brushes are enough for makeup play:)))</li>
            <li>Other than that, all the other brushes are pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>If you lose one you won&#x27;t have a break down and they still do the job :)</li>
            <li>And to this very day, they are still the same as then they first arrived!</li>
            <li>Concealer brush isn&#x27;t great quality, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li>I am particular on my brushes and their softness.</li>
            <li>You get a lot of decent eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>Grabbed some super glue and put it back together.</li>
            <li>I love the different brushes especially the angle brush to apply my liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re inexpensive and decent quality.</li>
            <li>This is a decent brush set for the price.  </li>
            <li>the quaulity of the brushes are decent for the price, no shedding.</li>
            <li>I really like the coastal scents brushes, they are very soft and durable.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty fantastic set for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Very soft and at the same time firm enough so as to give good application of makeup..!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>And has a high chemical smell..</li>
            <li>She always is &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; my Sephora brushes and my high end palettes in which I have to go on a goose chase for when I use them if not returned.</li>
            <li>But these aren&#x27;t high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>/&gt;Setting my expectations not to high</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and blend products very well.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and gentle against my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very tender skin rather sensitive...  </li>
            <li>Real soft</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use many of these brushes anyway, but the ones I did didn&#x27;t last too long or wash well.</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>if your looking for some affordable brushes this are the ones just remember to wash them before using other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li>Every kind of brush you will ever need, the eye liner brush is unbelievable!</li>
            <li>and I noticed right away that the brushes that I received are completely different from the photo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need new brushes for a while.</li>
            <li>but now i never see them because all the brushes she uses now live inside this</li>
            <li>and I must say I live them.</li>
            <li>I have been recommending them to everyone who is in the market for new brushes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to putting on makeup you can go on their website and it will tell you what each brush is for.</li>
            <li>The spaces are big enough to fit in some.</li>
            <li>These are just as good, in fact BETTER because they were less expensive</li>
            <li>I really like how soft the brushes are and they apply great, but the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed with them is that some of the bristles does fall off and shed a little bit when I use them, especially the bigger blush/concealer brushes.</li>
            <li>They are all very soft,  no shedding and the dye doesn&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>bristles are very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li>brushes are so soft and seems to be in high quality.</li>
            <li>and I was very surprised with these brushes.</li>
            <li>Definitely wash them with brush cleaner first</li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;ll order more of this brand..</li>
            <li>The other brushes are not bad..</li>
            <li>Only downside i could find is, they have a bit of a chemical smell when you first open it (which i didn&#x27;t mind ), other than that its absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>All my makeup is good quality and never had any trouble applying it with my Sephora brushes, which are now a little too old and decided to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Giving this a 5 star simply because the shipping came a few days before it said it would be here, and the brushes feel AMAZING especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The powder brushes are exceptionally soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set for my younger sister who is slowly starting to have a big love for make-up like me and about to go to college later this fall.</li>
            <li>This set has a mix of natural &amp; synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and apply product well.</li>
            <li>I ended up with all the color in one part of my cheeks, which did not look natural.</li>
            <li>I suspect the bristles are synthetic but they are soft and well packed and do not come out.</li>
            <li>I am not going to say i was surprised..</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>she really needed a basic, beginners kit and this hit the nail on the head.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft....</li>
            <li>I would deffinetley recommend Coastal Scents brushes to anyone and everyone who loves makeup whether professional or just playing around.</li>
            <li>All the makeup brushes are soft and dense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides this, the bristles are soft and they apply makeup well.</li>
            <li>Maybe a professional makeup artist would prefer the longer handles, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Thanks to online makeup tutorials, I learned quite a bit, still I feel like there should be labels or a simple instruction sheet included in the package.</li>
            <li>They are comparable to brand name brushes, soft but, sturdy, and</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>SHIPPED AND RECEIVED ALL WITHIN 4 DAYS.. came a day early</li>
            <li>but so far there is none.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are so soft.....</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t ready to dish out 100 bucks for makeup brushes (Sigma) when I&#x27;m just learning how to properly use them.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and stay intact.</li>
            <li>This set is definitely worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>Eyeshadow lovers, be warned there are no real blending brushes in this kit, although I suppose the large pencil one can blend the crease decently.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this brush set is worth the price</li>
            <li>She was right: they are soft, do not shed, and work extremely well for the price.  </li>
            <li>and I decided to also clean my everyday brushes.</li>
            <li>Even only using three brushes when the whole set costs less than 1 brush in a makeup retail store, worth it.</li>
            <li>They hold the makeup well and place it properly, but they won&#x27;t fit in an average case.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;d ever heard of the brand, but it didn&#x27;t take long for her to get rid of most of her old brushes and start using these (i know this because her brushes are usually all over the bathroom,</li>
            <li>long as you clean the brushes properly after each use and take care of them, these brushes should hold up for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>The contour brush sheds like no other.</li>
            <li>The package does smell a little when you get it but as long as you wash the brushes, it should be fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that, these brushes I believe are definitely worth the price, especially if you&#x27;re a beginner at make-up like me.</li>
            <li>Like what other reviewers said, there is that weird smell when you first open them, but once you&#x27;ve cleaned them once and just gently wipe the case, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft enough and well made, none of the heads fall off, yet.  </li>
            <li>and they BARELY shed.</li>
            <li>The blush brush and powder brush are much nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is how much volume there is to the powder brush, it seems a little overwhelming at times.</li>
            <li>More than enough for the average gal or some one looking for a small, portable travel size set.  </li>
            <li>(The case is also very nice-there is a slight chemical smell</li>
            <li>So, I purchased a big, Sephora eye palette that has every color under the sun and what else to go with it other than a new brush set!?</li>
            <li>After a few months of testing the brushes out, I found that the face brushes (powder, angled &amp; large foundation) started shedding when cleaning.</li>
            <li>I gave them a wash when I first got them and noticed very little shedding.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy, I was afraid that for the price they would be cheap, but they&#x27;re</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For the price, this set is nice.</li>
            <li> The case is nice too to keep them together orderly.</li>
            <li> There are a nice range of brushes in this set.</li>
            <li> I had heard that this was a reputable brand who made good quality brushes and cosmetics</li>
            <li> but i kind of was.</li>
            <li> I wanted to spend about $10-15 but decided to spend a couple more ($17) because this one sounded good from the reviews.</li>
            <li> Good price, I love it.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are nice</li>
            <li> These are really nice brushes.</li>
            <li> Good selection for a  good price -  would recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t need a huge amount of brushes</li>
            <li> I did not expect great thing from this order but it is worth!</li>
            <li> You get to know what kind of brushes you use the most.</li>
            <li> For the most part, i&#x27;m loving these brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and totally worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed too much shedding, falls apart easily..</li>
            <li> Overall, great value and a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> the set is great for the money, everything works great except for the larger angled brush, I use for foundation but it was shedding</li>
            <li> super affordable !!</li>
            <li> The handles are a beautiful matte black, and all the brushes are sleek and scream \\&quot;good quality!&#x27;</li>
            <li> The packing is nice and the set is easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I especially liked the blush brush and how small it was, perfect for applying the right amount of blush.  </li>
            <li> but I love it anyway.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Love the variety I have now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with them</li>
            <li> Its an awesome set, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this..</li>
            <li> she isn&#x27;t quite sure what the purpose of a couple of them are, but knowing her, she&#x27;ll figure it out.</li>
            <li> The set was wrapped in plastic but the smell was overwhelming as soon as the box was opened.  </li>
            <li> The eye brushes are great,  but the face brushes and lash/brow brush leave much to be desired.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of brushes for the price, and the quality is ok.</li>
            <li> My biggest gripe is that the bristles aren&#x27;t more dense.</li>
            <li> I bought the 22 piece and fell in love</li>
            <li> The brushes worked perfectly the first time I used them but after the first cleaning, they started to shed from there.</li>
            <li> I love how compact and how well the snap snaps without any struggle.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Just got these brushes and I already love them.</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve had these, my makeup comes out looking much better than before :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush set.</li>
            <li> I wanted this set specifically  because of the many eye shadow brushes..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I can definitely say these have been great!</li>
            <li> , the description about both real and synthetic hair sounded good and the picture shows really nice brushes.</li>
            <li> Great gift idea for anyone who loves to do makeup and wants quality brushes that don&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Compact size and love the case</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes</li>
            <li> ~ she loves these brushes! :)</li>
            <li> Love love love these.</li>
            <li> I would love them even more if they came with a guide to what each brush was for.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> i bought these, i told the wife she didn&#x27;t need new brushes because she&#x27;s beautiful without makeup.</li>
            <li> Plus we both love the brush holder, it is worth the money all by itself!!</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for a great price</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The angled blending brush (I think) is pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Pointed brush(?) works pretty good as well&lt;</li>
            <li> Really good brushes, hair falls out at first.</li>
            <li> This brush set arrived and I was initially excited the &amp;#34;carrying case&amp;#34; that holds the brushes looked very nice and the first couple of times I used the brushes</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed...and the rollup travel case is super handy</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed and the cute lil case makes it easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes so far, concealer brush was a lot softer than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes; no shedding and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> first off they are gorgeous so soft and look great</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my old set!</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful set full of all the necessary brushes.</li>
            <li> And multiple brushes beautiful and priced appropriately , but I noticed some  do not pick up the make-up materials</li>
            <li> this was my first time buying a brush set form coastal scents... very cheap!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great &amp; incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use brushes, but after seeing all the good reviews about this, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> If you have a budget and can&#x27;t afford $30 a brush this set comes in handy and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great price, nice brushes, and a perfect set to own when your higher priced favs get dirty.</li>
            <li> I also love the numerous eye brushes that are great for precision work in the outer corners and lash lines.</li>
            <li> Easy to pack colors on&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I prefer to have my brushes in a mug for easy access.</li>
            <li> overall I am more than happy with the brushes.</li>
            <li> just smell strong plastic.</li>
            <li> People on here were talking about a strong smell when they recieved it</li>
            <li> It wasnt that strong</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for a few months now and they are very easy to clean, also they are in great shape!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and fast delivery Thanks</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;she says they&#x27;re very soft, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Wicked soft with awesome application and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> my wife doesn&#x27;t really seem to enjoy doing her own makeup, but she&#x27;s always helping others with their hair and makeup for formal events.</li>
            <li> Great starter brush set for those starting to dabble.  </li>
            <li> and when you order through CS,  you get free samples.  </li>
            <li> But like I said they are such great quality</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this set 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the light shedding of the powder brush.</li>
            <li> This set includes a lot of the brushes you would need to do your eye make-up, but they are really cheap.</li>
            <li> it appears that in her opinion, these brushes seem to fit the bill of &amp;#34;nice things&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> also keeps them clean and so easy to pack.</li>
            <li> The case is genuine leather and well constructed.  </li>
            <li> For such a great price, these are a steal.</li>
            <li> I couldnt be more pleased soft to the touch no shedding :) even after i washed them holds</li>
            <li> You are definitely getting a great deal..</li>
            <li> This set is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> the case is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This brush set has more brushed than I will ever use, but the quality is good for the money.</li>
            <li> blush brush is absolutely perfect&lt;br /&gt;-The flat shader brush is absolutely perfect, lots of pigment.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like these, but I am very pleased with the overall quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes feels very smooth and looks very professional, i use the eyeliner ones mostly.</li>
            <li> Had an older coastal scents set for four years that I washed and kept nice</li>
            <li> those are my first brushes and they dont really shed which is good</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and are of quality the case is handy and they are easy to carry around if your on the go or traveling.</li>
            <li> These brushed are amazing!</li>
            <li> Worth buying!</li>
            <li> My first brush kit and I love it.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> My daughter was so excited to use the brushes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t wither when i clean them</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft and works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> I will say I wanted to clean my brushes before use.</li>
            <li> Obviously not absolute top quality, but feel good and have held up well for 2 years.</li>
            <li> daughter, who is nearly brushless in the makeup department, now has an incredible array of useful and decent quality brushes with which to apply her makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The big brushes don&#x27;t smell too pleasant even after washing but still tolerable.  </li>
            <li> This brush set is an amazing value and was delivered within a week, even during the busy Christmas season!</li>
            <li> love the case which is very user friendly</li>
            <li> Well i&#x27;m super excited about this buy.</li>
            <li> they are really nice brushes, they are soft.</li>
            <li> These are cool brushes to put makeup.</li>
            <li> So I got them and they are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Some fall out of bristels but overall good.</li>
            <li> And I started using a Lancome gel eyeliner and this tiny angled brush does a good job of picking up gel eyeliner and drawing lines at my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The brushes overall are good quality.</li>
            <li> It has all the brushes you need for a full face of makeup and</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> but they are soft and dont shed they take the make up pretty good.</li>
            <li> But yes, the case does have a strong chemical smell at first.  </li>
            <li> They come in a nice carrying case that is flat and easy to store.</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes are the angled brush and the bigger found brush,it could use more eyeshadow brushes though.</li>
            <li> Made a quick vid of the brushes on my YouTube channel britzoobabyy, I am planning on making a tutorial to show how well they work..</li>
            <li> Some brushes worked good for a while now they are not as good not great quality</li>
            <li> I am glad that I bought these to replace my older MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> my junior year of high school), and started watching makeup tutorials on youtube, subscribing to gurus, and investing in some more makeup.</li>
            <li> Though this is certainly not top of the line quality, it is very good for the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that I am IN lOVE!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cheap &amp; work very well!</li>
            <li> For the amount of money you&#x27;re paying, these brushes are pretty sturdy!</li>
            <li> Better than my old MAC brushes!  </li>
            <li> I love how soft all of the brushes are!</li>
            <li> But overall, I love my brushes!</li>
            <li> decided to look up on amazon and found this set pretty soon, all the brushes I was looking for to make a perfect makeup, the price is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Oh and shipping was fast!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with the eyebrow grooming brush, especially since the fine tooth comb is metal.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, and as usual Amazon had the best price</li>
            <li> Coastal scents is an amazing brand, i always saw on YouTube that all the big makeup artists had gotten these or MAC.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup newbie or an expert artist when it comes to cosmetics and makeup related items, but these are amazing...</li>
            <li> Have used most of them every day for the last year and they are still in fantastic shape.</li>
            <li> Def worth the price even with replacing two of them.</li>
            <li> decided against the, I think, 34 pc brush set because there were far too many brushes than I even knew what to do with.</li>
            <li> Quality, softness, elegant, leather pouch, almost all of the sizes and types, extremely soft brush hairs.</li>
            <li> overall it is a nice set of brushes and it includes all the essentials.</li>
            <li> , IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li> so far no shedding ..recommended to all who are on a budget :)</li>
            <li> Nice package to protect and carry them, the powder brush is not my favorite don&#x27;t like how it applies make-up, love the other brushes especially the blush brush and the eyebrow groomer.</li>
            <li> They have a great variety of brushes and it even comes with an eyebrow brush which was something I really wanted but couldn&#x27;t find in a lot of other ones.</li>
            <li> all i know is that the wife told me she was in need of some good brushes, and i thought i would get her these because of their high amazon rating and low price.</li>
            <li> this is a okay brush set i feel as though they are missing some important brushes, which gives me the impression that maybe this brush set is just suppose to be an add on, meaning if you already have brushes that are necessary and you are just trying to build your collection up then this is a good set, but for beginners i would rather recommend the 22 set.</li>
            <li> Does a great job to apply my make up being the amateur that I am.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they are high quality and they are very soft too!</li>
            <li> The stink is there of course but just wash the brushes with DAWN dish soap and wipe down the case with clorax wipes and then your good to go.</li>
            <li> Also, the brush case had a very strong scent that I can only describe as smelling industrial when I first got them.</li>
            <li> Long story short is that they are very soft, and they seem awesome from the start.</li>
            <li> First off, people were right when they talked about the smell of the packaging.</li>
            <li> do have an odor similar to a kind of industrial cleanser, but that fades away fast.</li>
            <li> but I would have liked to have had a fluffy blending blush; I just went out and bought a cheap one I think from Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> I just received them today, they are two days before expected date, which made it amazing from the start.</li>
            <li> First of all I did not receive an angle brush and a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush set</li>
            <li> I love the smaller brushes in this set.</li>
            <li> it was first set of brushes in my life</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Don&#x27;t use many of the smaller brushes&lt;br /&gt;-Stiff</li>
            <li> When I received the brushes the first thing i  was wash them...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought these brushes for my teen daughter.</li>
            <li> Im going to order the 22 piece set of brushes next amazon has amazed me again :)</li>
            <li> I might be a tab too ambitious at the time I purchased this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Stay pretty ladies.</li>
            <li> One of my first purchases from Amazon</li>
            <li> I had it for a few months now and they are still in good condition.</li>
            <li> , i have had it a few months with frequent use, and i haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding at all.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only experienced minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> Even the case (which I usually throw out) is very sturdy and nice!</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft, not very much shedding, and AFFORDABLE. :)</li>
            <li> the blush and foundation brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li> If you are someone who wants to improve the appearance of their make-up but not want to break the bank, these are a good starter kit before upgrading to more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure how good they are</li>
            <li> THESE REALLY CAN BE COMPARED TO MAC BRUSHES, THE bristles ARE SO SOFT BUT stand FIRM, they pick shadows up and actually leave it on the skin, u can blend etc.. IM HAPPY WiTH MY PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I only use three of the other brushes on a daily basis and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use for the  the different areas in the face.</li>
            <li> came nicely wrapped and the case did say coastal scents which from a previous review i thought I was going to have a problem.</li>
            <li> All the Coastal Scents brushes cleaned beautifully and even some of my other brushes, however my MAC brushes held soooo much product and were the most difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> , the brushes are quite large, if you&#x27;re looking for something to take in your purse or to travel, these are not what you want.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t any positive thing that I can say about these brushes.</li>
            <li> When I originally purchased them, I had the intention of purchasing a higher quality foundation brush from a different company, but after using the one that came with this</li>
            <li> she scoffed at my little brownie points remark, and then told me i couldn&#x27;t talk my way out of buying her nice things.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely high quality and you get everything you need for your makeup, exactly what shown in the picture and none of the brushes get no use like so often in a brush set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They arrived sooner then expected too :)</li>
            <li> They arrived very timely.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> All the brushes do what they&#x27;re meant to do very well.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really have any idea what i&#x27;m doing when i buy makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> They are also very sleek looking and seem to be well constructed.</li>
            <li> I threw that away and bought a Real Techniques powder brush, which I loooooove.</li>
            <li> one of them the liner brush broke really fast</li>
            <li> These are an absolute steal for the price.  </li>
            <li> appliers (haha)</li>
            <li> Brushes shed too much for me..</li>
            <li> but in all honestly it is high quality leather and all!</li>
            <li> They have very sturdy bristles and look and feel like MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> anyway I really like the foundation brush</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care about that part.</li>
            <li> But the actually brush end is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Im very budget savvy</li>
            <li> so I was really looking for some quality</li>
            <li> These brushes are great-my daughter worked in makeup sales and asked me to get her some, and she is very picky.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t regret it , these brushes are very reliable.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and the brushes I have used so far are very soft and apply my makeup smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I needed some good blending brushes along with small tip brushes to add color on the lash line, which are all included in this set!  </li>
            <li> The 12pc brush set offers the right amount of brushes for beginning to intermediate makeup</li>
            <li> Very soft, but still apply makeup very well!</li>
            <li> This product is so much better quality then i expected!</li>
            <li> only good thing is that the brushes are soft, but they are not high quality.</li>
            <li> small angled brush is AMAZING for adding eyeshadow to the bottom lash line</li>
            <li> I am very beginner though but even for me it is obvious that brushes are enough for makeup play:)))</li>
            <li> Other than that, all the other brushes are pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> If you lose one you won&#x27;t have a break down and they still do the job :)</li>
            <li> And to this very day, they are still the same as then they first arrived!</li>
            <li> Concealer brush isn&#x27;t great quality, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I am particular on my brushes and their softness.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of decent eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> Grabbed some super glue and put it back together.</li>
            <li> I love the different brushes especially the angle brush to apply my liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re inexpensive and decent quality.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush set for the price.  </li>
            <li> the quaulity of the brushes are decent for the price, no shedding.</li>
            <li> I really like the coastal scents brushes, they are very soft and durable.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty fantastic set for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Very soft and at the same time firm enough so as to give good application of makeup..!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> And has a high chemical smell..</li>
            <li> She always is &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; my Sephora brushes and my high end palettes in which I have to go on a goose chase for when I use them if not returned.</li>
            <li> But these aren&#x27;t high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> /&gt;Setting my expectations not to high</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and blend products very well.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and gentle against my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very tender skin rather sensitive...  </li>
            <li> Real soft</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many of these brushes anyway, but the ones I did didn&#x27;t last too long or wash well.</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> if your looking for some affordable brushes this are the ones just remember to wash them before using other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li> Every kind of brush you will ever need, the eye liner brush is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> and I noticed right away that the brushes that I received are completely different from the photo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need new brushes for a while.</li>
            <li> but now i never see them because all the brushes she uses now live inside this</li>
            <li> and I must say I live them.</li>
            <li> I have been recommending them to everyone who is in the market for new brushes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to putting on makeup you can go on their website and it will tell you what each brush is for.</li>
            <li> The spaces are big enough to fit in some.</li>
            <li> These are just as good, in fact BETTER because they were less expensive</li>
            <li> I really like how soft the brushes are and they apply great, but the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed with them is that some of the bristles does fall off and shed a little bit when I use them, especially the bigger blush/concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> They are all very soft,  no shedding and the dye doesn&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> bristles are very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li> brushes are so soft and seems to be in high quality.</li>
            <li> and I was very surprised with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Definitely wash them with brush cleaner first</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll order more of this brand..</li>
            <li> The other brushes are not bad..</li>
            <li> Only downside i could find is, they have a bit of a chemical smell when you first open it (which i didn&#x27;t mind ), other than that its absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> All my makeup is good quality and never had any trouble applying it with my Sephora brushes, which are now a little too old and decided to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Giving this a 5 star simply because the shipping came a few days before it said it would be here, and the brushes feel AMAZING especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The powder brushes are exceptionally soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my younger sister who is slowly starting to have a big love for make-up like me and about to go to college later this fall.</li>
            <li> This set has a mix of natural &amp; synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and apply product well.</li>
            <li> I ended up with all the color in one part of my cheeks, which did not look natural.</li>
            <li> I suspect the bristles are synthetic but they are soft and well packed and do not come out.</li>
            <li> I am not going to say i was surprised..</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> she really needed a basic, beginners kit and this hit the nail on the head.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft....</li>
            <li> I would deffinetley recommend Coastal Scents brushes to anyone and everyone who loves makeup whether professional or just playing around.</li>
            <li> All the makeup brushes are soft and dense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides this, the bristles are soft and they apply makeup well.</li>
            <li> Maybe a professional makeup artist would prefer the longer handles, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Thanks to online makeup tutorials, I learned quite a bit, still I feel like there should be labels or a simple instruction sheet included in the package.</li>
            <li> They are comparable to brand name brushes, soft but, sturdy, and</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> SHIPPED AND RECEIVED ALL WITHIN 4 DAYS.. came a day early</li>
            <li> but so far there is none.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are so soft.....</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t ready to dish out 100 bucks for makeup brushes (Sigma) when I&#x27;m just learning how to properly use them.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and stay intact.</li>
            <li> This set is definitely worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow lovers, be warned there are no real blending brushes in this kit, although I suppose the large pencil one can blend the crease decently.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this brush set is worth the price</li>
            <li> She was right: they are soft, do not shed, and work extremely well for the price.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to also clean my everyday brushes.</li>
            <li> Even only using three brushes when the whole set costs less than 1 brush in a makeup retail store, worth it.</li>
            <li> They hold the makeup well and place it properly, but they won&#x27;t fit in an average case.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;d ever heard of the brand, but it didn&#x27;t take long for her to get rid of most of her old brushes and start using these (i know this because her brushes are usually all over the bathroom,</li>
            <li> long as you clean the brushes properly after each use and take care of them, these brushes should hold up for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> The contour brush sheds like no other.</li>
            <li> The package does smell a little when you get it but as long as you wash the brushes, it should be fine.</li>
            <li> Other than that, these brushes I believe are definitely worth the price, especially if you&#x27;re a beginner at make-up like me.</li>
            <li> Like what other reviewers said, there is that weird smell when you first open them, but once you&#x27;ve cleaned them once and just gently wipe the case, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft enough and well made, none of the heads fall off, yet.  </li>
            <li> and they BARELY shed.</li>
            <li> The blush brush and powder brush are much nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is how much volume there is to the powder brush, it seems a little overwhelming at times.</li>
            <li> More than enough for the average gal or some one looking for a small, portable travel size set.  </li>
            <li> (The case is also very nice-there is a slight chemical smell</li>
            <li> So, I purchased a big, Sephora eye palette that has every color under the sun and what else to go with it other than a new brush set!?</li>
            <li> After a few months of testing the brushes out, I found that the face brushes (powder, angled &amp; large foundation) started shedding when cleaning.</li>
            <li> I gave them a wash when I first got them and noticed very little shedding.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy, I was afraid that for the price they would be cheap, but they&#x27;re</li>
            <li> It has all the brushes you would normally use for an everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a new makeup brush set few weeks ago, I had one before that</li>
            <li> They are soft, don&#x27;t shed, and don&#x27;t smell bad like most makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> so I had to wash and dry it multiple times.</li>
            <li> but when I put makeup on I spend about an extra 5 minutes picking loose hairs off my face..</li>
            <li> but the angled bronzer brush is a little too soft and just blah.</li>
            <li> but everything I looked at was either really cheap looking or really expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a make-up professional, just an everyday user.</li>
            <li> like they&#x27;ve sat somewhere... too long ....with no air circulation.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of them..not too soft but not too stiff.</li>
            <li> The other smaller brushes have not had this problem yet.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I noticed is that the eye brushes are not the same at all!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to send the whole pack back as i needed them and as they don&#x27;t seem to do a partial return i have just kept them not very impressed</li>
            <li> so I was very skeptical on buying a brush set that I wasnt able to see in front of me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just heading to Sephora to buy the expensive brushes that are gonna last years and should&#x27;ve bought in the first place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The leather case in which the brushes come in, when you INITIALLY open the package will have that slight leathery smell.&lt;br /&gt;However this smell soon fades after a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they shed a little but just as much as my MAC brushes, which are at least $40/brush</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no shedding problems with any brush except the powder brush.</li>
            <li> so I bought the smaller 12pc set for my everyday, everywhere use.  </li>
            <li> For the 12bucks spent it delivers quality as much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I wish they included a fluffy crease brush, similar to a Sigma E40.  </li>
            <li> but the hairs aren&#x27;t falling or giving me any other problems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Contrary to some of the other reviews complaining about the brissles falling out.</li>
            <li> The other brushes are fab and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Overall i was not completely pleased with this purchase because some of the brushes came with the bristles flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> I compared these to my other brushes (sephora, soniakashuk, and MAC)</li>
            <li> Instead I received two fluffy brushes one big one and one small.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is not ordering the 22 Pc.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone as the bristles fall out all the time, it was not worth it.</li>
            <li> they are so soft but without leaving bristles behind.</li>
            <li> For those who just start might want to get fewer brushes (like a set of 6 ) and something slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, it has died down and I can&#x27;t even say that I notice it anymore if it is still there.</li>
            <li> And the case has a little rip.</li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned before use as recommended but it still sheds a little.</li>
            <li> After washing there was little fall out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed them a few times because I try not to use them too often</li>
            <li> However there are a FEW drawbacks that I&#x27;ve learned to get over.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The fluffy brush sheds.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a few strands on my face which I can just brush off.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes a few months ago.</li>
            <li> They are firm and hold on to colors and apply well.</li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;ve had for a few weeks smell has either worn off or I&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>
            <li> I also like how the handles are matte black with the silver feral (not sure if that is the correct term -.-)  </li>
            <li> am not a fan of the eye shadow crease brushes in this pack which are too stiff.</li>
            <li> Only bad part is when you open it there&#x27;s a smell</li>
            <li> I would rather buy something that does not cost too much because it will still be thrown away anyway when it goes bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the hairs of the brushed started falling out!</li>
            <li> I usually use MAC</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people who are at least semi-professional doing makeup.</li>
            <li> I now use them everyday!!</li>
            <li> Am disappointed that this investment was such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> the brushed blend well and its not to bad for a starter kit</li>
            <li> They are VERY rough, they don&#x27;t pick up a lot of product, and the hairs fall out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was kinda skeptical about buying these at first because of the bad reviews, but I just decided to go with them anyways!</li>
            <li> Not great.  </li>
            <li> Over all I am not happy with this purchase and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> There is not a great blending brush, so I had to purchase that separately.</li>
            <li> However, when I opened the bag the eyebrow brush was completely broken and fell apart in my hands.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not really experienced with make up</li>
            <li> But like i said im not experienced</li>
            <li> That brush makes me angry</li>
            <li> I am probably going to also purchase the 30plus set just because I am obsessed with makeup.</li>
            <li> It smelled like fake leather thats been sitting in its package for a while..</li>
            <li> The magnetic closure artificial leather holder keeps the brushes organized and is a cinch to carry around.</li>
            <li> I had a budget to keep under and was in desperate need of brushes.</li>
            <li> Nothing some crazy glue can&#x27;t fix, but it&#x27;s still inconvenient.</li>
            <li> why :(?</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> .I am very disappointed..</li>
            <li> b/c it shed something horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like these, but I am very pleased with the overall quality of the brushes. Definitely wash them with brush cleaner first so they don&#x27;t shed. The powder brushes are exceptionally soft. Concealer brush isn&#x27;t great quality, but that&#x27;s my only complaint. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These brushed are amazing! I highly recommend them. They arrived sooner then expected too :)</li>
            <li> these are nice brushes.. Very soft and at the same time firm enough so as to give good application of makeup..! Worth buying!</li>
            <li> Great! Has the basics that any person just starting would want/need. They don&#x27;t wither when i clean them, i have had it a few months with frequent use, and i haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding at all. Only downside i could find is, they have a bit of a chemical smell when you first open it (which i didn&#x27;t mind ), other than that its absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use brushes, but after seeing all the good reviews about this, I decided to give it a try. The brushes feels very smooth and looks very professional, i use the eyeliner ones mostly.</li>
            <li> Great starter brush set for those starting to dabble.  When I started using mineral makeup, I bought this set, which has all the brushes I need for the basics (eye lining, foundation/concealer, contouring, blush, eyebrow  grooming).  More than enough for the average gal or some one looking for a small, portable travel size set.  The magnetic closure artificial leather holder keeps the brushes organized and is a cinch to carry around.</li>
            <li> Not great.  I don&#x27;t use many of these brushes anyway, but the ones I did didn&#x27;t last too long or wash well.</li>
            <li> same of the big bushes shade</li>
            <li> just smell strong plastic. but I love it anyway.</li>
            <li> this is a great set for starters.  they shed a little but just as much as my MAC brushes, which are at least $40/brush</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed too much shedding, falls apart easily.. And has a high chemical smell.. But only the power brush.. The other brushes are not bad.. Not sure I&#x27;ll order more of this brand.. However the did arrive on time..</li>
            <li> This is a pretty fantastic set for such a low price. My favorite brushes are the angled brush and the bigger found brush,it could use more eyeshadow brushes though.</li>
            <li> I love this set!  The spaces are big enough to fit in some. Of my extra brushes! They are all very soft,  no shedding and the dye doesn&#x27;t run out.  I did pay the same price that is it offered on the CS website though and when you order through CS,  you get free samples.  So I&#x27;d order off CS if I were to order again.  But like I said they are such great quality I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need new brushes for a while.</li>
            <li> Giving this a 5 star simply because the shipping came a few days before it said it would be here, and the brushes feel AMAZING especially for the price. Only bad part is when you open it there&#x27;s a smell But thats because of the leather holder. but it doesn&#x27;t even matter, these brushes are Great. Recommended this to Everybody!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of homework on brushes when purchasing from Amazon. I had a budget to keep under and was in desperate need of brushes. I&#x27;m a hairdresser and makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;I came among these and ended up purchasing them. They arrived very timely.&lt;br /&gt;They do have an odor similar to a kind of industrial cleanser, but that fades away fast. The smell is not in the brushes, the smell&#x27;s from the carrier. The brushes are individually wrapped up in the carrier.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t shed at all. All the brushes do what they&#x27;re meant to do very well. They are very sturdy, I was afraid that for the price they would be cheap, but they&#x27;re not!&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my face. They hold makeup well.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you clean the brushes properly after each use and take care of them, these brushes should hold up for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. Would recommend xoxo</li>
            <li> Love them. If you have a budget and can&#x27;t afford $30 a brush this set comes in handy and is worth every penny. The brushes are soft and are of quality the case is handy and they are easy to carry around if your on the go or traveling. If you lose one you won&#x27;t have a break down and they still do the job :)</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for a few months now and they are very easy to clean, also they are in great shape! Would definitely recommend especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who loves make-up and stores like Sephora and Ulta. I am particular on my brushes and their softness. I purchased this set for my younger sister who is slowly starting to have a big love for make-up like me and about to go to college later this fall. She always is &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; my Sephora brushes and my high end palettes in which I have to go on a goose chase for when I use them if not returned. So, I purchased a big, Sephora eye palette that has every color under the sun and what else to go with it other than a new brush set!? When I received this, I had to check the softness of the brushes. Let me tell you, I wish I had this set. It is a wonderful set full of all the necessary brushes. My only con would be aside from the shopping page, to include with the brushes a sheet or some form of labeling of the individual brushes for convenience purposes. She loves it though and uses them practically every day!</li>
            <li> After a few months of testing the brushes out, I found that the face brushes (powder, angled &amp; large foundation) started shedding when cleaning. The other smaller brushes have not had this problem yet.  This set has a mix of natural &amp; synthetic brushes. Eyeshadow lovers, be warned there are no real blending brushes in this kit, although I suppose the large pencil one can blend the crease decently.</li>
            <li> Thanks, excellent item.... recommended seller.</li>
            <li> Love these. Have used most of them every day for the last year and they are still in fantastic shape. Almost no shedding.</li>
            <li> I wanna reorder ths prodect becuz it is very good .. but now I cant ship it to Saudi arabia .. why :(?</li>
            <li> My first brush kit and I love it. I would rather buy something that does not cost too much because it will still be thrown away anyway when it goes bad. I had it for a few months now and they are still in good condition. The package does smell a little when you get it but as long as you wash the brushes, it should be fine.</li>
            <li> Love the variety I have now. Easy to use for the  the different areas in the face. I like them.</li>
            <li> So I received this product today and I noticed right away that the brushes that I received are completely different from the photo. First of all I did not receive an angle brush and a foundation brush. Instead I received two fluffy brushes one big one and one small. The other thing I noticed is that the eye brushes are not the same at all!!! I do not have an eye liner brush that bends or the angle blending brush. FINALLY the casing DOES NOT say Coastal Scents so I&#x27;m assuming that this aren&#x27;t Coastal Scent brushes!!!&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing is that the brushes are soft, but they are not high quality. And the case has a little rip. Over all I am not happy with this purchase and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I like when sellers tell you the truth about the brushes they are selling and they obviously didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The packaging is great, no smell like people said. no bristles have come out and even after washing no bristles came out. ordering my daughter a set</li>
            <li> I love the brush case that was included, which I&#x27;m sure will be great for travel. I also love the numerous eye brushes that are great for precision work in the outer corners and lash lines. There is not a great blending brush, so I had to purchase that separately. I have had some issues with shedding with the powder brush and the blush brush. There have been hairs left on my face that I have had to remove. This isn&#x27;t a total deal breaker though, and this has not been the case for the eye brushes. Overall, great value and a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> great easy to clean and use and the carrying case is great for storage loved it !!!!! super affordable !!</li>
            <li> first off they are gorgeous so soft and look great delivered the next day packaging is nice case is like a clutch so easy to travel with they don&#x27;t shed which is a bonus!! in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. Brushes are soft and blend products very well. They do shed a bit, but even my mac brushes shed. It&#x27;s workable.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no shedding problems with any brush except the powder brush. That brush makes me angry b/c it shed something horrible. Other than that I am IN lOVE!!</li>
            <li> These are great starter brushes I LOVE them! They&#x27;re super cheap &amp; work very well! I&#x27;m so pleased with them</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality for the price! There is every kind of brush you would need and the blush and foundation brushes are super soft! Great replacement for my old set!</li>
            <li> This is my first brush set and I must say I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I use the powder and blush brushes daily, prefer to apply foundation with my fingers but I like having a good quality brush just in case. The eyeshadow brushes allow me to create different looks with the Coastal Scents eyeshadow palette I bought. I&#x27;m so in love with the eyebrow grooming brush, especially since the fine tooth comb is metal. I use it to separate my eyelashes after applying mascara. I would&#x27;ve given this set 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the light shedding of the powder brush. I washed and conditioned before use as recommended but it still sheds a little. I would recommend this product to friends. Can&#x27;t wait to get their 22 piece set!</li>
            <li> brushes are so soft and seems to be in high quality. Came in a great pouch. A must buy for you or as a gift.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and gentle against my skin. The case is very handy as well. Let&#x27;s hope I&#x27;m just as happy in the case of durability.</li>
            <li> This brush set arrived and I was initially excited the &amp;#34;carrying case&amp;#34; that holds the brushes looked very nice and the first couple of times I used the brushes I was very pleased. Unfortunately, the hairs of the brushed started falling out! I would look in the mirror and see two or three of them on my face. My search for a durable and affordable brush set continues.</li>
            <li> This set includes a lot of the brushes you would need to do your eye make-up, but they are really cheap. I washed them before use, and there was a lot of hair fall out. Even when I was applying eye shadow, some of the hairs fell out. There really isn&#x27;t any positive thing that I can say about these brushes. They are VERY rough, they don&#x27;t pick up a lot of product, and the hairs fall out like crazy. I would suggest buying something else. I like the travel pouch though.</li>
            <li> I love the smaller brushes in this set. For the amount of money you&#x27;re paying, these brushes are pretty sturdy! I&#x27;ve washed them a few times because I try not to use them too often but the hairs aren&#x27;t falling or giving me any other problems. If you&#x27;re looking for brushes on a budget, this is it!</li>
            <li> Ive had no issues with the brush set. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some of the other reviews complaining about the brissles falling out. Ive had about 5 stuck to my face over the last 6 months. Its an awesome set, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using MAC makeup brushes for years, but wasn&#x27;t up for spending hundreds of dollars to replace them. This brush set has more brushed than I will ever use, but the quality is good for the money. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about the brushes that I have used and don&#x27;t see any difference in my makeup application. No reason not to take a chance and try them for yourself.</li>
            <li> And multiple brushes beautiful and priced appropriately , but I noticed some  do not pick up the make-up materials</li>
            <li> I love this..it came in a beautiful leather casing...well packaged...works great...I don&#x27;t regret buying this product...great for the price...planning to buy one for my niece</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really have any idea what i&#x27;m doing when i buy makeup brushes. all i know is that the wife told me she was in need of some good brushes, and i thought i would get her these because of their high amazon rating and low price. i don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;d ever heard of the brand, but it didn&#x27;t take long for her to get rid of most of her old brushes and start using these (i know this because her brushes are usually all over the bathroom, but now i never see them because all the brushes she uses now live inside this pack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she says they&#x27;re very soft, and that&#x27;s a good thing. she isn&#x27;t quite sure what the purpose of a couple of them are, but knowing her, she&#x27;ll figure it out. my wife doesn&#x27;t really seem to enjoy doing her own makeup, but she&#x27;s always helping others with their hair and makeup for formal events. she even commented that these brushes will work wonderfully for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before i bought these, i told the wife she didn&#x27;t need new brushes because she&#x27;s beautiful without makeup. she scoffed at my little brownie points remark, and then told me i couldn&#x27;t talk my way out of buying her nice things. it appears that in her opinion, these brushes seem to fit the bill of &amp;#34;nice things&amp;#34;. so for that, i&#x27;m quite happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The case and all of the brushes had a VERY strong chemical odor!  The set was wrapped in plastic but the smell was overwhelming as soon as the box was opened.  I am returning this item.</li>
            <li> For the price, this set is nice. The brushes are soft and apply product well. They are also very sleek looking and seem to be well constructed. However, the blush brush doesn&#x27;t do it for me and sheds. Also, the powder brush sheds a lot for me, despite washing it multiple times. I threw that away and bought a Real Techniques powder brush, which I loooooove. I am replacing the blush brush now.  The other brushes are fab and I have no complaints. Def worth the price even with replacing two of them. But yes, the case does have a strong chemical smell at first.  Not an issue for me because I keep my brushes in a glass cup on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/12/13 - Still using the eye brushes.  Recently, the lash brush lost four metal tines while I was cleaning it for the third time.  I don&#x27;t feel like this set is the best quality.  The eye brushes are great,  but the face brushes and lash/brow brush leave much to be desired.</li>
            <li> they are really nice brushes, they are soft. one of them the liner brush broke really fast but i still recommend this set.</li>
            <li> They are some very nice brushes at an inexpensive price.  Better than my old MAC brushes!  The case is nice too to keep them together orderly.</li>
            <li> There are a nice range of brushes in this set. The price was good and the quality is good. I would recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> Great for a starter brush kit. You get to know what kind of brushes you use the most. But these aren&#x27;t high quality so you will have some bristles that fall out.&lt;br /&gt;But overall it&#x27;s worth the price and it was what I was looking for at the time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to Sephora quality this set will not meet your expectations. I don&#x27;t find that the brushes distribute the eye shadows and blush well. I ended up with all the color in one part of my cheeks, which did not look natural. All my makeup is good quality and never had any trouble applying it with my Sephora brushes, which are now a little too old and decided to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brushes are quite large, if you&#x27;re looking for something to take in your purse or to travel, these are not what you want.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m just heading to Sephora to buy the expensive brushes that are gonna last years and should&#x27;ve bought in the first place.</li>
            <li> These are cool brushes to put makeup. it was first set of brushes in my life and I must say I live them.I don&#x27;t want to use something else.They are of good quality.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is okay, but they are a great deal when you consider the amount that you paid. I would recommend these to a friend</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Had an older coastal scents set for four years that I washed and kept nice but I decided it was time to toss them. These were an excellent replacement and I can tell they have increased the quality of their brushes since my first set!</li>
            <li> I wanted to have this brush set because I was taken make up classes and the teacher uses this brushes.  So I got them and they are nice and soft. Totally recommend coastal scents.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of brushes for the price, and the quality is ok. My biggest gripe is that the bristles aren&#x27;t more dense. This is especially true of the powder brush. I think with a powder brush I would like something that&#x27;s a bit fluffier and denser. Overall, it&#x27;s not bad. You get a lot of decent eyeshadow brushes. I wish they&#x27;d put a buffing brush instead of the foundation brush. I find that those are easier to work with and give a nicer finish. It&#x27;s very handy for traveling though, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they are high quality and they are very soft too! I now use them everyday!!</li>
            <li> good quality brushes at a great price</li>
            <li> These are an absolute steal for the price.  Great variety of brushes you won&#x27;t be disappointed...and the rollup travel case is super handy also keeps them clean and so easy to pack.</li>
            <li> One of, if not the best, brand on the market.  I bought the 22 piece and fell in love so I bought the smaller 12pc set for my everyday, everywhere use.  The case is genuine leather and well constructed.  Brushes are super soft and works exceptionally well. Makes the application process effortless. Set is well put together with a brush for every need and the biggest bonus --- a super great value for a steal of a deal!  Absolutely love the Coastal Scents line!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and fast delivery Thanks</li>
            <li> I just recently got into makeup last year (my junior year of high school), and started watching makeup tutorials on youtube, subscribing to gurus, and investing in some more makeup. I had heard that this was a reputable brand who made good quality brushes and cosmetics so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I decided against the, I think, 34 pc brush set because there were far too many brushes than I even knew what to do with. The 12pc brush set offers the right amount of brushes for beginning to intermediate makeup appliers (haha) and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  The price is right, there are a good amount of brushes, the case is really nice, and it&#x27;s a perfect set for applying makeup every day for day time and night time looks. However there are a FEW drawbacks that I&#x27;ve learned to get over.&lt;br /&gt;- The fluffy brush sheds. If you wash it with olive oil and dish detergent this helps with the shedding, however the brush became too oily so I had to wash and dry it multiple times. (It occasionally still sheds)&lt;br /&gt;-The blush brush is absolutely perfect&lt;br /&gt;-The flat shader brush is absolutely perfect, lots of pigment. Easy to pack colors on&lt;br /&gt;-The angled blending brush (I think) is pretty good. Not the BEST blender but it&#x27;s great for the crease&lt;br /&gt;-Pointed brush(?) works pretty good as well&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t use many of the smaller brushes&lt;br /&gt;-Stiff small angled brush is AMAZING for adding eyeshadow to the bottom lash line&lt;br /&gt;-Mascara comb and brow comb are great too&lt;br /&gt;-Overall great, but I would have liked to have had a fluffy blending blush; I just went out and bought a cheap one I think from Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> Like them great variety at a great price. Some fall out of bristels but overall good. Would recommend to others</li>
            <li> Quality, softness, elegant, leather pouch, almost all of the sizes and types, extremely soft brush hairs. Just for 17 bucks.</li>
            <li> When I received the brushes the first thing i  was wash them...the next morning I went to use them and the hairs started falling out! All of the big powder brushes shed as well as several of the eye brushes. .I am very disappointed..this was my first time buying a brush set form coastal scents... very cheap!</li>
            <li> These were recommended to me by the salon that did friend&#x27;s makeup for her wedding.  She was right: they are soft, do not shed, and work extremely well for the price.  I have been recommending them to everyone who is in the market for new brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes worked perfectly the first time I used them but after the first cleaning, they started to shed from there. Brushes shed too much for me.. Will not recommend purchase</li>
            <li> I use eyeshadow, mascara, eyeliner, blush, bronzer, lipstick and foundation daily during work week. This set has just about every brush that covers my need and I feel like a makeup artist using it each morning. My favorites are the contour brush that has rounded angles and pointed eyeshadow brush that distributes eyeshadow in a controlled manner. And I started using a Lancome gel eyeliner and this tiny angled brush does a good job of picking up gel eyeliner and drawing lines at my eyelashes. I suspect the bristles are synthetic but they are soft and well packed and do not come out. The only exception is the largest blush brush whose hair comes out a bit but it&#x27;s just a few strands on my face which I can just brush off. I didn&#x27;t care for the PU bag it came with and discarded it. It was big and I prefer to have my brushes in a mug for easy access. Even though the bag was tossed out, I still think it&#x27;s a great deal. Try it!</li>
            <li> Very good brushes! I did not expect great thing from this order but it is worth! I am very beginner though but even for me it is obvious that brushes are enough for makeup play:)))</li>
            <li> Really good brushes, hair falls out at first. Nice package to protect and carry them, the powder brush is not my favorite don&#x27;t like how it applies make-up, love the other brushes especially the blush brush and the eyebrow groomer.</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes, and my daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought these brushes for my teen daughter. Unbelievable price and excellent quality. My daughter was so excited to use the brushes. She loves them.</li>
            <li> I am not going to say i was surprised.. but i kind of was. This product is so much better quality then i expected! I thought it was going to be great but it was excellent! The picture makes the product look cheaper then it is but in all honestly it is high quality leather and all! I love how compact and how well the snap snaps without any struggle. The brushes are awesome too! I am not a &amp;#34;newbie&amp;#34; to the make-up scene but not a pro either,  so these brushes were perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I ordered these because i go to beauty school to study hair, make-up and nails and they suggested the coastal scents line to me! I took their advice and i am happy I did! I would def order more brushes from them!</li>
            <li> For the most part, i&#x27;m loving these brushes. When I originally purchased them, I had the intention of purchasing a higher quality foundation brush from a different company, but after using the one that came with this I was pleasantly surprised. It blends my foundation beautifully, and this is coming from someone who has been putting foundation on with their fingers for years! I love how soft all of the brushes are! My only complaint is how much volume there is to the powder brush, it seems a little overwhelming at times. Also, the brush case had a very strong scent that I can only describe as smelling industrial when I first got them. After a few weeks, it has died down and I can&#x27;t even say that I notice it anymore if it is still there. I do aspire on purchasing a different case for my brushes though. But overall, I love my brushes! If you are someone who wants to improve the appearance of their make-up but not want to break the bank, these are a good starter kit before upgrading to more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> i gave this to my younger sister as a christmas gift... i was embarrassed by how smelly it was. i told her to wash the brushes before she used them to a) prevent shedding and b) remove the factory smell. overall it is a nice set of brushes and it includes all the essentials. she really needed a basic, beginners kit and this hit the nail on the head.</li>
            <li> I really like the coastal scents brushes, they are very soft and durable. I only wish for the 22 pieces brushes to have the angled eyeliner brush included. It is a great tool for liquid liner applicaition.</li>
            <li> I have very tender skin rather sensitive...  These brushes are so soft.... I love them. They don&#x27;t shed and the cute lil case makes it easy to carry around. Just wished they labeled what some of the brushes do... Not all of us are make up gurus lol.</li>
            <li> Just got these brushes and I already love them. For such a great price, these are a steal. Being so into makeup I use a variety of brushes. Anything from Eco Tools to MAC and now Coastal Scents. I will say I wanted to clean my brushes before use. So I went out and bought a brush cleanser from Sally&#x27;s which was about five dollars and I decided to also clean my everyday brushes. All the Coastal Scents brushes cleaned beautifully and even some of my other brushes, however my MAC brushes held soooo much product and were the most difficult to clean.I almost feel like my MAC brushes are falling apart, and am now having a lot of fallout with them. I would deffinetley recommend Coastal Scents brushes to anyone and everyone who loves makeup whether professional or just playing around. They have very sturdy bristles and look and feel like MAC brushes. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price. The only complaint I have is not ordering the 22 Pc. set.</li>
            <li> The brushes overall are good quality. I rate the eye brushes 5 stars b/c they work great for applying cream or powder eyeshadow and have not had a problem with any of them. The powder brush, however, have been acting up recently. My powder brush handle broke off last week and it began shedding after one wash. Nothing some crazy glue can&#x27;t fix, but it&#x27;s still inconvenient. Other than that, these brushes I believe are definitely worth the price, especially if you&#x27;re a beginner at make-up like me.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes a few months ago. And to this very day, they are still the same as then they first arrived! I have experienced practically no thinning of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I&#x27;ve had these, my makeup comes out looking much better than before :) I recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> All the makeup brushes are soft and dense. I gave them a wash when I first got them and noticed very little shedding. The handles are a beautiful matte black, and all the brushes are sleek and scream \\&quot;good quality!&#x27; Overall, I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend these brushes. (The case is also very nice-there is a slight chemical smell but I&#x27;m hoping it will eventually air out.)</li>
            <li> COMPLET, EXELLENT CONDITIONS, IT IS WORTH THE PRICE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT WILL BUY THE 32 PIECES SET!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COASTAL SCENT PRODUCTS ARE VIP.</li>
            <li> First off, people were right when they talked about the smell of the packaging. Like others, i also agree that the smell eventually goes away. Overall i was not completely pleased with this purchase because some of the brushes came with the bristles flying everywhere. One of the handles had scratches all around, and another was cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides this, the bristles are soft and they apply makeup well. This is a good kit for beginners.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush set. All the brushes are perfect none of them shed whatsoever when I was them and its perfect for an upcoming mua like me (:</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, I am always in search of great brushes. Coastal Scents brushes are grear without spending a fortune!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really good, I like the feel of it on my face. Does a great job to apply my make up being the amateur that I am.</li>
            <li> This brush set is an amazing value and was delivered within a week, even during the busy Christmas season! Highly recommend. Great for people who want good quality at a better price. The different brushes are self explanatory and labeled so that you can look them up on the website if you don&#x27;t know what the brush is used for. I would suggest ordering it from Amazon, rather than Coastal Scents because shipping is faster and reliable from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I wish the handles of these brushes were slightly smaller.  They hold the makeup well and place it properly, but they won&#x27;t fit in an average case.  Maybe a professional makeup artist would prefer the longer handles, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I got my brushes about a week ago and I love them! I usually use MAC but when I put makeup on I spend about an extra 5 minutes picking loose hairs off my face.. so obviously they weren&#x27;t working out, then again I&#x27;ve had them for about over 3 years... I wanted this set specifically  because of the many eye shadow brushes.. I am trying to nail the perfect smokey eye look.. anyway I really like the foundation brush but the angled bronzer brush is a little too soft and just blah. but it still does the job... The stink is there of course but just wash the brushes with DAWN dish soap and wipe down the case with clorax wipes and then your good to go. I am really happy with my purchase and I love makeup!</li>
            <li> I couldnt be more pleased soft to the touch no shedding :) even after i washed them holds product well applys shadows evenly,smoothly and with ease lightweight ,sturdy brushes . Im going to order the 22 piece set of brushes next amazon has amazed me again :)</li>
            <li> I might be a tab too ambitious at the time I purchased this set of brushes. I have just began to learn applying makeup so I didn&#x27;t even know which brush does what. Thanks to online makeup tutorials, I learned quite a bit, still I feel like there should be labels or a simple instruction sheet included in the package. I wouldn&#x27;t even mind if they include some sales flyers.  The brushes are soft enough and well made, none of the heads fall off, yet.  The big brushes don&#x27;t smell too pleasant even after washing but still tolerable.  I would recommend this to people who are at least semi-professional doing makeup. For those who just start might want to get fewer brushes (like a set of 6 ) and something slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them!!!</li>
            <li> This set is definitely worth every penny spent. For the 12bucks spent it delivers quality as much.&lt;br /&gt;I use the blush, angled conealer, eye shadow and lip brushes a lot and I am quite happy with them. I didnt have occasion to try the big powder brush or the foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the eye shadow crease brushes in this pack which are too stiff. However, the shadow brush for applying to the lid and the pointed crease brush are good enough.&lt;br /&gt;On opening the package the case stinked, however after keeping it in the open air for a while it totally has disappered.&lt;br /&gt;I love the case which is very user friendly and I washed every brush before using them.</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes, the quality is great for the price. Yes one of the brushes has detached where the metal meets the wood but I don&#x27;t really care about that part. Grabbed some super glue and put it back together. But the actually brush end is fantastic. Literally use these every day. I am probably going to also purchase the 30plus set just because I am obsessed with makeup.</li>
            <li> It is a great brush set for people who need quality brushes! They are comparable to brand name brushes, soft but, sturdy, and overall I am more than happy with the brushes. Will order again from them. highly recommended</li>
            <li> These brush rate second in my makeup kit along with my Mary Kay brushes. I use these daily and never have an issue. They are firm and hold on to colors and apply well. I love the different brushes especially the angle brush to apply my liquid eyeliner. Not bad at all. Ordered it by mistake but mistake well kept I would say.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good make-up brush set but everything I looked at was either really cheap looking or really expensive. I wanted to spend about $10-15 but decided to spend a couple more ($17) because this one sounded good from the reviews. I am SO happy that I bought them. they are so soft but without leaving bristles behind. They come in a nice carrying case that is flat and easy to store. They have a great variety of brushes and it even comes with an eyebrow brush which was something I really wanted but couldn&#x27;t find in a lot of other ones. This is a great product and totally worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I just received them today, they are two days before expected date, which made it amazing from the start. Coastal scents is an amazing brand, i always saw on YouTube that all the big makeup artists had gotten these or MAC. Long story short is that they are very soft, and they seem awesome from the start. You can get the same set, same price on the coastal scents website, but i have amazon credits so this was a bonus to me! I recommend!</li>
            <li> The packing is nice and the set is easy to carry. It has all the brushes you would normally use for an everyday makeup. Good quality and great buy</li>
            <li> Great product. Wicked soft with awesome application and super fast shipping. Must have product. I love it. Stay pretty ladies.</li>
            <li> Good price, I love it.</li>
            <li> The reviews stated that these brushes were of good quality, however, the set I received is not. The brushes shed and leave hairs all over  my face, even after cleaning them. Am disappointed that this investment was such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my daughter.......</li>
            <li> One of my first purchases from Amazon and I was very surprised with these brushes. I&#x27;m not a makeup newbie or an expert artist when it comes to cosmetics and makeup related items, but these are amazing... The fact that the case comes with it is a plus, too! I really like how soft the brushes are and they apply great, but the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed with them is that some of the bristles does fall off and shed a little bit when I use them, especially the bigger blush/concealer brushes. Like what other reviewers said, there is that weird smell when you first open them, but once you&#x27;ve cleaned them once and just gently wipe the case, it&#x27;s okay. Other than that, this brush set is worth the price and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to makeup brushes but I can definitely say these have been great! Real soft and they BARELY shed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE doing makeup!  It has become an art to me! I needed some good blending brushes along with small tip brushes to add color on the lash line, which are all included in this set!  Very soft, but still apply makeup very well! LOVE THESE!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter per her request. She had tried this brand before and was hoping she found the same quality. She was extremely happy with my selection.</li>
            <li> The 12 piece brush set from Coastal Scents got delivered on time with no problem. Im very budget savvy so I was very skeptical on buying a brush set that I wasnt able to see in front of me. Well i&#x27;m super excited about this buy. They are beautiful and the case is amazing. The brushes are really soft. People on here were talking about a strong smell when they recieved it, I didnt smell anything until I put the case all the way up to my nose. It wasnt that strong but I did let it air out over night and it&#x27;s fine now. It smelled like fake leather thats been sitting in its package for a while.. These brushes are great. I am definitely buying again when I need to. Go on youtube and look up reviews on this product it&#x27;ll definitely ease the pain in ordering something you havent seen in person.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes; no shedding and they are very soft. I received everything as shown on-line with no problems. I&#x27;m not a make-up professional, just an everyday user.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes so far, concealer brush was a lot softer than I would have liked. Good set of brushes to start with</li>
            <li> I started looking for a new makeup brush set few weeks ago, I had one before that wasn&#x27;t that grate so I was really looking for some quality this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking at brush sets from these big companies but either they didn&#x27;t contain all the brushes I wanted or they were way to expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to look up on amazon and found this set pretty soon, all the brushes I was looking for to make a perfect makeup, the price is unbelievable!, the description about both real and synthetic hair sounded good and the picture shows really nice brushes. I decided to go for these brushes, i could always turn them back if they were crappy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setting my expectations not to high I am THRILLED over these brushes! They are absolutely high quality and you get everything you need for your makeup, exactly what shown in the picture and none of the brushes get no use like so often in a brush set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend them for anyone searching for grate brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great-my daughter worked in makeup sales and asked me to get her some, and she is very picky. Obviously not absolute top quality, but feel good and have held up well for 2 years.</li>
            <li> You are definitely getting a great deal.. I compared these to my other brushes (sephora, soniakashuk, and MAC) THESE REALLY CAN BE COMPARED TO MAC BRUSHES, THE bristles ARE SO SOFT BUT stand FIRM, they pick shadows up and actually leave it on the skin, u can blend etc.. IM HAPPY WiTH MY PURCHASE!! Made a quick vid of the brushes on my YouTube channel britzoobabyy, I am planning on making a tutorial to show how well they work.. SHIPPED AND RECEIVED ALL WITHIN 4 DAYS.. came a day early</li>
            <li> I was kinda skeptical about buying these at first because of the bad reviews, but I just decided to go with them anyways! I made a GREAT decision! They are soft, don&#x27;t shed, and don&#x27;t smell bad like most makeup brushes. Each brush is individually wrapped, which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend these for any beginner!</li>
            <li> the set is great for the money, everything works great except for the larger angled brush, I use for foundation but it was shedding so I had to stop using it. I only use three of the other brushes on a daily basis and I am very happy. Even only using three brushes when the whole set costs less than 1 brush in a makeup retail store, worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set for people who are just beginning delving into makeup. They&#x27;re inexpensive and decent quality. I&#x27;ve had them for about 5 months now and I&#x27;ve only experienced minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for my sister in law for Christmas. She LOVES the brushes. I plan on buying myself the very same set soon. Great gift idea for anyone who loves to do makeup and wants quality brushes that don&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Use it daily. Very convenient to travel with. Never leave ho,e without it. Compact size and love the case it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li> This set is fantastic.  There are so many brushes I don&#x27;t know if I will use them all.  They are high quality and the brushes I have used so far are very soft and apply my makeup smoothly.  They feel very nice against my face. Nice brush set at a great price.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for a family member and it was well received ~ she loves these brushes! :)</li>
            <li> Love love love these. They&#x27;re so good for the price and I&#x27;m very happy with them. Even the case (which I usually throw out) is very sturdy and nice!</li>
            <li> came nicely wrapped and the case did say coastal scents which from a previous review i thought I was going to have a problem. the brushed blend well and its not to bad for a starter kit</li>
            <li> some came bent  and beyond use shame because i did like the rest of the brushes but they do shed a little.&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t want to send the whole pack back as i needed them and as they don&#x27;t seem to do a partial return i have just kept them not very impressed</li>
            <li> Great brushes and great value of money.. so far no shedding ..recommended to all who are on a budget :)</li>
            <li> This starter kit is great and inexpensive. However, the powder brush is scratchy and the head has already fall/glue is not sturdy. The contour brush sheds like no other. Other than that, all the other brushes are pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, and great case. I would love them even more if they came with a guide to what each brush was for.</li>
            <li> Some brushes worked good for a while now they are not as good not great quality</li>
            <li> Ordered for my makeup guru fiance, who couldn&#x27;t be happier.  She compared their quality to Mac and lives them.  Highly recommend, and as usual Amazon had the best price</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for a great price</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush set for the price.  The blush brush and powder brush are much nicer than I expected.  I especially liked the blush brush and how small it was, perfect for applying the right amount of blush.  The eye brushes are nice but I wish they included a fluffy crease brush, similar to a Sigma E40.  However, when I opened the bag the eyebrow brush was completely broken and fell apart in my hands.  Thankfully this isn&#x27;t a brush I use so I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal. The bag does smell, but the brushes don&#x27;t.  But every leather bag that is shipped has smelled to me, even Sigma&#x27;s case.  After washing there was little fall out and the ferules seem to be glued on well to the handles.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase but I wouldn&#x27;t compare them to Sigma or Mac.</li>
            <li> I love them they were everything I was hoping for and more! Smooth, soft, not very much shedding, and AFFORDABLE. :)</li>
            <li> These are really nice brushes. I am 100 satisfied with these brushes!!!! Luv luv luv them!!!! These are a great buy at a great price</li>
            <li> There are no complaints when it comes to this product as yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are made sturdily and pick up pigment well.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d think that for the price there would&#x27;ve been a catch but so far there is none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather case in which the brushes come in, when you INITIALLY open the package will have that slight leathery smell.&lt;br /&gt;However this smell soon fades after a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes to anyone who is starting out in makeup but is on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;You wouldn&#x27;t regret it , these brushes are very reliable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set along with the larger Coastal Scents brush set and i prefer this one. It has all the brushes you need for a full face of makeup and the case is fantastic. I also like how the handles are matte black with the silver feral (not sure if that is the correct term -.-)  There is a smell that i know a lot of people find offensive but i like the smell. It reminds me of toys from when i was a child. The smell also goes away after time and washes. Do not hesitate to purchase this brush set if you are looking for a good value.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great &amp; incredibly soft. There&#x27;s good variety and the case Is also very nice. I got mine on sale for $9 on coastal scents website. If you&#x27;re new to putting on makeup you can go on their website and it will tell you what each brush is for.</li>
            <li> Every kind of brush you will ever need, the eye liner brush is unbelievable! They are so soft.....there isn&#x27;t any reason you won&#x27;t love these!</li>
            <li> I am glad that I bought these to replace my older MAC brushes. These are just as good, in fact BETTER because they were less expensive then the MAC brushes. I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> The big face brush sheds a bit.  Otherwise these brushes have worked well for me.</li>
            <li> this is a okay brush set i feel as though they are missing some important brushes, which gives me the impression that maybe this brush set is just suppose to be an add on, meaning if you already have brushes that are necessary and you are just trying to build your collection up then this is a good set, but for beginners i would rather recommend the 22 set. the quaulity of the brushes are decent for the price, no shedding. i would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginning stage makeup gal so these work perfect for me. Wasn&#x27;t ready to dish out 100 bucks for makeup brushes (Sigma) when I&#x27;m just learning how to properly use them. I like the consistency of them..not too soft but not too stiff. I would recommend these to anyone.. Oh and shipping was fast!!  Only CON was SMELL.. like they&#x27;ve sat somewhere... too long ....with no air circulation. but now that I&#x27;ve had for a few weeks smell has either worn off or I&#x27;ve gotten used to it lol.</li>
            <li> good brushes for a good price.</li>
            <li> Great price, nice brushes, and a perfect set to own when your higher priced favs get dirty.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone as the bristles fall out all the time, it was not worth it.</li>
            <li> if your looking for some affordable brushes this are the ones just remember to wash them before using other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush set that wont break the bank. Bristles are soft and stay intact.</li>
            <li> Best brushes you could buy.</li>
            <li> Though this is certainly not top of the line quality, it is very good for the money.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who is nearly brushless in the makeup department, now has an incredible array of useful and decent quality brushes with which to apply her makeup.&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t beat the value of this.&lt;br /&gt; Plus we both love the brush holder, it is worth the money all by itself!!</li>
            <li> Great set of makeup brushes that wont break the bank. I have been using these daily for 2 months. The brushes hold up well to vigorous use and regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Good quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. And not to mention i got this just got this after one day of placing my order</li>
            <li> those are my first brushes and they dont really shed which is good but i&#x27;m not really experienced with make up so i&#x27;m not sure how good they are but they are soft and dont shed they take the make up pretty good.I think for the price they are amazing. But like i said im not experienced but i will recommend them for beginners</li>
            <li> Good selection for a  good price -  would recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t need a huge amount of brushes</li>
