            <li>This shade is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Perfect color for me, just like on the box.  </li>
            <li>so Amazon is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I received the  package  in perfect condition and timely manner.  </li>
            <li>Perfect LT.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the process.</li>
            <li>Good product!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve found, lasts, and is kind to your hair.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>What is very nice is that it conditions your hair and gives  it shine.</li>
            <li>Heard good things about it, but as soon as I rinsed the conditioner out, I could tell my hair was damaged.</li>
            <li>My order arrived very fast and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled that I bought 4 or 5 boxes.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this haircolor and cannot find it in my town.</li>
            <li>Garnier Nutrisse Haircolor is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Need more of this color...seems no one is stocking it any longer???</li>
            <li>The smell of Garnier Nutrisse colors is a pleasant aroma, but they aren&#x27;t as effective in lightening hair as other brands.</li>
            <li>Bring in #91 Light Ash.</li>
            <li>The color is true to their description as well.</li>
            <li>I quickly received my order.</li>
            <li>I then waited 4 weeks and put in this lovely Light Ash Blonde 91.</li>
            <li>My hair shines, is soft and I love how I look.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with Garnier Nutrisse and have re-ordered, for next month, a lighter color to try, in fun!  </li>
            <li>This is priced  right too.</li>
            <li>A friend commented that I look very much blonder now.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this particular color at Rite Aid and Wal-Mart, but now it seems I can only find it online.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think Garnier makes this as \\&quot;Ginger Ale\\&quot; anymore, but a Garnier 91 Light Ash Blonde would be very close.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really cover the gray all that well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lighten hair very well, though.</li>
            <li>I never wanted to be this light of a blonde.</li>
            <li>Garnier Nutrisse is gentle to my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It left a nice, natural finish, with the look of natural highlights.</li>
            <li>I finally settled on #91 as my favorite shade...and then all the local stores seemed to stop carrying it.  </li>
            <li>This product is much better than some products I&#x27;ve tried and may be very affective for your hair if you don&#x27;t have an excessive amount of gray.</li>
            <li>Only because my hair is so fine and processed, I did not leave color on the ends for the recommended 5 minutes, only 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the colors that Garnier offers, this is a keeper.  </li>
            <li>The color comes out so natural looking and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is the nicest hair color with modest silver threads  and ash tones.</li>
            <li>Everyone tells me it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I tried other shades and they just weren&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>It is a very realistic blonde, and I can order multiple boxes and have it arrive within a week.</li>
            <li>I had used Les Blondismes to get out as much of the Feria red disaster color as possible.</li>
            <li>This product is excellently fortified with oils &amp; nutrients so that my hair is NOT dry nor does it act badly at anytime due to drab &amp; drying color products.</li>
            <li>color is not long lasting as it was.&lt;br /&gt;Now  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> color is not long lasting as it was.&lt;br /&gt;Now  </li>
            <li> I have thick but fine hair that doesn&#x27;t not respond well to harsh coloring products.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use again as too risky, but on unprocessed hair that has a tendency to turn brassy it might work well.</li>
            <li> I used this color over previously processed hair and it turned the lighter blonde parts green!</li>
            <li> It has never let me down</li>
            <li> It was dry and brittle, looked dull and felt like straw.</li>
            <li> However, the quality result looks natural...and the dye seemed less harsh than L&#x27;oreal products no matter how expensive; and, naturally, milder to hair than the Clairol products.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to the Ginger Ale color and receive countless compliments in a doctor&#x27;s office setting.</li>
            <li> I usually go by the number systme now anyway, now that I&#x27;ve learned it through help from beauty blogs and helpful clerks at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> with mouse-butt gray hair with no redeeming features.</li>
            <li> This was for a retouch and this color is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Still hints of red but not like a clown or David Bowie! :(  </li>
            <li> color 91 is difficult to find.</li>
            <li> This product dried my hair out something terrible!</li>
            <li> BORING!!</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really cover the gray all that well. This product is much better than some products I&#x27;ve tried and may be very affective for your hair if you don&#x27;t have an excessive amount of gray.</li>
            <li> Out of all the colors that Garnier offers, this is a keeper.  The color comes out so natural looking and soft.  Not brassy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely my &amp;#34;fav&amp;#34; and hope it becomes yours too.  I used to be able to buy this particular color at Rite Aid and Wal-Mart, but now it seems I can only find it online.</li>
            <li> This totally evened out my hair color, and took away any brassy tones. It left a nice, natural finish, with the look of natural highlights. I&#x27;m sticking with this! (Box was damaged in shipping...but the dye tubes were not affected.)</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not yellow with this one ... it lightens my hair and I look naturally blonde.  This shade is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have been using Garnier Nutrisse for quite some time.  I finally settled on #91 as my favorite shade...and then all the local stores seemed to stop carrying it.  I tried other shades and they just weren&#x27;t right.  Finally, I decided to search for it on Amazon.com...and I found it!  I was so thrilled that I bought 4 or 5 boxes.  My order arrived very fast and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> My fav color---unavailable elsewehere</li>
            <li> This product dried my hair out something terrible! I would never use this again! Heard good things about it, but as soon as I rinsed the conditioner out, I could tell my hair was damaged. It was dry and brittle, looked dull and felt like straw. I will stick with L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> The smell of Garnier Nutrisse colors is a pleasant aroma, but they aren&#x27;t as effective in lightening hair as other brands. I used this color over previously processed hair and it turned the lighter blonde parts green!

            <li> Perfect color for me, just like on the box.  Only because my hair is so fine and processed, I did not leave color on the ends for the recommended 5 minutes, only 1 minute.  This was for a retouch and this color is hard to find in stores so Amazon is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have used Garnier Nutrisse for over a year. I have thick but fine hair that doesn&#x27;t not respond well to harsh coloring products. This is the best I&#x27;ve found, lasts, and is kind to your hair. The color is true to their description as well.</li>
            <li> I used this to overdye a L&#x27;Oreal Feria Ombre nightmare disaster. I had used Les Blondismes to get out as much of the Feria red disaster color as possible. I then waited 4 weeks and put in this lovely Light Ash Blonde 91. Still hints of red but not like a clown or David Bowie! :(  A friend commented that I look very much blonder now. I don&#x27;t think Garnier makes this as \\&quot;Ginger Ale\\&quot; anymore, but a Garnier 91 Light Ash Blonde would be very close. I usually go by the number systme now anyway, now that I&#x27;ve learned it through help from beauty blogs and helpful clerks at Walgreen&#x27;s. I never wanted to be this light of a blonde. I&#x27;m only trying to get the nightmare disaster Feria red out. I&#x27;ve had problems with Feria before. I should know enough by now not to use it. I&#x27;ll stick with Garnier from now on. It has never let me down and I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair since I was 19. I&#x27;m over 55 now.</li>
            <li> I love this haircolor and cannot find it in my town. It is a very realistic blonde, and I can order multiple boxes and have it arrive within a week.</li>
            <li> Garnier Nutrisse is gentle to my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The color is not long lasting as it was.&lt;br /&gt;Now  color 91 is difficult to find. No reason given.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest hair color with modest silver threads  and ash tones. I received the  package  in perfect condition and timely manner.  I would recommend THIS .  What is very nice is that it conditions your hair and gives  it shine. This is priced  right too. Perfect LT. Ash blond.</li>
            <li> Garnier Nutrisse Haircolor is my favorite. I&#x27;m 66 yo. with mouse-butt gray hair with no redeeming features. BORING!! Bring in #91 Light Ash. It has been a year and I can&#x27;t be plied away from GN #91. This product is excellently fortified with oils &amp; nutrients so that my hair is NOT dry nor does it act badly at anytime due to drab &amp; drying color products. My hair shines, is soft and I love how I look. Great price.</li>
            <li> I buy it here because you can&#x27;t find it in any store anymore. WHY NOT????  Everyone tells me it looks so natural. So is that why it&#x27;s disappeared off the shelves?  Makes no sense to me. Yes I&#x27;m irritated.  I used to use coupons in the stores. Now it isn&#x27;t on any of the shelves.</li>
            <li> Need more of this color...seems no one is stocking it any longer???</li>
            <li> I panicked when I saw this color was discontinued. I am addicted to the Ginger Ale color and receive countless compliments in a doctor&#x27;s office setting. I quickly received my order. Very happy with the process.</li>
            <li> This hair dye was a bit darker than photo on my already colored hair.  However, the quality result looks natural...and the dye seemed less harsh than L&#x27;oreal products no matter how expensive; and, naturally, milder to hair than the Clairol products.  I am pleased with Garnier Nutrisse and have re-ordered, for next month, a lighter color to try, in fun!  Good product!!!</li>
