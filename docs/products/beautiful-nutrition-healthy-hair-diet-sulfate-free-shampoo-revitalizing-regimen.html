            <li>received a sample of this product, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great and leaves my scalp feeling great and hair super clean.</li>
            <li>Beautiful Nutrition has created a shampoo that deep cleans the hair very effectively.</li>
            <li>shampoo is extremely effective, and I love it for its ability to remove buildup from using too many products.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice shine and makes the hair easy to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed that using this product caused my hair to have much more volume.</li>
            <li>Are you like me, constantly searching for the perfect shampoo for your hair?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In order to evaluate any benefits of this shampoo, I needed to test the shampoo under the most severe conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It lathers well if you want lather, but nothing more.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this line of hair product, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>My hair feels softer and healthier already,  plus I love the citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many, like some of you</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, this Healthy Hair Diet seem to be what it was wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>As soon as I run out, I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>As soon as I run out, I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love the citrusy scent of this shampoo, and have been using it with the Healthy Hair Diet Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The pump is great and very practical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great product, which I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m using with Beautiful Nutrition&#x27;s Citrus Pectin Healthy Hair Diet shampoo, Grapefruit Detox shine repair serum and Infrizzable hair cuticle corrector sealing serum finishing products - whichever is needed, not both at the same time).</li>
            <li>I love its scent, which is light and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I really think it is making my hair look good</li>
            <li>While they all claim to be great or the best, very few really stand apart from everything else out there.</li>
            <li>However, this bottle doesn&#x27;t lock easily.  </li>
            <li>even my kids&#x27;  hair looks great when they wash themselves and barely brush.</li>
            <li>Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Conditioner, 13.1 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for about three weeks now, my hair feels healthier and more full.</li>
            <li>Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Serum, 5.1 Fluid Ounce]] which I use to smooth and shine the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, having found Citrus Pectin Healthy Hair Diet, from Beautiful Nutrition Healthy Hair, I think I have finally found a brand of shampoo to meet all my requirements, at a reasonable and affordable price.  </li>
            <li>Love love love all of their hair products that I have tried so far (5!).  </li>
            <li>I was looking for sulfate free products and gave it a shot</li>
            <li>received one free container for review purposes.</li>
            <li>is a paraben and DEA (diethanolamine) FREE shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The sulfate free hair products did wonders for maintaining my hair coloring so it wouldn&#x27;t be fading by week 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However what I didn&#x27;t like about the sulfate free hair products was the lack of lathering.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and citrusy and leaves hair healthy looking.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m still experimenting with how much I need to use on somewhat long hair, but I&#x27;m impressed that you don&#x27;t need to use a gigantic handful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo really got me off to a good start again, getting rid of all of the buildup and leaving my hair ready for a strong conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very satisfied using this product twice a week to remove buildup and oils, and using the healthy hair diet conditioner every time I wash my hair for a deep conditioning that keeps my hair shiny and the frizzy bits at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This guarantees my hair is super clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>The scent is grapefruit, at least to my nose, and is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Wanted a more natural (not toxic), cruelty free line to help clean and smooth my shoulder length textured hair, which has to survive HOT, HUMID south Florida weather.</li>
            <li>I am loyal to NO shampoos or conditioners and now I am.  </li>
            <li>For a sulfate free shampoo, it lathers well, and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li>so much right now, they&#x27;re my new favorite.</li>
            <li>so much right now, they&#x27;re my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Again, Citrus Pectrin Healthy Hair Diet leaves my hair soft, sleek, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously worth a try.</li>
            <li>So I went to my bin of hair products (filled with everything from Purple Shampoo to take away brassiness blondes, to color preserving shampoos for brunets) and realized I had just recently gotten this Healthy Hair Diet shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>My last kind literally felt like I was putting honey on my head.</li>
            <li>And it is WAY more affordable than my last sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>My last kind literally felt like I was putting honey on my head.</li>
            <li>And it is WAY more affordable than my last sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally try (or like) natural products, but this shampoo had a great smell and really left my hair without that slippery feel from products with a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a beautiful pale yellow color and the pleasant fragrance of a lemony blend of botanical extracts and oils, from lemon balm leaf, lemon, orange, and pink</li>
            <li>A Free Shampoo was provided for my evaluation, my results are clearly stated.er or any oils before shampooing.</li>
            <li>A Free Shampoo was provided for my evaluation, my results are clearly stated.</li>
            <li>This is the first pump style shampoo I’ve used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike my old sulfate free shampoo, this one does lather some.</li>

            <li>I never expected when I decided to try these that they would become my new favorite, but they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never expected when I decided to try these that they would become my new favorite, but they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many types of shampoos, I&#x27;ve long since lost count.</li>
            <li>- a quick light blow dry is all it needs.</li>
            <li>I live in an area that has very hard water, so I need like a shampoo that has some suds, but will also completely wash out clean – Citrus Pectrin Healthy Hair Diet, suds up nicely</li>
            <li>bottle of conditioner, a rather large price for my bankbook, which is the reason why I am always on the journey to find another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Citrus Pectin Healthy Hair Diet lathers up well, rinses out easily, even under hard water conditions.  </li>
            <li>Citrus Pectin Healthy Hair Diet lathers up well, rinses out easily, even under hard water conditions.  </li>
            <li>My Personal Evaluation: This is a paraben and DEA (diethanolamine) FREE shampoo.  </li>
            <li>pump container is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is thicker than the very watery conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot more on shampoos, but this one beats them all.</li>
            <li>Her hair is also much thinner than mine.</li>
            <li>Her hair is also much thinner than mine.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it comes with a pump dispenser because I have a habit of dropping slippery shampoo bottles on my feet in the shower, and having bruises on your feet is not at all</li>
            <li>Despite wearing a cap, my already chemically treated hair really takes a beating.  </li>
            <li>really like the pump jar.  </li>
            <li>It disciplines my dry, chemically treated, unruly mane leaving it soft, sleek, and manageable with a healthy sheen, even without the use of any conditioning hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  </li>
            <li>It disciplines my dry, chemically treated, unruly mane leaving it soft, sleek, and manageable with a healthy sheen, even without the use of any conditioning hair products.  </li>
            <li>It had been a long time since I used a sulfate free shampoo, so</li>
            <li>It had been a long time since I used a sulfate free shampoo, so</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both products.</li>
            <li>I am always on the endless quest for an effective and nourishing shampoo that meets my personal hair</li>
            <li>I’ve used other sulfate free products in the past but none of them is as effective as this one.</li>
            <li>I barely ned to smooth it with a flat iron anymore</li>
            <li>/&gt;Years went by, then last year I went to the salon and had them bleach my hair from the almost-black brown shade I had to, to light blonde.</li>
            <li>My hair is behaving for the first time in the last 2 months.</li>
            <li>My hair is behaving for the first time in the last 2 months.</li>
            <li>For a while, I was trying to use pomade to smooth out the frizzy parts in my hair, but I think over time it kind of gunked up and left my hair feeling a little limp.</li>
            <li>And it all cost so much, that between the high price of the hair color each month, and the hair products, I quit the whole lot after about 8 months and went back to a simpler hair color, and regular every day hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not feeling dried out like it was, and is soft and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not feeling dried out like it was, and is soft and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair is dry right now, because of all the processing it&#x27;s been through.</li>
            <li>What else is in there is not always clear to me because ingredients are listed by their chemical names.  </li>
            <li>and it does completely wash out</li>
            <li>I do notice a clear difference from my old Pantene shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am not an expert on natural products</li>
            <li>It wants something different.</li>
            <li>But I remembered that my last experience with a Sulfate Free shampoo, that I had started to notice a difference only after several washes.</li>

            <li>I have a small child who enjoys pump bottles, so for most bottles with a similar pump, I can lock them which keeps him from playing with it.  </li>
            <li>I went ahead and paid the high cost because at the time, I was paying for a type of hair color/foiling, that was done with multiple colors, which cost me well over $100 every 4-5 weeks, because of the length and thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I shampooed and used my wide-tooth comb to remove a couple of minor tangles and then proceeded to my normal styling with a blow dryer and my roll brush.  </li>
            <li>I have used lots of other sulfate free shampoos that actually add moisture and paid a lot less.</li>
            <li>teen daughter is also using this, and I never expected it to work as well as it does with her hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love all of their hair products that I have tried so far (5!).  I was looking for sulfate free products and gave it a shot, so happy that I did!  I am loyal to NO shampoos or conditioners and now I am.  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I have long, color treated hair that gets a bit frizzy without heat styling)</li>
            <li> Beautiful Nutrition has created a shampoo that deep cleans the hair very effectively. You will especially love this if you use a lot of hair products like mousse or serums. I also noticed that using this product caused my hair to have much more volume. I use this shampoo and then follow with [[ASIN:B00MCGYXNU Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Conditioner, 13.1 Fluid Ounce]]. Once my hair is dry I also use a quarter of a teaspoon of the [[ASIN:B00M8VEUHS Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Serum, 5.1 Fluid Ounce]] which I use to smooth and shine the hair. This guarantees my hair is super clean and shiny. Just what you need for the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free container for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Are you like me, constantly searching for the perfect shampoo for your hair?  I will buy one, try it for a while, even use up the bottle but when finished I am on the hunt for a different brand.  This is why I chose to test and evaluate this shampoo, when contacted by the seller.  I am always on the endless quest for an effective and nourishing shampoo that meets my personal hair requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one brand that I kept returning to but the cost is around $75.00, and the conditioner is another $50.00.  That is $125.00 for one 10 oz. bottle of shampoo and an 8 oz. bottle of conditioner, a rather large price for my bankbook, which is the reason why I am always on the journey to find another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, having found Citrus Pectin Healthy Hair Diet, from Beautiful Nutrition Healthy Hair, I think I have finally found a brand of shampoo to meet all my requirements, at a reasonable and affordable price.  In addition, I love the convenience of the pump dispenser, no more juggling slippery bottles, which spill, or at the very least have hurt and bruised my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY REQUIREMENTS:&lt;br /&gt;1. I live in an area that has very hard water, so I need like a shampoo that has some suds, but will also completely wash out clean – Citrus Pectrin Healthy Hair Diet, suds up nicely and it does completely wash out clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I have dry, coarse textured, thick hair a few inches past my shoulder and I have gone through the chemical coloring process for 35 years.  I need a shampoo that will nourish and manage this thick and unruly mane and tame the &#x60;frizzies&#x27;.  Again, Citrus Pectrin Healthy Hair Diet leaves my hair soft, sleek, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I have a small patch of psoriasis on the back of my scalp; I need a shampoo that will not irritate that condition.  This Citrus Pectrin Hair Diet does NOT irritate this skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE EVALUATION TEST:&lt;br /&gt;In order to evaluate any benefits of this shampoo, I needed to test the shampoo under the most severe conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use any pre-conditioner or any oils before shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use any rinse out conditioner after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use any leave-in conditioner or any of the oils that I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed and used my wide-tooth comb to remove a couple of minor tangles and then proceeded to my normal styling with a blow dryer and my roll brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Personal Evaluation:&lt;br /&gt;This is a paraben and DEA (diethanolamine) FREE shampoo.

            <li> I don&#x27;t normally try (or like) natural products, but this shampoo had a great smell and really left my hair without that slippery feel from products with a lot of chemicals. My hair feels softer after using this shampoo just a few times.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and my hair and scalp feel so great after I shampoo - I shower a couple of times a day - wash my hair every time - My hair is looking awesome!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and leaves my scalp feeling great and hair super clean. My hair is also softer and easier to comb. I’ve used other sulfate free products in the past but none of them is as effective as this one. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a beautiful pale yellow color and the pleasant fragrance of a lemony blend of botanical extracts and oils, from lemon balm leaf, lemon, orange, and pink grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job of cleaning hair with product build-up.  It leaves a nice shine and makes the hair easy to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump container is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Nutrition provided shampoo for evaluation and review.</li>

Good things are in this shampoo, and it is notable for what it does not contain – sulfates!  What else is in there is not always clear to me because ingredients are listed by their chemical names.  I do notice a clear difference from my old Pantene shampoo.  My hair is softer, feels cleaner, and shines like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I use both the shampoo and the conditioner when I shampoo, never fully pressing the pumps.  A little bit goes a long way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for unbiased review</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It lathers well if you want lather, but nothing more. It is thicker than the very watery conditioner. It does not nourish or add moisture. Hair is dead anyway, how can you nourish it. I have used lots of other sulfate free shampoos that actually add moisture and paid a lot less. I have curly dry tangly long hair. Both the shampoo and conditioner are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this line of hair product, and I&#x27;ve tried many. Wanted a more natural (not toxic), cruelty free line to help clean and smooth my shoulder length textured hair, which has to survive HOT, HUMID south Florida weather. (I&#x27;m using with Beautiful Nutrition&#x27;s Citrus Pectin Healthy Hair Diet shampoo, Grapefruit Detox shine repair serum and Infrizzable hair cuticle corrector sealing serum finishing products - whichever is needed, not both at the same time). The best way to describe my hair now is calm and well adjusted. The fussy, unpredictable, dried out mess I had before is gone - in a matter of a couple of weeks. I barely ned to smooth it with a flat iron anymore - a quick light blow dry is all it needs. Everyone in the family is using them and even my kids&#x27;  hair looks great when they wash themselves and barely brush. Seriously worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for two weeks now.  My hair feels softer and healthier already,  plus I love the citrus scent.  I am not an expert on natural products but I appreciate any opportunity to avoid extra chemicals on my body.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo. I have tried so many, like some of you, I have a collection. My hair has plenty of shine and great body with Healthy hair diet shampoo. . This has become my favorite shampoo. The scent is not too strong, which is perfect . I have spent a lot more on shampoos, but this one beats them all. Buy it, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many types of shampoos, I&#x27;ve long since lost count. While they all claim to be great or the best, very few really stand apart from everything else out there. This is one of the few that does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I use to buy and use a very expensive salon brand sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. I went ahead and paid the high cost because at the time, I was paying for a type of hair color/foiling, that was done with multiple colors, which cost me well over $100 every 4-5 weeks, because of the length and thickness of my hair. The sulfate free hair products did wonders for maintaining my hair coloring so it wouldn&#x27;t be fading by week 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However what I didn&#x27;t like about the sulfate free hair products was the lack of lathering. They just didn&#x27;t lather at all. So I felt like I was washing my hair with thick honey. Also it was so expensive ($36/bottle) I felt like I could only use a small amount at a time, but then without any lathering, I never felt like I was getting all my hair fully washed. And it all cost so much, that between the high price of the hair color each month, and the hair products, I quit the whole lot after about 8 months and went back to a simpler hair color, and regular every day hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years went by, then last year I went to the salon and had them bleach my hair from the almost-black brown shade I had to, to light blonde. It was a process but eventually it got there. Then I kept it that way for a year. Now I&#x27;ve gone back to brown. My hair needs some TLC. It&#x27;s not been liking any of my regular hair products. It wants something different. As it turns out, this Healthy Hair Diet seem to be what it was wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dry right now, because of all the processing it&#x27;s been through. Regular shampoos and my hair just were not getting along. I knew I needed to try something different. So I went to my bin of hair products (filled with everything from Purple Shampoo to take away brassiness blondes, to color preserving shampoos for brunets) and realized I had just recently gotten this Healthy Hair Diet shampoo and conditioner set. It had been a long time since I used a sulfate free shampoo, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. And I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, my hair seemed the same as usual. But I remembered that my last experience with a Sulfate Free shampoo, that I had started to notice a difference only after several washes. By the third shower with these products, I was hooked. My hair is behaving for the first time in the last 2 months. It&#x27;s not feeling dried out like it was, and is soft and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teen daughter is also using this, and I never expected it to work as well as it does with her hair. She and I have totally different hair needs. Her hair is overly oily and she usually has to use a clarifying shampoo at every wash, and no conditioner. Her hair is also much thinner than mine. My hair is very thick, I have tons of it, it&#x27;s dried out from bleaching, using high-lift products, flat ironing and usually needs products that add a lot of moisture and shine to it. Basically the opposite of what my teen daughter needs. But we&#x27;ve both been using this shampoo and both of our hair has been looking and feeling great. The only difference is I use the conditioner as well, and she doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my old sulfate free shampoo, this one does lather some. My last kind literally felt like I was putting honey on my head. This one lathers some, which I like. And it is WAY more affordable than my last sulfate free shampoo. My hair is behaving so well and loving these products so much right now, they&#x27;re my new favorite. As soon as I run out, I&#x27;m ordering more.

            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for about three weeks now, my hair feels healthier and more full. I highly recommend both products.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this shampoo.  I love its scent, which is light and not too overpowering.  My hair also feels truly revitalized after using it.  And finally, I appreciate that you don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it for it to work well.  (I&#x27;m still experimenting with how much I need to use on somewhat long hair, but I&#x27;m impressed that you don&#x27;t need to use a gigantic handful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the design of the bottle.  I have a small child who enjoys pump bottles, so for most bottles with a similar pump, I can lock them which keeps him from playing with it.  However, this bottle doesn&#x27;t lock easily.  I solve the problem by keeping it out of reach, but I wish I did not need to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product, which I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the citrusy scent of this shampoo, and have been using it with the Healthy Hair Diet Conditioner. I really appreciate that it comes with a pump dispenser because I have a habit of dropping slippery shampoo bottles on my feet in the shower, and having bruises on your feet is not at all comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is extremely effective, and I love it for its ability to remove buildup from using too many products. For a while, I was trying to use pomade to smooth out the frizzy parts in my hair, but I think over time it kind of gunked up and left my hair feeling a little limp. This shampoo really got me off to a good start again, getting rid of all of the buildup and leaving my hair ready for a strong conditioner. I&#x27;ve been very satisfied using this product twice a week to remove buildup and oils, and using the healthy hair diet conditioner every time I wash my hair for a deep conditioning that keeps my hair shiny and the frizzy bits at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I swim several times a week in a heavily chlorinated pool.  Despite wearing a cap, my already chemically treated hair really takes a beating.  This is one of the very few shampoos I&#x27;ve found that will not further damage my hair with almost daily use.  The scent is grapefruit, at least to my nose, and is wonderful.  For a sulfate free shampoo, it lathers well, and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking and feeling.  I can use it every time I swim to get the chlorine out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the pump jar.  It&#x27;s a great delivery method for this shampoo.  It only takes one firm pump to get enough product for a shampoo, and the jar will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The scent is fresh and citrusy and leaves hair healthy looking. The pump is great and very practical.</li>
            <li> Smells great,rinses well. I really think it is making my hair look good</li>
