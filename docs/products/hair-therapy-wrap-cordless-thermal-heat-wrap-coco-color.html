            <li>Works great, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let it be loosed or it won&#x27;t be effective.</li>
            <li>but I liked the concept.</li>
            <li>I liked the wrap,  i will recommend it to my friends.  </li>
            <li>It remains warm for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was truly impressed and happy that I no longer  have to wait under a drier to deep condition my hair.  </li>
            <li>really nice product.</li>
            <li>Stays warm for 15 min</li>
            <li>It stays warm for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it stayed warm longer</li>
            <li>It fits nice.</li>
            <li>great for mobility for quick treatments.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to put on.</li>
            <li>So much better than standing there with a blow dryer trying to warm up my hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect addition to my natural hair regiment</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this heated head wrap!</li>
            <li>I was SOOOOO happy with this headwrap when I first used it.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and not cumbersome.</li>
            <li>I just received this item which was very securely</li>
            <li>Loved it so much that I bought one for my mom too!!</li>
            <li>Way better than hanging out with the blow dryer</li>
            <li>A most buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many videos of people who LOVE this cap</li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>hope I&#x27;ll learn to love it.</li>
            <li>I just wish the design was a bit better.</li>
            <li>I ended up using it backwards for 10 minutes to make sure I got that area done.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>and I had a wonderful deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>I love that you can wear it and still do things around the house.  </li>
            <li>Im glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>You run foward and backward to get more heated water on towel?   </li>
            <li>Sometimes the simplest, most low-tech solutions are the best: if you are looking for a way of applying heat to your head, for example, when deep conditioning, this hat thing works well.</li>
            <li>Love that I can continue with my day.</li>
            <li>I love this hair wrap.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than no heat</li>
            <li>Use your best judgment and only keep it in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds at the time, test the temperature, then re-heat</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of no plug in.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but i will not recommend This product.</li>
            <li>makes it feel alright, could be better.</li>
            <li>Ive seen better though, keep improving almost there.</li>
            <li>Happy to say, my gift is a hit and well appreciated.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of this heat wrap.</li>
            <li>I love that I can remove the gel packs and just throw it into the washer.</li>
            <li>Love this cap.</li>
            <li>Ideal For Natural Hair Conditioning.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I think it was an okay buy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It works okay for the cost.</li>
            <li>It performs ok.</li>
            <li>More work that explained.</li>
            <li>I Love this heating cap.  </li>
            <li>thought it would retain heat better</li>
            <li>I will try a couple more times and then return it tomorrow if I&#x27;m unsuccessful.</li>
            <li>then i can do my chores or just watch tv until its time to wash out my hair, love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it again and if it does a better job, I&#x27;ll amend this review.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels so much better.</li>
            <li>will update my review after using this for some more time.</li>
            <li>I so love my therapy wrap.</li>
            <li>I also love how it makes my hair feel and look once I take it off.</li>
            <li>I love this wrap.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can move around with it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This cordless thermal turban is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>This would make a wonderful Christmas or birthday present.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I usually warm it the full amount recommended and a couple times more.</li>
            <li>and she says it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good for being cordless.</li>
            <li>I use it, I&#x27;ll be able to more accurately describe my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The idea of this product is great as far as me being able to move around etc.</li>
            <li>Very good heating cap for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>it was so comfortable that I almost forgot I had it on :-)</li>
            <li>Really works fast and is effective I use it when needed and it works great.</li>
            <li>but it would be nice to know you got it right instead of praying it won&#x27;t explode in the microwave.  </li>
            <li>heats up nicely easy to use, work nice with the right type of hair cream/oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as I had hoped but the heat does last for approximately 30 good minutes!</li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions and gives you mobility because it&#x27;s wireless.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I hope they improve the length of time the packs stay heated and the ability not to burst so easily</li>
            <li>It does what it promises and was easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up.</li>
            <li>The straps to hold the cap on can be adjusted easily.</li>
            <li>Easy instructions on how to use.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use and worth the price.</li>
            <li>They get pretty warm too.</li>
            <li>I did think it would stay hot for longer than it did, but I just warm it up again, and leave it on for about an hour.</li>
            <li>I have fine 3c/4a hair and my HTW works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Easy and comfortable to use</li>
            <li>This product is fine until you have to replace the gel-packs; replacements are no where to be found.</li>
            <li>love love...stayed hot and I was able to wash dishes and steam my hair.</li>
            <li>The product would be greatly improved if the pockets inside the cap were smaller and the gel inserts were made, specifically, to fit in the pockets (and placed all around the cap).</li>
            <li>This is great for my heat needed deep conditionings.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>had to trim gel pads so they fit in pockets.</li>
            <li>It shifted into that tail piece (which I didn&#x27;t know a gel could fit in there)</li>
            <li>This hood didnt fit too well</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit on head well and the heat comes from packs you put into this contraption.</li>
            <li>I tell you it fit</li>
            <li>I really love this heating cap and have found it extremely useful as it allows me to continue to be mobile as I treat my hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall great tool.</li>
            <li>Great for deep conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>and you will most likely have to re-heat it 1-2 times in order to get truly good penetration.</li>
            <li>Good results so far</li>
            <li>I find the size of the cap to be more than suitable for my head size, which is not small, and the velcro keeps it securely fastened.  </li>
            <li>The directions are very clear and easy to follow, this item is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>wonders&amp;&amp;it makes my deep condition sessions more eventful because I am able to be more mobile while conditioning my hair..</li>
            <li>In fact, the gel pads don&#x27;t cover the area where I need the hot oil treatment the most - the hair close to my neck line.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is not bulky and that I can even sleep with it on my head when I give myself an overnight hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the first Cordless Heat Wrap.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions for heating the gel packs on the stovetop because a couple of people have noted that you get a longer, more consistent heat using this method.  </li>
            <li>I have to wear a bonnet over top of my plastic cap and cover my ears because it gets to hot on my ears.  </li>
            <li>I like the freedom of not having to plug it in as sit and it stays warm for at least 30 minutes which is great</li>
            <li>It felt a great deal of relief to my dry scalp condition.</li>
            <li>Whoever designed this, got it right!</li>
            <li>Convenient and lightweight Hair Therapy Cordless Heat wrap is great for hot oil treatment and/or deep conditioning without being tied to the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good product because of the convenient way of using it.  </li>
            <li>It last a good 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>White is tougher to keep looking nice (especially if Mom-In-Law sees you in it)  :o)</li>
            <li>And it has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>I really like this turban and it&#x27;s great for my deep conditioning sessions.</li>
            <li>With rollers, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit over my whole head, but I still get a wonderful set, the heat still gets in my (African American) hair and through the rollers.</li>
            <li>Most of us are very busy &amp; need to multi task.</li>
            <li>It got really hot!</li>
            <li>Heats well and stays hot!  </li>
            <li>doesnt fit over whole head tho.</li>
            <li>I put it in the microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds; the turban stayed warm throughout the entire</li>
            <li>Overall nice product.</li>
            <li>It delivers the benefits promised which makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li>So far I love my hair therapy wrap.</li>
            <li>Great tool for deep conditioning for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I love it and it has replaced many other &amp;#34;heating caps&amp;#34; I purchased.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of being able to do other thing while my wrap is doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Therapy wrap is great for conducting hot oil treatments, deep conditioning and giving natural hair the added boost of moist heat.</li>
            <li>The price was right too.</li>
            <li>The cap starts loosing heat right away</li>
            <li>and YES done right</li>
            <li>Love the convenience this wrap offers, it&#x27;s well made and heats up pretty hot</li>
            <li>It will feel warm /hot to you as long</li>
            <li>And it stays warm a long time.</li>
            <li>(this is how long it has always stayed warm even when I first purchased the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you put it on and it really doesn&#x27;t feel warm enough, don&#x27;t add more than 10 seconds extra in the microwave at a time.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the freedom that the cap gives you because you are able to walk around and accomplish other things around the house.</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If you want more size in head, try white one.</li>
            <li>It is like towel method where you put it in hot water on head as \\&quot;sauna\\</li>
            <li>, it is still hot on my therapy wrap I am wearing.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I use this product for hot oil and deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>LOVE not sitting under the dryer and still getting my deep condition.</li>
            <li>The plastic bags works just as better overall</li>
            <li>there is nothing about how to put it together for the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t figure it out</li>
            <li>My first was purchased on another site.</li>
            <li>Hair definitely felt conditioned better after using this product.</li>
            <li>very convenient!</li>
            <li>I heated the turban for 80 seconds the maximum time because I expected the cloth to be a lot warmer, but at 80 seconds it was pretty warm.</li>
            <li>I love this, as i can regularly do a treatment without being stuck with the corded wrap.  </li>
            <li>and I put the gel packs in the microwave exactly as instructed and for the maximum recommended time.  </li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>I warmed it in the microwave for 3 minutes in 1 minute intervals and it was actually pretty hot.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to the letter, but it still never really heated up as hot as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I would be willing to pay more for the cap for such improvements.</li>
            <li>I really like this wrap!  </li>
            <li>I have kinky-curly textured (4a/b) hair and detangling with my Tresemme naturals conditioner after using this is so much easier!</li>
            <li>For my hair, it&#x27;s definitely a plus :).</li>
            <li>If you like mobility and convenience this cap is most definitely for you.</li>
            <li>and I would switched the wrap around from front to the back during treatment to make sure I got the whole head covered.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, the gel pads do heat up pretty well, and the cordless feature is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I was nervous it would burn me and was worried about heating this in the microwave, but it worked very well and wasn&#x27;t too hot.</li>
            <li>It fit comfortably and stayed warm long enough as needed to deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to save a lot of time and a little money by purchasing this wrap and I Love It!  </li>
            <li>It keeps my head warm for up to half an hour.</li>
            <li>am sure it&#x27;s going to do the job for my dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend for the price, convenience and results.</li>
            <li>This product makes it easy to do a hot oil treatment while doing other things, but it&#x27;s a pain heating the hot packs and handling them.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>The wrap doesn&#x27;t really cover your whole head.</li>
            <li>It also shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>This really does work well.</li>
            <li>I think this process is really growing my hair</li>
            <li>The idea is genius, but the convenience of deep conditioning while not be bound and plugged into light socket costs you in effectiveness.</li>
            <li>and it really conditions your hair well.</li>
            <li>Heat stays in very well.</li>
            <li>i even slept overnight with it on and was very comfy.</li>
            <li>It is a REAL &amp;#34;heating cap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very convenient because I don&#x27;t have to stay stationary in one place when conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant that this would really work, but it does.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister because it&#x27;s really helpful..</li>
            <li>Very practical.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but it works really well</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t even fit on my head properly.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it is really really</li>
            <li>Two different kind colors- white and brown.</li>
            <li>The white was clearly made better</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it gets warm enough to truly deep condition</li>
            <li>Being a natural hair diva, deep conditioning is a must and this product makes the process easy.</li>
            <li>Depending on your microwave, it may take more or less time to heat.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use heat without being stuck sitting somewhere for a half hour.</li>
            <li>Henna and Deep condition my hair on a more regular basis because of it.  </li>
            <li>After 1 hour I put more oil and massaged my hair and again used the heated cap and finally washed my hair with my regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>(honestly, your hair can only absorb so much moisture at one time so for those who deep condition for 45 minutes or more, the results are the same as if you left it on for 30 minutes - especially if you are using heat to help the conditioner/oils absorb).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving the turban a try.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cordless heating and this product came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>can be a little challenging.  </li>
            <li>Hard to warm up.</li>
            <li>It generally doesn&#x27;t stay hot for longer than 20 minutes but it doesn&#x27;t claim to either</li>
            <li>It stays warm for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>The heat doesn&#x27;t last too long, maybe 15 minutes or so, but you can reheat if you want more.  </li>
            <li>This newer version is an improvement with an extra bit of cover for the very back of the head thereby keeping the entire head covered and warm.</li>
            <li>When the gel pads are placed in the microwave for the recommended amount of time, they stay warm for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>As Most Of The Reviews Have Said The Heat Doesnt Last Long!</li>
            <li>The inner pads don&#x27;t stay warm long enough....</li>
            <li>This item did not appear new</li>
            <li>LIke I said, I did not think I received a new item and returned it.  </li>
            <li>My friend recommended the new one to me and I am recommending to anyone who is looking for this type.</li>
            <li>I love this product i have thick hair and it covers my whole head</li>
            <li>I find that it only stays hot for about 45 mins.</li>
            <li>but after about 10min I just didn&#x27;t think it was staying as hot as a deep treatment</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient; I&#x27;m able to deep condition with heat while doing other things around the house.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no biggie if you have time to work around the house and allow your conditioner to sit, but be aware that if you want a treatment that will only take 15-45 minutes, stick with an electric model.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think the packs get hot enough.</li>
            <li>the only thing is it gets my ears hot</li>
            <li>I use this for hot deep hair treatments.</li>
            <li>I use it as a per wash hair spa, have to rewarm4-5 times to have a proper hot oil treatment done.</li>
            <li>I ordered the first Hair Therapy Wrap Cordless Thermal which did not heat the lower back of my head.</li>
            <li>When you heat the product up in the microwave it doesn&#x27;t seem as if it is getting hot enough.</li>
            <li>I did a deep condition hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 instead of 5 only because sometimes getting the gel packs in while they are hot</li>
            <li>I also started using this on my 10 yr old and she has natural hair!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use without the mess!</li>
            <li>I wish it covered completely all of your hair.  </li>
            <li>No problems with the gel pads so far</li>
            <li>The cap works well so far.  </li>
            <li>The time saved helps this busy</li>
            <li>I have used this two times so far.</li>
            <li>The gel packs themselves provide complete coverage for your head, including the nape of the neck.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient when you don&#x27;t have a hooded dryer for deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>The heat stays in and my hair is so soft when I take it off.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats the mobility it offers</li>
            <li>I was surprised the zipper worked in the microwave.  </li>
            <li>I am using for the first time this week the new Cordless Thermal Turban Heat Wrap which I notice how it heats up my entire head front and back.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative for people that get sick from having too much air blown around them because they have to sit under a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>Warm Temperature does not last long, a bit heavy on the head.</li>
            <li>I have a big head and it more than fits, comes almost down to my eyebrows and covers the kitchen in the back with no problem.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item but in white not brown.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super fast (less than a minute) and lasts long (over 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>(I think if you push it a little further back you will achieve greater function).  </li>
            <li>Very convenient, can move around the house while your hair is being treated, no cords to fumble with, no sitting in one spot for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>i expected it to stay hot longer.</li>
            <li>It stays hot longer then i expected.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again, but only as a back up on days when I have much to do around the house.</li>
            <li>Really like it, I use it weekly, actually takes the place of pulling out the big hooded dryer and plugging it up</li>
            <li>but it is very helpful especially if your have a lot of house work and want to deep condition hair</li>
            <li>However, it is somewhat frustrating because the gel packs only seem to stay warm for about 20 to 30 minutes</li>
            <li>I will definitely be using this frequently!</li>
            <li>I am a natural hair female</li>
            <li>I have medium length natural hair and the front, sides and back of my head were well heated</li>
            <li>especially when you are busy with children.</li>
            <li>My only issue with the heating cap is the inevitable need to replace the gel packs, there is no mention of obtaining replacements, but I would hope that reaching out to the company would enable you to get the gel packs sans having to purchase an entirely new heating cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other that that, the heat wrap works like a charm and it enveloped my head very well.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little hesitant if whether the turban would condition my hair and achieve the same results as a hydration machine at the salon, and it does!</li>
            <li>I have many other steaming products but the fact that i have to sit there for so long usually turns me off..</li>

            <li> but I liked the concept.</li>
            <li> I liked the wrap,  i will recommend it to my friends.  </li>
            <li> It remains warm for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was truly impressed and happy that I no longer  have to wait under a drier to deep condition my hair.  </li>

            <li> It fits nice.</li>

            <li> Perfect addition to my natural hair regiment</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this heated head wrap!</li>
            <li> I was SOOOOO happy with this headwrap when I first used it.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable and not cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I just received this item which was very securely</li>
            <li> Loved it so much that I bought one for my mom too!!</li>
            <li> Way better than hanging out with the blow dryer</li>
            <li> A most buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many videos of people who LOVE this cap</li>
            <li> and I just don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> hope I&#x27;ll learn to love it.</li>
            <li> I just wish the design was a bit better.</li>
            <li> I ended up using it backwards for 10 minutes to make sure I got that area done.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li> and I had a wonderful deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> I love that you can wear it and still do things around the house.  </li>
            <li> Im glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> You run foward and backward to get more heated water on towel?   </li>
            <li> Sometimes the simplest, most low-tech solutions are the best: if you are looking for a way of applying heat to your head, for example, when deep conditioning, this hat thing works well.</li>
            <li> Love that I can continue with my day.</li>
            <li> I love this hair wrap.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than no heat</li>
            <li> Use your best judgment and only keep it in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds at the time, test the temperature, then re-heat</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of no plug in.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but i will not recommend This product.</li>
            <li> makes it feel alright, could be better.</li>
            <li> Ive seen better though, keep improving almost there.</li>
            <li> Happy to say, my gift is a hit and well appreciated.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of this heat wrap.</li>
            <li> I love that I can remove the gel packs and just throw it into the washer.</li>
            <li> Love this cap.</li>
            <li> Ideal For Natural Hair Conditioning.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I think it was an okay buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It works okay for the cost.</li>
            <li> It performs ok.</li>
            <li> More work that explained.</li>
            <li> I Love this heating cap.  </li>
            <li> thought it would retain heat better</li>
            <li> I will try a couple more times and then return it tomorrow if I&#x27;m unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> then i can do my chores or just watch tv until its time to wash out my hair, love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it again and if it does a better job, I&#x27;ll amend this review.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels so much better.</li>
            <li> will update my review after using this for some more time.</li>
            <li> I so love my therapy wrap.</li>
            <li> I also love how it makes my hair feel and look once I take it off.</li>
            <li> I love this wrap.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can move around with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This cordless thermal turban is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> This would make a wonderful Christmas or birthday present.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I usually warm it the full amount recommended and a couple times more.</li>
            <li> and she says it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty good for being cordless.</li>
            <li> I use it, I&#x27;ll be able to more accurately describe my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The idea of this product is great as far as me being able to move around etc.</li>
            <li> Very good heating cap for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> it was so comfortable that I almost forgot I had it on :-)</li>
            <li> Really works fast and is effective I use it when needed and it works great.</li>
            <li> but it would be nice to know you got it right instead of praying it won&#x27;t explode in the microwave.  </li>
            <li> heats up nicely easy to use, work nice with the right type of hair cream/oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as I had hoped but the heat does last for approximately 30 good minutes!</li>
            <li> Easy to follow directions and gives you mobility because it&#x27;s wireless.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I hope they improve the length of time the packs stay heated and the ability not to burst so easily</li>
            <li> It does what it promises and was easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up.</li>
            <li> The straps to hold the cap on can be adjusted easily.</li>
            <li> Easy instructions on how to use.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use and worth the price.</li>
            <li> They get pretty warm too.</li>
            <li> I did think it would stay hot for longer than it did, but I just warm it up again, and leave it on for about an hour.</li>
            <li> I have fine 3c/4a hair and my HTW works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Easy and comfortable to use</li>
            <li> This product is fine until you have to replace the gel-packs; replacements are no where to be found.</li>
            <li> love love...stayed hot and I was able to wash dishes and steam my hair.</li>
            <li> The product would be greatly improved if the pockets inside the cap were smaller and the gel inserts were made, specifically, to fit in the pockets (and placed all around the cap).</li>
            <li> This is great for my heat needed deep conditionings.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> had to trim gel pads so they fit in pockets.</li>
            <li> It shifted into that tail piece (which I didn&#x27;t know a gel could fit in there)</li>
            <li> This hood didnt fit too well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit on head well and the heat comes from packs you put into this contraption.</li>
            <li> I tell you it fit</li>
            <li> I really love this heating cap and have found it extremely useful as it allows me to continue to be mobile as I treat my hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall great tool.</li>
            <li> Great for deep conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> and you will most likely have to re-heat it 1-2 times in order to get truly good penetration.</li>
            <li> Good results so far</li>
            <li> I find the size of the cap to be more than suitable for my head size, which is not small, and the velcro keeps it securely fastened.  </li>
            <li> The directions are very clear and easy to follow, this item is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> wonders&amp;&amp;it makes my deep condition sessions more eventful because I am able to be more mobile while conditioning my hair..</li>
            <li> In fact, the gel pads don&#x27;t cover the area where I need the hot oil treatment the most - the hair close to my neck line.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is not bulky and that I can even sleep with it on my head when I give myself an overnight hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the first Cordless Heat Wrap.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions for heating the gel packs on the stovetop because a couple of people have noted that you get a longer, more consistent heat using this method.  </li>
            <li> I have to wear a bonnet over top of my plastic cap and cover my ears because it gets to hot on my ears.  </li>
            <li> I like the freedom of not having to plug it in as sit and it stays warm for at least 30 minutes which is great</li>
            <li> It felt a great deal of relief to my dry scalp condition.</li>
            <li> Whoever designed this, got it right!</li>
            <li> Convenient and lightweight Hair Therapy Cordless Heat wrap is great for hot oil treatment and/or deep conditioning without being tied to the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product because of the convenient way of using it.  </li>
            <li> It last a good 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> White is tougher to keep looking nice (especially if Mom-In-Law sees you in it)  :o)</li>
            <li> And it has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> I really like this turban and it&#x27;s great for my deep conditioning sessions.</li>
            <li> With rollers, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit over my whole head, but I still get a wonderful set, the heat still gets in my (African American) hair and through the rollers.</li>
            <li> Most of us are very busy &amp; need to multi task.</li>
            <li> It got really hot!</li>
            <li> Heats well and stays hot!  </li>
            <li> doesnt fit over whole head tho.</li>
            <li> I put it in the microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds; the turban stayed warm throughout the entire</li>
            <li> Overall nice product.</li>
            <li> It delivers the benefits promised which makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far I love my hair therapy wrap.</li>
            <li> Great tool for deep conditioning for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love it and it has replaced many other &amp;#34;heating caps&amp;#34; I purchased.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of being able to do other thing while my wrap is doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Therapy wrap is great for conducting hot oil treatments, deep conditioning and giving natural hair the added boost of moist heat.</li>
            <li> The price was right too.</li>
            <li> The cap starts loosing heat right away</li>
            <li> and YES done right</li>
            <li> Love the convenience this wrap offers, it&#x27;s well made and heats up pretty hot</li>
            <li> It will feel warm /hot to you as long</li>
            <li> And it stays warm a long time.</li>
            <li> (this is how long it has always stayed warm even when I first purchased the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you put it on and it really doesn&#x27;t feel warm enough, don&#x27;t add more than 10 seconds extra in the microwave at a time.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the freedom that the cap gives you because you are able to walk around and accomplish other things around the house.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you want more size in head, try white one.</li>
            <li> It is like towel method where you put it in hot water on head as \\&quot;sauna\\</li>
            <li> , it is still hot on my therapy wrap I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I use this product for hot oil and deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> LOVE not sitting under the dryer and still getting my deep condition.</li>
            <li> The plastic bags works just as better overall</li>
            <li> there is nothing about how to put it together for the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t figure it out</li>
            <li> My first was purchased on another site.</li>
            <li> Hair definitely felt conditioned better after using this product.</li>
            <li> very convenient!</li>
            <li> I heated the turban for 80 seconds the maximum time because I expected the cloth to be a lot warmer, but at 80 seconds it was pretty warm.</li>
            <li> I love this, as i can regularly do a treatment without being stuck with the corded wrap.  </li>
            <li> and I put the gel packs in the microwave exactly as instructed and for the maximum recommended time.  </li>
            <li> First time using it</li>
            <li> I warmed it in the microwave for 3 minutes in 1 minute intervals and it was actually pretty hot.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter, but it still never really heated up as hot as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I would be willing to pay more for the cap for such improvements.</li>
            <li> I really like this wrap!  </li>
            <li> I have kinky-curly textured (4a/b) hair and detangling with my Tresemme naturals conditioner after using this is so much easier!</li>
            <li> For my hair, it&#x27;s definitely a plus :).</li>
            <li> If you like mobility and convenience this cap is most definitely for you.</li>
            <li> and I would switched the wrap around from front to the back during treatment to make sure I got the whole head covered.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, the gel pads do heat up pretty well, and the cordless feature is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I was nervous it would burn me and was worried about heating this in the microwave, but it worked very well and wasn&#x27;t too hot.</li>
            <li> It fit comfortably and stayed warm long enough as needed to deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to save a lot of time and a little money by purchasing this wrap and I Love It!  </li>
            <li> It keeps my head warm for up to half an hour.</li>
            <li> am sure it&#x27;s going to do the job for my dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend for the price, convenience and results.</li>
            <li> This product makes it easy to do a hot oil treatment while doing other things, but it&#x27;s a pain heating the hot packs and handling them.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> The wrap doesn&#x27;t really cover your whole head.</li>
            <li> It also shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> This really does work well.</li>
            <li> I think this process is really growing my hair</li>
            <li> The idea is genius, but the convenience of deep conditioning while not be bound and plugged into light socket costs you in effectiveness.</li>
            <li> and it really conditions your hair well.</li>
            <li> Heat stays in very well.</li>
            <li> i even slept overnight with it on and was very comfy.</li>
            <li> It is a REAL &amp;#34;heating cap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very convenient because I don&#x27;t have to stay stationary in one place when conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant that this would really work, but it does.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister because it&#x27;s really helpful..</li>
            <li> Very practical.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but it works really well</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even fit on my head properly.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it is really really</li>
            <li> Two different kind colors- white and brown.</li>
            <li> The white was clearly made better</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it gets warm enough to truly deep condition</li>
            <li> Being a natural hair diva, deep conditioning is a must and this product makes the process easy.</li>
            <li> Depending on your microwave, it may take more or less time to heat.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use heat without being stuck sitting somewhere for a half hour.</li>
            <li> Henna and Deep condition my hair on a more regular basis because of it.  </li>
            <li> After 1 hour I put more oil and massaged my hair and again used the heated cap and finally washed my hair with my regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> (honestly, your hair can only absorb so much moisture at one time so for those who deep condition for 45 minutes or more, the results are the same as if you left it on for 30 minutes - especially if you are using heat to help the conditioner/oils absorb).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving the turban a try.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cordless heating and this product came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> can be a little challenging.  </li>
            <li> Hard to warm up.</li>
            <li> It generally doesn&#x27;t stay hot for longer than 20 minutes but it doesn&#x27;t claim to either</li>
            <li> It stays warm for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The heat doesn&#x27;t last too long, maybe 15 minutes or so, but you can reheat if you want more.  </li>
            <li> This newer version is an improvement with an extra bit of cover for the very back of the head thereby keeping the entire head covered and warm.</li>
            <li> When the gel pads are placed in the microwave for the recommended amount of time, they stay warm for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> As Most Of The Reviews Have Said The Heat Doesnt Last Long!</li>
            <li> The inner pads don&#x27;t stay warm long enough....</li>
            <li> This item did not appear new</li>
            <li> LIke I said, I did not think I received a new item and returned it.  </li>
            <li> My friend recommended the new one to me and I am recommending to anyone who is looking for this type.</li>
            <li> I love this product i have thick hair and it covers my whole head</li>
            <li> I find that it only stays hot for about 45 mins.</li>
            <li> but after about 10min I just didn&#x27;t think it was staying as hot as a deep treatment</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient; I&#x27;m able to deep condition with heat while doing other things around the house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no biggie if you have time to work around the house and allow your conditioner to sit, but be aware that if you want a treatment that will only take 15-45 minutes, stick with an electric model.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think the packs get hot enough.</li>
            <li> the only thing is it gets my ears hot</li>
            <li> I use this for hot deep hair treatments.</li>
            <li> I use it as a per wash hair spa, have to rewarm4-5 times to have a proper hot oil treatment done.</li>
            <li> I ordered the first Hair Therapy Wrap Cordless Thermal which did not heat the lower back of my head.</li>
            <li> When you heat the product up in the microwave it doesn&#x27;t seem as if it is getting hot enough.</li>
            <li> I did a deep condition hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 instead of 5 only because sometimes getting the gel packs in while they are hot</li>
            <li> I also started using this on my 10 yr old and she has natural hair!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use without the mess!</li>
            <li> I wish it covered completely all of your hair.  </li>
            <li> No problems with the gel pads so far</li>
            <li> The cap works well so far.  </li>
            <li> The time saved helps this busy</li>
            <li> I have used this two times so far.</li>
            <li> The gel packs themselves provide complete coverage for your head, including the nape of the neck.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient when you don&#x27;t have a hooded dryer for deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> The heat stays in and my hair is so soft when I take it off.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats the mobility it offers</li>
            <li> I was surprised the zipper worked in the microwave.  </li>
            <li> I am using for the first time this week the new Cordless Thermal Turban Heat Wrap which I notice how it heats up my entire head front and back.  </li>
            <li> This is a great alternative for people that get sick from having too much air blown around them because they have to sit under a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> Warm Temperature does not last long, a bit heavy on the head.</li>
            <li> I have a big head and it more than fits, comes almost down to my eyebrows and covers the kitchen in the back with no problem.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item but in white not brown.  </li>
            <li> It heats up super fast (less than a minute) and lasts long (over 30 minutes).</li>
            <li> (I think if you push it a little further back you will achieve greater function).  </li>
            <li> Very convenient, can move around the house while your hair is being treated, no cords to fumble with, no sitting in one spot for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> i expected it to stay hot longer.</li>
            <li> It stays hot longer then i expected.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again, but only as a back up on days when I have much to do around the house.</li>
            <li> Really like it, I use it weekly, actually takes the place of pulling out the big hooded dryer and plugging it up</li>
            <li> but it is very helpful especially if your have a lot of house work and want to deep condition hair</li>
            <li> However, it is somewhat frustrating because the gel packs only seem to stay warm for about 20 to 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this frequently!</li>
            <li> I am a natural hair female</li>
            <li> I have medium length natural hair and the front, sides and back of my head were well heated</li>
            <li> especially when you are busy with children.</li>
            <li> My only issue with the heating cap is the inevitable need to replace the gel packs, there is no mention of obtaining replacements, but I would hope that reaching out to the company would enable you to get the gel packs sans having to purchase an entirely new heating cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other that that, the heat wrap works like a charm and it enveloped my head very well.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little hesitant if whether the turban would condition my hair and achieve the same results as a hydration machine at the salon, and it does!</li>
            <li> I have many other steaming products but the fact that i have to sit there for so long usually turns me off..</li>
            <li> The material (towel-like) doesn&#x27;t seem strong, so I&#x27;m not sure it will survive a few washes in the machine.</li>
            <li> I then put in my choice of deep conditioner (I like to have at least 3 on hand at any one time), put on my first shower cap, and then put the one that comes with this turban over it.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from very irritable, itchy and burning scalp which i believe was caused due to extreme dryness and was also causing hair fall.</li>
            <li> The packs remained hot for at least 30 min after initial heating.</li>
            <li> I have long mid back length Dreadlocks.</li>
            <li> It has cut my deep conditioning process in half not to mention I am not trapped under a dryer.</li>
            <li> I have long locs and it works well for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> long ways from front to back.</li>
            <li> So long are the days when I have to sit under the dryer for my hair to be deep conditioned, I even exercised with it on.</li>
            <li> My next complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t stay hot for very long.  </li>
            <li> The cap definitely saves time spent under a dryer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t microwave too long.  </li>
            <li> it really does mean 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li> It is lasting for a long time!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried miscrovaw method, it only last a few seconds to mins.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate dryers and the noise they make (along with the heat on my shoulders lmao), so I haven&#x27;t deep conditioned with heat in YEARS (literally)!</li>
            <li> Remind you I have long locs hanging down my back.</li>
            <li> I heat it up for two minutes by microwaving in 30 second intervals with at least 15 seconds between each microwaving.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing, I was getting to the point where I felt like simply leaving my hair under a shower cap with conditioner wasn&#x27;t enough</li>
            <li> I use this to deep condition my hair and to dry set my hair on rollers (on hair that has been curled previously).  </li>
            <li> It does not fit no doe it heat up long enough to [put it on your head.</li>
            <li> So yes that little tail piece ends up with that last square gel in it.</li>
            <li> I just wish the heat would last a little longer and the cap was a little larger.</li>
            <li> and I can do other things while providing heat to my deep conditioners - no longer trapped under a dryer or limited by a cord.  </li>
            <li> So, I made a mental note to get ear cups to protect them.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> &quot; Deep conditioner fades in few seconds.</li>
            <li> This heating cap works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Keep putting the wrap in the microwave in 30 sec.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t bother me, my personal wrap has a gap where the heat packets do not cover the head without some shifting and turning every few minutes.</li>
            <li> so you must be careful not to be over zealous.</li>
            <li> I compensate by heating up a wet hand towel and placing it under a plastic cap under the wrap.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural, thick and almost bra length</li>
            <li> with  it because  it  did not  retain  the heat very long, in less than  5 minutes  </li>
            <li> But it is not pretty looking</li>
            <li> it was cool to cold.</li>
            <li> It allows me the freedom to walk around the house and do other things.</li>
            <li> It cools down after 5 minutes, but it&#x27;s to be expected since your not using electricity..</li>
            <li> I would prefer if it would last at least 20mins.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve had this product for at least 2 years, but I don&#x27;t use it religiously so it held up through time.</li>
            <li> Use the old plug in the wall cap - faster cleaner and mostly less frustrating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;might be a bit tight for people with big heads and thick hair..</li>
            <li> Wear tightly, but not too tight to lose blood circulation.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;d load my hair up with deep conditioner, and then sit under a hard hat for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It is the difference to mivocraw because it was hidden by fabric and waited there for a few seconds-minutes.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to use this</li>
            <li> However, I feel it is a little too heavy for wearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little nervous when I put it in the microwave to heat it up because on a few occasions I heard it popping.</li>
            <li> It still works, but there&#x27;s a bit missing.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and $$$.  </li>
            <li> The cap is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Put in microwave for a few seconds and it heats for about 30 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the instructions are poor.....</li>
            <li> There are a few gaps in the areas of heat, and it is somewhat hard to get even heat distribution.</li>
            <li> usually requires.  </li>
            <li> Usually microwave longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely buy this again as opposed to an expensive head heating device.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed. :-/</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have the problems with the cap not fitting completey</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually subscribe to buying this and that with the promises of sleeker/shinier/healthier/longer hair, but this wrap has made a difference in my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> i regret that purchasing the electric  one, at least i would  have  gotten  the degree of heat</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this product is that every 10 minutes, I had to rewarm it up because it starts to get cold.</li>
            <li> So I tell you if you do not own one GET one</li>
            <li> It stays heated for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product at least five times since I purchased it...</li>
            <li> My hair  is too thick for this.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair don&#x27;t bother buying this.</li>
            <li> I mean I feeling like I am under hooded dryer.   </li>

            <li> I absolutely love this thing! I never put heat on my hair because I tend to wear protective styles, but I missed heated conditioning, so I figured this would help with that. In the past I&#x27;d load my hair up with deep conditioner, and then sit under a hard hat for a couple of hours. I absolutely hate dryers and the noise they make (along with the heat on my shoulders lmao), so I haven&#x27;t deep conditioned with heat in YEARS (literally)! I use this product after rinsing my hair for about 15 minutes and wringing my hair of excess water. I then put in my choice of deep conditioner (I like to have at least 3 on hand at any one time), put on my first shower cap, and then put the one that comes with this turban over it. I deep condition for an hour once a week. The heat is absolutely lovely! I was nervous it would burn me and was worried about heating this in the microwave, but it worked very well and wasn&#x27;t too hot. I put it in the microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds; the turban stayed warm throughout the entire hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works really well. Way better than hanging out with the blow dryer They get pretty warm too.</li>
            <li> I am a natural hair female and i use this item for my deep conditioners.  I find that it only stays hot for about 45 mins. Its very easy to use and worth the price.</li>
            <li> It works as what it said. However, I feel it is a little too heavy for wearing.</li>
            <li> I use this every week when I DC my hair. I have fine 3c/4a hair and my HTW works like a charm. I prefer to boil it rather than microwave because it stays heated longer. Also they should lists the replacement gel packs on Amazon. Overall nice product.</li>
            <li> Very good heating cap for deep conditioning. A most buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of curlynikki.com and because I my brazilian space heat cap needs replacing.  The cap came promptly and I followed all of the directions.  My two complaints are that the cap has a square shape part cut out of the pack so the cap and it&#x27;s heat do not get to the hair at the bottom of your neck.  If you pull the cap back to cover all of your hair you risk your hair in the front not being covered.  I wish it covered completely all of your hair.  My next complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t stay hot for very long.  At first it&#x27;s hot (my ears feel it) but after about 10min I just didn&#x27;t think it was staying as hot as a deep treatment usually requires.  I microwaved it to the max too.  The cap definitely saves time spent under a dryer but I always sort of have to hold onto it because it feels like it might slip off even when I have firmly twisted the tail and secured it to the velcro on top.  I have slept with it on and it is WAY comfy.  I&#x27;ve seen many videos of people who LOVE this cap and I just don&#x27;t love it but I&#x27;m going to keep it and keep using it and hope I&#x27;ll learn to love it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product because of the convenient way of using it.  It delivers the benefits promised which makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as I had hoped but the heat does last for approximately 30 good minutes! I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again but it gives me the freedom to multitask while deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product to everyone! It does wonders&amp;&amp;it makes my deep condition sessions more eventful because I am able to be more mobile while conditioning my hair..</li>
            <li> I used it once and it worked well. I just wish the design was a bit better. The wrap doesn&#x27;t really cover your whole head. In fact, the gel pads don&#x27;t cover the area where I need the hot oil treatment the most - the hair close to my neck line.  I ended up using it backwards for 10 minutes to make sure I got that area done. The material (towel-like) doesn&#x27;t seem strong, so I&#x27;m not sure it will survive a few washes in the machine. On the positive side, the gel pads do heat up pretty well, and the cordless feature is very convenient. It also shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much that I bought one for my mom too!! It works great and I can do other things while providing heat to my deep conditioners - no longer trapped under a dryer or limited by a cord.  It heats up super fast (less than a minute) and lasts long (over 30 minutes).</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoyed using this product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was because my ears were also covered by the turban, which meant they got toasty too, hahahaaa! So, I made a mental note to get ear cups to protect them. Other that that, the heat wrap works like a charm and it enveloped my head very well. I have medium length natural hair and the front, sides and back of my head were well heated and I had a wonderful deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday and love it! Easy to follow directions and gives you mobility because it&#x27;s wireless. Definitely getting my daughter one.</li>
            <li> No zipper and broken gel pack. Total waste of money. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to receiving this package.</li>
            <li> This is great for my heat needed deep conditionings. So much better than standing there with a blow dryer trying to warm up my hair. It stays warm for at least 20 minutes. I haven&#x27;t tried it for longer than that. No problems with the gel pads so far and I follow the directions for heating it.</li>
            <li> Hard to warm up. Usually microwave longer than recommended. But a great deal.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet but my daughter has and she says it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Love it!  The right size, made from wonderful, durable material, and does a great job of caring for my hair.  The price was right too.</li>
            <li> Product does it&#x27;s job. Very convenient, can move around the house while your hair is being treated, no cords to fumble with, no sitting in one spot for a long period of time. Happy with my purchase. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Last time I used it it decoded to burn on me.</li>
            <li> I use this for deep conditioning my hair every wash!!  I love it!  I love that you can wear it and still do things around the house.  It&#x27;s so relaxing that you don&#x27;t want to take it off.  Very nice product, I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product, but I thought I would be receiving the tan one like in the picture.  White is tougher to keep looking nice (especially if Mom-In-Law sees you in it)  :o)</li>
            <li> Im glad I purchased it. I can tell the difference when I use it.Im very pleased with this purchase.Very pleased</li>
            <li> Two different kind colors- white and brown. Nothing same comparing to this. I think brown is the best for heating but it will be limit to size head. If you want more size in head, try white one. It will be larger than you thought. It looked like football helmet.   I tried miscrovaw method, it only last a few seconds to mins. It is like towel method where you put it in hot water on head as \\&quot;sauna\\&quot; Deep conditioner fades in few seconds. You run foward and backward to get more heated water on towel?   Forget it, I tried stove and put gel pads there. It got really hot! It is lasting for a long time!!!! It even got warmer sometimes that I wanna buy ear protector. I think it got hotter if you keep in stove for 5 mins longer. It is the difference to mivocraw because it was hidden by fabric and waited there for a few seconds-minutes. Stove can let it be bared and wait on minutes. It got so hotttt! I just put it there about 10 mins ago , it is still hot on my therapy wrap I am wearing. I mean I feeling like I am under hooded dryer.   It will feel warm /hot to you as long you know how to pull tail from the back and keep it crasped closely to you. Don&#x27;t let it be loosed or it won&#x27;t be effective. Wear tightly, but not too tight to lose blood circulation. Hair shaft need to feel the heat to open cuticles</li>
            <li> This heating cap works as expected.  It&#x27;s so convenient; I&#x27;m able to deep condition with heat while doing other things around the house.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the simplest, most low-tech solutions are the best: if you are looking for a way of applying heat to your head, for example, when deep conditioning, this hat thing works well. If you want heat for longer than 20 minutes, it still works: simply put it back in the microwave for another 45 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: DO take seriously the instructions giving maximum time in microwave. I tried adding an extra 20 seconds and one part of the gel pack burst. It still works, but there&#x27;s a bit missing. Also, when you first take it out of the microwave you will think it is not hot or not hot enough, but when you put it on, it seems a lot hotter than you&#x27;d think it is. If you put it on and it really doesn&#x27;t feel warm enough, don&#x27;t add more than 10 seconds extra in the microwave at a time. I burnt my ears when I overheated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again as opposed to an expensive head heating device. This really does work well.</li>
            <li> I like that it is convenient for getting things done around the house while you deep condition. I had to heat it for 75 seconds to get it to last for 15mins. I would prefer if it would last at least 20mins. But you can always reheat it. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love that I can continue with my day. Most of us are very busy &amp; need to multi task. This product makes that possible.</li>
            <li> So far I love my hair therapy wrap. I&#x27;ve used it once and will be using it again today. It left my hair feeling great. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works well. Makes my hair feel wonderful after I use it for the first time. I will tell my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I use this product for hot oil and deep conditioning treatments. I think I&#x27;ve had this product for at least 2 years, but I don&#x27;t use it religiously so it held up through time. Very easy to use and convenient! Awesome product :)</li>
            <li> I love this hair wrap. It keeps my head warm for up to half an hour. I love that it is not bulky and that I can even sleep with it on my head when I give myself an overnight hot oil treatment. It was a great investment.</li>
            <li> I think this process is really growing my hair</li>
            <li> What makes this cap great also makes it not so great. The idea is genius, but the convenience of deep conditioning while not be bound and plugged into light socket costs you in effectiveness. The cap starts loosing heat right away and you will most likely have to re-heat it 1-2 times in order to get truly good penetration. It&#x27;s no biggie if you have time to work around the house and allow your conditioner to sit, but be aware that if you want a treatment that will only take 15-45 minutes, stick with an electric model. Otherwise, be prepared to make a couple trips to the microwave. I would buy it again, but only as a back up on days when I have much to do around the house.</li>
            <li> This item did not appear new so I returned it.  I purchased a white one. The material, etc was 100 percent better than the brown and works great. I highly recommend this item but in white not brown.  For those who will ask what difference does the color make....For some reason the brown was not made as well as the white. Lint, strings, etc. LIke I said, I did not think I received a new item and returned it.  The white was clearly made better and so I recommend that one.</li>
            <li> i expected it to stay hot longer. or to get hotter than what it did. but it&#x27;s better than no heat and/or having to sit under the dryer. something for me to use while expecting. doesnt fit over whole head tho.</li>
            <li> fits neatly. stayed out for about 15mins, lost heat rapidly. had to trim gel pads so they fit in pockets. great for mobility for quick treatments. doesnt last.</li>
            <li> Really like it, I use it weekly, actually takes the place of pulling out the big hooded dryer and plugging it up</li>
            <li> Depending on your microwave, it may take more or less time to heat. Use your best judgment and only keep it in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds at the time, test the temperature, then re-heat if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product. I like the freedom of not having to plug it in as sit and it stays warm for at least 30 minutes which is great (honestly, your hair can only absorb so much moisture at one time so for those who deep condition for 45 minutes or more, the results are the same as if you left it on for 30 minutes - especially if you are using heat to help the conditioner/oils absorb).</li>
            <li> I love the wrap! I have long locs and it works well for a deep conditioner. Keep putting the wrap in the microwave in 30 sec. intervals to get it to the temp you want. I love the convenience of no plug in.</li>
            <li> Bought this item because I HATE sitting under the dryer. I work from home and wanted the ability to come and go while deep conditioning my hair. This works like a charm....Just wish it would stay warmer longer (averages about 20 mins of heat per microwave burst), but I don&#x27;t mind...I just reheat it again. LOVE not sitting under the dryer and still getting my deep condition.</li>
            <li> Heats well and stays hot!  Love it!</li>
            <li> It was okay, but i will not recommend This product. The plastic bags works just as better overall don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t think the packs get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I love this product i have thick hair and it covers my whole head the only thing is it gets my ears hot so i just cover them with tissue</li>
            <li> Its good. it locks in moisture makes it feel alright, could be better. Ive seen better though, keep improving almost there.</li>
            <li> This cap is just what I needed for henna.  The heat doesn&#x27;t last too long, maybe 15 minutes or so, but you can reheat if you want more.  My only complaint is that the instructions are poor.....there is nothing about how to put it together for the first time you use it.  Not rocket science perhaps but it would be nice to know you got it right instead of praying it won&#x27;t explode in the microwave.  Anyway it all worked out, a good product even if with subpar instructions.</li>
            <li> very good  everything!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> Awesome product, but by the second time of use one of the heating bags burst.  Do Not Heat to 80 seconds max as suggested it will burst on you.</li>
            <li> I use this for hot deep hair treatments. Works great, easy to use. It is very comfortable and not cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, gets the job done. It generally doesn&#x27;t stay hot for longer than 20 minutes but it doesn&#x27;t claim to either so I have no compliants.</li>
            <li> I just received this item which was very securely packaged.&lt;br /&gt;When I use it, I&#x27;ll be able to more accurately describe my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it&#x27;s going to do the job for my dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Bought for balding brother to use with essential oil treatment I made for him.  The cap works well so far.  Maybe he will get some hair back!</li>
            <li> Warm Temperature does not last long, a bit heavy on the head. I use it as a per wash hair spa, have to rewarm4-5 times to have a proper hot oil treatment done. Will buy a hair steamer next time. Maybe a good idea wear it at winter sometimes. But it is not pretty looking you don&#x27;t want be seen when wearing it.</li>
            <li> Hey guys I read some of your reviews on this wrap. I figured out how to put in the gel packs. and YES done right IT DOES COVER THE ENTIRE HEAD. At first I couldn&#x27;t figure it out and I would switched the wrap around from front to the back during treatment to make sure I got the whole head covered. One time when going to heat it up the gel packs shifted and whola!! It shifted into that tail piece (which I didn&#x27;t know a gel could fit in there) So I ended up putting the 4 gels packs (that go in the middle) long ways from front to back. So yes that little tail piece ends up with that last square gel in it. So ppl put it in from front to back and you got it made. :)&lt;br /&gt;BTW I got mine from my local beauty supply store</li>
            <li> I have had my heating cap for almost two years now. I enjoy the freedom that the cap gives you because you are able to walk around and accomplish other things around the house. However, it is somewhat frustrating because the gel packs only seem to stay warm for about 20 to 30 minutes (this is how long it has always stayed warm even when I first purchased the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also disappointed because my gel pack burst. I have to admit I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether to buy another one. I hope they improve the length of time the packs stay heated and the ability not to burst so easily ( I feel like this should have lasted longer if I am using this every two weeks).</li>
            <li> Can never get all my hair under the heated part off the cap.  Waste of time and $$$.  Use the old plug in the wall cap - faster cleaner and mostly less frustrating.</li>
            <li> This is my second HairTherapy Wrap CordlessThermal Turban Heat Wrap. My first was purchased on another site. It was such a hit I decided to purchase one for gift giving. Although it doesn&#x27;t bother me, my personal wrap has a gap where the heat packets do not cover the head without some shifting and turning every few minutes. The one I ordered from Amazon is absolutely wonderful! This newer version is an improvement with an extra bit of cover for the very back of the head thereby keeping the entire head covered and warm. Convenient and lightweight Hair Therapy Cordless Heat wrap is great for hot oil treatment and/or deep conditioning without being tied to the hair dryer. And it stays warm a long time. Happy to say, my gift is a hit and well appreciated. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Big Hair woes. I have long mid back length Dreadlocks. This hood didnt fit too well but I liked the concept.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of this heat wrap. It does what it promises and was easy to assemble. I love that I can remove the gel packs and just throw it into the washer. I put it on and did some chores around the house. it was so comfortable that I almost forgot I had it on :-)</li>
            <li> Love this cap. Easy and comfortable to use and it really conditions your hair well.</li>
            <li> I liked the wrap,  i will recommend it to my friends.  Hair definitely felt conditioned better after using this product.</li>
            <li> I can deep condition my hair and still walk around doing everything else I need to do. I love that I can use heat without being stuck sitting somewhere for a half hour.</li>
            <li> heats up nicely easy to use, work nice with the right type of hair cream/oil.&lt;br /&gt;might be a bit tight for people with big heads and thick hair.. maybe</li>
            <li> This product has been a life changer.  I now Henna and Deep condition my hair on a more regular basis because of it.  The time saved helps this busy mom maintain her hair much better than she was!!</li>
            <li> This product is fine until you have to replace the gel-packs; replacements are no where to be found. Don&#x27;t invest your money!! It&#x27;s a rip-off. Sorry :-(</li>
            <li> Heat stays in very well. I usually warm it the full amount recommended and a couple times more. It works just as describe. No cords needed is great because... I walk around the house cleaning with it on and cooking! So far so good!</li>
            <li> Therapy wrap is great for conducting hot oil treatments, deep conditioning and giving natural hair the added boost of moist heat. Perfect addition to my natural hair regiment</li>
            <li> These Are Good But As Most Of The Reviews Have Said The Heat Doesnt Last Long! Ideal For Natural Hair Conditioning.</li>
            <li> very convenient! especially when you are busy with children. i even slept overnight with it on and was very comfy.</li>
            <li> Great idea for the  product. but i was abit frustrated  with  it because  it  did not  retain  the heat very long, in less than  5 minutes  it was cool to cold. i regret that purchasing the electric  one, at least i would  have  gotten  the degree of heat i wanted  from the duration of time i desired.</li>
            <li> I was SOOOOO happy with this headwrap when I first used it. I love it and it has replaced many other &amp;#34;heating caps&amp;#34; I purchased. Whoever designed this, got it right! It is a REAL &amp;#34;heating cap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this. Use it often</li>
            <li> I brought this item to help with my deep conditioner treatments. The idea of this product is great as far as me being able to move around etc. while deep conditioning. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this product is that every 10 minutes, I had to rewarm it up because it starts to get cold. I did use the microwave and that could be the cause. Next time will use the boiling water method to heat it up and see how that goes! Otherwise I think it was an okay buy.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use without the mess!</li>
            <li> The Cordless Hair Therapy Wrap Turban works as it should. At first I was a little hesitant if whether the turban would condition my hair and achieve the same results as a hydration machine at the salon, and it does! I heated the turban for 80 seconds the maximum time because I expected the cloth to be a lot warmer, but at 80 seconds it was pretty warm. It&#x27;s also very convenient because I don&#x27;t have to stay stationary in one place when conditioning my hair. I highly recommend giving the turban a try.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Easy to set up. I can get chores done while cindtioning my hair. Descent quality for the price</li>
            <li> It works okay for the cost. I just wish the heat would last a little longer and the cap was a little larger. If you have a lot of hair and/or a larger head, it may not cover your edges.</li>
            <li> I bought this heating conditioning cap to deep condition without sitting under my hooded dryer. It performs ok. It has heating packs that are heated in the microwave and placed inside of the cap. It remains warm for about 20-30 minutes. The straps to hold the cap on can be adjusted easily. The cap is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> More work that explained.</li>
            <li> I have used this two times so far. The first time it was wonderful it stayed hot WAY past the 30 minutes that I needed it to. The second time it didn&#x27;t (which I believe was my fault) but I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions to the T so I think that has something to do with it. I gave it 4 stars just in case it wasn&#x27;t my fault which I will find out the next time that I use it. Great purchase anyway because now I can walk around and do my thing and not be confined to the chair.</li>
            <li> Good head wrap. Heat seems to be retained for a good length of time-- up to 30 minutes for me. The middle gel pack does not fully extend to the front of my head, though.</li>
            <li> I love this, as i can regularly do a treatment without being stuck with the corded wrap.  It stays hot longer then i expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered the first Hair Therapy Wrap Cordless Thermal which did not heat the lower back of my head. I am using for the first time this week the new Cordless Thermal Turban Heat Wrap which I notice how it heats up my entire head front and back.  It works much better than the first Cordless Heat Wrap. My friend recommended the new one to me and I am recommending to anyone who is looking for this type.</li>
            <li> I Love this heating cap.  If you follow the instructions it works very well.  I was truly impressed and happy that I no longer  have to wait under a drier to deep condition my hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant that this would really work, but it does. I used it as a heat source when putting in highlights and when doing a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience this wrap offers, it&#x27;s well made and heats up pretty hot so you must be careful not to be over zealous. It cools down after 5 minutes, but it&#x27;s to be expected since your not using electricity.. Very glad with this buy, would buy again.</li>
            <li> it is ok! thought it would retain heat better but over all I can use the wrap for deep conditioning</li>
            <li> I just got the wrap today. When I unzipped it to insert the heat packets, the zipper came off. Not a good start to this product. I can&#x27;t get it to go back on. I will try a couple more times and then return it tomorrow if I&#x27;m unsuccessful. Pretty disappointed. :-/</li>
            <li> this is so convienent for me as i dont like sitting under a hooded dryer for any period of time, so this fits the bill for me. I pop it in the microwave for 2 mins then i can do my chores or just watch tv until its time to wash out my hair, love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it gets warm enough to truly deep condition and I put the gel packs in the microwave exactly as instructed and for the maximum recommended time.  I&#x27;ll try it again and if it does a better job, I&#x27;ll amend this review.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money on this one</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has cut my deep conditioning process in half not to mention I am not trapped under a dryer.</li>
            <li> This product makes it easy to do a hot oil treatment while doing other things, but it&#x27;s a pain heating the hot packs and handling them.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister because it&#x27;s really helpful.. now I will have to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. You can walk around the house while you are deep conditioning your hair. When you heat the product up in the microwave it doesn&#x27;t seem as if it is getting hot enough. Once you put the Wrap on your head you feel the heat.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit on head well and the heat comes from packs you put into this contraption.</li>
            <li> Every curly girl needs one! Don&#x27;t microwave too long.  Comes with three disposable caps too</li>
            <li> I have finally used this product and it works well.  I microwaved twice on 35 seconds each.  The heat lasted approx 30 minutes. The cap reaches to the nape of my neck. My hair is natural, thick and almost bra length</li>
            <li> 👍 OMG!!! When I took this item out of its package, I was like where am I suppose to put this at with all this hair of mine. Remind you I have long locs hanging down my back. I tell you it fit PERFECT! I did a deep condition hot oil treatment. I put it in the microwave which is 900 watts for 75 seconds and it did the job. First time using it and I notice a big difference already.....So I tell you if you do not own one GET one and you&#x27;ll be glad that you did!!!👏👏👏👏👏</li>
            <li> I purchased this cordless hair wrap, to aid in deep conditioning my hair. When the gel pads are placed in the microwave for the recommended amount of time, they stay warm for at least 30 minutes. I love the convenience of being able to do other thing while my wrap is doing it&#x27;s job. I would definitely recommend this hair wrap to others.</li>
            <li> Really works fast and is effective I use it when needed and it works great. really nice product. try you will see!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  Works perfectly and if I need longer thant 20-30 minutes then I pop it back in the microwave for 1 minute.  Very practical.</li>
            <li> I really love this heating cap and have found it extremely useful as it allows me to continue to be mobile as I treat my hair.  I follow the directions for heating the gel packs on the stovetop because a couple of people have noted that you get a longer, more consistent heat using this method.  I find the size of the cap to be more than suitable for my head size, which is not small, and the velcro keeps it securely fastened.  The gel packs themselves provide complete coverage for your head, including the nape of the neck.  My only issue with the heating cap is the inevitable need to replace the gel packs, there is no mention of obtaining replacements, but I would hope that reaching out to the company would enable you to get the gel packs sans having to purchase an entirely new heating cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. someone noted that they received the white turban cap rather than the brown, I ordered the cap that was pictured as brown and that is what I received.</li>
            <li> Stays warm for 15 min</li>
            <li> This hair wrap worked well for me. It fit comfortably and stayed warm long enough as needed to deep condition my hair. I warmed it in the microwave for 3 minutes in 1 minute intervals and it was actually pretty hot. I would certainly recommend for the price, convenience and results.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I was suffering from very irritable, itchy and burning scalp which i believe was caused due to extreme dryness and was also causing hair fall. I got it my mail yesterday and i tried it today. And it has helped me tremendously. I massaged my hair with oil. Use the heated cap. It felt a great deal of relief to my dry scalp condition. After 1 hour I put more oil and massaged my hair and again used the heated cap and finally washed my hair with my regular shampoo and conditioner. My scalp feels so much better. I would say 98% better.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review after using this for some more time.</li>
            <li> I so love my therapy wrap. It allows me the freedom to walk around the house and do other things. I also love how it makes my hair feel and look once I take it off. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this wrap.  I give it 4 instead of 5 only because sometimes getting the gel packs in while they are hot can be a little challenging.  Besides that, great product, I just ordered my mom one and my aunt is begging for one too!</li>
            <li> love love...stayed hot and I was able to wash dishes and steam my hair. I have many other steaming products but the fact that i have to sit there for so long usually turns me off..this is perfect and nice quality :)</li>
            <li> It does not fit no doe it heat up long enough to [put it on your head. I am very disappointed and need to throw this thing away . I cant even give it away that is how bad it is.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> The directions are very clear and easy to follow, this item is very easy to use. It stays warm for about 15-20 minutes. Would be nice if it stayed warm longer but it&#x27;s pretty good for being cordless. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter, but it still never really heated up as hot as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> This heat wrap is a great addition to my at home treatments. I decided to save a lot of time and a little money by purchasing this wrap and I Love It!  I recently cut my hair to bob length so I don&#x27;t have the problems with the cap not fitting completey (I think if you push it a little further back you will achieve greater function).  It stays heated for at least 30 minutes. So now I don&#x27;t feel rushed like an assembly line in the salon when its crowded. I go there knowing my hair was treated to my expectations so all I do is have the stylist roller set and wrap and I&#x27;m on my way. I also started using this on my 10 yr old and she has natural hair!</li>
            <li> The hair therapy wrap delivered just what was said it would do. I love the fact that I can move around with it. It stayed heated even after the time I needed to deep condition my hair. I absolutely love it. This was a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> The product idea is very good. The product would be greatly improved if the pockets inside the cap were smaller and the gel inserts were made, specifically, to fit in the pockets (and placed all around the cap). I would be willing to pay more for the cap for such improvements. There are a few gaps in the areas of heat, and it is somewhat hard to get even heat distribution. I compensate by heating up a wet hand towel and placing it under a plastic cap under the wrap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid to heat it up in the microwave to have it explode but it works really well, I leave it on and let the warmth radiate around my head and it does steam my hair. Good results so far and it&#x27;s very easy to put on.</li>
            <li> This cordless thermal turban is fabulous!  I use this to deep condition my hair and to dry set my hair on rollers (on hair that has been curled previously).  I have discovered if I roll may hair and use this heat wrap for 30 minutes, I get a fab voluminous curls!  With rollers, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit over my whole head, but I still get a wonderful set, the heat still gets in my (African American) hair and through the rollers.</li>
            <li> Very convenient when you don&#x27;t have a hooded dryer for deep conditioning treatments. The packs remained hot for at least 30 min after initial heating. I will definitely be using this frequently!</li>
            <li> I really like this turban and it&#x27;s great for my deep conditioning sessions. I&#x27;m a little nervous when I put it in the microwave to heat it up because on a few occasions I heard it popping. I was hoping it wasn&#x27;t going to explode. My only issue is the color...bleh. But it works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> for the price, yeah. it helps. Some reviews expect this product to perform $150 steamer when they only piad for $35.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this heated head wrap! It fits nice. Feels good on. Easy instructions on how to use. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I really like this wrap!  I used it to set my color and it was so simple just to pop it in the microwave.  I loathe sitting under the dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it every month since purchase and it&#x27;s wonderful. Being a natural hair diva, deep conditioning is a must and this product makes the process easy. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once.  The inner pads don&#x27;t stay warm long enough....even when warmed up in microwave as instructed.  I&#x27;ll be returning this item:(</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cordless heating and this product came highly recommended. Great tool for deep conditioning for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I did think it would stay hot for longer than it did, but I just warm it up again, and leave it on for about an hour. The heat stays in and my hair is so soft when I take it off. I don&#x27;t understand those saying it doesn&#x27;t cover the entire head. I have a big head and it more than fits, comes almost down to my eyebrows and covers the kitchen in the back with no problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually subscribe to buying this and that with the promises of sleeker/shinier/healthier/longer hair, but this wrap has made a difference in my hair regimen. I have kinky-curly textured (4a/b) hair and detangling with my Tresemme naturals conditioner after using this is so much easier! Plus, I get in a good DT while I&#x27;m at it. Nothing beats the mobility it offers so you can carry about your 20-30 minutes without being restrained to the hood. It also keeps it&#x27;s heat for a good 20-30 minutes so your getting some good heating time. I heat it up for two minutes by microwaving in 30 second intervals with at least 15 seconds between each microwaving.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing, I was getting to the point where I felt like simply leaving my hair under a shower cap with conditioner wasn&#x27;t enough so I added heat through the hair therapy wrap. Overall great tool. For my hair, it&#x27;s definitely a plus :).</li>
            <li> fell apart after one use</li>
            <li> Great for deep conditioning my hair.  Put in microwave for a few seconds and it heats for about 30 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> My hair  is too thick for this. Wouldn&#x27;t even fit on my head properly. If you have thick hair don&#x27;t bother buying this. I had to return it, very disappointed I was looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product at least five times since I purchased it...and I have to say it is really really a must have.  Please follow the directions for heating.  When it says 45 seconds....it really does mean 45 seconds.  I put it in the microwave for 45 seconds and pull it out and squeeze it...to distribute the heat, then put it back in for another 45 seconds, then put it on.  It last a good 45 minutes.  I have to wear a bonnet over top of my plastic cap and cover my ears because it gets to hot on my ears.  I was surprised the zipper worked in the microwave.  Great product.  This would make a wonderful Christmas or birthday present.  This is a great alternative for people that get sick from having too much air blown around them because they have to sit under a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to use this but it is very helpful especially if your have a lot of house work and want to deep condition hair</li>
            <li> This cap is amazing! So long are the days when I have to sit under the dryer for my hair to be deep conditioned, I even exercised with it on. If you like mobility and convenience this cap is most definitely for you.</li>
