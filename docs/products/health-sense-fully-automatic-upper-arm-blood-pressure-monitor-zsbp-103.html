            <li>So far I am very satisfied with this Blood Pressure Monitor Zsbp-103</li>
            <li>The readings have been great and it doesn&#x27;t take long.  </li>
            <li>works great use everyday automatically blows up bladder does not use up batteries like you would expect too many words required</li>
            <li>but otherwise very well pleased.</li>
            <li>It seems the bladder inside the cuff has developed a hole of some kind.</li>
            <li>I brought two one for my grandmother and the other for a friend they both have great things to say about it.</li>
            <li>Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor is wonderful and very simple to use.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and product is just as it was advertised.</li>
            <li>This is adequate for the price.  </li>
            <li>It also seems pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>I get very consistent blood pressure readings at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Large numbers that are easy yo read.</li>
            <li>Got the same reading from my dr&#x27;s office, so this monitor is very accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>It worked fine except it was reading about 10 numbers too high according to a doctors unit.</li>
            <li>just right on your arm.</li>
            <li>PRICE IS RIGHT</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a nice, easy to read, clear monitor that was simple to set up</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, consistent, decent battery life.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use!</li>
            <li>This is very accurate and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>I use 4 rechargeable AA batteries to power the unit and they last many months before needing to be charged.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>My first three readings taken just one minute apart ranged anywhere from 166 to 141.  </li>
            <li>But if the machine is smaller, it would be better for travel.</li>
            <li>This reads quite a bit higher.</li>
            <li>Love it especially for the price</li>
            <li>We like the traditional inflated cuff, and love automatic record keeping for our doctor to review.</li>
            <li>That high pressure can hurt expecially of U have to do it over and over again !!</li>
            <li>IT SEEMS THAT THE READINGS ARE ALWAYS HIGHER THAN WHAT MY DOCTORS GET FROM  ME</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>a blood pressure monitor for a few years and your pressure is fairly stable.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works fine and seems quite accurate.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about ordering such a cheap cuff but so far it has been great.  </li>
            <li>At first impression, this was a nice little bp machine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise its easy to use and understand even if you&#x27;re not in the medical field.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and the display is easy to read.</li>
            <li>The cuff is easy to apply and to adjust properly.</li>
            <li>Well, when she started to use this, she panicked because it showed her blood pressure as very high.  </li>
            <li>The reading was only 2 digits off than a manual reading, so this product is accurate.</li>
            <li>and she gets much lower readings.  </li>
            <li>so much it hurts for awhile until the pressure drops below 150.</li>
            <li>As much as I did not want to buy another monitor, I read the reviews on the Health Sense and saw the price</li>
            <li>Very durable and convenient.</li>
            <li>It works very well and did the trick.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The unit is better looking than expected</li>
            <li>fast service--everything as stated--</li>
            <li>I gave my aunt this for a gift because her blood pressure was very erratic.  </li>
            <li>I love it , the only thing that I dont like is the fact the it does not have the cord to be charge at the electric outlet , but you can get one from your old collections of</li>
            <li>Went to doctor on Friday and had baby on Sunday due to preeclempsia, but glad I got the monitor.  </li>
            <li>it also reads 10-20mmHg more than our other cuff.</li>
            <li>Other than that ok product.</li>
            <li>It is properly calibrated and reads true.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but it is a little bigger than I had been expecting.  </li>
            <li>despite reviews to contrary it pumps to 190 psi and only higher if needed, works fine every time and can keep track of 4 different people</li>
            <li>I had high blood pressure during my the end of my pregnancy</li>
            <li>normally I check my blood pressure with the devices we have in the office.  </li>
            <li>This product has a very large screen with big numbers, and works by just pushing the button..  </li>
            <li>This works for me just fine everyday, thanks to the seller</li>
            <li>but I have tried it at different times or maybe I just have very high blood pressure!  </li>
            <li>Measured exactly the same as what the doctor used.</li>
            <li>and although I don&#x27;t get the exact reading when compared to the doctors it is close enough to get and idea where it is at.</li>
            <li>But if this is your first or second monitor and you&#x27;re trying to get your pressure stable below 140 or 120, then fogettaboutit.</li>
            <li>No complaint so far.</li>
            <li>I simply put on a long sleeve flannel shirt and put the cuff over the shirt; then my arm doesn&#x27;t hurt and the readings still seem accurate.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use but not accurate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the readings are large enough for even a partial visual impaired person can see.</li>
            <li>If you want a larger cuff, you&#x27;ll end up paying as much for the large cuff alone as you did for the unit as shipped -- essentially doubling your cost.</li>
            <li>I have my daughter who is a nurse take it the old fashioned way</li>
            <li>My old Omron blood pressure monitor decided to stop working.  </li>
            <li>If you take multiple readings they will very by about 10 points.  </li>
            <li>I had to replace my old monitor</li>
            <li>but it error&#x27;s out too much, like every third time it is used, or the hose falls off , and</li>
            <li>It is well made and the cuff is clearly marked</li>
            <li>We use this Blood Pressure Monitor, daily, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I squeezed the cuff near my elbow and the compressor pumped the cuff up</li>
            <li>The monitor is easy to read ,but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i wanted to return it, but we would have only gotten back 2/3 price thanks to high shipping.</li>
            <li>It was enough for me to make and appt with my doctor after being way too high for 2 days in a row.  </li>
            <li>The unit comes with a &amp;#34;standard size&amp;#34; cuff that&#x27;s useful only if your upper arm is 14&amp;#34; or less in circumference.</li>
            <li>My old blood pressure monitor was often unable to read my blood pressure - I have very low pressure in my left are (80/50) and borderline high blood pressure in my right arm (160/80).</li>
            <li>The arm band was plenty large for me and monitoring takes only a few minutes of your time.  </li>
            <li>Good or bad numbers depends on you.</li>

            <li> It seems the bladder inside the cuff has developed a hole of some kind.</li>
            <li> I brought two one for my grandmother and the other for a friend they both have great things to say about it.</li>
            <li> Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor is wonderful and very simple to use.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product is just as it was advertised.</li>
            <li> This is adequate for the price.  </li>
            <li> It also seems pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> I get very consistent blood pressure readings at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Large numbers that are easy yo read.</li>
            <li> Got the same reading from my dr&#x27;s office, so this monitor is very accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> It worked fine except it was reading about 10 numbers too high according to a doctors unit.</li>
            <li> just right on your arm.</li>
            <li> PRICE IS RIGHT</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a nice, easy to read, clear monitor that was simple to set up</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, consistent, decent battery life.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is very accurate and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> I use 4 rechargeable AA batteries to power the unit and they last many months before needing to be charged.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> My first three readings taken just one minute apart ranged anywhere from 166 to 141.  </li>
            <li> But if the machine is smaller, it would be better for travel.</li>
            <li> This reads quite a bit higher.</li>
            <li> Love it especially for the price</li>
            <li> We like the traditional inflated cuff, and love automatic record keeping for our doctor to review.</li>
            <li> That high pressure can hurt expecially of U have to do it over and over again !!</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS THAT THE READINGS ARE ALWAYS HIGHER THAN WHAT MY DOCTORS GET FROM  ME</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> a blood pressure monitor for a few years and your pressure is fairly stable.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works fine and seems quite accurate.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about ordering such a cheap cuff but so far it has been great.  </li>
            <li> At first impression, this was a nice little bp machine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise its easy to use and understand even if you&#x27;re not in the medical field.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and the display is easy to read.</li>
            <li> The cuff is easy to apply and to adjust properly.</li>
            <li> Well, when she started to use this, she panicked because it showed her blood pressure as very high.  </li>
            <li> The reading was only 2 digits off than a manual reading, so this product is accurate.</li>
            <li> and she gets much lower readings.  </li>
            <li> so much it hurts for awhile until the pressure drops below 150.</li>
            <li> As much as I did not want to buy another monitor, I read the reviews on the Health Sense and saw the price</li>
            <li> Very durable and convenient.</li>
            <li> It works very well and did the trick.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The unit is better looking than expected</li>
            <li> fast service--everything as stated--</li>
            <li> I gave my aunt this for a gift because her blood pressure was very erratic.  </li>
            <li> I love it , the only thing that I dont like is the fact the it does not have the cord to be charge at the electric outlet , but you can get one from your old collections of</li>
            <li> Went to doctor on Friday and had baby on Sunday due to preeclempsia, but glad I got the monitor.  </li>
            <li> it also reads 10-20mmHg more than our other cuff.</li>
            <li> Other than that ok product.</li>
            <li> It is properly calibrated and reads true.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but it is a little bigger than I had been expecting.  </li>
            <li> despite reviews to contrary it pumps to 190 psi and only higher if needed, works fine every time and can keep track of 4 different people</li>
            <li> I had high blood pressure during my the end of my pregnancy</li>
            <li> normally I check my blood pressure with the devices we have in the office.  </li>
            <li> This product has a very large screen with big numbers, and works by just pushing the button..  </li>
            <li> This works for me just fine everyday, thanks to the seller</li>
            <li> but I have tried it at different times or maybe I just have very high blood pressure!  </li>
            <li> Measured exactly the same as what the doctor used.</li>
            <li> and although I don&#x27;t get the exact reading when compared to the doctors it is close enough to get and idea where it is at.</li>
            <li> But if this is your first or second monitor and you&#x27;re trying to get your pressure stable below 140 or 120, then fogettaboutit.</li>
            <li> No complaint so far.</li>
            <li> I simply put on a long sleeve flannel shirt and put the cuff over the shirt; then my arm doesn&#x27;t hurt and the readings still seem accurate.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use but not accurate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the readings are large enough for even a partial visual impaired person can see.</li>
            <li> If you want a larger cuff, you&#x27;ll end up paying as much for the large cuff alone as you did for the unit as shipped -- essentially doubling your cost.</li>
            <li> I have my daughter who is a nurse take it the old fashioned way</li>
            <li> My old Omron blood pressure monitor decided to stop working.  </li>
            <li> If you take multiple readings they will very by about 10 points.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace my old monitor</li>
            <li> but it error&#x27;s out too much, like every third time it is used, or the hose falls off , and</li>
            <li> It is well made and the cuff is clearly marked</li>
            <li> We use this Blood Pressure Monitor, daily, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I squeezed the cuff near my elbow and the compressor pumped the cuff up</li>
            <li> The monitor is easy to read ,but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i wanted to return it, but we would have only gotten back 2/3 price thanks to high shipping.</li>
            <li> It was enough for me to make and appt with my doctor after being way too high for 2 days in a row.  </li>
            <li> The unit comes with a &amp;#34;standard size&amp;#34; cuff that&#x27;s useful only if your upper arm is 14&amp;#34; or less in circumference.</li>
            <li> My old blood pressure monitor was often unable to read my blood pressure - I have very low pressure in my left are (80/50) and borderline high blood pressure in my right arm (160/80).</li>
            <li> The arm band was plenty large for me and monitoring takes only a few minutes of your time.  </li>
            <li> Good or bad numbers depends on you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to mess up with an arm style BP monitor because it goes on just like the ones at the doctor and is easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li> I still check my blood pressure twice a week because it&#x27;s still a little on the high side.  </li>
            <li> The detection of pulsing by the cuff is like with a human, it depends on cuff location, accuteness of hear (pulse detection) and whether you made a minor motion during the read.</li>
            <li> Gave it a 4 only because the cuff is a little tougher to fight the velcro than my old one.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it runs through batteries fairly fast which is to be expected running a vacuum pump</li>
            <li> a complete WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> Obviously it will give your blood pressure reading, among other things, but I use it because of a medication that I have to monitor.</li>
            <li> However, be careful about the cuff size, as using too small of a cuff can cause readings to be high.</li>
            <li> it lets you save the previous times you&#x27;ve checked to compare it at a later time.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother who is a nurse and she loves it&amp;#62; the only drawback is that the band to go around the arm was too small.</li>
            <li> We were not aware it didn&#x27;t come with power adapter.</li>
            <li> adjust the amt of pressure to the cuff, like our other one can do.  </li>
            <li> you get what you pay for, its NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Turns out my BP was significantly less than the reading.  </li>
            <li> It seems to read  high, unless I am using it improperly or at the wrong time</li>
            <li> My old monitor was so expensive, I did not expect to find one that is a \\&quot;realistic\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The monitor stopped working , the monitor was only used approximately 10 times.the on button won&#x27;t turn the pump on, the date works</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was having trouble getting my blood pressure under control.  </li>
            <li> I used the BP monitor a few times each month to monitor Blood Pressure.</li>
            <li> But is not accurate and</li>
            <li> the one it came with was too small</li>
            <li> The cuff is difficult to put on properly, and I am a Registered Nirse.</li>
            <li> however it was a day late , Still came meets the discription of the ad.</li>
            <li> Total worthless piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Poorly written description made it difficult to determine the size range of the cuff.</li>
            <li> so I figured I could not go wrong.  </li>
            <li> looks gr8, but machine is uncomfortable-</li>
            <li> but it is quite difficult to place in the correct position on the arm.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible.  </li>

            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother who is a nurse and she loves it&amp;#62; the only drawback is that the band to go around the arm was too small. Hence she had to switch bands. Otherwise its easy to use and understand even if you&#x27;re not in the medical field.</li>
            <li> It has the bells and whistles but it had me running to the ER with an elevated BP.  Turns out my BP was significantly less than the reading.  And that is everytime I take it.  I have my daughter who is a nurse take it the old fashioned way and she gets much lower readings.  BP is too important for this product to be so off.</li>
            <li> works great; only problem I have is that the cuff always goes up to 190 and squeezes my arm so much it hurts for awhile until the pressure drops below 150. I simply put on a long sleeve flannel shirt and put the cuff over the shirt; then my arm doesn&#x27;t hurt and the readings still seem accurate. Other than that it works fine and seems quite accurate. I use 4 rechargeable AA batteries to power the unit and they last many months before needing to be charged.</li>
            <li> Very good BP cuff.  Exactly what I needed.  Easy to usde.  E$xcellent service.</li>
            <li> Excellent price excellent machine.  Need to sell the adapter along with the machine but otherwise very well pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice  Pressure Monitor i used it every day. check me in check with my med.</li>
            <li> My old Omron blood pressure monitor decided to stop working.  As much as I did not want to buy another monitor, I read the reviews on the Health Sense and saw the price so I figured I could not go wrong.  My old monitor was so expensive, I did not expect to find one that is a \\&quot;realistic\\&quot; price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to keep closely monitoring my blood pressure per my doctor&#x27;s instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice, easy to read, clear monitor that was simple to set up and it works \\&quot;like a charm.\\&quot;  Now I can track my blood pressure as often as necessary.  The arm band was plenty large for me and monitoring takes only a few minutes of your time.  Shows diastolic, systolic and pulse all at the push of a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 2012&lt;br /&gt;Recently I took this machine to my doctor&#x27;s office to ensure that it was accurately tracking my blood pressure and it works like a charm.  Measured exactly the same as what the doctor used.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he is very happy with it.  Easy to use too.</li>
            <li> I get very consistent blood pressure readings at my doctor&#x27;s office. (always  ~120/75)  Not only are the readings I got with this machine quite different from the readings at my doctor&#x27;s office, but they are also inconsistent.  I got readings varying from 90/64 to 143/85 within a couple minute period.  Not a product you would want to use to inform your health decisions.</li>
            <li> i love it its very good for the price shipping was fast and the product itself is amazing ,my dad love it ,you get every ting you see in the picture fully auto ,works with 4 AAA battery and has a adapter slot to make life easier ,hope i helped you guys out ....</li>
            <li> great very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> It seems to read  high, unless I am using it improperly or at the wrong time but I have tried it at different times or maybe I just have very high blood pressure!  But I have used the drug store cuff and it seems more in line.</li>
            <li> very easy to use, great quality for its price</li>
            <li> The Health Sense Fully Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor is wonderful and very simple to use.  Portable and easy to read.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother and he was able to use the cuff just fine that came with the machine.  My brother wears a 3XL and the cuff wrapped snug around his arm but not too snug that it couldn&#x27;t perform a good read.</li>
            <li> The monitor stopped working , the monitor was only used approximately 10 times.the on button won&#x27;t turn the pump on, the date works but the pump won&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> Why doe&#x27;s Amazon make us award a star, when it should be a turd? At first impression, this was a nice little bp machine. After using it about 50 - 60 times, the air pump became too week for it to function. Save your money, try a different brand, this one is JUNK!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but it is a little bigger than I had been expecting.  I&#x27;m happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I had high blood pressure during my the end of my pregnancy and this helped keep track on my blood pressure.  It was enough for me to make and appt with my doctor after being way too high for 2 days in a row.  Went to doctor on Friday and had baby on Sunday due to preeclempsia, but glad I got the monitor.  I still check my blood pressure twice a week because it&#x27;s still a little on the high side.  Very easy to use and read.</li>
            <li> good product, very accurate</li>
            <li> My old blood pressure monitor was often unable to read my blood pressure - I have very low pressure in my left are (80/50) and borderline high blood pressure in my right arm (160/80).</li>
            <li> This blood pressure machine works great.  Easy to operate.  I, however, returned it because my machine started working correctly.  The precise is very good.</li>
            <li> this came as i was having problems with my blood pressure , in have found it easy to use and it produces very good readings. the shipping was also great as it turned up very quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this monitor for home use. It&#x27;s perfect for checking my blood pressure every morning. Big enough screen and numbers for my inlaws to read as well. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> seems to be a bit more accurate I would suggest this to my friends and family . I like it alot!</li>
            <li> this item is  made in china but surprisinly  well made i recommend this item  it is light weight and seems durable</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was having trouble getting my blood pressure under control.  It seems to work well and although I don&#x27;t get the exact reading when compared to the doctors it is close enough to get and idea where it is at. If you take multiple readings they will very by about 10 points.  My only complaint is that it runs through batteries fairly fast which is to be expected running a vacuum pump but it would have been nice if a AC adapter had been included.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive, easy to use, fairly accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Battery life, no AC adapter, cheap carrying case.</li>
            <li> Machine works great, is very spot on with the accuracy. However, be careful about the cuff size, as using too small of a cuff can cause readings to be high.</li>
            <li> I love it , the only thing that I dont like is the fact the it does not have the cord to be charge at the electric outlet , but you can get one from your old collections of cord&#x60;s,I bet that we all have one but so far product works fine !!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible.  My first three readings taken just one minute apart ranged anywhere from 166 to 141.  This machine is incredibly inconsistent and provides the user with no information that could be medically relied upon...a complete WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> Good price and works great.</li>
            <li> love it and will be ordering another  one of it soon also fast shipping thank you!!!</li>
            <li> accuracy checked with nurse at hospital, she was very impressed with this unit and found this product to be very accurate. So far I am very satisfied with this Blood Pressure Monitor Zsbp-103</li>
            <li> a blood pressure monitor for a few years and your pressure is fairly stable. But if this is your first or second monitor and you&#x27;re trying to get your pressure stable below 140 or 120, then fogettaboutit. This has no rhyme or reason to it. Sometimes it&#x27;s good. Sometimes it&#x27;s outa whack.</li>
            <li> the internal memory is a must.</li>
            <li> So far so good. But if the machine is smaller, it would be better for travel.</li>
            <li> despite reviews to contrary it pumps to 190 psi and only higher if needed, works fine every time and can keep track of 4 different people</li>
            <li> I love it its very good for the price shipping was fast and the product itself is amazing ,I love it ,you get every ting you see in the picture fully auto ,works with 4 AAA battery and has an adapter slot to make life easier.</li>
            <li> It works but doesn&#x27;t give correct Blood pressure checked it several times against the blood pressure taken by several differnt home health care nurses and its not even close. Total worthless piece of junk.</li>
            <li> We were not aware it didn&#x27;t come with power adapter.</li>
            <li> I like the big numbers and ez operation.</li>
            <li> Great pay!!! Its the prefect size, easy to read. I brought two one for my grandmother and the other for a friend they both have great things to say about it. Would buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old monitor so my mom gave me a wrist style monitor but I could never get a good reading so I got rid of it and went back to the arm style.  It&#x27;s really hard to mess up with an arm style BP monitor because it goes on just like the ones at the doctor and is easy to figure out.  Just put it on your arm and hit on and it goes.  Turn it off when you are done and go on with life.  The readings have been great and it doesn&#x27;t take long.  I recommend this for anyone who needs to keep an eye on their BP.</li>
            <li> I always wanted a blood pressure machine that I could click one button and it would do all the work. This is definitely it. Had the product for three weeks to date, and have not had a problem yet. Simple and easy to use!</li>
            <li> looks gr8, but machine is uncomfortable- it puffs up ALL the way to 220 for EVERY reading. it also reads 10-20mmHg more than our other cuff. i wanted to return it, but we would have only gotten back 2/3 price thanks to high shipping. you get what you pay for, its NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this. Very durable and convenient.</li>
            <li> This blood pressure machine works ok. But is not accurate and time I use it. I get a different reading. But is ok for the value.</li>
            <li> does a great job , now i can keep track of my health</li>
            <li> It worked fine except it was reading about 10 numbers too high according to a doctors unit. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. We had one before and was very useful so we ordered another to replace. We will order another one when the  time is needed.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use but not accurate. I took this to my doctor&#x27;s office to compare with their BP reading. This reads quite a bit higher. 10+ for top number and 5+ for the bottom number.</li>
            <li> This works for me just fine everyday, thanks to the seller</li>
            <li> Works just like the one in the Dr office .... Love it especially for the price</li>
            <li> We like the traditional inflated cuff, and love automatic record keeping for our doctor to review. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> We would like it but it error&#x27;s out too much, like every third time it is used, or the hose falls off , and U&lt;br /&gt;cant adjust the amt of pressure to the cuff, like our other one can do.  Why pump it to up over 200 lbs when your arm pressure or blood pressure runs 124?  That high pressure can hurt expecially of U have to do it over and over again !!</li>
            <li> Gives inaccurate readings</li>
            <li> My mother had a stroke and when she got home they wanted her to start taking her blood pressure&lt;br /&gt;on a regular basis.  I bought her this product and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Gave it a 4 only because the cuff is a little tougher to fight the velcro than my old one.  Works like it should.  To those who think multiple readings should all be the same, NO.  The detection of pulsing by the cuff is like with a human, it depends on cuff location, accuteness of hear (pulse detection) and whether you made a minor motion during the read. Take 3 readings and pick the pick the 2 closest to eachother.  A good machine.  Worth the money</li>
            <li> Easy to use and a fair price. Large numbers that are easy yo read. Quality case and reading device. Lightweight.</li>
            <li> accurate And Nice To Have A Portable Way To Take My Blood Pressure.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable and works great!</li>
            <li> works great use everyday automatically blows up bladder does not use up batteries like you would expect too many words required</li>
            <li> THESE MONITOR, AS I COMES, DOES NO HAVE AC ADAPTER, THEREFORE I HAVE TO USE IT WITH BATTERIES ONLY, BESIDES IT SEEMS THAT THE READINGS ARE ALWAYS HIGHER THAN WHAT MY DOCTORS GET FROM  ME AT THEIR OFFICES</li>
            <li> I purchased this BP monitor for my step father. I wanted something easy read, then he could use. This product has a very large screen with big numbers, and works by just pushing the button..  It is well made and the cuff is clearly marked so you know how to put it on.  It also seems pretty accurate. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent blood pressure monitor. No complaint so far.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a health evaluation online.  It works very well and did the trick. Like that it is so compact.</li>
            <li> Rugged. Very accurate. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, consistent, decent battery life. It could come with a better case, and you have to make sure you place it just right on your arm. I compared it with my doctor&#x27;s reading and it was correct each time.</li>
            <li> The monitor is easy to read ,but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I like the multiple person feature ; with the ablity to save readings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the readings are large enough for even a partial visual impaired person can see. The only short coming I found was that the manufacturer  should have included in the description the size of the battery to use and that this is not provided. Other than that ok product.</li>
            <li> We use this Blood Pressure Monitor, daily, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The BP monitor works great however it was a day late , Still came meets the discription of the ad. I am a nurse and used the BP monitor all night 12 hours and no complaints.</li>
            <li> The unit is better looking than expected but it is quite difficult to place in the correct position on the arm.  When finally in the correct position it works well.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse, and I purchased this for an elderly friend. It is simple to use and the display is easy to read. The price was superb. The cuff is easy to apply and to adjust properly.</li>
            <li> This product have a Good price  and excelent  functions. Satisfied My needs and the color is well. Work with four batteries.</li>
            <li> Nothing to review here. It fills itself with air to stop your pulse, then measure it. Then spits out 2 numbers. Good or bad numbers depends on you.</li>
            <li> EXCELENT.I BOUGHT THIS ASA GIFT.THE PERSON WHO IS USING IT HAPPY WITH IT.IT IS EASY TO USE AND PRICE IS RIGHT</li>
            <li> Poorly written description made it difficult to determine the size range of the cuff. the one it came with was too small and I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere to but a larger one.</li>
            <li> works great,  I took it to my doctor to compare what she had with hers and it was very similar numbers.  it lets you save the previous times you&#x27;ve checked to compare it at a later time.</li>
            <li> I used the BP monitor a few times each month to monitor Blood Pressure. It seems the bladder inside the cuff has developed a hole of some kind. The compressor starts to inflate the cuff, when the pressure reads about 10 the compressor no longer pumps. I squeezed the cuff near my elbow and the compressor pumped the cuff up so I could get a BP reading. I will attempt to contact the Manufacturer for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer replaced the cuff, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> fast service--everything as stated--</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived quickly and product is just as it was advertised. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The unit comes with a &amp;#34;standard size&amp;#34; cuff that&#x27;s useful only if your upper arm is 14&amp;#34; or less in circumference. If you want a larger cuff, you&#x27;ll end up paying as much for the large cuff alone as you did for the unit as shipped -- essentially doubling your cost. Also, the larger cuff has to be ordered from a third party (tel: 1-866-456-2999). Whether the unit works well, I&#x27;ll leave that for when I get the larger cuff.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about ordering such a cheap cuff but so far it has been great.  I am a healthcare provider and checked the accuracy against a manual cuff with a stethoscope and this one is accurate and easy to use.  For the price I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I gave my aunt this for a gift because her blood pressure was very erratic.  Well, when she started to use this, she panicked because it showed her blood pressure as very high.  She brought it to the clinic where she was checking her blood pressure weekly and they showed her how to place it correctly and get a proper reading.  The reading was only 2 digits off than a manual reading, so this product is accurate.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Great seller, great product as new. 10000% recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for my elderly relatives, they brought them to their Dr. and the Dr. made sure they were spot on. All in all I&#x27;m told that the monitors work just as the reviews say they should. I am resting a lil easier knowing that my relatives can monitor their BP at home without having to either get someone to drive them to the Dr just for a reading or use the totally untrustworthy cuffs as well as unsanitary at the public locations.</li>
            <li> This machine is very easy to use and works very well.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I need a pressure machine to monitor my blood pressure per my doctors orders and although it&#x27;s inexpensive it a pretty good product and pretty accurate too..!! I would recommend</li>
            <li> Cuff not big enough and can&#x27;t get a bigger cuff to go with it.</li>
            <li> This is very accurate and simple to use.  I work in an office with Doctors and Nurses and normally I check my blood pressure with the devices we have in the office.  I decided to get one for home use.  The results that I get are the same that as the results with the devices that the professionals use - so I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I needed this item for a specific purpose. Obviously it will give your blood pressure reading, among other things, but I use it because of a medication that I have to monitor. It seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I took this blood pressure monitor with me to the doctors twice&lt;br /&gt;the readings were quite a bit off from the doctors. It was a&lt;br /&gt;waste of money</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is adequate for the price.  It is properly calibrated and reads true.  The cuff is difficult to put on properly, and I am a Registered Nirse.</li>
            <li> Helped me to keep track of my pressure on a daily basis. Got the same reading from my dr&#x27;s office, so this monitor is very accurate and easy to use.</li>
