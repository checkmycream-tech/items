            <li>Everything was great thank you so much</li>
            <li>nothing like my favorite Curve Crush.  </li>
            <li>i love the scent, its very fresh and smells amazing</li>
            <li>It smells strong and flowering.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for at an amazing price.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, not too heavy and not too light.  </li>
            <li>I also bought original Curve but didn&#x27;t like the smell at all.  </li>

            <li>Thought is was going to be a little more sweeter, but the scent is nice, and fresh.</li>

            <li>A little strong....</li>
            <li>The original fragrance, not a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; imitation.  </li>
            <li>It has a delicate smell - prominent but not overpowering like some.</li>
            <li>It weakens throughout the day, but is still on and can be smelled faintly - which is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I find this scent in general to be intoxicating to me.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.  The original fragrance, not a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; imitation.  I&#x27;m very, very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching on and off between this perfume and Mambo (another favorite).  I went through my drawer last week and pulled out my old bottle of Curve Appeal because I found myself missing the way it smelled.  I gave myself a spray and memories came back from the time I wore it before.  My brain seemed to immediately associate it with this game I was playing at the time.  I find this scent in general to be intoxicating to me.  I also bought original Curve but didn&#x27;t like the smell at all.  The difference between the two is night and day.  What a beautiful scent Appeal is, though.  I&#x27;ll be ordering a larger bottle of this next time I get paid.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at an amazing price.  Smells wonderful, not too heavy and not too light.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> It smells strong and flowering.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase, the fragrance is very nice &amp; cheerful. I will definitely buy it again when I start running low</li>
            <li> I love my purfume it smells so good very happy to buy it ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It has a delicate smell - prominent but not overpowering like some. It weakens throughout the day, but is still on and can be smelled faintly - which is good. You don&#x27;t want to smell like you bathed in perfume before you left the house!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume since it first came out and I absolutely love it!!! You aren&#x27;t going to find a better price then on here. Very happy</li>
            <li> Just Love IT!!!! everybody around me asks me what perfume I wear, every time!!</li>
            <li> smells good &amp; last long</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas as I couldn&#x27;t find it in out city and got it for 1/2 the price on Amazon..</li>

            <li> i love the scent, its very fresh and smells amazing but i hate the bottle. but for the price, it is awesome.</li>

            <li> It arrived perfectly and very quickly! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have had people tell me that they want to just eat me, you sick people get your minds out of the gutter.  Meaning I smell as good as an apple pie... not that this smells like apple pie but gives off that yummy aroma.... love it and don&#x27;t wear anything else...</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my wife and she said  Smells good.she likes it so m happy.the bottle looks good too</li>
            <li> bottle wont even spray &amp; amazon does not let you return the bottle</li>
            <li> A little strong....but I will wear it every once in a while. In a nut shell, just not &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> Always been a fan or curve. And Curve is by far my favorite. Love the smell!!! Can&#x27;t wait to get another one!!!</li>
            <li> Everything was great thank you so much</li>
            <li> This  is a nice scent nothing like my favorite Curve Crush.  Thought is was going to be a little more sweeter, but the scent is nice, and fresh.</li>
