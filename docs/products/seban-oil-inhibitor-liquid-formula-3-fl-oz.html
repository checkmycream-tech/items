    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I like the liquid formula the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Best buy of my life.</li>
            <li>Of course Amazon had the best prices.  </li>
            <li>This works incredibly well.  </li>
            <li>Feel good to the touch.</li>
            <li>I use many oil matifiers and good cleansers and good moisturizers too, but this is great to apply after cleanser and toner and before the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Surely Seban works!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, works like a charm on my oily skin!</li>
            <li>but it goes on nicely either way.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be effective with controlling oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my skin but very effective.</li>
            <li>It works much better than I could hope for.</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while as well, even with my generous applications:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Avon&#x27;s mattifier which works 100% better than this junk.</li>
            <li>This works for 10 hours, with just one touch-up of a light paper towel blot during the day.</li>
            <li>but it does let me look shine free a bit longer.</li>
            <li>My skin stays clean feeling for over 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>One of the better products I have used for my very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I started using this product many years ago when it was available in drugstores and just recently found it again thru the companies website...</li>
            <li>I lasts about 5 hours on me which is better than most other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I pour some directly on to my hands and slap it on all over my face to make sure I get as much of it on my skin as I can, versus having it get soaked up in cotton applying discs.</li>
            <li>It really helps to get rid of that shiny, oily look and with it breakups!  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin that gets pretty oily in the warmer months.  </li>
            <li>and this works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, and this really helped me!</li>
            <li>I really missed it when I went to California and pimples</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had very oily skin all my life</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a real burden.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Does not have much of an odor in case</li>
            <li>i have really oily skin</li>
            <li>I have had very oily skin all of my life</li>
            <li>A product capable of doing this will give you that assurance just by looking at the container up-close.</li>
            <li>I recommend this or the blotter as opposed to the treated pads as they dry up fairly quickly if you are not using them quickly.</li>
            <li>YES!, you can apply the Seban under makeup and it dries clear, but it did nothing for my large pores; they still looked large under the makeup.  </li>
            <li>Maybe, for someone with combination skin or just a slightly oily T-zone it might work better.  </li>
            <li>3.5 stars for me, but I&#x27;m sure that it would be 5/5 stars for someone with less oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d look halfway decent an hour or two after I washed my face</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the formula is just nothing but a neutral liquid which has the same effect of rubbing toner on your face and nothing else.</li>
            <li>Seban is the first product, after many failures and lots of money spent, that actually works to control my oily</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars if it lasted a bit longer, Still, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>johnson and johnson&#x27;s clean and clear used to make a similar product...</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will work fine for other people too.  </li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference in controlling the oil compared to other products.</li>
            <li>stay clear and matted all day!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>As others have stated, the form of this product that comes in a little tub with pads was dried out - this was more economical!</li>
            <li>Nothing totally stops oily skin, but this really helps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li>I am a 49 y/o RN with adult onset acne.</li>
            <li>Just a word of caution this stuff does contain alcohol so if you have sensitive skin it might sting.</li>
            <li>The pads seem to dry out easily so only first 10 might work.</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing I have ever used that stops the oiliness and leaves a nice matte finish and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film on the skin.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Surely Seban works!  Having oily skin, I always had problem with shiny makeup.  After reading pros/cons of primers and oily skin on Amazon.com, I read someone recommending this and decided to give it a shot.  WOW!  It really helps to get rid of that shiny, oily look and with it breakups!  I really missed it when I went to California and pimples started to appear all over my face.  Now, I don&#x27;t travel without it!!!  Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> This got me through another brutal summer here in Louisiana! After showering, I would dab it on my face &amp; let it dry, which meant I could make it through to lunch before I had to blot &amp; powder again! I have really oily skin, and this really helped me! As others have stated, the form of this product that comes in a little tub with pads was dried out - this was more economical!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years after a dermatologist recommended it. Nothing totally stops oily skin, but this really helps. I like the liquid formula the best. The pads seem to dry out easily so only first 10 might work.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts as I ordered Seban.  It sounded too good to be true.  I&#x27;ve had very oily skin all my life and it&#x27;s been a real burden.  I&#x27;d look halfway decent an hour or two after I washed my face, then gradually I&#x27;d look like I dunked my face in a tub of Crisco.  No brand or amount of make up made any improvement. Of course, I turned to Amazon for help.  This works incredibly well.  I&#x27;ll go an entire 8-hour shift at the hospital and still look matte finished.  Unless you&#x27;ve had oily skin, you can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;s like to have a matte finished face.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  To help it along, I also use Mabelline primer and a little powder.  No more liquid makeup.  I&#x27;m 68 years old and I dislike the stiff feel of makeup.    The trigger for me to buy this was when one morning I got home from my night shift and my makeup had actually slid off.  That was the last straw.  What a mess!  Buy this with confidence.  It doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin.  Hopefully it will work fine for other people too.  Best buy of my life.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Feel good to the touch. But my oil is stronger than this. I still use it as a routine. I have had for 2 months.  It last for a long time</li>
            <li> I am a 49 y/o RN with adult onset acne. Seban is the first product, after many failures and lots of money spent, that actually works to control my oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with an acne wash ,apply Seban and then a mineral makeup. No touch ups needed throughout my 10 hour day. My face has actually cleared up since I started using Seban (less oil &#x3D; less acne). Would recommend to anyone with oily skin/adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that gets pretty oily in the warmer months.  I started using this product many years ago when it was available in drugstores and just recently found it again thru the companies website...cooperlabs.  Of course Amazon had the best prices.  This product is the only thing I have ever used that stops the oiliness and leaves a nice matte finish and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film on the skin.  It also comes in a blotter bottle but I like this bigger bottle to put on with a cotton ball in the morning.  I keep the blotter in my purse.  I do think you waste a lot on the cotton balls but it goes on nicely either way.  Does not have much of an odor in case that&#x27;s a concern to some.  I recommend this or the blotter as opposed to the treated pads as they dry up fairly quickly if you are not using them quickly.</li>
            <li> One of the better products I have used for my very oily skin. I lasts about 5 hours on me which is better than most other products I have used. It is very gentle on my skin but very effective. I would have given 5 stars if it lasted a bit longer, Still, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have had horribly oily skin since I was a pre-teen, so YES(!); I have always been on the lookout for products that might inhibit, absorb or &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; the oil production on my face so I don&#x27;t end up looking like a grease-ball. Since I am female I wear makeup too and wanted something I could apply &amp;#34;underneath&amp;#34; my makeup to help the makeup stay on longer and not melt away with oil and sweat.  YES!, you can apply the Seban under makeup and it dries clear, but it did nothing for my large pores; they still looked large under the makeup.  The Seban did help for while to keep my face matt, but not all day.  Maybe, for someone with combination skin or just a slightly oily T-zone it might work better.  Just a word of caution this stuff does contain alcohol so if you have sensitive skin it might sting.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in controlling the oil compared to other products. This is my 4th bottle. It lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> i have really oily skin and this works pretty well.  it lasts about 4 to 6 hours....and that&#x27;s when i&#x27;m just inside.  i think it might actually contribute to clogged pores though.  also, it&#x27;s overpriced.  johnson and johnson&#x27;s clean and clear used to make a similar product...i believe it was slightly tinted and in a much larger bottle.  not sure if they still make it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, works like a charm on my oily skin!</li>
            <li> Oily skin from acne... not sure if it has any effect on treating acne (I am 99% cure when I started), but definitely stopped my facial oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stay clear and matted all day!</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d discovered this 30 years ago. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have the oiliest skin of anyone I know. This works shockingly well. Normally, a half an hour I wash my face I&#x27;ve got spots of oil. This works for 10 hours, with just one touch-up of a light paper towel blot during the day. Does not cause breakouts and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Amazed.</li>
            <li> I have had very oily skin all of my life and I&#x27;m over 50. When I searched and found this I ordered it.  It works much better than I could hope for. My skin stays clean feeling for over 8 hours.  The product doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin or show at all. By guy standards, it is expensive so I ordered  CS Being premium cotton pads and cut them in half. These pads don&#x27;t leave fuzz on my face and don&#x27;t waste as much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Daisan-Being-Cotton-Special-Sheets/dp/B001ECQDVS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1364421896&amp;sr&#x3D;1-7&amp;keywords&#x3D;cotton+pads+for+face</li>
            <li> I have horrible facial oils. This product allows me to go 3 hours without blotting versus 1, but it didn&#x27;t stop my oil, nor did I expect it to. I use many oil matifiers and good cleansers and good moisturizers too, but this is great to apply after cleanser and toner and before the moisturizer. I pour some directly on to my hands and slap it on all over my face to make sure I get as much of it on my skin as I can, versus having it get soaked up in cotton applying discs. I still shine like crazy after a couple of hours but it does let me look shine free a bit longer. 3.5 stars for me, but I&#x27;m sure that it would be 5/5 stars for someone with less oil. I WOULD recommend this to anyone because anything that helps me even the slightest bit would work wonders for other people. It lasts quite a while as well, even with my generous applications:)</li>
            <li> This product did zero for me. The feel of it screams &amp;#34;useless&amp;#34;. Controlling oily skin is a very complex situation. A product capable of doing this will give you that assurance just by looking at the container up-close. A bottle where even the label is coming off before handling it will cast doubts of the efficacy of its contents. Sure enough, the formula is just nothing but a neutral liquid which has the same effect of rubbing toner on your face and nothing else. My trash bin owns it now.</li>
            <li> Seems to be effective with controlling oily skin.  At least for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This did nothing at all for me. It will not leave a white film like other mattifiers but other than that it was like water. I&#x27;ve been using Avon&#x27;s mattifier which works 100% better than this junk.</li>
