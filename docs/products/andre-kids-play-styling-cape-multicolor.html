            <li>we haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it yet, but looks good, we thought it was a bit longer</li>
            <li>He freaks out when the hair sticks to him, as a towel doesn&#x27;t give as good coverage as this cape.  </li>
            <li>Good quality material.  </li>
            <li>The price is fair.  </li>
            <li>They love it too!</li>

            <li>Great item, thanks!</li>
            <li>The kids love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be more proffesional and not worry about get the color on their clothes</li>
            <li>It does a good job of keeping the hair off of him, while being fun to wear.  </li>
            <li>The Velcro part is also good quality, there is stitching near the neck line to prevent itching and the Velcro itself is nice and strudy to prevent the cape from falling off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and easy to take off, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>(Easy on/off) waterproof so it will be easy clean up</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and on and off</li>
            <li>This makes haircuts more fun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of good solid material and not the cheap sticky type that you often see in beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>Even if your kid tugs at it, it probably will stay on as you need more than a gentle tug to rip it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty breathable too!</li>
            <li>it not his idea of fun.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for a super hero themed hair cape, but this did the job.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keeps the hair away from your kid, but the cut hair glides off the cape easily</li>
            <li>It make&#x27;s cutting hair more pleasant for the kids and makes it easier for you too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thin.</li>
            <li>All the hair falls to the floor gently so the hair is not flying</li>
            <li>would recommend this for every one who wants to cut their kids&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>After coloring my friends hair the dye seaped through the cape and stained her new shirt.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy and is close to what you get at a professional barbershop.  </li>
            <li>But, for a few bucks more you&#x27;ll get a quality cape that will last years.  </li>
            <li>Fits my 4 and 6 yr olds fine for sitting down it covers them enough.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not fidgeting around saying he&#x27;s hot (like the other cape we have)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I have no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Plus the cape I got is big enough to be a young adult cape, not a kids&#x27; cape.</li>
            <li>So good for cutting not coloring</li>
            <li>Used it right away when I got it on my 3 little boys!</li>

            <li> we haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it yet, but looks good, we thought it was a bit longer but I guess it will do.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was in perfect condition</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with this cape. It&#x27;s made of good solid material and not the cheap sticky type that you often see in beauty supply stores. It&#x27;s pretty breathable too!</li>
            <li> The kids love it. U can was hair in this 2. It&#x27;s not thin. It&#x27;s kinda like a wet cape that u was hair in. I like the colors. It&#x27;s not boy or girl.</li>
            <li> I bought this cape because I color a lot of people&#x27;s hair. I wanted to be more proffesional and not worry about get the color on their clothes so I bought this because it was cheaper and smaller then the others. After coloring my friends hair the dye seaped through the cape and stained her new shirt. So good for cutting not coloring</li>
            <li> I got this for my one little grandson who does NOT like to get his haircut.  He freaks out when the hair sticks to him, as a towel doesn&#x27;t give as good coverage as this cape.  It does a good job of keeping the hair off of him, while being fun to wear.  I was really looking for a super hero themed hair cape, but this did the job.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. I use this for both of my son&#x27;s when i cut their hair it is just like at the hair salon</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping hair off the clothes.  It&#x27;s easy to put on and easy to take off, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Nice and bright and cheerful.Nice that it has a Velcro neck (Easy on/off) waterproof so it will be easy clean up</li>
            <li> I have a 5-yr-old boy and getting a haircut it not his idea of fun. But this cape makes the process a lot easier. He&#x27;s not fidgeting around saying he&#x27;s hot (like the other cape we have) and it&#x27;s a lot lighter. I wish the back was fully covered like the front, but I guess it was designed specifically tailored for a barber shop or beauty salon where you sit back in a chair. I got my kid on a stool, so he is a bit exposed back there. Otherwise, I have no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> When the package came in the mail, I unwrapped it, and to my surprise, what was in the package was not the same thing as what was pictured. The cutting cape I recieved was a boys&#x27; cape with skateboarders on it. While the cape is still usable, it is not what I thought I was getting. Plus the cape I got is big enough to be a young adult cape, not a kids&#x27; cape.</li>
            <li> 1.  Good quality material.  The cape itself is made from a medium duty blend type of material.  It doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy and is close to what you get at a professional barbershop.  The Velcro part is also good quality, there is stitching near the neck line to prevent itching and the Velcro itself is nice and strudy to prevent the cape from falling off.  Even if your kid tugs at it, it probably will stay on as you need more than a gentle tug to rip it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Makes cutting hair easy.  Not only does it keeps the hair away from your kid, but the cut hair glides off the cape easily so it makes cleaning up afterward easier.  All the hair falls to the floor gently so the hair is not flying every where, this helps keep sweeping to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The price is fair.  Can you get a cheaper cape?  Yeah, probably.  But, for a few bucks more you&#x27;ll get a quality cape that will last years.  I&#x27;ve even used the cape for myself and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for every one who wants to cut their kids&#x27; hair.  It make&#x27;s cutting hair more pleasant for the kids and makes it easier for you too.  The only reason I knocked off one star is because the back is short, but I think that&#x27;s standard for kid&#x27;s cape.</li>
            <li> cute cape, good price.  I use it all the time when I cut kids hair at school.  Have had lots of compliments on it from other students</li>
            <li> Fits my 4 and 6 yr olds fine for sitting down it covers them enough. They have no complaints about wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect cape for kids.  It&#x27;s bright, colorful, light weight and perfect length.  My son loves looking at all the cars while I cut his hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Used it right away when I got it on my 3 little boys! They love it too! Great item, thanks!</li>
            <li> This Cap works great, it is nice and light and a great size for a young child. Easy to clean and on and off</li>
            <li> I cut both my kids&#x27; hair, using this cape.</li>
            <li> This makes haircuts more fun.  Additionally, the closure and coverage are excellent. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Form and function - A+++.</li>
