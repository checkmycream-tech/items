            <li>Perfect and can glam up like a doll.</li>
            <li>but I found this the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent color selection</li>
            <li>This is an amazing foundation!</li>
            <li>This is great if you have good skin.</li>
            <li>, good color for me.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>The way it blends in with the skin is too good.</li>
            <li>Great color selection and really as best as high end.</li>
            <li>The liquid is really good for coverage and the powder gives it a nice matte look (I tend to be oily).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also put this shade on a couple Latina friends and it matched their skin tone pretty perfectly too</li>
            <li>amazing cause</li>
            <li>Its amazing for my oily skin, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Great Product...goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazing price here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Amazing as this is the first time we were able to find the perfect shade for her.  </li>
            <li>By far the best drug store foundation out there</li>
            <li>So I switched to the Warm line and that worked out a lot better.</li>
            <li>It offers a  medium coverageush or beauty blender you will have a flawless look.  </li>
            <li>With another layer I look absolutely flawless, it&#x27;s not oily it lasts a really long time I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Puts on really nice and gives a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>love it I been using it for along time.</li>
            <li>its better if applied with a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>would have been too light!)</li>
            <li>I suppose I could go with a heavier foundation, but this works well, and maybe it is better not to look to pancakey.</li>
            <li>Price is better than in store with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>And more convenient this way.</li>
            <li>My favorite foundation out there.</li>
            <li>invisible and my skin looks so smooth &amp; creamy!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does!!!</li>
            <li>It looks pretty good for about 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li>So for the most part, W6 works fine for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied it with a wet sponge and it gave me a flawless look.</li>
            <li>It is so lightweight and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Goes in smooth but does not stay on.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and light.  </li>
            <li>I finally settled on W6-Sun Beige which works just great.</li>
            <li>It buffs smoothly into my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the foundation got the right color.</li>
            <li>But I think if you&#x27;re not oily or if you&#x27;re really good about not touching your face, it can look good for a lot longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can never fail, repurchased so many times.</li>
            <li>One layer is literally full coverage for me, and I have some acne scaring</li>
            <li>but those are also much more obvious - those are better for stage makeup/models etc).</li>
            <li>It photographs well, and I hot a ton of compliments!</li>
            <li>Perfect, I use a buffing brush to apply this foundation and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>is exactly my shade.</li>
            <li>- I found one that matches my skin tone EXACTLY.</li>
            <li>If you have no dry spots, this foundation will probably be fine.</li>
            <li>Will be buying it again and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>example, on a weekend, I might be home all day, and then put on makeup at night if a friend wants to grab a quicksnack/drink, and then I come home</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t move much when I sleep</li>
            <li>Really if you just need one foundation then it is just this.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well in covering it up while still looking pretty natural (there are other foundations out there that are much better at coverage</li>
            <li>Better than Mac or any other Ive tried.</li>
            <li>I definitely have a bit of a yellow undertone - even more than some of my other Asian friends - maybe that&#x27;s why warm works well for me?</li>
            <li>This foundation is very smooth and does not feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>So natural looks like real skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing a mask due to its light, well blended coverage.</li>
            <li>But I live in California where there isn&#x27;t often a shortage of sun.</li>
            <li>It makes dry spots look more dry and flakey.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it does not smooth over dry skin patches nicely.</li>
            <li>I use stippling brush to give me natural looking, even coverage.</li>
            <li>However, coverage is very thin and light - I had to put on many layers to fully cover redness and other unevenness.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember exactly which, but I used to use a shade from the either the Ceramic or Neutral line - it seemed to be the correct level of darkness (any darker would have been too dark but lighter</li>

            <li> Love the foundation got the right color. Puts on really nice and gives a smooth finish. Will be buying it again and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> So natural looks like real skin.  My only issue is not with this foundation but with my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t cover my melasma.  This is great if you have good skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I use a buffing brush to apply this foundation and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s not watery, it&#x27;s perfect. One layer is literally full coverage for me, and I have some acne scaring and this does the trick. With another layer I look absolutely flawless, it&#x27;s not oily it lasts a really long time I absolutely love it!</li>

            <li> Goes in smooth but does not stay on.</li>
            <li> Best drugstore foundation out there! I got the color W6, I am NC40 in MAC foundations.</li>
            <li> love it I been using it for along time. i have a lot of freckles and this is perfect for coverage. it has spf 15 too. its better if applied with a foundation brush. Its oil based so you will need some powder to get rid of the shine.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing foundation! It is so lightweight and easy to blend. Looks like you have no makeup on</li>
            <li> I have use this product for the last 8 years, maybe longer.  It&#x27;s match my skin tone quite well.  It goes on smooth and light.  When I travel to tropical area, it has enough sun protection for my face. I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing a mask due to its light, well blended coverage.</li>
            <li> FYI: this is the same review I wrote for the powder; I use both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m darker than the typical East-Asian (but not as dark as typical South-East Asians or Pacific Islanders). I can&#x27;t remember exactly which, but I used to use a shade from the either the Ceramic or Neutral line - it seemed to be the correct level of darkness (any darker would have been too dark but lighter would have been too light!) but it still wasn&#x27;t working well for me. So I switched to the Warm line and that worked out a lot better. I definitely have a bit of a yellow undertone - even more than some of my other Asian friends - maybe that&#x27;s why warm works well for me? I finally settled on W6-Sun Beige which works just great. I&#x27;ve also put this shade on a couple Latina friends and it matched their skin tone pretty perfectly too (they are somewhat light-skinned for Latinas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the liquid as a base and the powder over it. The liquid is really good for coverage and the powder gives it a nice matte look (I tend to be oily). SOMETIMES (like in the winter when I get lighter), I&#x27;ll use W5-Sand Beige powder over a W6-Sun Beige liquid. But I live in California where there isn&#x27;t often a shortage of sun. So for the most part, W6 works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a lot of acne (Now I have only about 1-2 at any given time), my cheeks have a lot of red spots from the acne marks. It works pretty well in covering it up while still looking pretty natural (there are other foundations out there that are much better at coverage but those are also much more obvious - those are better for stage makeup/models etc). But I have oily skin, so if I touch my face a lot, then yeah, eventually it wears off. It looks pretty good for about 4-6 hours. But I think if you&#x27;re not oily or if you&#x27;re really good about not touching your face, it can look good for a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, on a weekend, I might be home all day, and then put on makeup at night if a friend wants to grab a quicksnack/drink, and then I come home and SOMETIMES I fall asleep without washing my makeup off (I know, that&#x27;s the worst! Especially since I&#x27;m acne prone!!!!) and in the morning my makeup still looks amazing cause nothing has touched my face all night (I don&#x27;t move much when I sleep and I always sleep on my back). Hope this info helps!</li>
            <li> it leaves a sateen finish, not sticky or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> When I got it I was freaking out with the amount of shimmer I could see in the bottle. Once shaken, applied and blended, though, you cant see the shimmer, just a luminosity from within. It photographs well, and I hot a ton of compliments!</li>
            <li> I ordered this color for my daughter and it is the perfect shade.  Amazing as this is the first time we were able to find the perfect shade for her.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Its amazing for my oily skin, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! It does exactly what it says it does!!! Doesn&#x27;t have that caked on effect blends in perfectly...highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for months now. Easier then having to pick it up from the store. I suppose I could go with a heavier foundation, but this works well, and maybe it is better not to look to pancakey. I am a bit on the tan side for a redhead. This gets rid of some of my red coloring and other blotchiness. Not super heavy, goes on well, good color for me. Price is better than in store with subscribe and save. And more convenient this way.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation out there. Better than Mac or any other Ive tried.</li>
            <li> Great Product...goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> One of the best drugstore foundation ever. Great color selection and really as best as high end. Can never fail, repurchased so many times. One foundation that i can never be without. Really if you just need one foundation then it is just this. Perfect and can glam up like a doll.</li>
            <li> I keep reordering this...same color.  I have a few different foundations but this is my everyday go to foundation.  I use stippling brush to give me natural looking, even coverage.</li>
            <li> Amazing price here at Amazon. This foundation is very smooth and does not feel heavy on the skin. It offers a  medium coverageush or beauty blender you will have a flawless look.  I recommend the subscribe and save..</li>
            <li> this is truly a no foundation Foundation...invisible and my skin looks so smooth &amp; creamy!  This is my 2nd bottle,</li>
            <li> I just got this product and I loved it. The way it blends in with the skin is too good. I have an Indian skin tone and W6(sun beige) is exactly my shade. I applied it with a wet sponge and it gave me a flawless look. I have been experimenting with a lot of other foundations but I found this the best. I don not have any acne or blemishes so I did not want to spend a lot on an expensive foundation. This is just so affordable.</li>
            <li> Bought this foundation at the drug store for $10. Excellent color selection - I found one that matches my skin tone EXACTLY. It buffs smoothly into my skin. However, coverage is very thin and light - I had to put on many layers to fully cover redness and other unevenness. Additionally, it does not smooth over dry skin patches nicely. It makes dry spots look more dry and flakey. If you have no dry spots, this foundation will probably be fine.</li>
