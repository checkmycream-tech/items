            <li>It does a nice job conditioning my brushes.</li>
            <li>bought the 1000 g one and is very easy to cut into manageable pieces.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It does not have the best smell, but it is so natural.  </li>
            <li>It does a lot of good for my brushes and my hands while I clean my brushes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SOAP</li>
            <li>Oh I guess the last thing I can say about it is, besides the ok scent, is the best thing about the soap.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>people complain about the smell of this soap, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I discovered it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like the rectangular shape of this soap more than the cube shape one because it&#x27;s easier to hold.</li>
            <li>Great for ones&#x27; own personal use.  </li>
            <li>This was a great purchase and I&#x27;ll be back for more, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>However, it was easy to cut.  </li>
            <li>blocks are a great value, and they can be cut easily into four individual 250gm.</li>
            <li>And, for me that feeling of being hydrated is so important, I&#x27;d spend whatever it takes to get it.</li>
            <li>After washing it with this soap, it is so smooth.</li>
            <li>No stinky aroma, smooth to the skin.</li>
            <li>I too, bought the large 1000 gram bars and found it very easy to cut up into manageable sized pieces.     </li>
            <li>Buy this original soap.     </li>
            <li>(That jersey material is a bear to clean).  </li>
            <li>VERY SMOOTH &amp; GENTLE SOAP.</li>
            <li>I find the soap hardens nicely and doesn&#x27;t get soft and transfer on the wires.     </li>
            <li>That is no bad</li>
            <li>I have been using this for only about a week now, and find it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used and will use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>So to me, this soap is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny in it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>We love using organic and natural soaps.  </li>
            <li>and it came right out...</li>
            <li>The French swear by it and they are right!!!</li>
            <li>My skin does not get dry after using it, and that it what it is most important.  </li>
            <li>While pricey compared to what you&#x27;d find in most drug stores, this soap is so fine that it virtually replaces a host of other products (body wash, body scrub, moisturizer).</li>
            <li>Everyone in my family absolutely loves this soap!</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves this soap!  </li>
            <li>At first, I was looking for olive oil soap to felt projects and came across this product on Amazon pages.</li>
            <li>They feel so soft and smooth after each shower.</li>
            <li>It smells kinda funny, but it&#x27;s probably what you would expect soap of olive oil to smell like.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>I bought this soap as a natural product to clean my makeup brushes with.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, don&#x27;t forget the cool factor of: this soap was produced in the middle ages, exactly like it is when you get it!</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean, without the typical \\&quot;residue on your skin\\&quot; feeling often experienced after using other soaps.</li>
            <li>For those with dry skin, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>The large 1000gm.</li>
            <li>I accidentally bought this olive oil soap in a large 1000g cube.  </li>
            <li>And really?</li>
            <li>My hair is very silky.</li>
            <li>only fragrance you&#x27;ll notice is the light scent of olive oil</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both!</li>
            <li>Though this soap is not fragranced in the same way many soaps are these days, it&#x27;s made in the traditional way with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Soft as a baby skin!  </li>
            <li>Also, unlike others that have reviewed this soap, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my soap being soft and getting yucky.</li>
            <li>Go natural.  </li>
            <li>It is a natural smell.</li>
            <li>With this soap, my skin is soft and also natural feeling.</li>
            <li>Naturally mosturizing and no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit masculine but it lathers well and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unlike other pure olive oil soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This a fantastic French long lasting  soap!  </li>
            <li>When you open the package it will bring you back to a time when things were much simpler.  </li>
            <li>When I would get out of the shower and forget to put lotion on, my skin would itch insessantly, enough to keep me awake for hours just itching (I have very sensitive skin and some lotions</li>
            <li>the only thing that i cant figure out is how to smoothly cut the soap down when you by an enormous block.</li>
            <li>My mother has had a tremendous problem with dry skin (cracking and bleeding) due to chemotherapy and radiation treatments</li>
            <li>With its simple and pure properties of Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil and Mediterranean Sea Salted water; \\&quot;Savon de Marseille\\&quot; is the ultimate soap to use for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Made with only sea salt and olive oil, the soap will gently cleanse and moisturize you without leaving your skin feeling tight and stripped of its natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels completely hydrated, and if you have issues with chronic dry skin, its an euphoric feeling.</li>
            <li>Normally when I use body wash, it leaves my skin soft, but feels greasy and heavy after I shower.</li>
            <li>It might seem a little pricey for soap, but it beats spending the extra money on lotions and emollients that really don&#x27;t give you a return on your money.  </li>

            <li> Do I recommend this French soap to someone with dry skin?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending/wasting my money for a long time now, but now</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> It also arrived soft, I had to cut it into small bars and am I currently letting it dry in my garage.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use any other soap....except Syrian Aleppo soap which is basically the same except for the addition of bay laurel oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from ezcema and dry skin</li>
            <li> In fact, I bought a lot of the olive oil lotions too, cause a little back up won&#x27;t hurt anything.</li>
            <li> She says there is very little need to use lotion when using this soap on a daily basis.      </li>
            <li> I have severe skin sensitivities and am kept awake at night due to itchiness.</li>
            <li> The soap that was delivered was green, not brown, so they put some sort of coloring in it.  </li>
            <li> bad is I expected soap to be like olive soap made in Middle East - Palestine, Lebanon, Syria.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> The soap from Amazon  that I received had to be returned because of its poor quality and rancid smell.  </li>
            <li> This one is different, it smells terrible like grease.</li>
            <li> A very poor product.</li>
            <li> I find it very difficult to believe that this soap was imported from Marseille.  </li>
            <li> My son had a soccer jersey with a nearly impossible grease stain on it.  </li>
            <li> It made the house smell so bad that we just threw it out.</li>
            <li> Crap deal, don&#x27;t buy.  </li>
            <li> This soap had a putrid, disgusting odor.  </li>
            <li> The soap smells awful, like it&#x27;s rancid.</li>
            <li> The soap was wrapped in disgusting butcher paper.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this product on time and in perfect condition. After using it for a couple of weeks, I have to say that I will never buy another brand of soap. It leaves me feeling clean, without the typical \\&quot;residue on your skin\\&quot; feeling often experienced after using other soaps. Everyone in my family absolutely loves this soap!</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and I&#x27;ll be back for more, I&#x27;m sure.  It might seem a little pricey for soap, but it beats spending the extra money on lotions and emollients that really don&#x27;t give you a return on your money.  Though this soap is not fragranced in the same way many soaps are these days, it&#x27;s made in the traditional way with natural ingredients.  It&#x27;s truly a great buy!  My mother has had a tremendous problem with dry skin (cracking and bleeding) due to chemotherapy and radiation treatments and she absolutely loves this soap!  She says there is very little need to use lotion when using this soap on a daily basis.      When I would get out of the shower and forget to put lotion on, my skin would itch insessantly, enough to keep me awake for hours just itching (I have very sensitive skin and some lotions made me itch too).  Using this soap daily has stopped all of that from happening.  I LOVE THIS SOAP and you will too!</li>
            <li> At first, I was looking for olive oil soap to felt projects and came across this product on Amazon pages. I have severe skin sensitivities and am kept awake at night due to itchiness. I have been using this for only about a week now, and find it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used and will use it as long as it&#x27;s available. In fact, I bought a lot of the olive oil lotions too, cause a little back up won&#x27;t hurt anything. I too, bought the large 1000 gram bars and found it very easy to cut up into manageable sized pieces.     Also, unlike others that have reviewed this soap, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my soap being soft and getting yucky. After I use it in the shower, I leave it on the white wire rack in the shower to wait till the next day when I&#x27;ll use it again. I find the soap hardens nicely and doesn&#x27;t get soft and transfer on the wires.     Oh I guess the last thing I can say about it is, besides the ok scent, is the best thing about the soap. Its how you feel when you get out of the shower. My skin feels completely hydrated, and if you have issues with chronic dry skin, its an euphoric feeling. And, for me that feeling of being hydrated is so important, I&#x27;d spend whatever it takes to get it. So to me, this soap is well worth the cost. I&#x27;ve been spending/wasting my money for a long time now, but now...I know what to buy. Buy this original soap.     Oh yeah, don&#x27;t forget the cool factor of: this soap was produced in the middle ages, exactly like it is when you get it! And really? Can anything be cooler than that?</li>
            <li> Soft as a baby skin!  When it came wrapped in foil i could tell that this will be my softest soap, as soon as i touched it.  It does not have the best smell, but it is so natural.  My skin does not get dry after using it, and that it what it is most important.  Go natural.  It is worth every penny in it.  Love it.</li>
            <li> i must find a cheaper way to buy it. It is the only soap i can use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  Just buy Dove or Caress.  Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I always buy this soap when I travel in France.  When I found it on Amazon, I was elated!  It is so moisturizing that I never need to use any body creams or lotions.  With its simple and pure properties of Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil and Mediterranean Sea Salted water; \\&quot;Savon de Marseille\\&quot; is the ultimate soap to use for dry skin.  The large 1000gm. blocks are a great value, and they can be cut easily into four individual 250gm. bars.  Great for ones&#x27; own personal use.  For gift giving the 300gm. bars are perfect!  If you want to walk out of the shower and not immediately feel compelled to put on hand cream or body cream, use this Masterpiece Soap!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. i love it. my boyfriend even loves it! the only thing that i cant figure out is how to smoothly cut the soap down when you by an enormous block. after i solve that mystery, it will be perfect!</li>
            <li> My son had a soccer jersey with a nearly impossible grease stain on it.  (That jersey material is a bear to clean).  Used Savon de Marseille on it and it came right out... just by rubbing the soap across the fabric!  Buy this stuff... it&#x27;s great for skin and laundry!  The French swear by it and they are right!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used. I use it on my skin and hair. They feel so soft and smooth after each shower. My hair is very silky. It feels like I just used conditioner. I have never seen a soap to do that to my hair. Also, my skin has never been pampered like this before. After washing it with this soap, it is so smooth. You don&#x27;t need to use body lotion after taking a shower. It&#x27;s so incredible the quality of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain about the smell of this soap, but I love it. It is a natural smell. Everything about this soap is A+. I am glad I discovered it and I will use it from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 1000 g one and is very easy to cut into manageable pieces.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great investment and your body and hair will look and feel  just gorgeous!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap as a natural product to clean my makeup brushes with. It does a nice job conditioning my brushes. It is creamy and smells like olive oil. It does a lot of good for my brushes and my hands while I clean my brushes.</li>
            <li> Finally found a cleanser that does not break me out, make me red, make me flake, make me itch, or make my pores clog. It smells kinda funny, but it&#x27;s probably what you would expect soap of olive oil to smell like. It lasts a really long time. I have had mine for over three months now and I still have a lot to go! Great stuff. it will be all I will ever buy from now on.</li>
            <li> While pricey compared to what you&#x27;d find in most drug stores, this soap is so fine that it virtually replaces a host of other products (body wash, body scrub, moisturizer). Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! I bought this soap in the 1000 gram block size, and I cut it up so it&#x27;s easier to use. Normally when I use body wash, it leaves my skin soft, but feels greasy and heavy after I shower. With this soap, my skin is soft and also natural feeling. It smells wonderful: it&#x27;s light and refreshing. I don&#x27;t even have to apply lotion after I shower with this!</li>
            <li> THIS BLOCK LAST FOR A YEAR. VERY SMOOTH &amp; GENTLE SOAP. VERY GOOD QUALITY AND WHEN I PURCHASED THIS, IT WAS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, WHEN COMPARED TO BAR SOAPS.</li>
            <li> I will no complain about the paper that is wrapped the soap. That is no bad part.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 1000 g soap but I received 880 g one.&lt;br /&gt;My bad is I expected soap to be like olive soap made in Middle East - Palestine, Lebanon, Syria. This one is different, it smells terrible like grease.</li>
            <li> This soap had a putrid, disgusting odor.  It made the house smell so bad that we just threw it out.</li>
            <li> This is a big chunk of soap so be prepared. I love this stuff. Naturally mosturizing and no harmful ingredients. I buy this stuff all the time. This 1000g will last months.</li>
            <li> The soap smells awful, like it&#x27;s rancid. It&#x27;s very unlike other pure olive oil soaps I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ll never order again.</li>
            <li> The soap that was delivered was green, not brown, so they put some sort of coloring in it.  It also arrived soft, I had to cut it into small bars and am I currently letting it dry in my garage.  Crap deal, don&#x27;t buy.  The wrapping was soaked in a yellow liquid.</li>
            <li> Hundreds of years of experience goes into making this stuff. It&#x27;s perfect soap. I cut the cube into 6 big bars with a meat cleaver.</li>
            <li> We love using organic and natural soaps.  I accidentally bought this olive oil soap in a large 1000g cube.  However, it was easy to cut.  It smells a bit masculine but it lathers well and leaves no residue.  For those with dry skin, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> When you open the package it will bring you back to a time when things were much simpler.  Made with only sea salt and olive oil, the soap will gently cleanse and moisturize you without leaving your skin feeling tight and stripped of its natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only fragrance you&#x27;ll notice is the light scent of olive oil and I can&#x27;t help but think of the Don Quijote times of Spain when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from ezcema and dry skin and this is a god send!  I couldn&#x27;t use any other soap....except Syrian Aleppo soap which is basically the same except for the addition of bay laurel oil.  I highly recommend both!</li>
            <li> I visited Marseille, France two weeks ago and purchased savon de marseille olive oil soap in 400 g.  The soap from Amazon  that I received had to be returned because of its poor quality and rancid smell.  The soap was wrapped in disgusting butcher paper.  I find it very difficult to believe that this soap was imported from Marseille.  A very poor product.</li>
            <li> Good product. Helps to keep my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> This a fantastic French long lasting  soap!  I like the rectangular shape of this soap more than the cube shape one because it&#x27;s easier to hold. (Only the 300g savon de marseille soap comes in the rectangular shape, the others come in a cube shape)  Do I recommend this French soap to someone with dry skin? Absolutely!</li>
            <li> A hand soap that seems to last forever. No stinky aroma, smooth to the skin. Very refreshing to use. Beneficial to the skin.</li>
