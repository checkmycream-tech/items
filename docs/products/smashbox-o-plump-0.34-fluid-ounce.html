            <li>This is the best lip gloss I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Makes my lips feel wonderful ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>Best plumper I&#x27;ve ever used and the color</li>
            <li>it turns my lips is great!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful lip plumper!!</li>
            <li>and this did that wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best out there.</li>
            <li>this is a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And if you like how The Bachelorette Emily Maynard puts herself together, then you will be happy to hear that this is a product she swears by-</li>
            <li>Liquid magic!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; plumping gloss, but this isn&#x27;t good lip gloss at all...</li>
            <li>this is a good investment.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s is a superior product.</li>
            <li>This is one lip glass that I absolutely love!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>was trying to replace my favorite Too Faced brand of &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; gloss they seem to have discontinued and gave this a try based on mostly good reviews.</li>
            <li>I had many years ago bought the O-Gloss and loved it.</li>
            <li>It does have a warm tingle feeling when you wear it.  </li>
            <li>It gives nice definition without looking like a pair of balloons.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not as true when I apply Smashbox&#x27;s great O PLUMP product to them.  </li>
            <li>In comparison, Smashbox is very smooth and spreadable.</li>
            <li>My favorite plumping gloss.</li>
            <li>I wonder what causes this and is it safe?  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this lip gloss...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t plump, but I love the color my lips turn.</li>
            <li>I love this lip plumper.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>And I love how it feels on my lips.</li>
            <li>I love the shade it brings to my lips and</li>
            <li>I love this gloss.  </li>
            <li>Smashbox is one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li>That really did seem to be what they thought lol.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t plump at all, drugstore brands (sally Hanse&#x27;s lip inflation, and physicians formula) work way better for me.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, favorite gloss</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need a mirror to put it on and then changes to the perfect shade of pink.</li>
            <li>compared to Smashbox which has a very mild minty feeling but doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have the sticky, gooey feeling.  </li>
            <li>This is the one that really does make my lips look nice and plump.</li>
            <li>This Smashbox plumper, you can definately feel tingling like it&#x27;s working, but quite honestly I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement.  </li>
            <li>It looks very natural, but also makes me look instantly more glamarous!</li>
            <li>Everyone I have seen it on lookes natural and understated, but also very stunning.</li>
            <li>If the difference had been significant I would say go for it.  </li>
            <li>I currently use a cheap brand (NYC from Wal-mart) that works pretty good, but if there was something out there that worked BETTER, then I definately wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>This product did not plump my lips at all, but I have fairly full lips already.  </li>
            <li>I have full lips anyway</li>
            <li>I tried to get the same angle and expression to show a good comparison.</li>
            <li>I really like it and am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>(the taste; not so great so only kiss someone you don&#x27; t want to kiss again) haha</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never been sprayed (count your lucky stars)</li>
            <li>If you are looking to enhance your own natural beauty then this stuff is right up your alley.</li>
            <li>It just depends on your taste, but if you google image search this product there are some before/after shots that give a pretty accurate depiction.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>so I think this has more of a pornstar effect on me, but the natural color was so pretty!</li>
            <li>You WON&#x27;T look like Angelina Jolie after using this product, but you will be a bit more lush for those nights out on the town.....</li>
            <li>my lips feel fresh after every application.</li>
            <li>the tingly feeling is nice and last for a while.</li>
            <li>I love this because it goes on clear</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost for me.</li>
            <li>was well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t significant, really.  </li>
            <li>Although I prefer Dior&#x27;s wand application to Smashbox&#x27;s squeeze tube, all other aspects of the Smashbox product are superior.   </li>
            <li>The gloss is not sticky or greasy, but just the right texture/feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on right before you kiss someone...unless you use a corny line like &amp;#34;My kisses are hot&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you need plumping, this is the stuff to use, but don&#x27;t use it if you have full lips but want the extra pop, because it works too well. :)</li>
            <li>, tinted chapstick doesnt do enough, and strong lip gloss looks totally synthetic to me usually/ not to mention the color is always a bit off, but this stuff is GORGEOUS on.</li>
            <li>I have a very defined teardrop and full lips</li>
            <li>but honestly I have long hair</li>
            <li>The effect is enough to make me happy, this is the ONLY lip plumper that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>That could be a good thing if you have thin lips and want to create more lip.</li>
            <li>So soft and easy.</li>
            <li>as far as a lip gloss goes, its fine.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>It did make my lips a nice shade of pink but did not plump</li>
            <li>I will look for other colors because I love it!</li>
            <li>I like how this product leaves your lips your own shade of pink.  </li>
            <li>It is a tube of lip gloss, not terpentine, although the color stays pretty well all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still looking for that plumper that really works!</li>
            <li>The first time, it felt like my lips were on fire...</li>
            <li>first, or maybe you guys are into that kinky S&amp;M stuff.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy another just as a back up, I love it so much.</li>
            <li>and it DID hurt a ton (the term bee sting is quite accurate) and I accidentally got it on my chin turning it a lovely shade of red for several hours and plumped that up as well.</li>
            <li>If you like a more natural look of a light pink gloss - than</li>
            <li>&quot; but really I&#x27;ve noticed no change in my lip color when using this product.  </li>
            <li>they look much fuller with it on.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing to plump lips.</li>
            <li>and I really like</li>
            <li>I like it, but don&#x27;t notice much &#x27;plumping of the lips&#x27;.</li>
            <li>(I think) lip plumper a that really work.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be very sticky, doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to and has a foul taste.</li>
            <li>The essential oils and moisturizers really do give it a more soft texture.</li>
            <li>Also the subtle shade of pink that I got is totally gorgeous!!</li>
            <li>I love the natural, pretty pink shade it gives my lips too!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s true enough.  </li>
            <li>Nice personal color and texture, but haven&#x27;t noticed any real plumping so not sure its worth the price.</li>
            <li>, the top half is the plumped lips after applying O plump, the bottom is a pic of my lips I cropped from my phone.</li>
            <li>If your realistic and are expecting a little more pout</li>
            <li>but I wanted just a little more of a lucious look</li>
            <li>good thing about this product is that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Save your money and just buy a normal lip gloss, because that&#x27;s basically what this is.</li>
            <li>Be careful to apply right on lip line, because the first time I tried it at home, I got a swipe on the skin right above my lip and I umped the skin.</li>
            <li>I have never found a better shade of pink for me, and everyone I have lent it too says the same thing.</li>
            <li>People seemed to be raving about this product on here, but when I got it I was surprised by how small the bottle was, and when applying the plumper felt that it was pretty much exactly like any drug-store brand plumper I&#x27;d bought before and really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the plumpness of my lips.</li>
            <li>And it actually plumps up my lips, unlike many other plumping glosses.</li>
            <li>I decided to go a head and buy a new one and bought this one with the plumping action.</li>
            <li>I also noticed it filled out the wrinkles in my lips a little, so that&#x27;s another plus</li>
            <li>But with there being little if any difference, I would definately say don&#x27;t spend all the extra money and shipping on something that doesn&#x27;t work any better than the plumper you can get with NYC</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and remains clear.  </li>
            <li>I gave this 4 stars because I really like how it comes out clear but turns into a color that I finally like on me!  </li>
            <li>Do not waste 26.00 for this product.</li>
            <li>So natural</li>
            <li>(maybe it&#x27;s old??)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting at all- unless you have a very low pain threshold, Iknow some people are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>The color is a very sheer pink, it actually enhances the pink on my lip which I love, giving my lips an all-natural-look.  </li>
            <li>It does develop a subtle pink color which is nice.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in your purse and does work.  </li>
            <li>It goes with your natural lip color but give a extra umpth&lt;br</li>
            <li>the #2 is from the UK and apparently isn&#x27;t made anymore and #3 is Smashbox.  </li>
            <li>I also can feel the little sparkles that make the Dior gloss it shimmery as a mild gritty feeling.</li>
            <li>The product must contain peppermint or something similar, becaues you can feel a slight burning sensation right after application.    </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, is there really anything out there other than botox that will do that??</li>
            <li>Feels tingly at first but can see a little plumping.</li>
            <li>When I apply it to my lips, it feels tingly for a few minutes and then turns into a nice subtle color, plus glossy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product; does what it&#x27;s intended to do, plus a little extra color; but too expensive for lip gloss.</li>

            <li> I love the natural, pretty pink shade it gives my lips too!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s true enough.  </li>
            <li> Nice personal color and texture, but haven&#x27;t noticed any real plumping so not sure its worth the price.</li>
            <li> , the top half is the plumped lips after applying O plump, the bottom is a pic of my lips I cropped from my phone.</li>
            <li> If your realistic and are expecting a little more pout</li>
            <li> but I wanted just a little more of a lucious look</li>
            <li> good thing about this product is that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Save your money and just buy a normal lip gloss, because that&#x27;s basically what this is.</li>
            <li> Be careful to apply right on lip line, because the first time I tried it at home, I got a swipe on the skin right above my lip and I umped the skin.</li>
            <li> I have never found a better shade of pink for me, and everyone I have lent it too says the same thing.</li>
            <li> People seemed to be raving about this product on here, but when I got it I was surprised by how small the bottle was, and when applying the plumper felt that it was pretty much exactly like any drug-store brand plumper I&#x27;d bought before and really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the plumpness of my lips.</li>
            <li> And it actually plumps up my lips, unlike many other plumping glosses.</li>
            <li> I decided to go a head and buy a new one and bought this one with the plumping action.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it filled out the wrinkles in my lips a little, so that&#x27;s another plus</li>
            <li> But with there being little if any difference, I would definately say don&#x27;t spend all the extra money and shipping on something that doesn&#x27;t work any better than the plumper you can get with NYC</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and remains clear.  </li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because I really like how it comes out clear but turns into a color that I finally like on me!  </li>
            <li> Do not waste 26.00 for this product.</li>
            <li> So natural</li>
            <li> (maybe it&#x27;s old??)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting at all- unless you have a very low pain threshold, Iknow some people are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> The color is a very sheer pink, it actually enhances the pink on my lip which I love, giving my lips an all-natural-look.  </li>
            <li> It does develop a subtle pink color which is nice.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in your purse and does work.  </li>
            <li> It goes with your natural lip color but give a extra umpth&lt;br</li>
            <li> the #2 is from the UK and apparently isn&#x27;t made anymore and #3 is Smashbox.  </li>
            <li> I also can feel the little sparkles that make the Dior gloss it shimmery as a mild gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> The product must contain peppermint or something similar, becaues you can feel a slight burning sensation right after application.    </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, is there really anything out there other than botox that will do that??</li>
            <li> Feels tingly at first but can see a little plumping.</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my lips, it feels tingly for a few minutes and then turns into a nice subtle color, plus glossy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product; does what it&#x27;s intended to do, plus a little extra color; but too expensive for lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I also like how it feels on, but, unfortunately, I don&#x27;t get much plumping at all, which is why I bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> last long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very barbie-like pale pink.</li>
            <li> There is a definite tingle upon application, but I saw absolutely no change in the fullness of my lips</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the prettiest shade of pink (because it changes to match your personal skin tone)</li>
            <li> a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried to layer different types of lipstick under this product, but I always ended up with the pink lip gloss effect.  </li>
            <li> as for the color, it is different on everyone so it might be a bit of a gamble buying before trying, but if you like the idea of a custom shade of pink</li>
            <li> So I bought both the Dior and the Smashbox because I have very small lips that have only gotten thinner as I am getting older.  </li>
            <li> but I have had other plumpers do the same for me at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, all of that being said, that is what this product is meant to do, and I&#x27;ve used other lip-plumpers that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I would say for someone with an average sized pout, it plumps up just enough without over doing it.</li>
            <li> Not only is Smashbox slightly cheaper ($26 vs $27.55)</li>
            <li> I know the price is a little steep but overall</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my lips look a little fuller.</li>
            <li> however I saw absolutely no plumping at all in my lips.  </li>
            <li> Has absolutely no discernable color on my lips and zero plumping, except for a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips too pink</li>
            <li> While it does have some minimal plumping effect - this is a gloss and is not a product for anyone wanting a matte lip.  </li>
            <li> It turns a pink color once on the lips which could be considered &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; but i&#x27;m not really into that.</li>
            <li> It did tingle, and it gave my lips a tint of pink.  </li>
            <li> The Dior color is also lighter than I expected (almost tan) compared to Smashbox which applies clear and then turns a faint shade of medium pink (looks natural).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and adds a subtle, natural color to your lips.  </li>
            <li> But, I went ahead and purchased it at Sephora the other day</li>
            <li> I expected maybe a little fullness, but it did zero.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to try this product for so long, but was reluctant because of how small the tube is for the price.</li>
            <li> And as for the wear length, I would say it has all the qualities of an average gloss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again, unless the price comes down.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews prior to buying, and I want to respond to some of these reviews complaining about a)the color being wrong, b) it stinging or not plumping enough,  or c)</li>
            <li> I think it is just subtle enough.</li>
            <li> My mom, who has very thin and wrinkly lips tried it and it gave her enough definition (without looking unnatural) and totally smoothed out her lines</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little tingly, and it defiantly plumps my lips...</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> for the plumping factor, I have tried the heavy duty \\&quot;bee sting&#x27; type of plumpers before-</li>
            <li> Waste of $.&lt;br /&gt;Debra McDonald</li>
            <li> In fact, it looks identical to a dab of plain Vaseline, except that Vaseline doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have small lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what some of the 1-2 star reviews were for.</li>
            <li> Certainly not better than my $4 NYC lip plumper.  </li>
            <li> But if you are really trying to mask an insecurity about your lips, or are expecting miracles then I would stick with the heavy duty stuff as a base and maybe use this as a topcoat- or book a consult with a plastic surgeon, your choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont like the thick matte appearance of lipstick</li>
            <li> I mean come on</li>
            <li> I mean it IS a gloss we are talking about,  </li>
            <li> Not a good look.</li>
            <li> Again, it works really well, doesn&#x27;t have a nasty taste and not sticky.</li>
            <li> You get use to the sting after a few uses, so it&#x27;s not always so bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, neither myself, family or friends could see any difference in the size of my lips.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the tingling which isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This is basically an expensive lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Hey, who am I to judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way too expensive, though.  </li>
            <li> but my daughter said it drove her crazy</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> then you could probably liken it to an extremely bad sunburn.  </li>
            <li> Just disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it does not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> I hated it!</li>
            <li> Tastes awful, too.</li>

            <li> I have small lips. That&#x27;s true enough.  But it&#x27;s not as true when I apply Smashbox&#x27;s great O PLUMP product to them.  Whether going to work or dinner, I apply this over my lipstick for a fuller effect.  The product must contain peppermint or something similar, becaues you can feel a slight burning sensation right after application.    The color isn&#x27;t significant, really.  It goes on clear and remains clear.  I&#x27;ve read that it \\&quot;conforms to the color of your lips\\&quot; but really I&#x27;ve noticed no change in my lip color when using this product.  Small enough to fit in your purse and does work.  Don&#x27;t expect astronomical results:  You WON&#x27;T look like Angelina Jolie after using this product, but you will be a bit more lush for those nights out on the town.....</li>
            <li> This is one lip glass that I absolutely love!  The color is a very sheer pink, it actually enhances the pink on my lip which I love, giving my lips an all-natural-look.  It glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have the sticky, gooey feeling.  After about 30 seconds of applying it, it gives a tingling and minty sensation on your lips...my lips feel fresh after every application.</li>
            <li> My favorite plumping gloss. Really works!</li>
            <li> There is a definite tingle upon application, but I saw absolutely no change in the fullness of my lips</li>
            <li> This product did not plump my lips at all, but I have fairly full lips already.  It did sting a lot.  I wonder what causes this and is it safe?  I used it twice and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have a very defined teardrop and full lips so I think this has more of a pornstar effect on me, but the natural color was so pretty! If you need plumping, this is the stuff to use, but don&#x27;t use it if you have full lips but want the extra pop, because it works too well. :)</li>
            <li> as far as a lip gloss goes, its fine. however I saw absolutely no plumping at all in my lips.  Save your money and just buy a normal lip gloss, because that&#x27;s basically what this is.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lip gloss...it&#x27;s the prettiest shade of pink (because it changes to match your personal skin tone), it&#x27;s a little tingly, and it defiantly plumps my lips...they look much fuller with it on. I know the price is a little steep but overall if you want a shiny gloss that plumps and looks good--its a winner!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t plump, but I love the color my lips turn. Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is the best lip gloss I have ever used!  When I apply it to my lips, it feels tingly for a few minutes and then turns into a nice subtle color, plus glossy. I will definitely buy again. Makes my lips feel wonderful ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, neither myself, family or friends could see any difference in the size of my lips.  This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Has absolutely no discernable color on my lips and zero plumping, except for a burning sensation. In fact, it looks identical to a dab of plain Vaseline, except that Vaseline doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to replace my favorite Too Faced brand of &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; gloss they seem to have discontinued and gave this a try based on mostly good reviews. I don&#x27;t expect &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; plumping gloss, but this isn&#x27;t good lip gloss at all...a complete waste of money. I tried it a couple times, then again a couple weeks later. Dries my lips out...I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I love this lip plumper. It&#x27;s my favorite! I&#x27;ve tried a lot. This is the one that really does make my lips look nice and plump. :) And I love how it feels on my lips. (the taste; not so great so only kiss someone you don&#x27; t want to kiss again) haha</li>
            <li> Best plumper I&#x27;ve ever used and the color it turns my lips is great! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Makes your lips too pink</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing to plump lips. No change what so ever. Tingled a bit but no visible difference. Do not waste 26.00 for this product.</li>
            <li> I had many years ago bought the O-Gloss and loved it. I lost it, found it tried it out and it still worked. I decided to go a head and buy a new one and bought this one with the plumping action. Again, it works really well, doesn&#x27;t have a nasty taste and not sticky. I love the shade it brings to my lips and the tingly feeling is nice and last for a while.</li>
            <li> Nice personal color and texture, but haven&#x27;t noticed any real plumping so not sure its worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this gloss.  It&#x27;s not sticky and adds a subtle, natural color to your lips.  It definitely makes my lips look a little fuller.</li>
            <li> I love this because it goes on clear so you don&#x27;t need a mirror to put it on and then changes to the perfect shade of pink.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful lip plumper!! I have full lips anyway but I wanted just a little more of a lucious look and this did that wonderfully. Smashbox is one of my favorite brands. I&#x27;m not sure what some of the 1-2 star reviews were for. This is a plumping gloss not botox. It&#x27;s not going to take you from no lips to angelina I mean come on It&#x27;s a 30$ gloss! That really did seem to be what they thought lol. If your realistic and are expecting a little more pout this is a great product. If you are wanting a miracle save your money for lip injections. Also the subtle shade of pink that I got is totally gorgeous!!</li>
            <li> I like this product but it limits your ability to use different types of lipsticks. While it does have some minimal plumping effect - this is a gloss and is not a product for anyone wanting a matte lip.  I tried to layer different types of lipstick under this product, but I always ended up with the pink lip gloss effect.  If you like a more natural look of a light pink gloss - than this is a good investment.</li>
            <li> I thought this lip gloss would work, because I saw it on a tv show where they claimed it worked..  Don&#x27;t waste your money it doesn&#x27;t work... Didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t plump at all, drugstore brands (sally Hanse&#x27;s lip inflation, and physicians formula) work way better for me. This didn&#x27;t even give my lips any color! Just didn&#x27;t work at all. I like the satiny finish but overall its a dud.</li>
            <li> I can feel the tingling which isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  However, I can&#x27;t say that I see any change in the look of my lips.  It does develop a subtle pink color which is nice.</li>
            <li> People seemed to be raving about this product on here, but when I got it I was surprised by how small the bottle was, and when applying the plumper felt that it was pretty much exactly like any drug-store brand plumper I&#x27;d bought before and really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the plumpness of my lips. This is basically an expensive lip gloss. It turns a pink color once on the lips which could be considered &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; but i&#x27;m not really into that. If you want this level of quality, save money and buy a drug-store brand plumper.</li>
            <li> It did make my lips a nice shade of pink but did not plump and I had to constantly reapply it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Liquid magic!!  It does have a warm tingle feeling when you wear it.  I love it but my daughter said it drove her crazy and she had to remove it.  I will look for other colors because I love it!</li>
            <li> for almost $30 with shipping I expected maybe a little fullness, but it did zero. I used it 3 times a day for 2 weeks. Also gave me sores and chapped. Never again.</li>
            <li> Feels tingly at first but can see a little plumping.</li>
            <li> I like how this product leaves your lips your own shade of pink.  As for the plumping factor, Haven&#x27;t noticed anything nor has anyone mentioned it.</li>
            <li> It plumps my lips! The effect is enough to make me happy, this is the ONLY lip plumper that has ever worked for me. Be careful to apply right on lip line, because the first time I tried it at home, I got a swipe on the skin right above my lip and I umped the skin. That could be a good thing if you have thin lips and want to create more lip. Anyhow, I included a before and after picture, the top half is the plumped lips after applying O plump, the bottom is a pic of my lips I cropped from my phone. I tried to get the same angle and expression to show a good comparison. I also noticed it filled out the wrinkles in my lips a little, so that&#x27;s another plus. I love the natural, pretty pink shade it gives my lips too! I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to try this product for so long, but was reluctant because of how small the tube is for the price. But, I went ahead and purchased it at Sephora the other day and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this product is that a little bit goes a long way. The gloss is not sticky or greasy, but just the right texture/feel. And it actually plumps up my lips, unlike many other plumping glosses. I really like it and am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> My lips did not plump with this.  It did tingle, and it gave my lips a tint of pink.  I personally did not like the color at all.  It is a very barbie-like pale pink.</li>
            <li> There is no additional color to it aside from the reddish tone that it turns your lips when the gloss is in effect (which is a plus).  It does the justice that it is intended to do but I have had other plumpers do the same for me at a cheaper price.  I would recommend it to others but I am still on the hunt for something that last longer.</li>
            <li> So soft and easy. Love the color. So natural</li>
            <li> No visible plumping.  Just stings for a while.</li>
            <li> I have never found a better shade of pink for me, and everyone I have lent it too says the same thing. I am going to buy another just as a back up, I love it so much. I dont like the thick matte appearance of lipstick, tinted chapstick doesnt do enough, and strong lip gloss looks totally synthetic to me usually/ not to mention the color is always a bit off, but this stuff is GORGEOUS on. Totally worth the cost for me. I read all the reviews prior to buying, and I want to respond to some of these reviews complaining about a)the color being wrong, b) it stinging or not plumping enough,  or c) formula problems: sticky/doesnt last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well as for the color, it is different on everyone so it might be a bit of a gamble buying before trying, but if you like the idea of a custom shade of pink I think this is the best out there. It just depends on your taste, but if you google image search this product there are some before/after shots that give a pretty accurate depiction. Just remember, the lighting on computers could distort it a tiny bit. I think it is just subtle enough. It looks very natural, but also makes me look instantly more glamarous! Everyone I have seen it on lookes natural and understated, but also very stunning. My mom, who has very thin and wrinkly lips tried it and it gave her enough definition (without looking unnatural) and totally smoothed out her lines, she looked so beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the plumping factor, I have tried the heavy duty \\&quot;bee sting&#x27; type of plumpers before- well once. I hated it! My lips were TOO big and it DID hurt a ton (the term bee sting is quite accurate) and I accidentally got it on my chin turning it a lovely shade of red for several hours and plumped that up as well. Not a good look. But this stuff doesnt do that at all!! It has a minty taste and a tingly sensation I would say is just a notch or two stronger than peppermint chapstick. It doesn&#x27;t sting at all- unless you have a very low pain threshold, Iknow some people are very sensitive. It gives nice definition without looking like a pair of balloons. I would say for someone with an average sized pout, it plumps up just enough without over doing it. If you are looking to enhance your own natural beauty then this stuff is right up your alley. But if you are really trying to mask an insecurity about your lips, or are expecting miracles then I would stick with the heavy duty stuff as a base and maybe use this as a topcoat- or book a consult with a plastic surgeon, your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the formula, I think it has a tiny bit of tack, I mean it IS a gloss we are talking about,  but honestly I have long hair and I have yet to experience that aggrivating scenario where my hair gets stuck to my lips. The essential oils and moisturizers really do give it a more soft texture. I am a chapstick freak, I always have it. But besides swiping on the chapstick before bed, I havent had to use it since making this purchase. And as for the wear length, I would say it has all the qualities of an average gloss. Probably have to reapply after 2-3 hours maybe. It is a tube of lip gloss, not terpentine, although the color stays pretty well all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the satisfaction this gave me (this is all I wear, although I may swipe it over a lip tint before going out at night) was well worth the cost. You don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time. I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you like how The Bachelorette Emily Maynard puts herself together, then you will be happy to hear that this is a product she swears by- according to twitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped!</li>
            <li> Tingles when you put it on. I like it, but don&#x27;t notice much &#x27;plumping of the lips&#x27;. Let&#x27;s face it, is there really anything out there other than botox that will do that??</li>
            <li> Love it, favorite gloss</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because I really like how it comes out clear but turns into a color that I finally like on me!  I also like how it feels on, but, unfortunately, I don&#x27;t get much plumping at all, which is why I bought it in the first place.  Still looking for that plumper that really works!</li>
            <li> I only felt tingling sensation. My lips didn&#x27;t appear any larger. And there was no tint to the color. But I did receive item in a timely matter. So no problems with the seller. Just disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It goes with your natural lip color but give a extra umpth&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m actually going to buy a second tube of this</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it does not perform as advertised. Tastes awful, too. Waste of $.&lt;br /&gt;Debra McDonald</li>
            <li> Have you ever been sprayed in the face by Pepper (or Oleoresin Capsicum) spray? Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit like that, but for your lips. If you&#x27;ve never been sprayed (count your lucky stars) then you could probably liken it to an extremely bad sunburn.  The first time, it felt like my lips were on fire...and oops, I accidentally licked my lips. Don&#x27;t do that. Seriously...you will regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, all of that being said, that is what this product is meant to do, and I&#x27;ve used other lip-plumpers that do the same thing. It&#x27;s basically burning your lips so they swell up, giving it that plump &amp;#34;I just got back from a collagen injection session&amp;#34; look. You get use to the sting after a few uses, so it&#x27;s not always so bad. Plus, it enhances your lips natural pink...if you have naturally pink lips. I like it, and use it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on right before you kiss someone...unless you use a corny line like &amp;#34;My kisses are hot&amp;#34; first, or maybe you guys are into that kinky S&amp;M stuff. Hey, who am I to judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way too expensive, though.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again, unless the price comes down. I can go to the grocery store, buy a jalapeno pepper, and rub the seeds over my lips if I&#x27;m that desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product; does what it&#x27;s intended to do, plus a little extra color; but too expensive for lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I read an article that gave the to 10 (I think) lip plumper a that really work.  The #1 was Dior, the #2 is from the UK and apparently isn&#x27;t made anymore and #3 is Smashbox.  So I bought both the Dior and the Smashbox because I have very small lips that have only gotten thinner as I am getting older.  I currently use a cheap brand (NYC from Wal-mart) that works pretty good, but if there was something out there that worked BETTER, then I definately wanted to try it.  This Smashbox plumper, you can definately feel tingling like it&#x27;s working, but quite honestly I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement.  Certainly not better than my $4 NYC lip plumper.  If the difference had been significant I would say go for it.  But with there being little if any difference, I would definately say don&#x27;t spend all the extra money and shipping on something that doesn&#x27;t work any better than the plumper you can get with NYC</li>
            <li> This is the only pumping gloss that has ever worked for me!  I bought this gloss as well as &amp;#34;Dior Lip Maximizer&amp;#34; both from Amazon. Not only is Smashbox slightly cheaper ($26 vs $27.55) it&#x27;s is a superior product. Although I prefer Dior&#x27;s wand application to Smashbox&#x27;s squeeze tube, all other aspects of the Smashbox product are superior.   3 reason&#x27;s I prefer Smashbox to Dior: -Tingle... I find Dior has zero &#x27;tingle&#x27; (maybe it&#x27;s old??) compared to Smashbox which has a very mild minty feeling but doesn&#x27;t burn.  -Texture... Dior&#x27;s gloss is also too sticky - my hair gets stuck to it. I also can feel the little sparkles that make the Dior gloss it shimmery as a mild gritty feeling. In comparison, Smashbox is very smooth and spreadable. -Tint... The Dior color is also lighter than I expected (almost tan) compared to Smashbox which applies clear and then turns a faint shade of medium pink (looks natural).  I&#x27;m sticking with Smashbox.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews for this product. I found it to be very sticky, doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to and has a foul taste. Sorry!</li>
