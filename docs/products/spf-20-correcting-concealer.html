    <ol>
            <li>This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I never feel that the makeup is &amp;#34;caked on&amp;#34; and the flawless effect lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Best coverage ever.</li>
            <li>but my wife was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>perfect color.</li>
            <li>Best correcting consealer for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product otherwise though - doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily (which is a must!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and the shade is perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect can make any face beautiful.</li>
            <li>The color is great but the longevity is nonexistent.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great coverage, awsome product.  </li>
            <li>Great concealer for under the eyes.</li>
            <li>This is a great concealer..</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely too!</li>
            <li>Great product at a good price</li>
            <li>It feels good to look good (and have people notice).</li>
            <li>This concealer provides great coverage and is easy to apply!  </li>
            <li>Received it quickly &amp; it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>Goes on perfect, worth buying.</li>
            <li>I love that this product multitasks as a consealer,and a great color enhancer for under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer!</li>
            <li>love this makeup!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Glad they came out with a cream, the powder did not do the trick!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and provides good coverage without being cakey.</li>
            <li>this concealer is amazing</li>
            <li>covers effectively.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It never changes consistancy when applied either, so coating it with a translucent type powder is a good idea to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it up a bit and make it stop laying in the fine eye wrinkles</li>
            <li>This is by far the best concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I have been using concealers for more than 40 years..</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of concealers and have never been as satisfied as I am with this product.</li>
            <li>Really glad that I tried it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>as light as this makeup is it can cover anything!</li>
            <li>My skin looks flawless, I&#x27;m so glad I finally found this!</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t tell it has sunscreen :).</li>
            <li>smell is ok.</li>
            <li>Blends in beautifully and conceals many different types of blemishes.</li>
            <li>This product offers really great coverage&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave one to a good friend and she loves it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>balances out the blue and purple tones of my light under eye circles and also does a great job of concealing redness around my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>creamy, smooth application with a medium amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>The color I ordered is also too light for me.  </li>
            <li>and it was too light.</li>
            <li>light</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 yrs old and always looking for good coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, easy and does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>I love Bare materials makeup and love their coverup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that this concealer is only good for winter months and indoor/controlled climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this concealer for covering my dark under eye circles and it works great.</li>
            <li>only downside is it&#x27;s has more of a peachy color to it, vice Estee Lauder&#x27;s light concealer.</li>
            <li>This concealer is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned but have inherited dark  circles..</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great concealer, I love that it has spf to protect my eyes too (which is why I switched from my previous concealer).</li>
            <li>and yes, I tried applying the foundation first</li>
            <li>So far, this concealer has done great to help cover up those dark circles from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t personally have fine lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and blends nicely, softening uneven skin tones.</li>
            <li>Amazing coverage without being heavy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I probably don&#x27;t get as much sleep as one person should,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thanks to this concealer.</li>
            <li>The 1 is for pinkish skin tones while the 2 is for yellowish skin tones, and the colors range from light, medium, tan and deep.</li>
            <li>have super fair skin which means my dark circles under my eyes are DARK, and blemishes are VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have been waiting for a product that offers more coverage than the loose powder and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>It goes on like a light cream with a concealer brush, but does not weight down my face.</li>
            <li>And the color does not change in the different lights I work in, it stays natural the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have 4 young children</li>
            <li>_ OLD POST _______</li>
            <li>it looks very natural and blends seamlessly with the bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I use Light 1 and it completely covers dark circles, red and brown spots and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>So as I am aging I&#x27;m finding this cream is heavy enough to cake up in my fine wrinkles making them look like deep ones.</li>
            <li>I only use Bare Minerals because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks, but no thanks.</li>
            <li>(I use the bare minerals touch up veil to both keep the sweat/oils away and</li>
            <li>It is thicker (not heavy) in order to do this which I could see causing some issues  in different situations&lt;</li>
            <li>Works well with bare minerals powder over it.  </li>
            <li>This is the only make-up I can wear on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot use powered products because of my very dry skn ,,, so I was surprised to find Bare Minerals with a cream based concealer.</li>

            <li> The color is great but the longevity is nonexistent.  I&#x27;m so let down. I really had high hopes for this concealer :(</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used. It is very lightweight and blends nicely, softening uneven skin tones. I have medium size pores, red spots, and dark circles that are completely undetectable after applying Correcting Concealer. I never feel that the makeup is &amp;#34;caked on&amp;#34; and the flawless effect lasts all day. Since I started using this product, numerous people have complemented my &amp;#34;great skin&amp;#34;. It feels good to look good (and have people notice).</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage without being heavy. I would recommend to anyone. Covered redness, scars and evened out skin tones. I love Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly &amp; it was perfect.  Goes on nicely too!</li>
            <li> creamy, smooth application with a medium amount of coverage. balances out the blue and purple tones of my light under eye circles and also does a great job of concealing redness around my nose and chin. it looks very natural and blends seamlessly with the bare minerals foundation. i&#x27;m happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;though i don&#x27;t personally have fine lines or wrinkles, i feel like the consistency of this product would accentuate those problem areas, so give that some consideration.</li>
            <li> Best coverage ever. Goes on perfect, worth buying.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but the concealer is not great.  I tried applying it with my fingertip and blending, and also tried applying with a small cosmetic brush and blending - it doesn&#x27;t stay on, especially when I apply my bare minerals foundation over it .....and yes, I tried applying the foundation first and then the correcting concealer, and it still did not work.  The color I ordered is also too light for me.  Thanks, but no thanks.</li>
            <li> So far the one of the few concealers out there to have some lasting power and I have been using concealers for more than 40 years.. I am fair skinned but have inherited dark  circles.. I do use a primer under it</li>
            <li> I love Bare materials makeup and love their coverup</li>
            <li> Product as described and prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Great coverage, awsome product.  I&#x27;m very fair and the shade is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer! I have 4 young children and I probably don&#x27;t get as much sleep as one person should, yet I always look refreshed and it&#x27;s thanks to this concealer. Without it I would look like a raged zombie while grabbing my Tiramisu Latte and attending to my mom duties.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of concealers and have never been as satisfied as I am with this product. I cannot use powered products because of my very dry skn ,,, so I was surprised to find Bare Minerals with a cream based concealer. Really glad that I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I use Light 1 and it completely covers dark circles, red and brown spots and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 10/6/15: So as I am aging I&#x27;m finding this cream is heavy enough to cake up in my fine wrinkles making them look like deep ones. If you try to pat the cream out of the wrinkles the makeup comes off because it&#x27;s so light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never changes consistancy when applied either, so coating it with a translucent type powder is a good idea to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it up a bit and make it stop laying in the fine eye wrinkles (I use the bare minerals touch up veil to both keep the sweat/oils away and this concealer from caking under my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer time (if you sweat even a little) don&#x27;t bother trying this makeup, it will NOT last. I went to an amusement park this summer with a date, and after the day of thrills (no water parks mind you) in 90 degree weather I looked like a zombie...I&#x27;ve learned that this concealer is only good for winter months and indoor/controlled climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_________ OLD POST __________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this makeup! It goes on like a light cream with a concealer brush, but does not weight down my face. And the color does not change in the different lights I work in, it stays natural the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as light as this makeup is it can cover anything! It is thicker (not heavy) in order to do this which I could see causing some issues  in different situations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super fair skin which means my dark circles under my eyes are DARK, and blemishes are VERY noticeable. With that said, I look like movie star quality in my photoshoots! My skin looks flawless, I&#x27;m so glad I finally found this!</li>
            <li> Great concealer for under the eyes. I use this every day! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Other concealers tend to cause break-outs either because of an allergy or just because they clog pores.  So far, this concealer has done great to help cover up those dark circles from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> This concealer provides great coverage and is easy to apply!  Includes SPF 20 but you can&#x27;t tell it has sunscreen :).</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase of this product. I have EXTREMELY fair and sensitive skin. This is by far the best concealer I have ever used. Never cakey.</li>
            <li> I only use Bare Minerals because of my sensitive skin. finding a concealer that doesnt have that harsh Oil is next to imposible. this concealer is amazing</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;How did this item meet your expectations?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations but my wife was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> perfect color. product does not run . covers effectively. smell is ok. I love that this product multitasks as a consealer,and a great color enhancer for under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price</li>
            <li> Perfect can make any face beautiful.</li>
            <li> Best correcting consealer for me.  Spreads on evenly and lasts all day</li>
            <li> I use this concealer for covering my dark under eye circles and it works great. It goes on very smoothly and provides good coverage without being cakey. My one complaint is that the pictures on the Amazon website do not accurately depict the colors at all, so I got the Light 1 and it was too light. Will now need to get the Medium 2. You should refer to the company&#x27;s website for the color choice. The 1 is for pinkish skin tones while the 2 is for yellowish skin tones, and the colors range from light, medium, tan and deep. Hope this helps so others don&#x27;t choose the wrong color! Other than that this is a great concealer, I love that it has spf to protect my eyes too (which is why I switched from my previous concealer).</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer..light yet it covers blemishes and irregularities on your face.  Works well with bare minerals powder over it.  I&#x27;m 58 yrs old and always looking for good coverage.  Glad they came out with a cream, the powder did not do the trick!</li>
            <li> Blends in beautifully and conceals many different types of blemishes.</li>
            <li> This product offers really great coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is it&#x27;s has more of a peachy color to it, vice Estee Lauder&#x27;s light concealer. I actually switched just because I didn&#x27;t like the peachiness. It&#x27;s a great product otherwise though - doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily (which is a must!).</li>
            <li> This is the only make-up I can wear on my sensitive skin. I was ecstatic when they came out with the pressed mineral veil. This was the icing on the cake! I have been waiting for a product that offers more coverage than the loose powder and this does the trick. Lasts all day, but does not leave me feeling cakey. Love it!</li>
            <li> This concealer is worth every penny. It is smooth, easy and does exactly what it claims. I take one in my purse whenever I am out and about.  I gave one to a good friend and she loves it as much as I do.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Too moist for concealer......after a couple hours it was gone. I have oily skin and used under the eye area.  Very disappointed because I love bare minerals.</li>
