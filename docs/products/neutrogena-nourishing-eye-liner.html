    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Looks great!</li>
            <li>The taupe shade is perfect for light-medium skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect for daytime.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for creating smokey eyes look.</li>
            <li>This is a great color.</li>
            <li>This is great because it eliminates having to use a brush at all.</li>
            <li>Good color.  </li>
            <li>Great color, easy application, stays put, no irritation!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>My favorite eye shadow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it all week and love it!</li>
            <li>Tried this because a friend raved about it, and I really liked how it looked on her.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it if Neutrogena would make more and darker shades of this shadow stick!</li>
            <li>Nice product but very light.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed wearing it, nice neutral shade for work.</li>
            <li>I love this eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>But I love this color.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try it for a night out, will use more and maybe blend with another color.</li>
            <li>4 hours later, I checked in the bathroom mirror and my creases are still perfect.</li>
            <li>the understated look, it is quite becoming, lightens up the eye lid yet doesn&#x27;t scream  \\&quot;Eye Shadow!\\&quot;, just perfect for an attractive professional look during the week and natural looking for hanging out on weekends.  </li>
            <li>The tip is rounded, so it is very comfortable and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, this eye shadow tends to fade, but still pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more natural appearance, then this eyeshadow is great for that.</li>
            <li>This product would be best suited to someone (like me) who prefers to use just a single color on her eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy, but sets and lasts all day and into the evening.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, smooth, doesn&#x27;t crease with time.  </li>
            <li>This shade works great on me (Asian with light-medium skin and neutral/cool undertones).</li>
            <li>I got to try this eyeshadow for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>The primary benefits are convenience in application and removal.  </li>
            <li>I got to try this eye shadow from Bzz Agent for free.</li>
            <li>The shadow stick glides on velvety smooth and is super easy to use, basically foolproof.</li>
            <li>OK, the directions say to apply on lid first and then upward.</li>
            <li>The colors are super pretty although there should make more colors available.</li>
            <li>Yet, I didn&#x27;t need special eye makeup remover</li>
            <li>I really like the easy and smooth application.</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily and very easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I found is that if you want to mix it with other colors you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Just right for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The stick is just the right width for me.</li>
            <li>You can blend right away</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a great products and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff, and bought my second one.</li>
            <li>Because of its stick format, it is very low dust, which is probably actually better for contact lens wearers, anyway.  </li>
            <li>Application was super easy, the stick is rounded at the end, product is creamy and sheer, and it applied very well.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply although not very blendable.  </li>
            <li>I  highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s easy to apply, wears well, and looks natural.</li>
            <li>although I rely on their retinol line that is easy on my skin - not sure if this is just an exception or if their make up line is changing for the better.</li>
            <li>This eye shadow does exactly what it says, because it is absolutely crease proof.</li>
            <li>This blends better than powder shadows, especially when we are older.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and subtle on its own, or works fabulously as a base/primer under darker taupe-ish shadows such as the L&#x27;Oreal Nude 2 palette (that&#x27;s how I currently use it--keeps the powdery Nude 2 shadows in place all day and makes the colors stand out more).</li>
            <li>If I remember correctly, it had sparkles in it that was too much for me.</li>
            <li>It is also a very muted look.</li>
            <li>Wears really well</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s promising.</li>
            <li>not had much luck with Neutrogena cosmetics before,</li>
            <li>and it is not terribly dramatic; however, it does add a little color to my eyelids and is suitably conservative for my job in a patent law office.  </li>
            <li>This is a very natural looking, almost sheer color shadow that goes on easily and then just stays there all day - no creasing, melting, etc.  </li>
            <li>The taupe color was promising - it&#x27;s my go-to color and kind of hard to find.</li>
            <li>I have successfully removed this with three different makeup removers (not all at the same time, but I have tested different ones on different days, and they all work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes so also like the fact that no eye shadow powder sifts into my eyes since this is a cream.  </li>
            <li>I uploaded some before and after pics using the Lasting Taupe color on my upper lids, Constant Copper on my upper lids, Neutrogena mineral sheer as a foundation, and Neurogena Healthy Lengths Mascara.</li>
            <li>This eye shadow is my tried and true go to for everyday.</li>
            <li>Not to purple, just right to complement my dark brown eye color.</li>
            <li>Only caution would be for those who want a dramatic look - this cream is more subdued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>

            <li> , it came off with my usual facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I saw this at the drugstore the other day and decided to try it out.  </li>
            <li> However, I typically have a VERY bad creasing problem, even after only a few hours, and this is longer lasting than most other eye shadows I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a also a warmer copper shade that I would love to try as a base for mink brown shadows, to add a little depth.</li>
            <li> I could give half stars, I&#x27;d probably give this 3.5.  </li>
            <li> The result is very subtle and natural looking eyes.</li>
            <li> My lids are a little wrinkled and the shadow brought emphasis to the wrinkles, I do not recommend spending money on this.</li>
            <li> The color is a cool-toned pale taupe with touch of pink-lavender.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Sadly, this is not 100% crease proof; I do see a small amount of creasing after wearing it all day.  </li>
            <li> Not in the least!</li>
            <li> I like to use it with Constant Cooper shade 40, which I use as a base all over the eye lid.</li>
            <li> if it looked bad I could wash off immediately.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this eye shadow.  I do not get product build up in my creases even after wearing it all day.  This is a great color.</li>
            <li> This blends better than powder shadows, especially when we are older. Smooth and creamy, but sets and lasts all day and into the evening. Love this!</li>
            <li> Got this at the drugstore.  Had to get another one to go in my &#x27;travel&#x27; bag I liked it so much.  Good color.  Just right for my eyes.  Seems to stay on too.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Great color, easy application, stays put, no irritation!</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff, and bought my second one. It goes on easily, smooth, doesn&#x27;t crease with time.  Only complaint--more colors please!  But I love this color. Not to purple, just right to complement my dark brown eye color.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye shadow!</li>
            <li> Very pretty and subtle on its own, or works fabulously as a base/primer under darker taupe-ish shadows such as the L&#x27;Oreal Nude 2 palette (that&#x27;s how I currently use it--keeps the powdery Nude 2 shadows in place all day and makes the colors stand out more).

The shadow stick glides on velvety smooth and is super easy to use, basically foolproof. The stick is just the right width for me. There is a also a warmer copper shade that I would love to try as a base for mink brown shadows, to add a little depth. I&#x27;d love it if Neutrogena would make more and darker shades of this shadow stick!</li>
            <li> Got this a while ago, and don&#x27;t have it anymore. If I remember correctly, it had sparkles in it that was too much for me.</li>
            <li> I received this product from BzzAgent to test. I usually use the power eyeshadows in the little cases and it is always a pain to get the right amount applied with a eyeshadow brush. This is great because it eliminates having to use a brush at all. I can just roll it on. It is also a very muted look. If you are looking for a more natural appearance, then this eyeshadow is great for that. I uploaded some before and after pics using the Lasting Taupe color on my upper lids, Constant Copper on my upper lids, Neutrogena mineral sheer as a foundation, and Neurogena Healthy Lengths Mascara.</li>
            <li> I got this product to test for BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve never tried a creamy eye shadow, or an eye shadow stick for that matter. The taupe color was promising - it&#x27;s my go-to color and kind of hard to find. OK, the directions say to apply on lid first and then upward. I did this before taking a shower, that way if it looked bad I could wash off immediately. Not in the least! Application was super easy, the stick is rounded at the end, product is creamy and sheer, and it applied very well. Looks great! You can blend right away then it sets. Wears really well: I had tested some on the back of my hand and noticed that water ran off it. That&#x27;s promising. Yet, I didn&#x27;t need special eye makeup remover, it came off with my usual facial cleanser. I&#x27;ve worn it all week and love it! I  highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s easy to apply, wears well, and looks natural. The taupe shade is perfect for light-medium skin. You can enhance your eyes without looking \\&quot;made up\\&quot;. Perfect for daytime. Can&#x27;t wait to try it for a night out, will use more and maybe blend with another color. This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I tried creamy eye shadows before but they always creased and didn&#x27;t stay for too long until I found Neutrogena&#x27;s Crease Proof Eye Shadow.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need a brush and it stays all day. The colors are super pretty although there should make more colors available. Perfect for daily and very easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I found is that if you want to mix it with other colors you can&#x27;t. Other than that, it is a great products and highly recommended.</li>

            <li> I saw this at the drugstore the other day and decided to try it out.  I have not been wearing much eye shadow lately because I definitely have a problem with creasing.  I have found a couple of primers that work, but applying two products takes twice as long as applying one, and I can barely get out of the house on time in the morning as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this is not 100% crease proof; I do see a small amount of creasing after wearing it all day.  However, I typically have a VERY bad creasing problem, even after only a few hours, and this is longer lasting than most other eye shadows I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the darkest color I saw at the store and it is not terribly dramatic; however, it does add a little color to my eyelids and is suitably conservative for my job in a patent law office.  It is very easy to apply although not very blendable.  This product would be best suited to someone (like me) who prefers to use just a single color on her eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wear contact lenses and this seems to work with those.

The primary benefits are convenience in application and removal.  The drawbacks are that it is not 100% crease proof and it&#x27;s not really blendable.</li>
            <li> This shadow is not at all as described. It goes on very cakey and is not smooth at all. It set very quickly and is difficult to blend. My lids are a little wrinkled and the shadow brought emphasis to the wrinkles, I do not recommend spending money on this.</li>
            <li> Tried this because a friend raved about it, and I really liked how it looked on her.

            <li> I got to try this eye shadow from Bzz Agent for free. I really like the easy and smooth application. The tip is rounded, so it is very comfortable and easy to apply. This color - Lasting Taupe is the darkest from all the shades. It is perfect for creating smokey eyes look. The result is very subtle and natural looking eyes. I like it, because I can&#x27;t overdo the color. I like to use it with Constant Cooper shade 40, which I use as a base all over the eye lid. This eye shadow does exactly what it says, because it is absolutely crease proof. It is not too powdery or greasy. I would recommend this for summer, because if you sweat or get water in your eyes it won&#x27;t affect the eyeshadow. The only con is that my eyelids felt a little dry after removing the eye shadow, but I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> cannot see the color at all, except when it creases. I need something matte and compatible with contacts. If you are going to tell me how to write these reviews what is the point</li>
