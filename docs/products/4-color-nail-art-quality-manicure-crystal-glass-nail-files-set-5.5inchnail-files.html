            <li>nice product, fair price...fast shipping!</li>
            <li>They look good too.</li>
            <li>These are good to put in your purse for on-the-go emergencies but not the best for a full on mani.</li>
            <li>These nail files are very cute and sturdy.</li>
            <li>These arrived and looked great, I was very excited.</li>
            <li>I sell nail wraps for a company &amp; these files give the most perfect smooth finish.</li>
            <li>They looked really nice</li>
            <li>I think the design dresses them up, they look nice, and who ever has glass nail files?</li>
            <li>These are okay but not as good as the Cheeky nail files.</li>
            <li>These files are the best, these look do pretty, the price is great and they ship out quickly</li>
            <li>my whole family is enjoying using them and the colors are Awesome, this product showed up in time and we have no complaints !</li>
            <li>I need more for sure!</li>
            <li>Cute</li>
            <li>I already owned a glass nail file set, but thought I would like to get some more, so I ordered these.  </li>
            <li>They are just as cute in person, BUT....  </li>
            <li>They are lovely.</li>
            <li>I brought these because I love flowers</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love these type of files.  </li>
            <li>and I thought they were a pretty good price.  </li>
            <li>The metal files don&#x27;t glide as easily as the glass nail file.</li>
            <li>they fit in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Pretty and does the job!</li>
            <li>and they are really pretty too.</li>
            <li>they are pretty.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>save your money one filing and there done buy real crystal</li>
            <li>The original set that I have is supposed to last forever.  </li>
            <li>I have only used them a few times but so far they are good.</li>
            <li>So we will see how long I can keep these before they will, more than likely, have to be trashed.</li>
            <li>Normally you wouldn&#x27;t give anyone a nail file.</li>
            <li>Something different and pretty to add to your manicure set.</li>
            <li>They only for the first time you use them</li>
            <li>and they work so far.</li>
            <li>These glass nail files work really well, especially, if you have paper-thin nails.  </li>
            <li>Not exactly what I expected, but ok.</li>
            <li>There are areas on them that are smooth and will not file the nail any longer....or at least not properly.  </li>
            <li>The carrying case is a little flimsy, but for the price, I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>

            <li> No sharp edges, and even when nails are thin or brittle it doesn&#x27;t file them too quickly so you can&#x27;t shape your nails.</li>
            <li> I had these for a few weeks now and some parts are too smooth to file my nail down (not just the part with the picture but the other side as well).</li>
            <li> Wore out after a few uses, I have others that have lasted years and only had to buy new ones because I broke them.</li>
            <li> or if they are actually meant to last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to actually file my nails shorter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one or two only a couple of times, and they are already starting to wear down.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever be going back to the other nail files.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long these will last</li>
            <li> Thanks Crazy K&amp;A ^.^</li>
            <li> Waste of my money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for those who have thin nails.  </li>
            <li> Use them like crazy!</li>

            <li> These nail files are very cute and sturdy. They arrived in a timely manner and are just as pictured.</li>
            <li> Cute and they work so far. I have only used them a few times but so far they are good.</li>
            <li> Oh They Work Wonderfully ! my whole family is enjoying using them and the colors are Awesome, this product showed up in time and we have no complaints ! Thanks Crazy K&amp;A ^.^</li>
            <li> I ordered sets of these to put in my daughter and daughter-in-laws Christmas stockings this year...and a set for me too. Something different and pretty to add to your manicure set. I carry one in my purse and have the others on hand at home.</li>
            <li> nice product, fair price...fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I already owned a glass nail file set, but thought I would like to get some more, so I ordered these.  They looked really nice and I thought they were a pretty good price.  They are just as cute in person, BUT....  I&#x27;m not sure how long these will last or if they are actually meant to last very long at all.  The original set that I have is supposed to last forever.  And I have had them for quite a while.  These seem to be almost like an emery board.  I&#x27;ve used one or two only a couple of times, and they are already starting to wear down.  There are areas on them that are smooth and will not file the nail any longer....or at least not properly.  Glass nail files should not wear out in 2-3 uses.  So we will see how long I can keep these before they will, more than likely, have to be trashed.</li>
            <li> Wore out after a few uses, I have others that have lasted years and only had to buy new ones because I broke them.</li>
            <li> They are lovely. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Best nail file I have ever used!!! No sharp edges, and even when nails are thin or brittle it doesn&#x27;t file them too quickly so you can&#x27;t shape your nails.</li>
            <li> These files are the best, these look do pretty, the price is great and they ship out quickly</li>
            <li> They only for the first time you use them and then that will be the last time you will use em. Waste of my money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected, but ok.</li>
            <li> These arrived and looked great, I was very excited. However they lost their grit after one use and weren&#x27;t very effective even before that. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them at all, despite their low price.</li>
            <li> These glass nail files work really well, especially, if you have paper-thin nails.  I would recommend these for those who have thin nails.  I brought these because I love flowers and they are really pretty too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love them. Use them like crazy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> save your money one filing and there done buy real crystal flies these are just glass and trash</li>
            <li> Glass nail files are the best. I actually like to use these files. I&#x27;m also including some as gifts. Normally you wouldn&#x27;t give anyone a nail file. I think the design dresses them up, they look nice, and who ever has glass nail files? The sandpaper type files wear out. The metal files don&#x27;t glide as easily as the glass nail file. I won&#x27;t ever be going back to the other nail files. I think the glass nail files are the best. They look good too. You just don&#x27;t see these sold in stores. I wish the design was on both sides. I will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> These are okay but not as good as the Cheeky nail files. I had these for a few weeks now and some parts are too smooth to file my nail down (not just the part with the picture but the other side as well). It takes a long time to actually file my nails shorter. These are good to put in your purse for on-the-go emergencies but not the best for a full on mani.</li>
            <li> Pretty and does the job!</li>
            <li> These files are amazing!!!! I sell nail wraps for a company &amp; these files give the most perfect smooth finish. I need more for sure! Great price too.</li>
            <li> Arrived before it was supposed to; and the files work like they should. The carrying case is a little flimsy, but for the price, I can&#x27;t really complain.  The files are cute-looking, too.</li>
            <li> I love these type of files.  they fit in my purse.  they are pretty.</li>
