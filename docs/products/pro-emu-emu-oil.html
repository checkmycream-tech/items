            <li>but it&#x27;s good for my husband.</li>
            <li>I notice my skin was not looking as good as it was.</li>
            <li>the quality is good too.</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>really good product for skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried emu oil before but heard it was good for muscle pain.</li>
            <li>To be honest, this is not the best emu oil I&#x27;ve used, but it was better than some I&#x27;ve tried and the price was good.</li>
            <li>Really good product</li>
            <li>#34;So good so far&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The reason I took off one star is because it does not noticeably help with inflammation, acne, e.t.c, instead I find it to be just a really good alternative to lotions that have a million crappy ingredients(even organic ones).  </li>
            <li>My hair and scalp feel great and the wound is healing nicely.</li>
            <li>Good for everything from acne to dandruff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been doing some good to my skin.</li>
            <li>so good.</li>
            <li>Works well and keeps my ears feeling good.</li>
            <li>another thing I bought that I heard was good for your skin and still not used it.  </li>
            <li>I have paid well over $100.00 for a 1 oz bottle of moisturizer and my skin has never looked as good as it has within a week of using this Emu Oil.</li>
            <li>I had good results with that</li>
            <li>I also read that emu oil is good for arthritis pain and tried it.  </li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer, and good for so many things.</li>
            <li>and it has No smell, which is super great!</li>
            <li>I AM VERY PLEASED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>This item is great for many things.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait to write this review until I had used the Emu Oil for a good length of time so that I could provide ALL of the amazing results in this review.  </li>
            <li>Very glad I purchased this oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also appears to be attractive to cats as one of mine has a tendency to lick the applied area.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting, but I make sure he promptly stops.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I bought this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Seems to work great on flea bite scars and goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on face when applied at night, although hydration seems to disappear by morning.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item as described....and honestly the BEST oil I&#x27;ve ever used for my face.</li>
            <li>Smells nice also.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was made in the US as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna be honest:  </li>
            <li>Emu oil is honestly a miracle product to me.</li>
            <li>Bought this item as an ingredient to make my own eczema cream.</li>
            <li>The BEST PART of USING EMU OIL is that it has hydrated my under eye area so much that my concealer and powder no longer cake</li>
            <li>Advice I would give if you were to purchase any kind of emu oil</li>
            <li>The texture is really nice compared to some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and it went away (now to be honest</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I just think that its a nice household staple (i.e., like rubbing alcohol, epson salt, witch hazel, etc.)</li>
            <li>Nice quality lotion.  </li>
            <li>If the price is too good to be true then it probably is!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new convert to the magic &amp; healing power of Emu Oil!!!!.</li>

            <li>THE PRODUCTS CAN DO WILL COME TRUE!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my order and will be coming back to buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t make a great first impression.</li>
            <li>Also a great first aid oil for burns or cuts.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my feet very smooth as well.</li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>Transaction was very smooth.</li>
            <li>Please make this easy to understand and honest.  </li>

            <li>This stuff is magical</li>
            <li>Making very impressive progress with scar care / stretch marks and at this time I&#x27;m only 9 weeks post-op.  </li>
            <li>I got this to try to hep my industrial piercings heal after reading so many things about it.</li>
            <li>Have to order some more; mine is almost gone.</li>
            <li>and I need to use more</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>The downside is that it makes the dog smell very strong and attracts dirt on all her harnesses and collars and it doesn&#x27;t wash out easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the skin and absorbs very fast.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for stretched ears.</li>
            <li>However, it stops the skin from peeling when it gets that dry, so it&#x27;s also awesome for that.</li>
            <li>Good price on a fairly large bottle of emu oil.  </li>
            <li>but I also discovered that it can be used to help heal and moisturize my fresh tattoos it works amazingly well because of its anti-inflammatory properties</li>
            <li>Good quality, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Healed up super fast and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I originally bought this for streaching my ears</li>
            <li>It easily cleaned out, I was just not expecting it.</li>
            <li>Love the product and will be back for more!!</li>
            <li>I am still experimenting with different brands but this one definitely has the best price for being good quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>This seems like a fine product.</li>
            <li>Excellent to soften skin and make wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have started showing fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Used colloidal silver to suppress infection but still had inflammation of the cornea which caused light sensitivity.</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S LIGHT</li>
            <li>American made and it works great</li>
            <li>My doctor said my skin is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It also allows my makeup to go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>both of these topics addressed, it is important to note</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an aggressive smell and seems to be smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and makes my skin look real smooth and</li>
            <li>It is so fantastic</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Since it leaves your skin smooth and supple, you dont get creases etc.</li>
            <li>I use it with my infer skin light and it helps healing factors..</li>
            <li>it worked well enough that I didn&#x27;t have to take a painkiller, which made me happy.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be great for my husband&#x27;s skin for the same reason.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a terrific moisturizer, works great</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far seems good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face, burns and for new moms it works better than most items on the market for chapped nipples</li>
            <li>originally purchased to treat varicose veins.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face to remove makeup in the shower, and I also use it on my feet and it serves perfectly for... other purposes... ;)</li>
            <li>I use it to keep my hands moist and it seems to help with minor cuts (yep my knife wielding in the kitchen sometimes is not that great).  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this item because I read that it was beneficial for treating rosacea.</li>
            <li>The day after I use it does seem to improve the swelling, therefore I haven been trying to be more consistent.</li>
            <li>(although not everyone gets as excited as me).</li>
            <li>stuff is AMAZING for new piercings.</li>
            <li>I put it on a clean, washed face before bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering coconut oil next to try out, but this one is still the best natural oil that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using a saline solution to clean my ear</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to smooth on a face or neck and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come out the bottle fast and it is absorbed by the skin immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave ANY kind of residue and has no ODOR.</li>
            <li>It feels soothing and is able to soak easily into the skin if you don&#x27;t use more than necessary.  </li>
            <li>OK, so how can something be 100% Pure emu oil if it is not?</li>
            <li>I tried everything from salt soaks to special sprays and solutions, noting helped.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this product.</li>
            <li>I honestly have not noticed anything as far as improvement on aging skin with emu oil, but I do notice with inflammation and for burns.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t refrigerate but temp in my dwelling is cool and no sunlight in bathroom.</li>
            <li>Actually makes a good hand moisturizer too.</li>
            <li>the best way to alleviate that problem is to apply at least 1 hr.</li>
            <li>This appears to be a good product, but I think I would prefer a product that is just the emu oil, and not mixed with additives that are not disclosed beforehand.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I read that emu oil is one of the only oils that is good to put on healing piercings.</li>
            <li>The emu oil doesn&#x27;t burn and absorbs into skin pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Whether this is due to the emu oil or the vitamin E in the product, I don&#x27;t know, but it works great for me, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This does a great job at moisturizing and curing chapped skin (regardless of any other extrinsic benefits you may or may not believe in).</li>
            <li>I was able to go on with my day only re applying once more.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly as well.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth out &amp; soft</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs quickly and soothes my irritated skin.</li>
            <li>and this has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I will pay more the next time to get better quality.</li>
            <li>the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the quick service.</li>
            <li>Helps heal quickly.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I used it two days in a row and they were quickly disappearing.</li>
            <li>The appearance of my bare face has some kind of quality to it that it didn&#x27;t have before.  </li>
            <li>I think if you live in a more humid climate, or have oily skin, you will not want to use this as a moisturizer -- but it could be helpful for scarring and skin repair; I&#x27;d try spot-treating first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its helped cure a sudden case of adult acne, imparted a beautiful glow to my skin, smoothed lines, made my eyelashes and eyebrows thicker and softer, and is improving my son&#x27;s stubborn eczema.</li>
            <li>Absorbed so quickly and gives a youthful glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my heat rash last night and this morning it was so much better!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This is the first month in my memory that I haven&#x27;t had some flare up at some point!  </li>
            <li>I use this mostly on my face for fine lines and wrinkles and I must say that I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the year that I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
            <li>It it very light and despite being an oil, it absorbs in very well and leaves the skin silky smooth... yet natural feeling.  </li>
            <li>He wants to complete my surgery as soon as he feels comfortable my skin is healthy again</li>
            <li>It heals sores and cuts fast and it smooth scars.</li>
            <li>It really is amazing, although definitely greasy!  </li>
            <li>It was definitely worth a try though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and it&#x27;s is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>like that this is totally fragrance free and may grow to like it more</li>
            <li>It does not break my out, it is odorless (to me), natural and applicable to more than just your skin (hair too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>i got it to heal a fresh burn.</li>
            <li>I am so happy i found this all natural product that actually works.</li>
            <li>This fixed that better than any cream, lotion or oil</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed without a greasy or shiny look on the skin.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of elbow grease to get it absorbed, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>this is worth knowing about.</li>
            <li>I have tried another companies emu oil &amp; all though it was fresh</li>
            <li>But, do your own your research, then come back and grab a bottle of this brand.</li>
            <li>Just what I expected good night time moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have progressively replaced many of the products I have been using with natural alternatives.  </li>
            <li>Liked it enough that I bought a 1-oz version for traveling.</li>
            <li>it got here pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>It works extremely well on sunburns -- no pain; also good for clearing up stubborn skin rashes.</li>
            <li>, at least works for me, have  not smell so is good for that!</li>
            <li>Vitamin E is good for my skin too, so I don&#x27;t see what some of the other reviewers are so upset about.  </li>
            <li>and it took the burn right out within 1/2 the day.</li>
            <li>it obsorbs right into your skin with out leaving an oil film.  .</li>
            <li>It says right on the bottle that some minuscule amount of Vitamin E has been added as a preservative.  </li>
            <li>and it cleared right up.  </li>
            <li>did use it on my right shoulder one night before bed</li>
            <li>and I was sure that it was going to clog my pores and send me into a major breakout.  </li>
            <li>Best $10 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a long .. very long hard search for the best moisturizer, I am so happy to have found Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li>The only question I&#x27;ve had is how much vitamin E does this 100% pure EMU Oil product contain (read back label) and do the versions without vitamin E work even better!!!</li>
            <li>Great for keeping skin soft and healing dry skin</li>
            <li>I needed a small size Emu oil that I could take with me in my carryon bag when I fly.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it does help with those things a little, but it is not as magical as the description and some reviewers make it out to be.  </li>
            <li>me a huge one because I have 3 new piercings.</li>
            <li>I have gotten one or two blackheads which I think are from using this, but they&#x27;ve been completely on the skin surface and easily removable.</li>
            <li>but I do see a difference natural is better maybe one med benzoyl peroxide clean and clear</li>
            <li>I even used it on my dry skin and honestly i have to say that i prefer coconut oil for that.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple all month.  </li>
            <li>I applied it twice in the past week and she looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>so Ill try my best to update on whether or not it helps with peeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on my face at night and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first one lasted over two years.</li>
            <li>(first purchased Jan 2013)&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and evenig on my face, my skin has never looked better and it has  only been a month.</li>
            <li>Everyone should have a bottle in their homes, especially near the stove!</li>
            <li>I just want to know exactly.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but it was much smaller</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Emu Oil.</li>
            <li>If I get a blackhead from it, I just wait a greater number of nights between my next use, until my face starts to look drier again.</li>
            <li>will come back for more.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The first ingredient was Emu oil.</li>
            <li>this is the same quality I am so glad I found this</li>
            <li>Since this happened, I&#x27;ve been using it more regularly again...</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used Emu oil.</li>
            <li>I had some at first but ran out</li>
            <li>I WILL be ordering more and a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li>will last for many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t need it all the time, so it does last me a while, but the effects it has is astonishing.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy another brand next time to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>and I have under eye wrinkles that become even more obvious with concealer and/or powder.  </li>
            <li>and my feet still feel just as silky as they did when I first applied.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and this actually absorbes better than they do.  </li>
            <li>Had a dog bite and it really helped with the scarring!</li>
            <li>Not only have my lobes returned to their healthy color and are warmer to the touch, but they feel thicker and the stretch scars on the inside have evened out and diminished.</li>
            <li>This stuff is helping so much!</li>
            <li>freshly pierced ears fast and painless.</li>
            <li>outstanding product will definitely order again started working  the first week</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was a bit pricey</li>
            <li>I thought EMU oil was safe for sensitive skin, but I have very sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li>I had no bad reactions to the emu oil and it worked better than any other &amp;#34;certified&amp;#34; agent I had tried to damaged skin.</li>
            <li>my skin feels very smooth when I dry it off.</li>
            <li>Affordable and as good as any overpriced moisturizer that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Nice oil, makes my hands very soft and it lasts a very long time, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either.  </li>
            <li>love this oil on dry eyes &amp; lips</li>
            <li>I used it for troublesome piercings that were always too dry and fell in love.</li>
            <li>This will easily become a staple in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After one week of using this daily on the dog, the hairloss I am trying to regrow is defintely filling in!</li>
            <li>You can apply this to even highly cracked skin and there will not be that same intense stinging you get with most lotions.</li>
            <li>It also helped a large bruise to heel quicker.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Emu Oil (2oz)  </li>
            <li>I got this because it said 100% Pure Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li>But when I received the product and read the ingredient, it is not 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t want this bottle to go rancid before I can use it -</li>
            <li>Pure Emu Oil...</li>
            <li>It worked well and required only one or two drops as it spread easily.&lt;br /&gt;While it appeared oily when applied, it  was absorbed rather quickly and did not stay</li>
            <li>I have fine hair (currently between jaw and shoulder length) and it does not weigh my hair</li>
            <li>I have used this on my very dry skin and love it.</li>
            <li>Works great to hydrate and you can also put a few drops in your regular body lotion!</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>You really cannot put a price on comfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>fast absorbing no greasy feel</li>
            <li>It caused a bump on my forehead that looked like a wart and had me really scared.</li>
            <li>I find this to be very moisterizing and not cloging.</li>
            <li>I used this product after getting a TCA peel and it really helped soothe my skin and control the peeling and flakiness.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought the big size in the white bottle.  </li>
            <li>Without getting into reasons I purchased this product, it absolutely works for healing skin that has sustained injury or trauma.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to like this.</li>
            <li>I use it to stretch my ears and it really speeds up the healing process.</li>
            <li>it works really well and improved my skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>When applied to the skin it absorbs very well, and it has substantially reduced the dryness of my face.</li>
            <li>Since the oil is very &amp;#34;breathable,&amp;#34; I also have not noticed any clogged pores or breakouts when using this.  </li>
            <li>I have very itchy scalp that sometimes hurt at the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It has no smell and it absorb fast, it works well even on combination skin</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement in the 3 months I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>I noticed that within a day or two of applying my friend&#x27;s oil, the skin around my eyes was much healthier looking</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the oil for really anything else</li>
            <li>this product is very soothing and has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It soaks in really fast.  </li>
            <li>I may put in refrigerator and use  it straight out of the fridge.  </li>
            <li>before I was supposed to, and I played with it too much.</li>
            <li>I tried everything to see fast results and nothing worked like Emu oil</li>
            <li>It smoothes lines and wrinkles, and heals blemishes FAST.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t leave much oil residue.</li>
            <li>used this on him for 4 days, one time every night and by the next week the scrapes were gone and his skin was smooth.</li>
            <li>so i dont really use it at all</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it made my face feel and look.  </li>
            <li>really like it because it helps with my acne.</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li>Emu  oil which my brother bought from a Health Food store which worked really well, but</li>
            <li>much the contrary</li>
            <li>I use this on my lips and on my skin, and really like it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give much of a review.</li>
            <li>I put a tiny drop of emu oil in the ends and no frizz, curl is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to the efficacy of the product.</li>
            <li>She has so much hair, the pony tails were causing traction alopecia.  </li>
            <li>Real emu oil is odorless, greaseless and will not stain clothing.</li>
            <li>It absorbs readily into the skin.</li>
            <li>thanks thoguh.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone absolutely.</li>
            <li>fast delivery/shipping..</li>
            <li>I didnt see where it helped anything really.</li>
            <li>If you feel greasy after you use it, you&#x27;re using too much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed since I&#x27;ve been using that my cuticles are much softer and not snagging on stuff, too.  </li>
            <li>I apply it right after my shower and my skin is supple and just looks amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>It is better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used at x3</li>
            <li>It worked 20x better than olive oil, almond oil, honey and all my other branded products.</li>
            <li>originally bought this to use as an eye cream at nite, but I&#x27;ve applied it all over my face the last 2 nites.  </li>
            <li>In the four months I have been using this product I have seen more improvements and ease of healing then with any other product I have used.  </li>
            <li>From the other reviews that guess that this is more vitamin e oil than the label says, I would hazard a guess in that direction as well.  </li>
            <li>But, I am just too darn excited to wait, so all I can report are the immediate results since I&#x27;ve only been using the Emu Oil for five days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used so many other products and someone bumped into Emu Oil from someone reviewing it online.</li>
            <li>Currently using it on a new tattoo and the results are FAR better</li>
            <li>Three years down the line her shell is healthy and whole.</li>
            <li>This oil is really effective on dry skin and especially your feet.</li>
            <li>I have used most of the bottle I received, and while my dry skin is improving, I have some concerns about the direct application of the Vitamin E without knowing the percentage of its content.  </li>
            <li>It has been fantastic for helping a piercing heal, for a minor cut or two, and for skin softening in general&lt;</li>
            <li>I use this for my new piercings and it helps!</li>
            <li>It plumps up any lines you may have and moisturizes better than or as well as anything I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Emu Oil for a couple of years mainly as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with mild to moderate scarring like mine.</li>
            <li>I became aware of EMU oil after my first facial chemical peel (with TCA).  </li>
            <li>I mainly purchased some after piercing my ears and then continuing to stretch them to a 0 gauge.</li>
            <li>I got it mainly</li>
            <li>This makes the emu oil last longer &amp; will not go rancid as quickly.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that it&#x27;s just gradual change for aging process, but other than that the price is fantastic for supposed pure emu oil.</li>
            <li>but I was using the old home remedy for a week by itself, and the ringworm only went away when I added the EMO oil as part as the remedy, and when the spot cleared up, it cleared up \\&quot;pretty\\&quot;, meaning it was no peeling or dryness, now the thing is, the spot where he had the ring worm is smoother, and a better texture (he has pretty skin in the first place) than the other parts of his face (and</li>
            <li>Used this twice a day for two weeks and my feet and heels look great, no more cracked dry heels.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, arrived right away and in good condition, was a bit odd to have such a large box for such a small item, could have put a hundred bottles in it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil along with the Jamaican Castor oil for hair growth.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It applies to the skin very easily -- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is high quality Emu oil.</li>
            <li>After two days of using this product, the piercing became noticeably more tame, and within the last week that I have been using it, the problem is pretty much gone!</li>
            <li>However, I found that using the oil as a spot-treatment on cuts and old breakouts resulted in dramatically reduced redness and much faster healing.</li>
            <li>This oil has no odor really and is a clear, milky color.</li>
            <li>my smile lines, they were not deep</li>
            <li>I intend to continue to use it until the bottle is gone or my skin returns to its normal color.</li>
            <li>My vet said a few days ago that if I hadn&#x27;t mentioned the Alopecia he wouldn&#x27;t have noticed at all, so that is it&#x27;s testimony for sure.</li>
            <li>100% on my right side was gone immediately after 1 application and the left side 80% disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I immediately applied to my feet and it soaked right in with no oily residue, three hours later</li>
            <li>I then dry my hair as usual, and my hair has seen a significant change in the amount of static that occurs throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I bought it primarily for healing the cut on the end of my fingers due to the winter weather.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as if I&#x27;m applying a new layer of skin when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Despite being an oil, it does absorb into your skin fairly quickly and, once it&#x27;s dry, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I am a mertial artist, so my knees are very important, and other martial artists know my pain.</li>
            <li>I am guessing this experience with Emu oil is very rare, just be very careful.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought this for acne relief based upon other reviews of emu oils skin healing abilities.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no offensive smell or taste, and it has never caused me to break out and as far as I know, no negative side effects.</li>
            <li>You will not believe how far one drop goes!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I tried this brand over another and the only issue is the other brand gave you more product for the price.</li>
            <li>However, this is the first and only Emu Oil brand I have tried</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to take this cream to the next level, works well.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;d say those are both small prices to pay to keep the dog&#x27;s fur growing in a healthy way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen, online that people mix emu and sulfur to help grow their hair, but this hasn&#x27;t made my facial hair grow haha!</li>
            <li>I actually saw results after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much of an improvement there is in both those fine lines as well as the overall appearance of my skin and in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I have vulvodynia and needed something to moisturize and smooth the skin down there.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $10, as I&#x27;ve used it 4-5 times a week for several months now and the bottle seems barely touched!</li>
            <li>I bought it originally for my new tat, but find myself using it as a hand moisturizer and other things as well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Just started using so its too early to see any results but its lighter than I expected no bad scent.</li>
            <li>The raw pink parts showing more color and the dark burned parts are lightening up and the skin is more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only a little more than a week.</li>
            <li>The skin all over my face got super flaky and it looked as if it was burned around my mouth due to redness.</li>
            <li>It did not have any kind of bad smell to it which is important.  </li>
            <li>My face is clear and even.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come out clear</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin and leaves it soft and not oily.  </li>
            <li>I was suspicious but have been surprised at the</li>
            <li>It really helps when you&#x27;re trying to get back to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>I use the Emu Oil along with the Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM cream twice daily and find that it is very helpful in relieving arthritic pain in both knees and a foot.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that my bottle says with vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell the scar reduction is permanent and does not require continuous use to maintain.</li>
            <li>I apply it directly to my face at night and on my hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By far</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>and I do not use it near my roots.</li>
            <li>I have a 13 month old with SEVERE eczema and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>I purchased the cream as well, however I use the oil for my face, feet, hands &amp; old</li>
            <li>Not only does it work, it works fast.</li>
            <li>this product is completely non-clogging.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>And a lot faster than sitting around and waiting for them to naturally fade.</li>
            <li>and I think so far</li>
            <li>I recently started using Emu oil, and i really like this one.</li>
            <li>It is the closest to natural skin oil you can get.  </li>
            <li>It can also be rubbed directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have never heard of this stuff before in my life until my 9 month old daughter started developing a bald spot at her edges.  </li>
            <li>, I did use this in conjunction with an old home remedy)</li>
            <li>Her bald spots have grown in completely and the fur is even growing longer than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li>So far I am using it</li>
            <li>Still haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the true benefits but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money spent so far</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil works better for me, and the cost is about 95% less than this!</li>
            <li>I first dry my ear with a q-tip.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my dogs for hot spots, dry skin, rashes and cracked paw pads.</li>
            <li>Almost immediately the heat was off and the skin was not tight at all.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product seems to be very pure and no real odor.  </li>
            <li>After all, we&#x27;re all different little peaches in this basket called Earth!  :)</li>
            <li>I love that it is just one ingredient, well researched, and that it might be helping with inflammation in a really subtle way.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the EMU Oil on my recent tattoo and already it has begun to heal better than any anti-bacterial cream that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a small trade-off for a chemical free natural moisturizer that improves your skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>First I tried it on my hands and they looked younger immediately and the effects lasted 24 hours through hand washings until I next showered.</li>
            <li>but when I saw how little it takes and how far ONE drop will go, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>There are so many variations on the market; and I had a hard time on here, especially, figuring out which variation to get.</li>
            <li>have also recently started to apply it to wet hair after showering due to the amount of static in my hair during the winter.  </li>
            <li>Just recently got a new tattoo, using this product as opposed to the recommended Palmers Cocoa Butter my artist suggested.  </li>
            <li>so I put it on after I shower, let it dry then put on vitamin D cream on after which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very therapeutic for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Still works well but just a bit too thick to come out of bottle easily.</li>
            <li>, it is more a thick white color, although it doesn&#x27;t harden like coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order from this company again once I run out, which shouldn&#x27;t be until the middle of next year if that much!</li>
            <li>I am a super pale redhead</li>
            <li>It does clear up active acne faster for me oily large pores</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have very dry skin and a read that emu oil can be very beneficial.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the little bit of effort for the results</li>
            <li>Other emu oils I have used have been golden, tan, or slightly yellow, thick but flow well, and definitely not sticky but absorb easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and my skin just sucks it</li>
            <li>No odor at all, hasn&#x27;t developed one over several months either.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my edges since it arrived and thus far its working well, just not enough time to see results.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and at my age I get the occasional acne because I have T zone.</li>
            <li>Im not sure it really helped with a burn I got on my face from hot cooking oil splashing,  My scar is still there and visible even after almost one year later</li>
            <li>It is okay for this purpose, but not great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for everyone, I&#x27;m sure, as some people have arthritis worse than others</li>
            <li>Other product I used is what it says, 100% pure emu oil with no vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>normally after I shower and blow dry my hair</li>
            <li>The oil haven&#x27;t really been working for the purpose I bought it for, but I can tell that it works wonders in other aspects.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review because this is my second time ordering this product I ran out a few days ago and my first purchase was in feb!</li>
            <li>could not sleep for 2 days because my skin was so tight and hot.</li>
            <li>I have used the oil everyday twice a day for 2 weeks so far and my skin is healing very well.</li>
            <li>This is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried, but so far my scars are definitely fading.</li>
            <li>(too expensive just to throw out) and have made my own facial night cream.  </li>
            <li>kinda over did it the first time I applied it, and have to say a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li>I did use the Palmers the first day, and it burned a little.  </li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne scarring on small portions of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went with this company because of the cheap price and a year later; due to infrequent use for an allergic skin reaction; I am at about half a bottle.</li>
            <li>I still have some dark circles under the eye, and when you apply it to the face, it is REALLY</li>
            <li>The only thing that really works is extremely diligent continuous application of lotion/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I live in the North and my skin gets very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused a reaction on my very sensitive/combination skin.</li>
            <li>and then they will get a little tender and raw, so I just put a tiny bit of emu oil on them and almost instantly they start to feel better.</li>
            <li>Not much of a scent at all and no reaction with my very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>I thoroughly believe that salt water soaks paired with this oil, or even this oil alone, as long as you are still hygienic while showering/bathing, could entirely replace the use of other popular after piercing care items such as: Antibacterial Dial Soap, Bactine, Hydrogen Peroxide, or any other harsh chemicals or ointments</li>
            <li>Seriously, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this! :D</li>
            <li>I bought this because my tattoo artist recommended it for my new tattoo due to the anti-inflammatory properties of emu oil.</li>
            <li>I have a skin condition an this helps so much to calm it down, a little goes a long way too, seems expensive but not when you see how far it goes, will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>I think if you live in a dry climate or have dry skin, you&#x27;d want to put it on your entire face.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about Emu oil</li>
            <li> , I dont know if this is a good &#x27;brand&#x27; or not, but it did the trick.</li>
            <li> Good product..</li>

            <li> and she loved it</li>

            <li> Good price and quality.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E can be good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> It is defintely good at keeping chapped hands at bay.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good for my husband.</li>
            <li> I notice my skin was not looking as good as it was.</li>
            <li> the quality is good too.</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> really good product for skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried emu oil before but heard it was good for muscle pain.</li>
            <li> To be honest, this is not the best emu oil I&#x27;ve used, but it was better than some I&#x27;ve tried and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Really good product</li>
            <li> #34;So good so far&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The reason I took off one star is because it does not noticeably help with inflammation, acne, e.t.c, instead I find it to be just a really good alternative to lotions that have a million crappy ingredients(even organic ones).  </li>
            <li> My hair and scalp feel great and the wound is healing nicely.</li>
            <li> Good for everything from acne to dandruff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been doing some good to my skin.</li>
            <li> so good.</li>
            <li> Works well and keeps my ears feeling good.</li>
            <li> another thing I bought that I heard was good for your skin and still not used it.  </li>
            <li> I have paid well over $100.00 for a 1 oz bottle of moisturizer and my skin has never looked as good as it has within a week of using this Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> I had good results with that</li>
            <li> I also read that emu oil is good for arthritis pain and tried it.  </li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer, and good for so many things.</li>
            <li> and it has No smell, which is super great!</li>
            <li> I AM VERY PLEASED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> This item is great for many things.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write this review until I had used the Emu Oil for a good length of time so that I could provide ALL of the amazing results in this review.  </li>
            <li> Very glad I purchased this oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also appears to be attractive to cats as one of mine has a tendency to lick the applied area.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting, but I make sure he promptly stops.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I bought this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Smells nice also.</li>
            <li> I liked that it was made in the US as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna be honest:  </li>
            <li> Emu oil is honestly a miracle product to me.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as an ingredient to make my own eczema cream.</li>
            <li> The BEST PART of USING EMU OIL is that it has hydrated my under eye area so much that my concealer and powder no longer cake</li>
            <li> Advice I would give if you were to purchase any kind of emu oil</li>
            <li> The texture is really nice compared to some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and it went away (now to be honest</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I just think that its a nice household staple (i.e., like rubbing alcohol, epson salt, witch hazel, etc.)</li>
            <li> Nice quality lotion.  </li>
            <li> If the price is too good to be true then it probably is!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new convert to the magic &amp; healing power of Emu Oil!!!!.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a wonderful moisturizing oil which is good for many different uses!</li>
            <li> liked the emu oil, will purchase more.    </li>
            <li> So far, I am impressed.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCTS CAN DO WILL COME TRUE!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my order and will be coming back to buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t make a great first impression.</li>
            <li> Also a great first aid oil for burns or cuts.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my feet very smooth as well.</li>
            <li> It is very light</li>
            <li> Transaction was very smooth.</li>
            <li> Please make this easy to understand and honest.  </li>
            <li> I tried Vinegar and Yogurt as well (those helped more then the aloe fyi).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gotta love Amazon prime :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using anything better for sun burn.d&#x27; or not, but it did the trick.</li>

            <li> Pro Emu Oil is truly worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have started using sooner, much better than jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> my favorite oil.</li>
            <li> Better than almond and coconut.</li>
            <li> Update 3 years later:  Still the best oil.</li>
            <li> Better than almond and coconut.</li>
            <li> skin responds to it immediately, but much better after a shower </li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought</li>
            <li> of which I know there are many.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> It worked fabulously!  </li>
            <li> I put it in my hair to moisturize it and it gives it a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I have learned it is better to spend a bit more for a quality product.</li>
            <li> This oil is a magical elixir.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen great results yet but it can&#x27;t hurt to keep trying.</li>
            <li> great to use under the eyes, keeps your skin very well moisturized all day or night</li>
            <li> I keep my fingers crossed he gets better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s fragrance free, and smooths on nicely.  </li>
            <li> I love how this feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> It is a nice light oil for the face and does not clog the pores.</li>
            <li> It made my air so shinny and healthy.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this oil.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for all piercings :)</li>
            <li> It has so many benefits everyone should try it atleast once.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so hydrated and healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I love the spill proof bottle and the way it goes on my face and hands.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to help with the healing of a tattoo that may have otherwise scabbed up and lost more ink than I wanted.</li>
            <li> is to make sure your rub it in.</li>
            <li> Only wish that it was organic, then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> What I bought was what was sent, couldn&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried all types of oils - almond, vitamin e oil, jajaboba oil.. and many face moisturizers - oil of olay (many lines), dr. hauschka, Perricone, and many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful oil.</li>
            <li> Seals in those precious peptide solutions and helps them to penetrate deeper.  </li>
            <li> Use this with your favorite peptides around eyes.  </li>
            <li> And love it.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both really love this oil.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this as a moisturizer for my face.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never had skin issues, my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> If I use it I feel a lot better.  </li>
            <li> Love and swear by this product.</li>
            <li> So, I read through most of the reviews, and if I missed it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> When I mix sulfur and emu oil, I get better results, without the crusty skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical</li>
            <li> Making very impressive progress with scar care / stretch marks and at this time I&#x27;m only 9 weeks post-op.  </li>
            <li> I got this to try to hep my industrial piercings heal after reading so many things about it.</li>
            <li> Have to order some more; mine is almost gone.</li>
            <li> and I need to use more</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> The downside is that it makes the dog smell very strong and attracts dirt on all her harnesses and collars and it doesn&#x27;t wash out easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin and absorbs very fast.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for stretched ears.</li>
            <li> However, it stops the skin from peeling when it gets that dry, so it&#x27;s also awesome for that.</li>
            <li> Good price on a fairly large bottle of emu oil.  </li>
            <li> but I also discovered that it can be used to help heal and moisturize my fresh tattoos it works amazingly well because of its anti-inflammatory properties</li>
            <li> Good quality, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Healed up super fast and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I originally bought this for streaching my ears</li>
            <li> It easily cleaned out, I was just not expecting it.</li>
            <li> Love the product and will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> I am still experimenting with different brands but this one definitely has the best price for being good quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> This seems like a fine product.</li>
            <li> Excellent to soften skin and make wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have started showing fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Used colloidal silver to suppress infection but still had inflammation of the cornea which caused light sensitivity.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S LIGHT</li>
            <li> American made and it works great</li>
            <li> My doctor said my skin is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It also allows my makeup to go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> both of these topics addressed, it is important to note</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an aggressive smell and seems to be smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and makes my skin look real smooth and</li>
            <li> It is so fantastic</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Since it leaves your skin smooth and supple, you dont get creases etc.</li>
            <li> I use it with my infer skin light and it helps healing factors..</li>
            <li> it worked well enough that I didn&#x27;t have to take a painkiller, which made me happy.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would be great for my husband&#x27;s skin for the same reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrific moisturizer, works great</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far seems good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, burns and for new moms it works better than most items on the market for chapped nipples</li>
            <li> originally purchased to treat varicose veins.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face to remove makeup in the shower, and I also use it on my feet and it serves perfectly for... other purposes... ;)</li>
            <li> I use it to keep my hands moist and it seems to help with minor cuts (yep my knife wielding in the kitchen sometimes is not that great).  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item because I read that it was beneficial for treating rosacea.</li>
            <li> The day after I use it does seem to improve the swelling, therefore I haven been trying to be more consistent.</li>
            <li> (although not everyone gets as excited as me).</li>
            <li> stuff is AMAZING for new piercings.</li>
            <li> I put it on a clean, washed face before bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering coconut oil next to try out, but this one is still the best natural oil that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using a saline solution to clean my ear</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to smooth on a face or neck and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t come out the bottle fast and it is absorbed by the skin immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave ANY kind of residue and has no ODOR.</li>
            <li> It feels soothing and is able to soak easily into the skin if you don&#x27;t use more than necessary.  </li>
            <li> OK, so how can something be 100% Pure emu oil if it is not?</li>
            <li> I tried everything from salt soaks to special sprays and solutions, noting helped.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this product.</li>
            <li> I honestly have not noticed anything as far as improvement on aging skin with emu oil, but I do notice with inflammation and for burns.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t refrigerate but temp in my dwelling is cool and no sunlight in bathroom.</li>
            <li> Actually makes a good hand moisturizer too.</li>
            <li> the best way to alleviate that problem is to apply at least 1 hr.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a good product, but I think I would prefer a product that is just the emu oil, and not mixed with additives that are not disclosed beforehand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I read that emu oil is one of the only oils that is good to put on healing piercings.</li>
            <li> The emu oil doesn&#x27;t burn and absorbs into skin pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Whether this is due to the emu oil or the vitamin E in the product, I don&#x27;t know, but it works great for me, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This does a great job at moisturizing and curing chapped skin (regardless of any other extrinsic benefits you may or may not believe in).</li>
            <li> I was able to go on with my day only re applying once more.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth out &amp; soft</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly and soothes my irritated skin.</li>
            <li> and this has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> I will pay more the next time to get better quality.</li>
            <li> the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the quick service.</li>
            <li> Helps heal quickly.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I used it two days in a row and they were quickly disappearing.</li>
            <li> The appearance of my bare face has some kind of quality to it that it didn&#x27;t have before.  </li>
            <li> I think if you live in a more humid climate, or have oily skin, you will not want to use this as a moisturizer -- but it could be helpful for scarring and skin repair; I&#x27;d try spot-treating first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its helped cure a sudden case of adult acne, imparted a beautiful glow to my skin, smoothed lines, made my eyelashes and eyebrows thicker and softer, and is improving my son&#x27;s stubborn eczema.</li>
            <li> Absorbed so quickly and gives a youthful glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my heat rash last night and this morning it was so much better!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first month in my memory that I haven&#x27;t had some flare up at some point!  </li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my face for fine lines and wrinkles and I must say that I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the year that I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
            <li> It it very light and despite being an oil, it absorbs in very well and leaves the skin silky smooth... yet natural feeling.  </li>
            <li> He wants to complete my surgery as soon as he feels comfortable my skin is healthy again</li>
            <li> It heals sores and cuts fast and it smooth scars.</li>
            <li> It really is amazing, although definitely greasy!  </li>
            <li> It was definitely worth a try though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy and it&#x27;s is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> like that this is totally fragrance free and may grow to like it more</li>
            <li> It does not break my out, it is odorless (to me), natural and applicable to more than just your skin (hair too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> i got it to heal a fresh burn.</li>
            <li> I am so happy i found this all natural product that actually works.</li>
            <li> This fixed that better than any cream, lotion or oil</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed without a greasy or shiny look on the skin.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of elbow grease to get it absorbed, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> this is worth knowing about.</li>
            <li> I have tried another companies emu oil &amp; all though it was fresh</li>
            <li> But, do your own your research, then come back and grab a bottle of this brand.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected good night time moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have progressively replaced many of the products I have been using with natural alternatives.  </li>
            <li> Liked it enough that I bought a 1-oz version for traveling.</li>
            <li> it got here pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well on sunburns -- no pain; also good for clearing up stubborn skin rashes.</li>
            <li> , at least works for me, have  not smell so is good for that!</li>
            <li> Vitamin E is good for my skin too, so I don&#x27;t see what some of the other reviewers are so upset about.  </li>
            <li> and it took the burn right out within 1/2 the day.</li>
            <li> it obsorbs right into your skin with out leaving an oil film.  .</li>
            <li> It says right on the bottle that some minuscule amount of Vitamin E has been added as a preservative.  </li>
            <li> and it cleared right up.  </li>
            <li> did use it on my right shoulder one night before bed</li>
            <li> and I was sure that it was going to clog my pores and send me into a major breakout.  </li>
            <li> Best $10 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a long .. very long hard search for the best moisturizer, I am so happy to have found Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li> The only question I&#x27;ve had is how much vitamin E does this 100% pure EMU Oil product contain (read back label) and do the versions without vitamin E work even better!!!</li>
            <li> Great for keeping skin soft and healing dry skin</li>
            <li> I needed a small size Emu oil that I could take with me in my carryon bag when I fly.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it does help with those things a little, but it is not as magical as the description and some reviewers make it out to be.  </li>
            <li> me a huge one because I have 3 new piercings.</li>
            <li> I have gotten one or two blackheads which I think are from using this, but they&#x27;ve been completely on the skin surface and easily removable.</li>
            <li> but I do see a difference natural is better maybe one med benzoyl peroxide clean and clear</li>
            <li> I even used it on my dry skin and honestly i have to say that i prefer coconut oil for that.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple all month.  </li>
            <li> I applied it twice in the past week and she looks amazing!  </li>
            <li> so Ill try my best to update on whether or not it helps with peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my face at night and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first one lasted over two years.</li>
            <li> (first purchased Jan 2013)&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and evenig on my face, my skin has never looked better and it has  only been a month.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have a bottle in their homes, especially near the stove!</li>
            <li> I just want to know exactly.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but it was much smaller</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Emu Oil.</li>
            <li> If I get a blackhead from it, I just wait a greater number of nights between my next use, until my face starts to look drier again.</li>
            <li> will come back for more.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> The first ingredient was Emu oil.</li>
            <li> this is the same quality I am so glad I found this</li>
            <li> Since this happened, I&#x27;ve been using it more regularly again...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Emu oil.</li>
            <li> I had some at first but ran out</li>
            <li> I WILL be ordering more and a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> will last for many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t need it all the time, so it does last me a while, but the effects it has is astonishing.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy another brand next time to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> and I have under eye wrinkles that become even more obvious with concealer and/or powder.  </li>
            <li> and my feet still feel just as silky as they did when I first applied.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and this actually absorbes better than they do.  </li>
            <li> Had a dog bite and it really helped with the scarring!</li>
            <li> Not only have my lobes returned to their healthy color and are warmer to the touch, but they feel thicker and the stretch scars on the inside have evened out and diminished.</li>
            <li> This stuff is helping so much!</li>
            <li> freshly pierced ears fast and painless.</li>
            <li> outstanding product will definitely order again started working  the first week</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was a bit pricey</li>
            <li> I thought EMU oil was safe for sensitive skin, but I have very sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li> I had no bad reactions to the emu oil and it worked better than any other &amp;#34;certified&amp;#34; agent I had tried to damaged skin.</li>
            <li> my skin feels very smooth when I dry it off.</li>
            <li> Affordable and as good as any overpriced moisturizer that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Nice oil, makes my hands very soft and it lasts a very long time, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either.  </li>
            <li> love this oil on dry eyes &amp; lips</li>
            <li> I used it for troublesome piercings that were always too dry and fell in love.</li>
            <li> This will easily become a staple in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After one week of using this daily on the dog, the hairloss I am trying to regrow is defintely filling in!</li>
            <li> You can apply this to even highly cracked skin and there will not be that same intense stinging you get with most lotions.</li>
            <li> It also helped a large bruise to heel quicker.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Emu Oil (2oz)  </li>
            <li> I got this because it said 100% Pure Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li> But when I received the product and read the ingredient, it is not 100% pure.  </li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t want this bottle to go rancid before I can use it -</li>
            <li> Pure Emu Oil...</li>
            <li> It worked well and required only one or two drops as it spread easily.&lt;br /&gt;While it appeared oily when applied, it  was absorbed rather quickly and did not stay</li>
            <li> I have fine hair (currently between jaw and shoulder length) and it does not weigh my hair</li>
            <li> I have used this on my very dry skin and love it.</li>
            <li> Works great to hydrate and you can also put a few drops in your regular body lotion!</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> You really cannot put a price on comfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> fast absorbing no greasy feel</li>
            <li> It caused a bump on my forehead that looked like a wart and had me really scared.</li>
            <li> I find this to be very moisterizing and not cloging.</li>
            <li> I used this product after getting a TCA peel and it really helped soothe my skin and control the peeling and flakiness.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought the big size in the white bottle.  </li>
            <li> Without getting into reasons I purchased this product, it absolutely works for healing skin that has sustained injury or trauma.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to like this.</li>
            <li> I use it to stretch my ears and it really speeds up the healing process.</li>
            <li> it works really well and improved my skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> When applied to the skin it absorbs very well, and it has substantially reduced the dryness of my face.</li>
            <li> Since the oil is very &amp;#34;breathable,&amp;#34; I also have not noticed any clogged pores or breakouts when using this.  </li>
            <li> I have very itchy scalp that sometimes hurt at the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It has no smell and it absorb fast, it works well even on combination skin</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement in the 3 months I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that within a day or two of applying my friend&#x27;s oil, the skin around my eyes was much healthier looking</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the oil for really anything else</li>
            <li> this product is very soothing and has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It soaks in really fast.  </li>
            <li> I may put in refrigerator and use  it straight out of the fridge.  </li>
            <li> before I was supposed to, and I played with it too much.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to see fast results and nothing worked like Emu oil</li>
            <li> It smoothes lines and wrinkles, and heals blemishes FAST.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t leave much oil residue.</li>
            <li> used this on him for 4 days, one time every night and by the next week the scrapes were gone and his skin was smooth.</li>
            <li> so i dont really use it at all</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it made my face feel and look.  </li>
            <li> really like it because it helps with my acne.</li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> Emu  oil which my brother bought from a Health Food store which worked really well, but</li>
            <li> much the contrary</li>
            <li> I use this on my lips and on my skin, and really like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give much of a review.</li>
            <li> I put a tiny drop of emu oil in the ends and no frizz, curl is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to the efficacy of the product.</li>
            <li> She has so much hair, the pony tails were causing traction alopecia.  </li>
            <li> Real emu oil is odorless, greaseless and will not stain clothing.</li>
            <li> It absorbs readily into the skin.</li>
            <li> thanks thoguh.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone absolutely.</li>
            <li> fast delivery/shipping..</li>
            <li> I didnt see where it helped anything really.</li>
            <li> If you feel greasy after you use it, you&#x27;re using too much.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed since I&#x27;ve been using that my cuticles are much softer and not snagging on stuff, too.  </li>
            <li> I apply it right after my shower and my skin is supple and just looks amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> It is better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used at x3</li>
            <li> It worked 20x better than olive oil, almond oil, honey and all my other branded products.</li>
            <li> originally bought this to use as an eye cream at nite, but I&#x27;ve applied it all over my face the last 2 nites.  </li>
            <li> In the four months I have been using this product I have seen more improvements and ease of healing then with any other product I have used.  </li>
            <li> From the other reviews that guess that this is more vitamin e oil than the label says, I would hazard a guess in that direction as well.  </li>
            <li> But, I am just too darn excited to wait, so all I can report are the immediate results since I&#x27;ve only been using the Emu Oil for five days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used so many other products and someone bumped into Emu Oil from someone reviewing it online.</li>
            <li> Currently using it on a new tattoo and the results are FAR better</li>
            <li> Three years down the line her shell is healthy and whole.</li>
            <li> This oil is really effective on dry skin and especially your feet.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the bottle I received, and while my dry skin is improving, I have some concerns about the direct application of the Vitamin E without knowing the percentage of its content.  </li>
            <li> It has been fantastic for helping a piercing heal, for a minor cut or two, and for skin softening in general&lt;</li>
            <li> I use this for my new piercings and it helps!</li>
            <li> It plumps up any lines you may have and moisturizes better than or as well as anything I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Emu Oil for a couple of years mainly as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with mild to moderate scarring like mine.</li>
            <li> I became aware of EMU oil after my first facial chemical peel (with TCA).  </li>
            <li> I mainly purchased some after piercing my ears and then continuing to stretch them to a 0 gauge.</li>
            <li> I got it mainly</li>
            <li> This makes the emu oil last longer &amp; will not go rancid as quickly.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that it&#x27;s just gradual change for aging process, but other than that the price is fantastic for supposed pure emu oil.</li>
            <li> but I was using the old home remedy for a week by itself, and the ringworm only went away when I added the EMO oil as part as the remedy, and when the spot cleared up, it cleared up \\&quot;pretty\\&quot;, meaning it was no peeling or dryness, now the thing is, the spot where he had the ring worm is smoother, and a better texture (he has pretty skin in the first place) than the other parts of his face (and</li>
            <li> Used this twice a day for two weeks and my feet and heels look great, no more cracked dry heels.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, arrived right away and in good condition, was a bit odd to have such a large box for such a small item, could have put a hundred bottles in it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil along with the Jamaican Castor oil for hair growth.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It applies to the skin very easily -- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is high quality Emu oil.</li>
            <li> After two days of using this product, the piercing became noticeably more tame, and within the last week that I have been using it, the problem is pretty much gone!</li>
            <li> However, I found that using the oil as a spot-treatment on cuts and old breakouts resulted in dramatically reduced redness and much faster healing.</li>
            <li> This oil has no odor really and is a clear, milky color.</li>
            <li> my smile lines, they were not deep</li>
            <li> I intend to continue to use it until the bottle is gone or my skin returns to its normal color.</li>
            <li> My vet said a few days ago that if I hadn&#x27;t mentioned the Alopecia he wouldn&#x27;t have noticed at all, so that is it&#x27;s testimony for sure.</li>
            <li> 100% on my right side was gone immediately after 1 application and the left side 80% disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I immediately applied to my feet and it soaked right in with no oily residue, three hours later</li>
            <li> I then dry my hair as usual, and my hair has seen a significant change in the amount of static that occurs throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I bought it primarily for healing the cut on the end of my fingers due to the winter weather.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if I&#x27;m applying a new layer of skin when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Despite being an oil, it does absorb into your skin fairly quickly and, once it&#x27;s dry, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I am a mertial artist, so my knees are very important, and other martial artists know my pain.</li>
            <li> I am guessing this experience with Emu oil is very rare, just be very careful.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had originally bought this for acne relief based upon other reviews of emu oils skin healing abilities.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no offensive smell or taste, and it has never caused me to break out and as far as I know, no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> You will not believe how far one drop goes!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I tried this brand over another and the only issue is the other brand gave you more product for the price.</li>
            <li> However, this is the first and only Emu Oil brand I have tried</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to take this cream to the next level, works well.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;d say those are both small prices to pay to keep the dog&#x27;s fur growing in a healthy way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen, online that people mix emu and sulfur to help grow their hair, but this hasn&#x27;t made my facial hair grow haha!</li>
            <li> I actually saw results after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much of an improvement there is in both those fine lines as well as the overall appearance of my skin and in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have vulvodynia and needed something to moisturize and smooth the skin down there.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $10, as I&#x27;ve used it 4-5 times a week for several months now and the bottle seems barely touched!</li>
            <li> I bought it originally for my new tat, but find myself using it as a hand moisturizer and other things as well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just started using so its too early to see any results but its lighter than I expected no bad scent.</li>
            <li> The raw pink parts showing more color and the dark burned parts are lightening up and the skin is more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a little more than a week.</li>
            <li> The skin all over my face got super flaky and it looked as if it was burned around my mouth due to redness.</li>
            <li> It did not have any kind of bad smell to it which is important.  </li>
            <li> My face is clear and even.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come out clear</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin and leaves it soft and not oily.  </li>
            <li> I was suspicious but have been surprised at the</li>
            <li> It really helps when you&#x27;re trying to get back to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> I use the Emu Oil along with the Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM cream twice daily and find that it is very helpful in relieving arthritic pain in both knees and a foot.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that my bottle says with vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell the scar reduction is permanent and does not require continuous use to maintain.</li>
            <li> I apply it directly to my face at night and on my hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By far</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> and I do not use it near my roots.</li>
            <li> I have a 13 month old with SEVERE eczema and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cream as well, however I use the oil for my face, feet, hands &amp; old</li>
            <li> Not only does it work, it works fast.</li>
            <li> this product is completely non-clogging.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> And a lot faster than sitting around and waiting for them to naturally fade.</li>
            <li> and I think so far</li>
            <li> I recently started using Emu oil, and i really like this one.</li>
            <li> It is the closest to natural skin oil you can get.  </li>
            <li> It can also be rubbed directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have never heard of this stuff before in my life until my 9 month old daughter started developing a bald spot at her edges.  </li>
            <li> , I did use this in conjunction with an old home remedy)</li>
            <li> Her bald spots have grown in completely and the fur is even growing longer than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> So far I am using it</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the true benefits but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money spent so far</li>
            <li> Extra virgin olive oil works better for me, and the cost is about 95% less than this!</li>
            <li> I first dry my ear with a q-tip.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my dogs for hot spots, dry skin, rashes and cracked paw pads.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately the heat was off and the skin was not tight at all.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product seems to be very pure and no real odor.  </li>
            <li> After all, we&#x27;re all different little peaches in this basket called Earth!  :)</li>
            <li> I love that it is just one ingredient, well researched, and that it might be helping with inflammation in a really subtle way.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the EMU Oil on my recent tattoo and already it has begun to heal better than any anti-bacterial cream that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a small trade-off for a chemical free natural moisturizer that improves your skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> First I tried it on my hands and they looked younger immediately and the effects lasted 24 hours through hand washings until I next showered.</li>
            <li> but when I saw how little it takes and how far ONE drop will go, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> There are so many variations on the market; and I had a hard time on here, especially, figuring out which variation to get.</li>
            <li> have also recently started to apply it to wet hair after showering due to the amount of static in my hair during the winter.  </li>
            <li> Just recently got a new tattoo, using this product as opposed to the recommended Palmers Cocoa Butter my artist suggested.  </li>
            <li> so I put it on after I shower, let it dry then put on vitamin D cream on after which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very therapeutic for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Still works well but just a bit too thick to come out of bottle easily.</li>
            <li> , it is more a thick white color, although it doesn&#x27;t harden like coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Will definitely order from this company again once I run out, which shouldn&#x27;t be until the middle of next year if that much!</li>
            <li> I am a super pale redhead</li>
            <li> It does clear up active acne faster for me oily large pores</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have very dry skin and a read that emu oil can be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the little bit of effort for the results</li>
            <li> Other emu oils I have used have been golden, tan, or slightly yellow, thick but flow well, and definitely not sticky but absorb easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and my skin just sucks it</li>
            <li> No odor at all, hasn&#x27;t developed one over several months either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my edges since it arrived and thus far its working well, just not enough time to see results.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and at my age I get the occasional acne because I have T zone.</li>
            <li> Im not sure it really helped with a burn I got on my face from hot cooking oil splashing,  My scar is still there and visible even after almost one year later</li>
            <li> It is okay for this purpose, but not great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for everyone, I&#x27;m sure, as some people have arthritis worse than others</li>
            <li> Other product I used is what it says, 100% pure emu oil with no vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> normally after I shower and blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> The oil haven&#x27;t really been working for the purpose I bought it for, but I can tell that it works wonders in other aspects.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review because this is my second time ordering this product I ran out a few days ago and my first purchase was in feb!</li>
            <li> could not sleep for 2 days because my skin was so tight and hot.</li>
            <li> I have used the oil everyday twice a day for 2 weeks so far and my skin is healing very well.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried, but so far my scars are definitely fading.</li>
            <li> (too expensive just to throw out) and have made my own facial night cream.  </li>
            <li> kinda over did it the first time I applied it, and have to say a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> I did use the Palmers the first day, and it burned a little.  </li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne scarring on small portions of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went with this company because of the cheap price and a year later; due to infrequent use for an allergic skin reaction; I am at about half a bottle.</li>
            <li> I still have some dark circles under the eye, and when you apply it to the face, it is REALLY</li>
            <li> The only thing that really works is extremely diligent continuous application of lotion/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I live in the North and my skin gets very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused a reaction on my very sensitive/combination skin.</li>
            <li> and then they will get a little tender and raw, so I just put a tiny bit of emu oil on them and almost instantly they start to feel better.</li>
            <li> Not much of a scent at all and no reaction with my very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> I thoroughly believe that salt water soaks paired with this oil, or even this oil alone, as long as you are still hygienic while showering/bathing, could entirely replace the use of other popular after piercing care items such as: Antibacterial Dial Soap, Bactine, Hydrogen Peroxide, or any other harsh chemicals or ointments</li>
            <li> Seriously, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this! :D</li>
            <li> I bought this because my tattoo artist recommended it for my new tattoo due to the anti-inflammatory properties of emu oil.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition an this helps so much to calm it down, a little goes a long way too, seems expensive but not when you see how far it goes, will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I think if you live in a dry climate or have dry skin, you&#x27;d want to put it on your entire face.</li>
            <li> I then squeeze a small drop of the oil onto the end of a new q-tip and gently deposit the oil onto one opening of my piercing and repeat the process for the other opening(s).  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m getting LESS new acne overall since using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s little more expensive than other oils although I don&#x27;t have to use very much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit really goes a long way</li>
            <li> My other emu oil, which I am nearly out of, does NOT cause this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trouble is, I bought it to deal with skin irritation and this falls short when compared to a New Zealand brand I bought at the same time.</li>
            <li> It has been mixed with Vitamin E, not sure how much Emu Oil is in this product.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy though but it absorbs decently after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased pure emu oil as a pain reliever for arthritis in the past because it works well.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it wasn&#x27;t working due to my allergic reaction not clearing up within a day or two like I had imagined, but all in all it took a few applications almost daily (or about 2 weeks time) to see results and it stopped the irritation.</li>
            <li> and although I can&#x27;t speak for how it affects my dark marks directly...</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s reducing redness as much as I&#x27;d like, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> the 2oz  size actually lasts a really long time for me.</li>
            <li> Emu oil has helped me to regrow a front piece of hair I burned with highlights and a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I currently use dessert palms fully refined emu oil and have been using it for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to post results.  </li>
            <li> Can be left on your head for long periods of time without fear of it damaging the  brain.</li>
            <li> I have lived in a very dry climate for a while, and I think I am finally getting enough moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not found that it is particularly long lasting, or that less frequent applications (compared to lotion) will keep the knuckles moist longer.</li>
            <li> I used this on three of my piercings with those little piercing bubbles and after some waiting, they went away completely!</li>
            <li> I started using it for dry skin and red patchiness that I get from ulcerative colitis flar up.</li>
            <li> It is able to moisturize without cutting off proper air circulation or causing any irritations.  </li>
            <li> Again, I have only used this for five days, so I am very hopeful that with continued use I will see less and less wrinkles there.  </li>
            <li> I spot treat and do not use on entire face as this product does tend to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used it around my eyes, which are middle aged and starting to show wrinkles and under-eye bags.  </li>
            <li> Instead it left me baby soft skin, I apply it everyday and my skin has visably improved.</li>
            <li> I get instant, long lasting relief with the other one but not with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it dried my skin out so bad that when I smiled I looked like I was fifty years old</li>
            <li> It makes sensitive areas, like my face and hands, break out in small red bumps.  </li>
            <li> I have stretched ears and every now</li>
            <li> I also use it on minor burns, sunburns, windburns, etc.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and it soaks in and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It worried me for a long time</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a long</li>
            <li> The 2nd time I applied it I mixed it with the banana boat aftersun lotion and that cut the wetness/glisten/oily-ness factor in half.</li>
            <li> This bottle goes a long way and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this oil for the first week, but I used it after a chemical peel and felt like it was doing a decent job of keeping my skin moist, so I kept using it.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other night mixed with my retin-a.</li>
            <li> I have read other similar products can smell rancid.</li>
            <li> The other nights I do my regular skin care routine.</li>
            <li> All I know is there are two other brands that set the standard (for me anyway) in emu oil.</li>
            <li> it is not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; like my other facial oils.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year and will not go back to any other face moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to my friends; if they have problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry knuckles in the winter.</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a nurse and have really dry skin from washing my hands all the time.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and my skin loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hair as I have seriously dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It has also cleared up a couple of dry spots in one application.</li>
            <li> Used to have really dry skin</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, it rubs in all the way.</li>
            <li> Now I use it on my dry nails, my elbows, anywhere that needs moisturizing.</li>
            <li> As I age the backs of my hands tend to look dry and crepey.</li>
            <li> I made my hair so dry and greasy and funky.</li>
            <li> Tried this for a dry skin area.</li>
            <li> When I would clean my ears I would have this weird brown stuff in my ears.</li>
            <li> It helps them not get dry.</li>
            <li> Also, I would not recommend on the inside of the hands, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well as lotion and leaves your hands slippery for longer than a normal lotion, so it can be hard to handle your phone or steering</li>
            <li> To start, I will let you know that I have medium skin (not dry or oily) and have recently suffered from small hormonal breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a week now, and her skin is baby soft once again and no more itchies.</li>
            <li> At the suggestion of another review I also put it in hot water to thin it out</li>
            <li> Have used on piercings too, has helped to keep them loose.  </li>
            <li> Since then it has calmed down to next to nothing</li>
            <li> I pat at the brow bone and enough migrates down to affect the lid.  </li>
            <li> The true test will be next fall/winter when the air gets really cold and dry here in the Nor&#x27;east.</li>
            <li> My skin never got overly dry!</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery and am still a little swollen (1 month post op) I have been using on and off for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Only a little bit of oil is needed.  </li>
            <li> bad most of it gets wiped off on my pillow.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it may have been a fluke and a few weeks later after just two applicatons</li>
            <li> I am not real fond of gloves in the kitchen and for cleaning and gardening so this helps with keeping moisure in.</li>
            <li> I put it all over, including carefully blending under my eyes and around the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Had heard a few years back that emu oil would make your eye lashes thicker and grow longer I have been using this about a month</li>
            <li> In a few weeks the chewing stopped and his coat is growing back</li>
            <li> I just use it sparingly and massage my scalp for a few minutes and it&#x27;s instant relief.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended me the oil for some pains I&#x27;ve been having on my hands the last few months.</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised and it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> My reconstruction plastic surgen asked me what I was using because the skin is healing faster than he expected.</li>
            <li> Ingredient performed as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The skin is still rough where it used to be, but there&#x27;s no sign of eczema and absolutely no itching.</li>
            <li> Terrific product that few people know about.</li>
            <li> really no problems...used it after my jessner&#x27;s peel, and it did help.  </li>
            <li> My nose piercing healed faster than expected and it helps soothe my cartilage piercings as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a volunteer use this on patients at the chemo infusion center.  </li>
            <li> Not large amount</li>
            <li> Truly helps with severely dry hands due to my medications I&#x27;m on for lupus!</li>
            <li> You can use a little and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Of course, you can use this anywhere, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> My bare face looked dull before and now it does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is thicker than other emu oil brands.  </li>
            <li> other products like aloe</li>
            <li> Other brands I have purchased have had a rancid smell where this was is virtually odorless.</li>
            <li> Only takes a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I still need to use it with other pain medications.  </li>
            <li> I needed to restore a bald spot on the front of my head due to wearing tree braids.</li>
            <li> No smell whatsoever like some other brands</li>
            <li> and I do not have an opinion on its comparison to other brands.</li>
            <li> I did not realise all the other uses but works for what I needed</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who got a skin rash due to an allergy to something from the ground as well as to side effects from medications, his doctors prescribed, and I&#x27;m just going by what he said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to explore some of the other uses for emu oil, and thank my friend for introducing me to it.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day to decrease the inflammation and aid in regrowing the hair that was pulled out from the braids.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face and hair for about 3 weeks, but not consistently.</li>
            <li> Blended well with the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was suprised that it didnt leave an oily/greasy feeling like other products Ive tried.</li>
            <li> Any other parents worried about their kids eczema should buy this.</li>
            <li> work well for that, although it may work well for other skin problems.</li>
            <li> This Emu oil i found out is also used for other skin conditions..</li>
            <li> It was delivered in the middle of a snowstorm, so I&#x27;m not sure if the climate had anything to do with it.  </li>
            <li> usually I get them after doing a peel, and I&#x27;ve done nothing different but use this emu oil ever night on cleaned skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes all other oils sink in to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I also use a little to moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Stops the itchies on your dry skin!!!  </li>
            <li> Also, it cleared up a nasty burn pretty quickly</li>
            <li> took a soap less shower to get rid of the other products and slathered this stuff on.</li>
            <li> Maybe the opposite of dull.  </li>
            <li> It is thin and doesn&#x27;t last long, that is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Only complaint</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is the price.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my skin dark discolorations.  </li>
            <li> It lightens all my dark sun spots without clogging pores.  </li>
            <li> because I read it could fade away dark spots (age + sun), not changes there yet</li>
            <li> But I need concealer to cover up the dark circles and powder to set it so the concealer doesn&#x27;t just slide down my face.  </li>
            <li> This oil is really thin and runny, slightly sticky, and clear.  </li>
            <li> I thought with it being an oil it would at least slightly clog pores especially with my acne prone oily skin.</li>
            <li> It helped my swelling go down</li>
            <li> and I never peeled and toned down the redness</li>
            <li> With Emu oil (and other things!)</li>
            <li> I actually got this oil for my fawn Doberman, who has very dry skin and thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I looked online for other remedies and came across a few posts about EMU OIL.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference in a few minutes, unlike other OTC pain meds that seem to take forever.  </li>
            <li> I recently had a really bad breakout and started using this 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Panoxyl bar to get rid of it, I used it for four days straight</li>
            <li> Slight burn on my arms...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so burnt on my arms, just slightly-</li>
            <li> I have not noticed less arthritis though</li>
            <li> I WILL CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS STATES</li>
            <li> Though skeptical, I rubbed some on my lower middle back.  </li>
            <li> The vet tried to load me up on expensive shampoo&#x27;s and such and I remembered that they used Emu oil on her skin/hair at a groomer several years ago.  </li>
            <li> and wrinkles were less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I am going to start using on my edges with my Jamaican Black Castor Oil and see if some growth returns.</li>
            <li> A fellow Black Belt at my academy has a lot of issues with their knees and they tild me about it and how it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I also use it with my black Jamaican oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not - as a matter of fact, my skin has been less oily since I&#x27;ve been using it, no break-outs at all</li>
            <li> This cuts healing time for scrapes and scars in half.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use it on my face unless the skin is very dry, because it leaves a little bit of grease even if you rub it in a lot.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive for the size, but worth the price.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it after my scalp suffered trauma from braids that were too tight.</li>
            <li> wish I would of known of the emu oil before hand, although expensive I would of ultimately saved money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> I noticed this one was a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> a VERY small amount will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It works a little.  </li>
            <li> I have also used this whenever my little ones have a scratch or bruise.  </li>
            <li> Takes just a little bit to make a difference for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first product (aside from prescription-strength cortisone, which has only a temporary effect and is terrible for the body) that I&#x27;ve found that actually heals eczema.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update #2: It has been a little over a month since I started using this product to help combat hairloss on my dachshund.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll take the little help I can get when it comes to the aches of arthritis.  </li>
            <li> Put a few drops of Emu Oil in the eye at night and could feel near-instant relief of pain.</li>
            <li> Hoping to stretch a few of them, and this is what the Piercing Bible recommended to use to help that process along.</li>
            <li> When this arrived it wasn&#x27;t liquid but a heavy like consistency which puzzled me.  </li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of this with the Timless brand Hyaluronic serum, add in a drop or two of organic rosehip oil and put it all on at night.</li>
            <li> I am addicted and so is my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my face before I shower and</li>
            <li> I will use it for a few months to see if it resolves my issue.</li>
            <li> For me it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on and had plenty to spare.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got two very bad bites on my right hand and left wrist.</li>
            <li> It might be my imagination but even feel like my lines are less noticable!</li>
            <li> I ordered it instead of my usual because the price was less, to try it.</li>
            <li> She and her husband are farmers and use it for stiff joints and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i bought this product for my hair but the oil is a little to thick which causes my hair to weigh down</li>
            <li> Needless to say I had a massive sunburn all down my legs, face and on my chest.</li>
            <li> I JUST STARTED USING IT PAST FEW WEEKS.</li>
            <li> I have been using this to see if it could slow down the aging process.  </li>
            <li> and I mix with emu oil plus apple cider vinegar for Amin or 5 and a raw honey on face</li>
            <li> It helps heal and makes scaring less visible, it heals your skin in just a few uses!!</li>
            <li> Since he&#x27;s been on chemo, the least little irritation will cause these marks.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that when it gets too bad, and they start to crack, applying lotion really burns.</li>
            <li> At night I mix a small amount with my moisturizer and apply to my face.</li>
            <li> I also apply a small amount on my thinning eye brows and it appears to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which one.</li>
            <li> Not sure but will continue to use to see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone and fades away small lines.  </li>
            <li> (yes, that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed usually)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I use it sparingly as the bottle is not very big.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is the &amp;#34;anti-inflammatory&amp;#34; properties of the oil or if it is just the moisture it provides to my skin, but I have seen some relief.</li>
            <li> not sure if i believe the certification on it, sounds made up but worked alright</li>
            <li> A friend told me about emu oil, and gave me a small sample to try.  </li>
            <li> I had a real bad scar on the top of my feet</li>
            <li> Its small</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on and my pain goes away; there&#x27;s no better feeling than the lack of pain.</li>
            <li> (I usually always have at least a few), and no more clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Does not penetrate the surface of the skin, just sits there like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> But there was a small problem.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if the affect I am looking for on the dog&#x27;s fur will be as postitive as I&#x27;m hoping for, but the psoriasis on my scalp is not flaking today...</li>
            <li> She told me it had worked wonders for her piercings in the past, and I had been having a troublesome piercing where sea salt soaks, tea tree oil, and chamomile tea soaks were not working.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small bottle for $5</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it helps with inflammation, but has no scent.</li>
            <li> I use this oil both alone and in combination with coconut and shea butter hard</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m too chicken, and too vain to do my entire face at once!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the bites were swollen, red and they itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair loses and burns.</li>
            <li> and I have honestly never been happier.  </li>
            <li> In my experience it will also help clear an infection in a piercing and reduce painful or aesthetically unpleasing scar tissue around the piercing site.  </li>
            <li> I applied it every night for about a month to the ugly, itchy eczema I&#x27;ve had on one foot for years, and it has completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> but know it is thick consistency and doesn&#x27;t go on like an oil.</li>
            <li> Very little goes a looooong way!</li>
            <li> It also accelerated healing time for other random cuts and scrapes and it softened my hair.  </li>
            <li> Two months ago I came down with a really bad case of dermatitis due to stress.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I had oozing rashes in the back of my legs, arms and the back of my neck with terrible swelling, itching and burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely serious that this has outperformed them all.</li>
            <li> Emu oil has helped tremendously to heal my ears and prevent that nasty &amp;#34;piercing smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It smells a little weird, and the color of the liquid is grayish but it DOES work</li>
            <li> I actually had a bad reaction to this.</li>
            <li> Jojoba would get sticky and essentially glue the plugs to my ears, very hard and painful to remove them.</li>
            <li> Then I realized that it was due to the cold weather.  </li>
            <li> For one, I didn&#x27;t believe this would work, I thought it was no more than a plecebo, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> So I was stupid enough to sit out in the sun for 5 hours without reapplying sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Now I am confused.  </li>
            <li> That is poor quality control if that is the case.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I have stretched earlobes at 1&amp;#34;, and they have poor circulation, causing them to turn purpleish and get very cold.</li>
            <li> This is my 10th tattoo, and while I still get some peeling, it doesn&#x27;t seem as bad as my previous tattoos.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my sons&#x27; legs as he has very bad eczema on his legs that left his legs looking like it was healing from a scrape, but never healed!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It helps with the scarring, has lasted at least 6 months, and is helping me keep this embarrassing, painful, frustrating disease under control.</li>
            <li> In this economy I think you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the ingredients on the expensive face cream I used to buy.</li>
            <li> but it helps with all this but still not perfect</li>
            <li> I use this for a lot of random stuff.</li>
            <li> When all else fails, try this.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this if it would help at all.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s so darn expensive</li>
            <li> I believe turning jewelry increases the chances of you bringing a dirty section into the wound, introducing bacteria.  </li>
            <li> BTW, this oil does get condensed in a cold room.</li>
            <li> it flakes like crazy and itches something fierce.  </li>
            <li> My very skeptical husband tried it on his knee.  </li>
            <li> so I know I didn&#x27;t just get a bad bottle</li>
            <li> yep bad skin</li>
            <li> scar was really bad itchy and flaky now after almost a month is almost unseen</li>
            <li> Now my piercings never hurt or got too bad, they just wouldn&#x27;t heal.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this as recommended by my stylist, I no longer have a painful crown.</li>
            <li> I use it for painful joints.  </li>
            <li> I used this product on my hair, my face and my knee (knee pain) and have seen no results with my hair or knee :(  </li>
            <li> I hate emu oil, it is not for me.</li>
            <li> It was insane.</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell awful but still smells and performs like emu oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a horrible time keeping my cuticles in shape but this has helped that, too.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have noticed impovements on my skin after two days!</li>
            <li> Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this Emu oil because I suffer from Hidradenitis Supparitiva. I&#x27;ve heard good things about Emu oil however it didn&#x27;t work for my specific needs. It was definitely worth a try though.</li>
            <li> This product meet all of my expectations. I would recommend this to my friends; if they have problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had originally bought this for acne relief based upon other reviews of emu oils skin healing abilities. While it did not function as an acne cure, it does work for me as a healing accelerant.    I have oily skin which is prone to breakouts. Unfortunately, using this product on my entire face clogged my pores and created more breakouts. However, I found that using the oil as a spot-treatment on cuts and old breakouts resulted in dramatically reduced redness and much faster healing. Whether this is due to the emu oil or the vitamin E in the product, I don&#x27;t know, but it works great for me, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent for piercings</li>
            <li> This is thicker than other emu oil brands.  Still works well but just a bit too thick to come out of bottle easily.</li>
            <li> Emu oil was recommended by a Dr. to help healing after surgery.  I used it for arthritis in my knees and hands.  It worked very well. It does not leave an oily feeling . It did not help my lower back. It also helped a large bruise to heel quicker.</li>
            <li> So I was stupid enough to sit out in the sun for 5 hours without reapplying sunscreen. Needless to say I had a massive sunburn all down my legs, face and on my chest. Slight burn on my arms... I am a super pale redhead fyi.&lt;br /&gt;I put aloe, solarcaine as well as banana boat after sun lotion trying to kill the burn. I tried Vinegar and Yogurt as well (those helped more then the aloe fyi).&lt;br /&gt;I could not sleep for 2 days because my skin was so tight and hot. It was insane. I looked online for other remedies and came across a few posts about EMU OIL. I had it overnighted. Gotta love Amazon prime :)&lt;br /&gt;I took a soap less shower to get rid of the other products and slathered this stuff on. Almost immediately the heat was off and the skin was not tight at all. Seriously. It was amazing. I was able to go on with my day only re applying once more. I wasn&#x27;t so burnt on my arms, just slightly- and it took the burn right out within 1/2 the day. I dont tan but I have &#x27;color&#x27; on my arms now whereas I wouldn&#x27;t normally.&lt;br /&gt;Now my legs and chest are red-red, and it did help take the redness away but its not totally gone. But its only been a day.&lt;br /&gt;With other products like aloe It seems like I am reapplying numerous countless times. Within the 2 days prior I went though an entire tube of aloe, an 3/4 of a bottle of solarcaine and sleepless nights.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would of known of the emu oil before hand, although expensive I would of ultimately saved money in the long run. You really cannot put a price on comfort.&lt;br /&gt;I kinda over did it the first time I applied it, and have to say a little goes a loooong way. The 2nd time I applied it I mixed it with the banana boat aftersun lotion and that cut the wetness/glisten/oily-ness factor in half. I have only been using it for about 24 hours now so Ill try my best to update on whether or not it helps with peeling. But I think it will. Even my lobster red legs and cheast are supple.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this, I dont know if this is a good &#x27;brand&#x27; or not, but it did the trick. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything better for sun burn.d&#x27; or not, but it did the trick. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything better for sun burn.</li>
            <li> This is the best oil that I&#x27;ve used on my skin. It&#x27;s not too greasy and it&#x27;s is easily absorbed into the skin. It also has healing properties. I never want to be without this oil.</li>
            <li> I left my contacts in for four weeks - got an eye infection. Used colloidal silver to suppress infection but still had inflammation of the cornea which caused light sensitivity. Put a few drops of Emu Oil in the eye at night and could feel near-instant relief of pain. Slept great. Woke up with eye feeling great and had zero light-senstiivity.</li>
            <li> works great for sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Good product..Other brands I have purchased have had a rancid smell where this was is virtually odorless.</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry knuckles in the winter. I have tried several things to manage the problem. The only thing that really works is extremely diligent continuous application of lotion/moisturizer. The problem is that when it gets too bad, and they start to crack, applying lotion really burns. Enter EMU-OIL! You can apply this to even highly cracked skin and there will not be that same intense stinging you get with most lotions. That is the best use for it. I have not found that it is particularly long lasting, or that less frequent applications (compared to lotion) will keep the knuckles moist longer. Also, I would not recommend on the inside of the hands, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well as lotion and leaves your hands slippery for longer than a normal lotion, so it can be hard to handle your phone or steering wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried to use as a facial moisturizer, as I read some reviews about people having the darkness under their eyes disappear, and having 70 year olds looking 20 again.... YMMV, as that was not my experience at all. I still have some dark circles under the eye, and when you apply it to the face, it is REALLY shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you want moist knuckles, and/or a shiny face, this is the product for you</li>
            <li> I love this product. I work with a lot of allergies and can use this product. It is also good for burns I have found.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil fast absorbing no greasy feel no odor I use as a facial moisturizer at night. The true test will be next fall/winter when the air gets really cold and dry here in the Nor&#x27;east.</li>
            <li> I actually had a bad reaction to this. I thought EMU oil was safe for sensitive skin, but I have very sensitive skin and rosacea. It caused a bump on my forehead that looked like a wart and had me really scared. It went away so I thought it may have been a fluke and a few weeks later after just two applicatons I got another bump like the one before this time on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave this product to a friend who did not have the same issues so I know I didn&#x27;t just get a bad bottle and she loved it it seems to be a quality product. I am guessing this experience with Emu oil is very rare, just be very careful.</li>
            <li> i use it for all kinds of things. Even for hemorrhoid. I read online that it works for hemorrhoid so i tried it and it helps</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a week now and i love it. I&#x27;m using it on my face at night and my skin is soft and smooth. I find this to be very moisterizing and not cloging. Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this product. It might be my imagination but even feel like my lines are less noticable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the quality and price.  It works extremely well on sunburns -- no pain; also good for clearing up stubborn skin rashes. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Emu Oil . . . originally purchased to treat varicose veins. Sometimes use along with Calendula&lt;br /&gt;and Arnica Gell. Works great alone too .. .  Love it. Also used it for joint pain. It&#x27;s very effective.  Only takes a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one lasted over two years. In fact, I&#x27;m still working on it.. (first purchased Jan 2013)&lt;br /&gt;Got 2 this time so I could give one to my sister. She used mine for knee pain and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought as a suggestion from the Piercing Bible.  Just recently got a new tattoo, using this product as opposed to the recommended Palmers Cocoa Butter my artist suggested.  This is my 10th tattoo, and while I still get some peeling, it doesn&#x27;t seem as bad as my previous tattoos.  I did use the Palmers the first day, and it burned a little.  The emu oil doesn&#x27;t burn and absorbs into skin pretty easily. It&#x27;s also virtually odorless.  Have used on piercings too, has helped to keep them loose.  Hoping to stretch a few of them, and this is what the Piercing Bible recommended to use to help that process along.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It absorbs into the skin and leaves it soft and not oily.  I was pleased.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Emu Oil (2oz)  I love this oil. I use it every morning and evenig on my face, my skin has never looked better and it has  only been a month. This oil is so wonderful it obsorbs right into your skin with out leaving an oil film.  .</li>
            <li> Great oil for skin. Moisturizer and stops itching skin. No allergic reaction with this product.</li>
            <li> I started to see some growth around hair line and eyebrows.  Also good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality. It absorbs well, and softens hands, feet and elbows. I use it on my face a couple of times a week also, noting that it seems to absorb overnight and results in great looking skin.</li>
            <li> I swear by emu oil for cuts, burns, and even flaky skin on my face from too many beauty products or weather changes. It is a miracle product. Everyone should have a bottle in their homes, especially near the stove!</li>
            <li> I got this because it said 100% Pure Emu Oil.  But when I received the product and read the ingredient, it is not 100% pure.  It has been mixed with Vitamin E, not sure how much Emu Oil is in this product.</li>
            <li> So far seems good.  I honestly have not noticed anything as far as improvement on aging skin with emu oil, but I do notice with inflammation and for burns.  I am hoping that it&#x27;s just gradual change for aging process, but other than that the price is fantastic for supposed pure emu oil.</li>
            <li> I use this on chapped hands and faces in the winter for my kids in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I use it every other night mixed with my retin-a. It works great at adding the much needed moisture. It goes on smooth and my skin just sucks it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, too!</li>
            <li> Used this twice a day for two weeks and my feet and heels look great, no more cracked dry heels.</li>
            <li> I have used emu oil before and this product has a perfect consistency And amount.  It is AEA certified as well.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST EMU OILS I HAVE USED. MY BOTTLES ARE CERTIFIED AND IT HAS VITAMIN-E AS A PRESERVATIVE. I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING THAT CAN GET RANCID ON MY FACE. I AM VERY PLEASED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I used this product after getting a TCA peel and it really helped soothe my skin and control the peeling and flakiness. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law swears by emu oil. She and her husband are farmers and use it for stiff joints and as a moisturizer. I was suspicious but have been surprised at the how well it works.  It also has no smell. I have read other similar products can smell rancid.</li>
            <li> I have psoriases and bought this on the advice of several people.  Nothing seems to eliminate it completely, but this product eliminated the red, scarred look and it is much harder to detect my psoriasis.  I liked it so much that I bought the big size in the white bottle.  The only question I&#x27;ve had is how much vitamin E does this 100% pure EMU Oil product contain (read back label) and do the versions without vitamin E work even better!!!</li>
            <li> My mom and I both use this for arthritis.  Her knees, my shoulder.  We both love it.  You can feel the difference in a few minutes, unlike other OTC pain meds that seem to take forever.  It really helps when you&#x27;re trying to get back to sleep at night.  However I still need to use it with other pain medications.  Odorless, and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Without getting into reasons I purchased this product, it absolutely works for healing skin that has sustained injury or trauma. I had no bad reactions to the emu oil and it worked better than any other &amp;#34;certified&amp;#34; agent I had tried to damaged skin. I use this once it the morning and once at night and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I use this Emu Oil for when I do my at-home TCA 20% peel from Skin Obsession (I&#x27;m too chicken, and too vain to do my entire face at once!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The properties in this oil are wonderful and healthy for your skin.  Very glad I purchased!  I used this 3 x/day after the TCA peel, and for the following 2 days, twice each day.  And then I used it about once a day until peel was over (7 - 8 days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have it on hand for whenever I feel I need extra moisture at night.  Love it!!  So glad I have it on hand!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time.  I  haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I expect it to work as well as the Emu Oil I currently have.</li>
            <li> This oil is really effective on dry skin and especially your feet. At night I mix a small amount with my moisturizer and apply to my face. I also apply a small amount on my thinning eye brows and it appears to work. The price is affordable too. In this economy I think you cannot go wrong. So many products are over priced and don&#x27;t work. This one does. I mix the oil with my regular body lotion after I shower. You don&#x27;t need to use much. My skin is no longer dry and itchy. You need to use this on a regular basis for results. I faithfully use it daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product intially for a post Jessner peel. I started using it for dry skin and red patchiness that I get from ulcerative colitis flar up. This stuff seems to relieve the skin condition within a day. I&#x27;m also a nurse and have really dry skin from washing my hands all the time. I apply this oil every night to my hands and heels everynight. my hands and heels look great now!</li>
            <li> Two months ago I came down with a really bad case of dermatitis due to stress. I had oozing rashes in the back of my legs, arms and the back of my neck with terrible swelling, itching and burning. None of the prescription medications were of any help until I found emu oil on the internet. Immediately I ordered this product and I&#x27;m glad I did. Not only did it give immediate soothing relief; but within 24hrs. I saw incredible improvement and within 4 days the dermatitis was gone completely. I am now using it for flare-ups of arthritis in my left knee as well as cuts, burns and mosquito bites. INCREDIBLE STUFF - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! Deserves 10 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I use the Emu Oil along with the Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM cream twice daily and find that it is very helpful in relieving arthritic pain in both knees and a foot.  I will not go without either one.</li>
            <li> This seems like a fine product. I ordered it instead of my usual because the price was less, to try it. Other product I used is what it says, 100% pure emu oil with no vitamin E.  I noticed this one was a little thicker.  I was surprised that my bottle says with vitamin E.  The picture of this one does not say with vitamin E, although it says .000022% in Amazon contents lengthy description on page.     Now I am confused.  OK, so how can something be 100% Pure emu oil if it is not? Vitamin E can be good too. I get it that the emu oil you are using is 100% emu oil, however, I just want to know, of the 100% of liquid product in this bottle, what percentage is emu oil and what is vitamin E?  For instance, 99% emu oil and 1%  vitamin E. Please make this easy to understand and honest.  It may be perfectly acceptable I just want to know exactly. I might order it again once I know. Reason for 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use after chemical peels. It is gentle on the skin and a little goes a long way. It is a bit greasy though but it absorbs decently after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Unconventional use for this. I made a paste of this Emu oil and miconozole nitrate and treated shell rot in a rescue box turtle. Daily for three months. Worked beautifully. Three years down the line her shell is healthy and whole.</li>
            <li> It is thin and doesn&#x27;t last long, that is why I gave it 3 stars. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I also brought some from Skin Obsession 4 months and still have some. The reason why I brought this Emu oil was because I couldn&#x27;t find my Skin Obsession bottle after moving.</li>
            <li> When this arrived it wasn&#x27;t liquid but a heavy like consistency which puzzled me.  Then I realized that it was due to the cold weather.  After a while it changed to the liquid form I was expecting.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but it was much smaller then I thought</li>
            <li> I have been using this Emu Oil for a couple of years mainly as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s very gentle and hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused a reaction on my very sensitive/combination skin. I mix a few drops of this with the Timless brand Hyaluronic serum, add in a drop or two of organic rosehip oil and put it all on at night. During the day, I just use the serum alone b/c I find the oils are too oily under makeup. All of these products combined together work well for me, even in the winter months.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Emu Oil. Initially, I got it for my hair. I needed to restore a bald spot on the front of my head due to wearing tree braids. My hair follicles were greatly damaged and I loss about 2 inches of hair in the front of my head. (I&#x27;ve been wearing wigs as a protective style.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a video on You Tube that said Emu Oil is great for restoring hair. But, I&#x27;m also using it for my skin and face. I got two very bad bites on my right hand and left wrist. The bites were either from a spider or ant bite. I&#x27;m not sure which one. But the bites were swollen, red and they itch like crazy. After putting Emu Oil on, the swelling went away by the next day. The itchiness stopped.The day after - all the redness and soreness disappeared, and there&#x27;s no visible scars. I LOVE EMU OIL! Only complaint - it&#x27;s little more expensive than other oils although I don&#x27;t have to use very much to get the job done. I&#x27;m a new convert to the magic &amp; healing power of Emu Oil!!!!.</li>
            <li> Not sure but will continue to use to see if it makes a difference.Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this product, no funky smell, and the 2oz  size actually lasts a really long time for me. I am writing this review because this is my second time ordering this product I ran out a few days ago and my first purchase was in feb!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face to remove makeup in the shower, and I also use it on my feet and it serves perfectly for... other purposes... ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no offensive smell or taste, and it has never caused me to break out and as far as I know, no negative side effects. This is a perfect oil all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the price. My lordy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Emu Oil. I have stretched ears and every now and then they will get a little tender and raw, so I just put a tiny bit of emu oil on them and almost instantly they start to feel better. I also use it on minor burns, sunburns, windburns, etc. It&#x27;s a really great, moisturizing, healing, and protecting product. It&#x27;s almost as if I&#x27;m applying a new layer of skin when I put it on. I got my order on time and in great condition. I am very happy with my order and will be coming back to buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> This goes on non-greasy, non-sticky and absorbs well. I love this product. I use it on my face, neck, décolletage, hands, elbows, knees. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this emu oil.  I put a drop in my hand and use it with my face lotion every morning.</li>
            <li> No smell.. I like this brand the best of the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to like this. It seems like a quality product being certified and everything. The trouble is, I bought it to deal with skin irritation and this falls short when compared to a New Zealand brand I bought at the same time. I get instant, long lasting relief with the other one but not with this.&lt;br /&gt;I like that this is totally fragrance free and may grow to like it more but it didn&#x27;t make a great first impression.</li>
            <li> A little bit really goes a long way so it&#x27;ll last you quite some time. I use it to stretch my ears and it really speeds up the healing process. I even use it for any scrapes or cuts I may get from work.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, arrived right away and in good condition, was a bit odd to have such a large box for such a small item, could have put a hundred bottles in it. I have a skin condition an this helps so much to calm it down, a little goes a long way too, seems expensive but not when you see how far it goes, will definitely order more. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil along with the Jamaican Castor oil for hair growth.</li>
            <li> This oil is a cure all!  I used it on my face, hands, body and hair.  I have sometimes oily skin and this does not cause break outs, it actually helps heal them!  It also accelerated healing time for other random cuts and scrapes and it softened my hair.  I am addicted and so is my teenage daughter.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I used this on three of my piercings with those little piercing bubbles and after some waiting, they went away completely! Even some scarring a piercer said would always be there!</li>
            <li> Feels nice on face when applied at night, although hydration seems to disappear by morning.  Will continue to use it and see how it goes</li>
            <li> I bought this after my doctor recommend it for my bumpy arms (a type of eczema) called keratosis pilaris.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise it works really well and improved my skin almost immediately.  There is no odor to it so I put it on after I shower, let it dry then put on vitamin D cream on after which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is a wondeful multi-purpose product.  It did not have any kind of bad smell to it which is important.  I use it to keep my hands moist and it seems to help with minor cuts (yep my knife wielding in the kitchen sometimes is not that great).  I have not noticed less arthritis though but maybe in time I will feel a difference.  It is defintely good at keeping chapped hands at bay.  I am not real fond of gloves in the kitchen and for cleaning and gardening so this helps with keeping moisure in. I feel this product does the job well and am pleased with the effectiveness of it.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with acne scarring. I have mild to moderate acne scarring on small portions of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of amazing. I put it on a clean, washed face before bed. I put it all over, including carefully blending under my eyes and around the corners of my eyes. I wake up the next morning and my face just glows all day. Overnight it reduces scarring. As far as I can tell the scar reduction is permanent and does not require continuous use to maintain. I&#x27;ve had a reduction in discoloration and an increase in skin texture quality and smoothness. My face feels AMAZING to the touch the morning after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly my face hasn&#x27;t looked better in years. I have lived in a very dry climate for a while, and I think I am finally getting enough moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this 1-3 times a week. The other nights I do my regular skin care routine. I treat it sort of like you would treat a hair mask - an extra moisturization that I use as-needed. I&#x27;ve found that if I use it too often, my face does become too oily. I have gotten one or two blackheads which I think are from using this, but they&#x27;ve been completely on the skin surface and easily removable. Can&#x27;t tell they were there. If I get a blackhead from it, I just wait a greater number of nights between my next use, until my face starts to look drier again. And I&#x27;m getting LESS new acne overall since using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with mild to moderate scarring like mine. I think if you live in a dry climate or have dry skin, you&#x27;d want to put it on your entire face. I think if you live in a more humid climate, or have oily skin, you will not want to use this as a moisturizer -- but it could be helpful for scarring and skin repair; I&#x27;d try spot-treating first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best - xo</li>
            <li> Makes the skin on my face and chest break out but it&#x27;s good for my husband. Also, it cleared up a nasty burn pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Excellent to soften skin and make wrinkles less noticeable.  I use it s for my elbows face and hair.  I purchased the smaller containers for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this. I just can&#x27;t run out of it.  It evens out my skin tone and fades away small lines.  It faded a way my smile lines, they were not deep but it was there.  It cleared up my skin dark discolorations.  When I stopped using it I notice my skin was not looking as good as it was.</li>
            <li> You will not believe how far one drop goes!  This is some amazing oil!  I had no idea it would be this good!</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!! Order this NOW!!!!!!! Works perfectly for any type of skin irritation, itching, lesions, cuts, rashes.... EVERYTHING It worked for me in 3 days!!!!!!!!!!! UGH!!!!! Get this!</li>
            <li> Had heard a few years back that emu oil would make your eye lashes thicker and grow longer I have been using this about a month and I do believe it is working!</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing. Zero fragrance. I&#x27;m using it to prevent stretch marks, only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Truly helps with severely dry hands due to my medications I&#x27;m on for lupus! Love the product and will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> It has been fantastic for helping a piercing heal, for a minor cut or two, and for skin softening in general&lt;br /&gt;It has no fragrance, and though you must remember to shake the bottle well before squeezing out a few&lt;br /&gt;drops (yes, that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed usually) it&#x27;s worth the little bit of effort for the results&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to know - it lasts!  I thought 2oz would be gone in a flash but I&#x27;m still using it 6 mos. on!</li>
            <li> I JUST STARTED USING IT PAST FEW WEEKS. I LOVE THE SHINE IT GIVES TO MY HAIR. I WILL CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS STATES THE PRODUCTS CAN DO WILL COME TRUE!! NO ODOR AND IT&#x27;S LIGHT</li>
            <li> I needed a small size Emu oil that I could take with me in my carryon bag when I fly.  This one has not leaked and it is under the size that the airline allows.  I am a believer in Emu oil and the benefits it has for my skin.  I don&#x27;t want to do without it when I travel!</li>
            <li> Wow! Pro Emu Oil is truly worthwhile. It quieted the inflammation from a skin blemish that kept recurring over two years and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> This item is great for many things. I put a few drops on my face before I shower and my skin feels very smooth when I dry it off. I also use it for foot pain at night and it helps with the tingling I have in my feet and it keeps my feet very smooth as well. It has no scent and I would highly recommended.</li>
            <li> for emu oil this is a very good price. the quality is good too. will come back for more. thanks!</li>
            <li> American made and it works great</li>
            <li> I like the product. I tried this brand over another and the only issue is the other brand gave you more product for the price. Same oil in the bottle though. Shipped quickly as well.</li>
            <li> will try again for the piercing, since that is why I bought it.  maybe it will work well for anti aging skin treatment or sunburns, as it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I could not discern that it eased my back discomfort at all, although I used it religiously for several days.</li>
            <li> Perfect for stretched ears. Wish I would have started using sooner, much better than jojoba oil. Jojoba would get sticky and essentially glue the plugs to my ears, very hard and painful to remove them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the ingredients on the expensive face cream I used to buy. The first ingredient was Emu oil. So I thought, why not just buy Emu oil and stop giving these people $55 a jar!? This oil has no odor really and is a clear, milky color. I apply it directly to my face at night and on my hands. It plumps up any lines you may have and moisturizes better than or as well as anything I&#x27;ve previously used. This oil has not made me breakout at all and I have been using it for several months. I have combination skin. Purchase this!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about Emu oil to help counter skin damage from radiation treatment.  My doctor said my skin is fantastic.  I use with Remedy.  The quality of this product seems to be very pure and no real odor.  Tried coconut oil and it burned my skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from male pattern baldness, and since I&#x27;ve been using emu oil on my scalp, i&#x27;ve actually experianced some hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> No odor at all, hasn&#x27;t developed one over several months either. I don&#x27;t refrigerate but temp in my dwelling is cool and no sunlight in bathroom. Cleared resistant dermatitis in ears to manageable level after *years* of trying to find something from my dermatologist that worked. Actually makes a good hand moisturizer too. Definitely will keep some on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item as described....and honestly the BEST oil I&#x27;ve ever used for my face. It&#x27;s rich, absorbs beautifully yet not greasy.. .</li>
            <li> I have been paying twice the price from a shop that is supposed to help cancer survivors this is the same quality I am so glad I found this</li>
            <li> I suffered from severe acne two years ago. It was terrible. Since then it has calmed down to next to nothing and now I am just left with the scarring. I just recently started using this and although I can&#x27;t speak for how it affects my dark marks directly... this is a moisturizer that makes my skin feel hydrated all night until I wake up in the morning and apply a thinner layer again after my shower. It is better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used at x3 the price so I do recommend this to anyone. It does not break my out, it is odorless (to me), natural and applicable to more than just your skin (hair too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;By far my favorite oil. I&#x27;m ordering coconut oil next to try out, but this one is still the best natural oil that I&#x27;ve tried. I recently had a really bad breakout and started using this 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Panoxyl bar to get rid of it, I used it for four days straight and it dried my skin out so bad that when I smiled I looked like I was fifty years old (I&#x27;m 19). It freaked me out and I could not go out in public for the next two days. The skin all over my face got super flaky and it looked as if it was burned around my mouth due to redness. (Nothing against Panoxyl because I do think it works, I just used it too intensely with a harsh exfoliating scrub.) Low and behold I had some of this emu oil left to save me from this trauma. It was the only moisturizer I had that soothed the dryness. It worked 20x better than olive oil, almond oil, honey and all my other branded products. I applied a generous layer on my face before bed and let it absorb for a moment before applying Aquaphor all over it to seal it in. It took only two days and nights of this before my skin was hydrated enough for me to be out in public again. Since this happened, I&#x27;ve been using it more regularly again... and I gotta say I look GOOD. Maybe it has to do with the unintentional face-peel I did... but I look so well-rested. After I try out coconut oil, I&#x27;ll probably come back to this. I can&#x27;t imagine something else working so well with my acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3 years later:&lt;br /&gt;Still the best oil. Better than almond and coconut. Great for hair. I bought a giant size and gave 4oz to the girls in my family for christmas. There&#x27;s nothing else like it.I can&#x27;t imagine something else working so well with my acne prone skin.    Update 3 years later:  Still the best oil. Better than almond and coconut. Great for hair. I bought a giant size and gave 4oz to the girls in my family for christmas. There&#x27;s nothing else like it.</li>
            <li> I used this for my dog who was chewing off his beautiful fur. In a few weeks the chewing stopped and his coat is growing back</li>
            <li> Wow but everybodies different It does clear up active acne faster for me oily large pores and I use jojoba oil with it drink water Water water and I mix with emu oil plus apple cider vinegar for Amin or 5 and a raw honey on face yep bad skin but it helps with all this but still not perfect but I do see a difference natural is better maybe one med benzoyl peroxide clean and clear</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and my skin loves this stuff. I apply it right after my shower and my skin is supple and just looks amazingly soft. Unfortunately I use it sparingly as the bottle is not very big.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Emu oil. I originally purchased this item because I read that it was beneficial for treating rosacea. I am not sure if it is the &amp;#34;anti-inflammatory&amp;#34; properties of the oil or if it is just the moisture it provides to my skin, but I have seen some relief. When applied to the skin it absorbs very well, and it has substantially reduced the dryness of my face. It also allows my makeup to go on smoothly.  I use this oil both alone and in combination with coconut and shea butter hard lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also recently started to apply it to wet hair after showering due to the amount of static in my hair during the winter.  I then dry my hair as usual, and my hair has seen a significant change in the amount of static that occurs throughout the day. I have fine hair (currently between jaw and shoulder length) and it does not weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With both of these topics addressed, it is important to note a VERY small amount will go a long way.  The amount I use for my hair  is smaller than the size of a pea and I do not use it near my roots. The amount I use for my face is about the size of a pea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a wonderful moisturizing oil which is good for many different uses!</li>
            <li> Great oil. My wife uses it for her scalp.  Especially when her hair is braided.  Smells nice also. Good product.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $10, as I&#x27;ve used it 4-5 times a week for several months now and the bottle seems barely touched! This is a great oil -- transparent, non greasy, soaks in in seconds and does a very nice job. I bought it originally for my new tat, but find myself using it as a hand moisturizer and other things as well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The Pro Emu Oil is a great product!  It applies to the skin very easily -- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This has been a wonderful oil for my tattoos. It&#x27;s the perfect thing to use for your healing skin. This EMU OIL will forever be my go to. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have a 13 month old with SEVERE eczema and this does the trick. I only have to apply once a day at bedtime and by morning it is noticeably improved. I&#x27;ve been using a week now, and her skin is baby soft once again and no more itchies. No smell whatsoever like some other brands</li>
            <li> liked the emu oil, will purchase more.    It is a great moisturizer, and good for so many things.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cream as well, however I use the oil for my face, feet, hands &amp; old tats.&lt;br /&gt;M skin responds to it immediately, but much better after a shower </li>
            <li> I used this product on my hair, my face and my knee (knee pain) and have seen no results with my hair or knee :(  BUT,  I mixed it with shea butter, coconut oil, etc. (too expensive just to throw out) and have made my own facial night cream.  My face is clear and even.  Thus, the three rating.</li>
            <li> really good product for skin, at least works for me, have  not smell so is good for that! thank you!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an aggressive smell and seems to be smooth but I don&#x27;t know if it works as yet. Need time. The package arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, burns and for new moms it works better than most items on the market for chapped nipples</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried emu oil before but heard it was good for muscle pain. People with Fibromyalgia have a LOT of pain so I gave it a try.  I liked that it was made in the US as well.  Though skeptical, I rubbed some on my lower middle back.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the pain was gone!  My very skeptical husband tried it on his knee.  He said he felt not pain, couldn&#x27;t believe it either.  My daughter&#x27;s back didn&#x27;t seem to like it, I will say; however, she may have had a deeper muscle pain or didn&#x27;t rub it in enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend emu oil to everyone now who complains of muscle aches.  TRY IT!  I&#x27;m gonna buy the 8 oz next time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil on my face 3 consecutive nights in a row, and let me tell you, I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this to use as an eye cream at nite, but I&#x27;ve applied it all over my face the last 2 nites.  Wow!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this stuff .. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and makes my skin look real smooth and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad most of it gets wiped off on my pillow.  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;However, the best way to alleviate that problem is to apply at least 1 hr. before bedtime; that way it&#x27;s got time to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful oil.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;For my face?  Definitely, a thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;Exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;:&gt;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this to see if it could slow down the aging process.  I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and was referred to this product by a friend who swore by it.  It is okay for this purpose, but not great.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair loses and burns.</li>
            <li> Wow I love this stuff.  I have noticible crows feet.  100% on my right side was gone immediately after 1 application and the left side 80% disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not oily or greasy at all.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I use this emu oil for piercing care and it has proved itself to be immensely helpful.  It feels soothing and is able to soak easily into the skin if you don&#x27;t use more than necessary.  It is able to moisturize without cutting off proper air circulation or causing any irritations.  Since the oil is very &amp;#34;breathable,&amp;#34; I also have not noticed any clogged pores or breakouts when using this.  My piercing care ritual now only consists of saline soaks and this emu oil and I have honestly never been happier.  In my experience it will also help clear an infection in a piercing and reduce painful or aesthetically unpleasing scar tissue around the piercing site.  I thoroughly believe that salt water soaks paired with this oil, or even this oil alone, as long as you are still hygienic while showering/bathing, could entirely replace the use of other popular after piercing care items such as: Antibacterial Dial Soap, Bactine, Hydrogen Peroxide, or any other harsh chemicals or ointments of which I know there are many.  When caring for a piercing, you want to soothe and promote your cells to heal and replenish, not punish them with regeneration stunting methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a saline solution to clean my ear I use this product.  I first dry my ear with a q-tip.  I then squeeze a small drop of the oil onto the end of a new q-tip and gently deposit the oil onto one opening of my piercing and repeat the process for the other opening(s).  I then rub any excess oil that has soaked into the q-tip on the jewelry, focusing on the sections closest to the openings in my skin.  As a last tip, I do not believe in the necessity for turning the jewelry in a healing piercing.  If you are concerned about the oil not penetrating, I believe this product would eliminate your worries.  In my experience it soaks in thoroughly.  I believe turning jewelry increases the chances of you bringing a dirty section into the wound, introducing bacteria.  I have had over 6 years of experience caring for personal piercings and those of close relatives.  In the four months I have been using this product I have seen more improvements and ease of healing then with any other product I have used.  However, this is the first and only Emu Oil brand I have tried and I do not have an opinion on its comparison to other brands.</li>
            <li> Emu oil has helped me to regrow a front piece of hair I burned with highlights and a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have a belly button piercing and it was irritated and my piercer told me to get emu oil! I had some at first but ran out and it worked great! This bottle goes a long way and lasts a long time! If any of you reading this have irritated piercings anywhere then use this product! Mine healed within 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my edges since it arrived and thus far its working well, just not enough time to see results.</li>
            <li> I have very itchy scalp that sometimes hurt at the crown of my head. Since I&#x27;ve been using this as recommended by my stylist, I no longer have a painful crown. I just use it sparingly and massage my scalp for a few minutes and it&#x27;s instant relief. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I became aware of EMU oil after my first facial chemical peel (with TCA).  They gave me EMU oil and Hyaluronic acid cream to moisturize and heal afterwards.  It worked fabulously!  Now I keep EMU oil around my house for all healing skin issues.  This is a perfect size for my medicine cabinet.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to smooth on a face or neck and absorbs quickly.  HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this for a lot of random stuff. I put it in my hair to moisturize it and it gives it a healthy glow. I also use a little to moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is so fantastic I love how smooth out &amp; soft it makes my skin &amp; helps with irritation. Lovely!</li>
            <li> To be honest, this is not the best emu oil I&#x27;ve used, but it was better than some I&#x27;ve tried and the price was good. With Emu oil (and other things!) I have learned it is better to spend a bit more for a quality product. However, that is not to say this won&#x27;t work well for you...it just may. All I know is there are two other brands that set the standard (for me anyway) in emu oil. Every home should have a bottle of this on hand. From burns to bites to cuts to scrapes to muscle aches, spasms, cramps, sunburn, skin problems,.....there are so many uses for this remarkable product. My granddaughter is now 6 and from the time she was three, when she had a &#x27;boo-boo&#x27;, growing pain, scratch...whatever, she would say, &amp;#34;Papa, can you get the blue stuff&amp;#34;? Not only does it work, it works fast.</li>
            <li> WORKS AS ADVERTISED, ESPECIALLY FOR HEMORRHOIDS.</li>
            <li> This oil is a magical elixir. Its helped cure a sudden case of adult acne, imparted a beautiful glow to my skin, smoothed lines, made my eyelashes and eyebrows thicker and softer, and is improving my son&#x27;s stubborn eczema. Fast shipping. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery and am still a little swollen (1 month post op) I have been using on and off for a couple of weeks. The day after I use it does seem to improve the swelling, therefore I haven been trying to be more consistent. I have also been using periodically with mederma on the incision, I cannot speak to any benefits</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen great results yet but it can&#x27;t hurt to keep trying. It has no smell and it absorb fast, it works well even on combination skin</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hair as I have seriously dry hair.  It works a little.  I did not realise all the other uses but works for what I needed</li>
            <li> this product is completely non-clogging. Currently using it on a new tattoo and the results are FAR better that A&amp;D. It has also cleared up a couple of dry spots in one application. I WILL be ordering more and a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> not sure if i believe the certification on it, sounds made up but worked alright</li>
            <li> Really good product but know it is thick consistency and doesn&#x27;t go on like an oil.</li>
            <li> i got it to heal a fresh burn. it has been maybe 10 days. it helped heal a few cuts that I had really well, burn is still there but not as red. I use it on my face. it has very pleasant consistency, like a gel. it is not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; like my other facial oils. has no smell. great to use under the eyes, keeps your skin very well moisturized all day or night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna be honest:  I got this stuff for my pen!s (foresk!n regeneration).  Can&#x27;t tell you how well it&#x27;s doing for that, but I did apply it to a sunburn, and it did relieve the pain.  The nature of the product means I&#x27;m just going to have to update later.</li>
            <li> excellant stuff great quality perfect price.  putting on scar from c-section that got staff infection in it. scar was really bad itchy and flaky now after almost a month is almost unseen</li>
            <li> Although I can buy this cheaper in Ohio&#x27;s Amish Country, this price was quite acceptable especially in comparison with health food stores. I use this on my dogs for hot spots, dry skin, rashes and cracked paw pads. This brand was as promised and did the trick, getting to of 90% of my dog&#x27;s rash with one application.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who got a skin rash due to an allergy to something from the ground as well as to side effects from medications, his doctors prescribed, and I&#x27;m just going by what he said. I had heard about it&#x27;s clearing up of skin problems like acne, rashes, etc, so I suggested and purchased a bottle for him. He says, &amp;#34;So good so far&amp;#34;. I keep my fingers crossed he gets better.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly and soothes my irritated skin. Great product. I will use it for a few months to see if it resolves my issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the claims that it helps with inflammation, such as with joint pain. But I haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement in the 3 months I&#x27;ve been using it. It is however an excellent skin conditioner! Despite being an oil, it does absorb into your skin fairly quickly and, once it&#x27;s dry, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my face for fine lines and wrinkles and I must say that I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the year that I&#x27;ve been using it! I mix a drop of it with my face moisturizer, morning and night. Best $10 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> Good quality, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I actually got this oil for my fawn Doberman, who has very dry skin and thin hair.  The vet tried to load me up on expensive shampoo&#x27;s and such and I remembered that they used Emu oil on her skin/hair at a groomer several years ago.  I applied it twice in the past week and she looks amazing!  Her skin is no longer flaking and I can tell she is happier and not itchy.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping skin soft and healing dry skin</li>
            <li> A friend told me about emu oil, and gave me a small sample to try.  I used it around my eyes, which are middle aged and starting to show wrinkles and under-eye bags.  I noticed that within a day or two of applying my friend&#x27;s oil, the skin around my eyes was much healthier looking and wrinkles were less noticeable.  What really impressed me is that it seems to reduce my eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy some for myself, and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  It says right on the bottle that some minuscule amount of Vitamin E has been added as a preservative.  Vitamin E is good for my skin too, so I don&#x27;t see what some of the other reviewers are so upset about.  I certainly don&#x27;t want this bottle to go rancid before I can use it - I use a drop or two each time, so 2 oz. will last for many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fragrance free, and smooths on nicely.  It soaks in without leaving a greasy feel, and I&#x27;m impressed.  I&#x27;m going to explore some of the other uses for emu oil, and thank my friend for introducing me to it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived just in time, no delays. My doctor recommended me the oil for some pains I&#x27;ve been having on my hands the last few months. The oil haven&#x27;t really been working for the purpose I bought it for, but I can tell that it works wonders in other aspects.</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised and it is what I expected. Thank you!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use it as a face moisturizer. It lightens all my dark sun spots without clogging pores.  It works great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product and it&#x27;s delivery.</li>
            <li> bought this for my grandsons eczema and it didn&#x27;t  do anything miraculous for his skin. It was applied after the bath to lock in moisture then it wore off shortly after an he was back to being scaly.</li>
            <li> I should start by saying I have not yet purchased this specific product. I currently use dessert palms fully refined emu oil and have been using it for quite a long time. Emu oil is honestly a miracle product to me. I mainly purchased some after piercing my ears and then continuing to stretch them to a 0 gauge. Emu oil has helped tremendously to heal my ears and prevent that nasty &amp;#34;piercing smell&amp;#34;. I have always taken care of my ears throughout this process and I have to say my lobes are as healthy as ever! I haven&#x27;t used the oil for really anything else but my ears, but the effect that it has had on them is evidence to me of it&#x27;s healing properties. You need this stuff if you are planning to pierce your ears and especially if you are planning to stretch them!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my scalp. I read about the benefits of emu oil for hair and skin a while back. I decided to try it after my scalp suffered trauma from braids that were too tight. I used it every other day to decrease the inflammation and aid in regrowing the hair that was pulled out from the braids. The redness and inflammation reduced. I will continue to use this product and track the progress of my hair growth</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to help my skin heal from the effects of my 28 rounds of radiation. I am very happy with the results. I have used the oil everyday twice a day for 2 weeks so far and my skin is healing very well. The raw pink parts showing more color and the dark burned parts are lightening up and the skin is more vibrant. I intend to continue to use it until the bottle is gone or my skin returns to its normal color. My reconstruction plastic surgen asked me what I was using because the skin is healing faster than he expected. He wants to complete my surgery as soon as he feels comfortable my skin is healthy again and even he agrees that I should continue to use this product because of the impressive results he noted.</li>
            <li> I love how this feels on my scalp. It has no scent and I LOVE THAT! It is very light but it spreads well.  Only a little bit of oil is needed.  I am going to start using on my edges with my Jamaican Black Castor Oil and see if some growth returns.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have very dry skin and a read that emu oil can be very beneficial. When I received this product I discovered it has Vitamin E in it as well as the emu oil.  I have used most of the bottle I received, and while my dry skin is improving, I have some concerns about the direct application of the Vitamin E without knowing the percentage of its content.  This appears to be a good product, but I think I would prefer a product that is just the emu oil, and not mixed with additives that are not disclosed beforehand.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin. this product is very soothing and has not caused any breakouts. It is also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Received as described.</li>
            <li> I have cronic pain in my knees, and I have for years. I am a mertial artist, so my knees are very important, and other martial artists know my pain. For one, I didn&#x27;t believe this would work, I thought it was no more than a plecebo, but I was wrong. A fellow Black Belt at my academy has a lot of issues with their knees and they tild me about it and how it works wonders. So I looked it up on here, got it, used it, and the rest is history. I have taken this for months now, I don&#x27;t need it all the time, so it does last me a while, but the effects it has is astonishing. My knees feel amazing for hours after i put it on. I must mension I have used all kinds of knee braces, and all of them only give relief for a short time. But now I can use Emu oil to get hours of reliefe!! This is amazing stuff! Try it, use it, love it!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. You can use a little and it goes a long way. I had a real bad scar on the top of my feet and I have truly noticed that its not has visible and the skin is actually smoothing out. BTW, this oil does get condensed in a cold room. This is not a big deal though.</li>
            <li> I was told about Emu Oil from a friend. There are so many variations on the market; and I had a hard time on here, especially, figuring out which variation to get. I went with this company because of the cheap price and a year later; due to infrequent use for an allergic skin reaction; I am at about half a bottle. I thought at first it wasn&#x27;t working due to my allergic reaction not clearing up within a day or two like I had imagined, but all in all it took a few applications almost daily (or about 2 weeks time) to see results and it stopped the irritation. I like that it doesn&#x27;t come out the bottle fast and it is absorbed by the skin immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave ANY kind of residue and has no ODOR. That is great. Will definitely order from this company again once I run out, which shouldn&#x27;t be until the middle of next year if that much! Great product for the price and don&#x27;t let the size fool you! Its small but if u don&#x27;t need to use it weekly, or even daily, then this is the Emu Oil to get.</li>
            <li> Other emu oils I have used have been golden, tan, or slightly yellow, thick but flow well, and definitely not sticky but absorb easily into the skin.  This oil has none of those qualities.  This oil is really thin and runny, slightly sticky, and clear.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb well into my skin at all, even with deep massaging.  It makes sensitive areas, like my face and hands, break out in small red bumps.  My other emu oil, which I am nearly out of, does NOT cause this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will use this on my hair only.  From the other reviews that guess that this is more vitamin e oil than the label says, I would hazard a guess in that direction as well.  If that isn&#x27;t how they formulate it to be, then it possibly isn&#x27;t getting mixed well when they do batches.  That is poor quality control if that is the case.  If the price is too good to be true then it probably is! Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face and hair for about 3 weeks, but not consistently. It is a nice light oil for the face and does not clog the pores. I got it mainly because I read it could fade away dark spots (age + sun), not changes there yet but I still think it is a quality oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my tattoo artist recommended it for my new tattoo due to the anti-inflammatory properties of emu oil. Love it! Healed up super fast and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use it to grow my hair. It made my air so shinny and healthy. So glad I bought this oil.</li>
            <li> I got this oil and immediately put around my eyes and all over my face and hands.  It soaks in really fast.  I love this stuff!!!  I will not be without this stuff.  LOVE&amp;lt; LOVE&amp;lt;LOVE!!!!!  I will be ordering the bigger size of this.  My next order I will get the two 4 OZ. sizes that are 100% emu oil on PRIME.  Stops the itchies on your dry skin!!!  I will try on my hair and all over.  Give this wonderful stuff a try.  It is white and creamy on texture.  I may put in refrigerator and use  it straight out of the fridge.  It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Just started using so its too early to see any results but its lighter than I expected no bad scent.</li>
            <li> Great product. Can use for several different things like bald spots, rashes, acne, and dandruff. The list goes on. A must have.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what you want in an emu oil is purity. It is as described, and very good quality. I like it.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as an ingredient to make my own eczema cream. Ingredient performed as expected. Blended well with the other ingredients. Exactly what I needed to take this cream to the next level, works well.</li>
            <li> I have HD, and this emu oil, while the idea grosses me out, is so helpful. It helps with the scarring, has lasted at least 6 months, and is helping me keep this embarrassing, painful, frustrating disease under control. (I also recommend taking turmeric, pramoxine once the healing begins, antibacterial hand soap in the shower, and antibiotic ointment as needed).</li>
            <li> I have been using the EMU Oil on my recent tattoo and already it has begun to heal better than any anti-bacterial cream that I have used in the past.  I also use it with my black Jamaican oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> I got my tragus pierced (both sides) and they started to become infected and with a big red bubble (keloid) because I changed out the earing way before I was supposed to, and I played with it too much. I tried everything to see fast results and nothing worked like Emu oil, I applied it three times a day and say an amazing difference in just two days. I would recommend this for all piercings :)</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again.  For me it was a waste of money.  Extra virgin olive oil works better for me, and the cost is about 95% less than this!</li>
            <li> Good price on a fairly large bottle of emu oil.  I use it on cuts and scrapes, body blemishes, and neck and chest area.  Works great to hydrate and you can also put a few drops in your regular body lotion!</li>
            <li> I am still experimenting with different brands but this one definitely has the best price for being good quality.  The reason I took off one star is because it does not noticeably help with inflammation, acne, e.t.c, instead I find it to be just a really good alternative to lotions that have a million crappy ingredients(even organic ones).  I love that it is just one ingredient, well researched, and that it might be helping with inflammation in a really subtle way.  I am sure it does help with those things a little, but it is not as magical as the description and some reviewers make it out to be.  I am going to buy another brand next time to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> After reading glowing reviews about the benefits of emu oil, I bought this to try. It is, well, oily, but that is all I can say about it.</li>
            <li> love this oil on dry eyes &amp; lips</li>
            <li> Ive heard about emu oil and all the benefits people seem to have, so I decided Ide give it a shot. And im glad I did! I was suprised that it didnt leave an oily/greasy feeling like other products Ive tried. Instead it left me baby soft skin, I apply it everyday and my skin has visably improved. It smoothes lines and wrinkles, and heals blemishes FAST. Its my go to flaw corrector. It has so many benefits everyone should try it atleast once.</li>
            <li> Pure Emu Oil...Great Product...Great Benefits!!</li>
            <li> Use this product alongside my Cetaphil bar soaps when I wash my face. Used to have really dry skin and this has helped tremendously. Would recommend to apply on your face as you wash your face for any individual on accutane. This products helps to prevent the cracking and burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Just started using this and I can see some growth on the edges.  Not large amount but can see improvement will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. I encourage everyone I know to try it (although not everyone gets as excited as me). I have vulvodynia and needed something to moisturize and smooth the skin down there. I put this stuff on and my pain goes away; there&#x27;s no better feeling than the lack of pain. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t leave much oil residue. If you have dry skin, it rubs in all the way. I don&#x27;t usually use it on my face unless the skin is very dry, because it leaves a little bit of grease even if you rub it in a lot. However, it stops the skin from peeling when it gets that dry, so it&#x27;s also awesome for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my sons&#x27; legs as he has very bad eczema on his legs that left his legs looking like it was healing from a scrape, but never healed!&lt;br /&gt;I used this on him for 4 days, one time every night and by the next week the scrapes were gone and his skin was smooth. I put a few drops on and had plenty to spare. I am so happy i found this all natural product that actually works. Any other parents worried about their kids eczema should buy this.</li>
            <li> Giving it a 3 stars because we only used it for a month. We are purchasing another bottle and giving it 90 days before we review.</li>
            <li> i bought this product for my hair but the oil is a little to thick which causes my hair to weigh down so i dont really use it at all</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write this review until I had used the Emu Oil for a good length of time so that I could provide ALL of the amazing results in this review.  But, I am just too darn excited to wait, so all I can report are the immediate results since I&#x27;ve only been using the Emu Oil for five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Jodie Maran Argon Oil on my face day and night for a while now and I really like the way it made my face feel and look.  I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle from it and I didn&#x27;t get one.  However, once I used the Emu Oil in place of the argon oil, it seemed that miracles did happen.  My face has never been so hydrated and healthy feeling.  The appearance of my bare face has some kind of quality to it that it didn&#x27;t have before.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on it.  Maybe the opposite of dull.  Yes, I think that helps explain it.  My bare face looked dull before and now it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pushing 40 and I have under eye wrinkles that become even more obvious with concealer and/or powder.  But I need concealer to cover up the dark circles and powder to set it so the concealer doesn&#x27;t just slide down my face.  The BEST PART of USING EMU OIL is that it has hydrated my under eye area so much that my concealer and powder no longer cake and therefore no longer amplify the wrinkled skin!!!!!!  Again, I have only used this for five days, so I am very hopeful that with continued use I will see less and less wrinkles there.  Is is possible that this product can turn back time?  Seems possible to me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I read that emu oil is one of the only oils that is good to put on healing piercings. I used it for troublesome piercings that were always too dry and fell in love. Now I use it on my dry nails, my elbows, anywhere that needs moisturizing. It is fantastic. Do not hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love the spill proof bottle and the way it goes on my face and hands.  I would recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> It kind of looks disgusting, but it makes me face really smooth in the morning if I put it on at night. It smells a little weird, and the color of the liquid is grayish but it DOES work and I do really like it because it helps with my acne.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help with the healing of a tattoo that may have otherwise scabbed up and lost more ink than I wanted. It is soothing and it soaks in and goes a long way. Will use it for later tats too!</li>
            <li> it got here pretty quick.  I applied it to my heat rash last night and this morning it was so much better! and it has No smell, which is super great!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to post results.  Feels good on the skin and absorbs very fast.  Seems to be real good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for my hair and a surgical wound.  My hair and scalp feel great and the wound is healing nicely.</li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t help at all. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used this as a night time moisturizing lotion when I was on accutane.  My skin never got overly dry! This stuff is really awesome if you&#x27;re taking accutane!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a little more than a week. So far, I am impressed. I thought with it being an oil it would at least slightly clog pores especially with my acne prone oily skin. It does not - as a matter of fact, my skin has been less oily since I&#x27;ve been using it, no break-outs at all (I usually always have at least a few), and no more clogged pores. Do note that when you put it on it does feel a bit oily - it is an oil after all, but you can always wipe off the excess with a tissue. That&#x27;s a small trade-off for a chemical free natural moisturizer that improves your skin&#x27;s texture. I will update if this turns out to be a fluke. So far, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this today which was a day earlier than estimated. I immediately applied to my feet and it soaked right in with no oily residue, three hours later and my feet still feel just as silky as they did when I first applied. I just applied a drop to my face and it feels wonderful. Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use after pedicures. First I tried it on my hands and they looked younger immediately and the effects lasted 24 hours through hand washings until I next showered. As I age the backs of my hands tend to look dry and crepey. This fixed that better than any cream, lotion or oil I have used in the past. It gets absorbed without a greasy or shiny look on the skin. Too bad it&#x27;s so darn expensive or I would use it daily.</li>
            <li> Emu oil is amazing! I mis with my regular serums and creams at night to get extra treatment and it works wonders. It helps heal and makes scaring less visible, it heals your skin in just a few uses!! I use on face, hair, cuticles and mix in with my body lotions too!</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this to my mom. I made my hair so dry and greasy and funky. I hate emu oil, it is not for me. ( BTW) I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend Emu Oil for the use of acne scars. This is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried, but so far my scars are definitely fading. I&#x27;ve been using this for about four months now and of course it is taking a bit of time for them to fade, but no doubt they are fading. And a lot faster than sitting around and waiting for them to naturally fade. Advice I would give if you were to purchase any kind of emu oil is to make sure your rub it in. It takes a bit of elbow grease to get it absorbed, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> How did I not hear about this sooner! This brand is fantastic, no smell and great consistency.  Only wish that it was organic, then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Anytime I do a TCA peel this is my number one choice in keeping my face mositurized. This product is very expensive for the size, but worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands. I don&#x27;t care for this one. It is way too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; for me. Does not penetrate the surface of the skin, just sits there like an oil slick. It was very inexpensive. I will pay more the next time to get better quality.</li>
            <li> What I bought was what was sent, couldn&#x27;t ask for more than that. Thanks! Pro emu oil is great for everybody</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it has served my purpose or not.  I had researched the product and learned about it&#x27;s healing power.  I tried it but I cannot tell if it has healed scar tissue on my temples.</li>
            <li> Use this in place of Neosporin or basitracin. This cuts healing time for scrapes and scars in half. Overnight I see a difference in my wounds. Takes the red out of a wound overnight. Wonderful for sports players always injuring knees. This is high quality Emu oil. Perfect blend of thickness and bonus it&#x27;s odorless. Vitamin E is wonderful addition for the skin. I adore the product and great deal for the price. Fast shipping also. Thank You!</li>
            <li> AMAZING stuff.  I use squalane (both shark liver and olive oil) and this actually absorbes better than they do.  I combine the three for a &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; and it has truly changed the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> Good for everything from acne to dandruff. As helpful as some $90 prescription dandruff shampoo I used. Can be left on your head for long periods of time without fear of it damaging the  brain. When all else fails, try this. I never bothered to write a review  before in 10 years of internet use, but this is worth knowing about.</li>
            <li> Had a dog bite and it really helped with the scarring!</li>
            <li> I so regret I only could afford to get that tiny bottle of emu oil! It&#x27;s been doing some good to my skin. I absolutely love it. Absorbed so quickly and gives a youthful glow to your skin. Saving up so I can buy a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> I bought it primarily for healing the cut on the end of my fingers due to the winter weather.  I had&lt;br /&gt;used Emu  oil which my brother bought from a Health Food store which worked really well, but this one&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t work well for that, although it may work well for other skin problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil to help with hair growth and I think so far so good. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have stretched earlobes at 1&amp;#34;, and they have poor circulation, causing them to turn purpleish and get very cold. It worried me for a long time and I was told about emu oil. I put ONE drop on my fingers and rub it into my earlobes in the morning and evening, and it is GREAT! Not only have my lobes returned to their healthy color and are warmer to the touch, but they feel thicker and the stretch scars on the inside have evened out and diminished. This stuff is great, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> To start, I will let you know that I have medium skin (not dry or oily) and have recently suffered from small hormonal breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long .. very long hard search for the best moisturizer, I am so happy to have found Emu Oil.  I have been using it for over a year and will not go back to any other face moisturizers. I have tried all types of oils - almond, vitamin e oil, jajaboba oil.. and many face moisturizers - oil of olay (many lines), dr. hauschka, Perricone, and many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is hands down the best. It it very light and despite being an oil, it absorbs in very well and leaves the skin silky smooth... yet natural feeling.  It does not make be break out... much the contrary, it reduces redness, inflammation, and helps healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also great to wear under makeup. Since it leaves your skin smooth and supple, you dont get creases etc.</li>
            <li> Bought it to use on my ears after they were pierced and for stretching, I have no complaints about it. Works well and keeps my ears feeling good. Very little goes a looooong way!</li>
            <li> This Emu oil i found out is also used for other skin conditions..I use it with my infer skin light and it helps healing factors..i also use it on my psoriasis it is cheaper than those steroid creams..I love this stuff!! give it a try you wont be dissappointed!</li>
            <li> I had stubborn piercings that would NOT heal! I tried everything from salt soaks to special sprays and solutions, noting helped. I went digging for some help and saw a post about Emu oil. Now my piercings never hurt or got too bad, they just wouldn&#x27;t heal. This stuff is helping so much! It prevents any crusting which happens often with piercings and prevents any swelling.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. My skin has never felt better. It healed eczema, puffiness under eyes and healed my 5 year Olds freshly pierced ears fast and painless. Such a wonderful oil.</li>
            <li> I recently started using Emu oil, and i really like this one. It doesn&#x27;t come out clear, it is more a thick white color, although it doesn&#x27;t harden like coconut oil. I use this on my lips and on my skin, and really like it. Very glad I purchased this oil.</li>
            <li> I returned after fearing it could make me break out from reading reviews. I never tried so I can&#x27;t give much of a review.</li>
            <li> Great item. I have tried another companies emu oil &amp; all though it was fresh it didn&#x27;t have any added oil to extend shelf life. This emu oil has added vitamin e. This makes the emu oil last longer &amp; will not go rancid as quickly. Great Job!</li>
            <li> another thing I bought that I heard was good for your skin and still not used it.  someday I will try it</li>
            <li> of emu oil.  It is the closest to natural skin oil you can get.  It&#x27;s very therapeutic for dry skin. Seals in those precious peptide solutions and helps them to penetrate deeper.  Use this with your favorite peptides around eyes.  Don&#x27;t coat the lid (oil has a tendency to seep). I pat at the brow bone and enough migrates down to affect the lid.  I use this on the area where crows feet form, and under eye. Of course, you can use this anywhere, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to use this oil. So far so good. I mix it with my regular lotion and it&#x27;s great. I use it on my face as a night time moisturizer and my skin is softer and smoother even after I wash it off the next morning. Still haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the true benefits but it&#x27;s worth the money spent so far</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle to help my piercing heal faster and it works for that too. I also use it on my face, under eye area, belly, etc. definitely going to purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and at my age I get the occasional acne because I have T zone. I have used so many other products and someone bumped into Emu Oil from someone reviewing it online. I researched on Amazon and decided to try this Progressive Emu oil... this is by far the best priced one and works great, I love it!!! Blemishes be gone!!! I apply at night and by morning my blemishes are almost gone, not so red, and within 2-3 days they&#x27;ve disappeared. I spot treat and do not use on entire face as this product does tend to dry skin. But I do my face wash and moisturizer regimen at night, then spot treat with the emu oil. I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is great for skin everywhere, and also your hair.  Affordable and as good as any overpriced moisturizer that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> ... And love it.  My wife is using it for stronger hair and hair growth.  I use it for blemishes and I use it on my kids for simple rashes.  It is an all purpose oil.  But, do your own your research, then come back and grab a bottle of this brand.</li>
            <li> Tried this for a dry skin area. It worked well and required only one or two drops as it spread easily.&lt;br /&gt;While it appeared oily when applied, it  was absorbed rather quickly and did not stay topical.&lt;br /&gt;It also appears to be attractive to cats as one of mine has a tendency to lick the applied area.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting, but I make sure he promptly stops.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both really love this oil.  We use it along with our regular&lt;br /&gt;body lotions, and it creates a delicious softness on the skin. We&#x27;ll keep this on hand&lt;br /&gt;all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the quick service.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my very dry skin and love it. Great for feet. I have had a couple break outs on face, however this is awesome on my hair. I have frizzy curly hair and have never found a hair care product that works. I keep my hair in a bun as I can not do anything with it. I put a tiny drop of emu oil in the ends and no frizz, curl is fabulous. Love it.</li>
            <li> The oil is very nice and was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning after my shave....</li>
            <li> Just what I expected good night time moisturizer</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell awful but still smells and performs like emu oil. I&#x27;m sold. The texture is really nice compared to some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have progressively replaced many of the products I have been using with natural alternatives.  I mostly use this as a moisturizer for my face.  While I&#x27;ve never had skin issues, my skin has never looked better.  I regularly receive compliments on my skin.  I have also used this whenever my little ones have a scratch or bruise.  It&#x27;s healing in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for hair growth and it works wonders on the skin. You mix this with a carrier oil and rub on the scalp for hair growth. It can also be rubbed directly on the skin. It heals sores and cuts fast and it smooth scars.</li>
            <li> I thought that this was an oil.  It came as a white paste.  It was delivered in the middle of a snowstorm, so I&#x27;m not sure if the climate had anything to do with it.  I can&#x27;t really speak to the efficacy of the product. It might be very effective.  It&#x27;s just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have never heard of this stuff before in my life until my 9 month old daughter started developing a bald spot at her edges.  She has so much hair, the pony tails were causing traction alopecia.  I watched a youtube video about combining Emu Oil and Castor Oil and figured I would try it.  After a week, her hair is definitely starting to fill in.  She is teething and broke out into a rash and I used the emu oil on that and it cleared right up.  This stuff is holy water in a bottle.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This item worked well. I bought it to stretch my ears to a larger size (gauges), and it did its job. But there was a small problem. When I would clean my ears I would have this weird brown stuff in my ears. It easily cleaned out, I was just not expecting it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great on flea bite scars and goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smell. Will order more.</li>
            <li> I have purchased pure emu oil as a pain reliever for arthritis in the past because it works well. Real emu oil is odorless, greaseless and will not stain clothing. It absorbs readily into the skin. This emu oil has an unlisted additive that smells and feels like cooking oil. Real emu oil does not separate after sitting for a few days--that is not the case for this oil. You must shake it vigorously at each use to mix the ingredients and even then it feels greasy on the skin, would likely stain fabrics and leaves a definitive sheen. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great oil for problem skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased because I was having some swelling on my pierced nipples. It helped my swelling go down and my skin noticeably softer. *thumbs up*</li>
            <li> Love this product! I got it to use on my son&#x27;s eczema, and it has helped. I also started using it for a facial moisturizer. It works great for that too. Does not clog pores, and I have combination skin. I plan on using this indefinitely.</li>
            <li> got this for the wifey and she&#x27;s used it until it&#x27;s all gone.  or maybe it&#x27;s not all gone... thanks thoguh.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this if it would help at all.  Surprise it does help.  I use it for painful joints.  If I don&#x27;t use it I hurt.  If I use it I feel a lot better.  Takes just a little bit to make a difference for me.</li>
            <li> This Emu Oil is wonderful! I have paid well over $100.00 for a 1 oz bottle of moisturizer and my skin has never looked as good as it has within a week of using this Emu Oil. I wish I had known about it a long time ago. I would have saved a lot of money. I have tried products from very high-end lines such as Perricone, Peter Thomas Roth, and AmorePacific to name a few. I&#x27;m absolutely serious that this has outperformed them all. I live in the North and my skin gets very dry in the winter. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have started showing fine lines around my eyes. I cannot believe how much of an improvement there is in both those fine lines as well as the overall appearance of my skin and in such a short amount of time. I would recommend this to anyone absolutely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered and it does what I want...</li>
            <li> This is the first product (aside from prescription-strength cortisone, which has only a temporary effect and is terrible for the body) that I&#x27;ve found that actually heals eczema. I applied it every night for about a month to the ugly, itchy eczema I&#x27;ve had on one foot for years, and it has completely disappeared. The skin is still rough where it used to be, but there&#x27;s no sign of eczema and absolutely no itching. I also used it successfully to speed up the healing of bug bites and cuts on my skin. Terrific product that few people know about.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I use it in my hair, and recently my son had a tad bit of ringworm on his cheek,and I applied this nightly for a week and it went away (now to be honest, I did use this in conjunction with an old home remedy) but I was using the old home remedy for a week by itself, and the ringworm only went away when I added the EMO oil as part as the remedy, and when the spot cleared up, it cleared up \\&quot;pretty\\&quot;, meaning it was no peeling or dryness, now the thing is, the spot where he had the ring worm is smoother, and a better texture (he has pretty skin in the first place) than the other parts of his face (and I know that is soley because of the Emo oil)...LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I just think that its a nice household staple (i.e., like rubbing alcohol, epson salt, witch hazel, etc.) to have on hand.</li>
            <li> At the suggestion of another review I also put it in hot water to thin it out and I am glad I did!  I used it on my hair and on the dog&#x27;s fur after a shower and both have remarkable softness today.  This is just one use so I&#x27;m not sure if the affect I am looking for on the dog&#x27;s fur will be as postitive as I&#x27;m hoping for, but the psoriasis on my scalp is not flaking today...normally after I shower and blow dry my hair it flakes like crazy and itches something fierce.  None of that after rubbing a tiny amount on the spots before I got out of the shower.  This will easily become a staple in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After one week of using this daily on the dog, the hairloss I am trying to regrow is defintely filling in! I am very glad I bought this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2: It has been a little over a month since I started using this product to help combat hairloss on my dachshund. Her bald spots have grown in completely and the fur is even growing longer than it has ever been.  The downside is that it makes the dog smell very strong and attracts dirt on all her harnesses and collars and it doesn&#x27;t wash out easily. Now, I&#x27;d say those are both small prices to pay to keep the dog&#x27;s fur growing in a healthy way. My vet said a few days ago that if I hadn&#x27;t mentioned the Alopecia he wouldn&#x27;t have noticed at all, so that is it&#x27;s testimony for sure.</li>
            <li> outstanding product will definitely order again started working  the first week</li>
            <li> I like this oil very much at a great price.</li>
            <li> when I get sunburned I peel I used this and I never peeled and toned down the redness also relieved the burn.. great stuff</li>
            <li> This has no odor and absorbs well into my skin. Not sure it&#x27;s reducing redness as much as I&#x27;d like, but I&#x27;ll keep using it. Liked it enough that I bought a 1-oz version for traveling.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through the piercer at my local shop that I go to.  She told me it had worked wonders for her piercings in the past, and I had been having a troublesome piercing where sea salt soaks, tea tree oil, and chamomile tea soaks were not working.  After two days of using this product, the piercing became noticeably more tame, and within the last week that I have been using it, the problem is pretty much gone! Love and swear by this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I originally bought this for streaching my ears but I also discovered that it can be used to help heal and moisturize my fresh tattoos it works amazingly well because of its anti-inflammatory properties</li>
            <li> fast delivery/shipping.. Will rate product after use</li>
            <li> So, I read through most of the reviews, and if I missed it I&#x27;m sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AMAZING for new piercings. My piercer always sells it to me but it&#x27;s a small bottle for $5 and I have to drive ALL the way there to get it so I said to myself \\&quot;Amazon has everything\\&quot;... VOILA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting me a huge one because I have 3 new piercings. Seriously, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this! :D</li>
            <li> I love this product. It helps to relieve my pain from my back. It does. Ot have a smell it is soothing and does not stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a good quality emu oil and price is absolutely great.I use it on my hair,face and body sometimes.Lasts for a long</li>
            <li> I mix 2 parts sulfur powder with 8 parts emu oil to use topically for acne. I also use just the emu oil, instead of an under eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use, de la cruz&#x27;s sulfur ointment. I had good results with that and I used it for years. But, the only downfall was that you could see my skin flaking off! When I mix sulfur and emu oil, I get better results, without the crusty skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it to my face, avoiding the skin under my eyes, in the morning and at night. I don&#x27;t wash it off after 10 minutes like de la cruz&#x27;s sulfur ointment directions say to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen, online that people mix emu and sulfur to help grow their hair, but this hasn&#x27;t made my facial hair grow haha!</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical</li>
            <li> Im not sure it really helped with a burn I got on my face from hot cooking oil splashing,  My scar is still there and visible even after almost one year later</li>
            <li> I think this is great massage oil. I am not sure if it helps with inflammation, but has no scent.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this oil for the first week, but I used it after a chemical peel and felt like it was doing a decent job of keeping my skin moist, so I kept using it.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with the greasy feel and I was sure that it was going to clog my pores and send me into a major breakout.  Amazingly, I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple all month.  I don&#x27;t know why.  It&#x27;s not the peel...usually I get them after doing a peel, and I&#x27;ve done nothing different but use this emu oil ever night on cleaned skin.  This is the first month in my memory that I haven&#x27;t had some flare up at some point!  It really is amazing, although definitely greasy!  In the winter, this stuff is going to be perfect!</li>
            <li> Excellent!! I love it! Transaction was very smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice quality lotion.  This does a great job at moisturizing and curing chapped skin (regardless of any other extrinsic benefits you may or may not believe in).</li>
            <li> Concentrated.  A little goes a long way.  Using for post op tummy tuck scar care.  Used twice daily after wounds healed over.  Making very impressive progress with scar care / stretch marks and at this time I&#x27;m only 9 weeks post-op.  Also works great for any dryness for face lips etc.  Not much of a scent at all and no reaction with my very sensitive skin  I&#x27;ve already bought a 2nd bottle and plan to keep buying it just for it&#x27;s therapeutic skin uses.</li>
            <li> Great oil for skin care and hair. Also a great first aid oil for burns or cuts. Helps heal quickly. It was inexpensive and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I got this to try to hep my industrial piercings heal after reading so many things about it. I didnt see where it helped anything really. I even used it on my dry skin and honestly i have to say that i prefer coconut oil for that.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for my husbands knee.</li>
            <li> really no problems...used it after my jessner&#x27;s peel, and it did help.  stopped using it after peel was over, made my face break out a bit.  did use it on my right shoulder one night before bed (it was aching).  it worked well enough that I didn&#x27;t have to take a painkiller, which made me happy.</li>
            <li> Great oil.  I use it for everything.  I&#x27;ve used it in my hair mixture. My body oil mixture.  Heck I even use it on my lips.  It makes all other oils sink in to the skin.  Have to order some more; mine is almost gone.</li>
            <li> So far I am using it and I need to use more</li>
            <li> Delivered before the estimated delivery date. I use this for my new piercings and it helps! My nose piercing healed faster than expected and it helps soothe my cartilage piercings as well. It helps them not get dry. Helps with swelling too. I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a volunteer use this on patients at the chemo infusion center.  It&#x27;s really a great product for drying skin, cracked skin, etc. Some of the patients have red blotchy spots under the skin caused by the chemo and I thought this would be great for my husband&#x27;s skin for the same reason. He had two big red blotches where his skin had turned from his shirt sleeve rubbing against it.  Since he&#x27;s been on chemo, the least little irritation will cause these marks.  I used it two days in a row and they were quickly disappearing. I actually saw results after the first use.  I also read that emu oil is good for arthritis pain and tried it.  It has a cumulative effect so using it two-three times a day helps a lot. It&#x27;s not for everyone, I&#x27;m sure, as some people have arthritis worse than others but it helps me. It won&#x27;t make it disappear, granted, but nothing will.  Let&#x27;s just say it helps and I&#x27;ll take the little help I can get when it comes to the aches of arthritis.  Word of warning...a little goes a LONG way.  One drop on the knee (or wherever you need to use it) will do the trick.  If you feel greasy after you use it, you&#x27;re using too much. :)  It absorbs into the skin quite well and I&#x27;ve noticed since I&#x27;ve been using that my cuticles are much softer and not snagging on stuff, too.  I&#x27;ve always had a horrible time keeping my cuticles in shape but this has helped that, too.  Added benefit.  :)  At first, I thought it was a bit pricey but when I saw how little it takes and how far ONE drop will go, it&#x27;s well worth the price you pay. I even re-ordered it to have so I could share with my Mother and see if she likes it.  Hope my information will help someone else.  Give it a try.  If you don&#x27;t like it, you can always give it to someone else.  Maybe their results will be different from yours. After all, we&#x27;re all different little peaches in this basket called Earth!  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrific moisturizer, works great it you have eczema or itchy skin. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference on bruises. Doesn&#x27;t grow hair, so this isn&#x27;t some miracle oil.</li>
            <li> Nice oil, makes my hands very soft and it lasts a very long time, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either.  Recommend!</li>
