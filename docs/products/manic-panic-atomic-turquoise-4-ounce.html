            <li>It isn&#x27;t even bright.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t even bright.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used ManicPanic and it works for you - good on you.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see how it could for others after getting a good look at how the product coats or depth of the pigments..  </li>

            <li>and I don&#x27;t see how it could for others after getting a good look at how the product coats or depth of the pigments.</li>
            <li>used it for my dip dye and it turned out really good after bleaching it.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s not harmful to the hair shaft (good thing, since bleaching process is.)</li>
            <li>This is a great product, smells good and so easy to apply!</li>
            <li>The color is lovely and the product is very nice.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color!</li>
            <li>Nice pigmented color.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;ll feel kind of crunchy)&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Also there were patches of hair that weren&#x27;t completely white/blonde, and it did an awesome job of covering it with color.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I bought this hair color.</li>
            <li>My favorite Manic Panic color.</li>
            <li>Okay, for starters I have been dyeing my hair for eleven years and know what I am doing.</li>
            <li>The better you bleach your hair, the better the results.</li>
            <li>The remaining dye I&#x27;ll be mixing into some conditioner to use as a top up between dye</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, for BEST results, you&#x27;d have to lighten hair as blond as possible!</li>
            <li>clarifying conditioner in Key Lime and it cleans my hair perfectly without fading my color.</li>
            <li>Favorite color from Manic Panic.  </li>
            <li>I love manic panic</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>This turquoise hair dye is great: easy to use, vibrant color.  </li>
            <li>Really nice bold color.</li>
            <li>It also fades VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>It was used on natural hair colors of light and medium brown and worked great.</li>
            <li>and so easy</li>
            <li>The turquoise color is nice at first, but honestly to get it vibrant, you have to leave it in for an hour or more.</li>
            <li>The product it&#x27;s self is great, it&#x27;s in a smaller bottle</li>
            <li>Your hair will feel lovely and soft, and I&#x27;m sure it appreciates the love if you&#x27;ve just bleached your hair like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This color is beautiful, and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using less shampoo also helps with fading but over all I really love the color extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I colored my teen daughter&#x27;s hair and it was beautiful the first day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait until I can dye over this with some Special Effects.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li>In the sunlight it had hints of other blues and greens and we had many comments on how pretty and bright the color was.  </li>
            <li>The color was even pretty after fading!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!!</li>
            <li>&quot; this is like the coral coloured tips of a flamingo&#x27;s feathers and very washed out, unlike the bright fuchsias or strong pinks or purple tinted pinks of other brands.</li>
            <li>&quot; this is like the coral coloured tips of a flamingo&#x27;s feathers and very washed out, unlike the bright fuchsias or strong pinks or purple tinted pinks of other brands.</li>
            <li>I love Manic Panic simply because I&#x27;ve used products like Splat, where it&#x27;s almost all liquid and when you&#x27;re working with a purple or bright blue...</li>
            <li>I recommend mixing this hair dye with some kind of conditioner or deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>It was so fun</li>
            <li>&#x27;savings&#x27; right there eaten up and then some)&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li>I am so very impressed with this dye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing to help with fading issues- use cold water and a silicone free conditioner to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>While it lasts longer then most brands we have used the color did not come out to be a turquoise color at all and was more of a green color over all.</li>
            <li>Not as permanent or easy to extract as Special Effects, but definitely lives up to expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors came in very fast</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve found that 2 hours has been working best for her medium blonde hair, the 30 mins the instructions give is not long enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair more times than I can remember back in my teens with Manic panic.</li>
            <li>but I have been dyeing my hair the same colours for most of those years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shocking Blue - if this lasts more than three washes I&#x27;ll be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, my preferred brands and colours cost more initially, but for pigment and durability - my time is also money, you know?</li>
            <li>Yes, my preferred brands and colours cost more initially, but for pigment and durability - my time is also money, you know?</li>
            <li>I went to go get my hair done, and I took my own dye; as a result, my hair came out just how i wanted it, so whoever would like their hair to look green but yet kind of blue, i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed this it turned my hair downright moldy-looking.</li>
            <li>I bought this because when I think turquoise, I think a pretty bluegreen shade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years now and this is my favorite shade of blue.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a redhead, so she first had to bleach the hair to be colored.</li>
            <li>The color of the dye on my hair was the exact color it came out to be</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s ok to condition it every time you take a shower, but only shampoo it once or twice a week..</li>
            <li>Over priced for the amount received, I am pretty sure it was part of a set of colors they sell individually</li>
            <li>(not that i wanted it to, but i expected it to fade much more quickly than it did. )</li>
            <li>/&gt;Atomic Turquoise - on very well lightened, healthy hair, left on for 9 hours</li>
            <li>This was the BRIGHTEST, prettiest, most intense color we have tried from Manic Panic and we will definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li>The product features pretty much lie when they say that the fading is gradual.</li>
            <li>I find leaving it on for the full 30 minutes and completely coating it and re-applying after 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend doing a strand test if the exact color result is important to you.</li>
            <li>easy to use, definitely wear rubber gloves, and a shower cap.</li>
            <li>Atomic turquoise, on unbleached natural blonde hair, came out a gorgeous vibrant lush teal.</li>
            <li>but the turquoise is holding pretty steady.</li>
            <li>If you do get it on your skin, as long as you wash it off quickly, the stain will wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>The Turquoise fades to a great green color and seems to last forever on bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I really like it though</li>
            <li>You need to be careful about making sure to put coconut oil or petroleum jelly around your hairline, ears and neck to prevent staining.</li>
            <li>The final color was definitely more green than blue, but looks good and has stayed for weeks now.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what color I wanted, but it did turn out lovely.</li>
            <li>This color is SO vibrant and velvety looking.</li>
            <li>To get rid of green, we used a bright red shade of Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this color and this seller.</li>
            <li>This color is really pretty, but it does turn green pretty quickly is your hair isn&#x27;t too bleached.</li>
            <li>and I love it, but I&#x27;d like to share a few tips of mine.</li>
            <li>That worked nicely, since red cancels green.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use shampoo when you first wash it out, also, only conditioner if you want to.</li>
            <li>(I frequently put coconut or jojoba oil on my ends, especially since it&#x27;s winter, and I haven&#x27;t really had to since the dye.)&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be surprised.   </li>
            <li>The only downside is that we wish the color lasted longer and didn&#x27;t fade as fast.</li>
            <li>After completely bleaching my hair and applying Manic Panic, I had hoped my hair was going to turn out turquoise, as in the photos on the company website.</li>
            <li>and it completely covered it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it on hair that had some washed out purple, and the purple turned to a vibrant blue.</li>
            <li>I was super skeptical because my hair/scalp tends to get oily quickly, but i&#x27;ve been using Suave (of all things!)</li>
            <li>One jar is more than enough to dye a thick, medium-length head of hair.</li>
            <li>Pretty Flamingo - unlike other brands that say \\&quot;flamingo\\</li>
            <li>I grabbed this dye instead of Special Effects which is what I usually use.</li>
            <li>I also pre-rinse with white vinegar to help &#x27;set&#x27; the color before washing it completely out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried manic panic before (Cotton Candy Pink and Atomic Turquoise) and it did not work out very well</li>
            <li>I get a ton of compliments when it&#x27;s freshly dyed, but otherwise it gets called  a green color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had it about two weeks now and the other colors are fading a bit-- I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily, and when I do I don&#x27;t use hot water, am sparing with shampoo, and rinse with white vinegar--</li>
            <li>And my hair is so soft, I can use a lot less hydrating products than I normally do.</li>
            <li>However, it turned out lime green and then faded to yellow-green after the first wash.</li>
            <li>None of the other colors came out particularly well--</li>
            <li>and I have to say the blue is a little harder to work with only because it fades so quickly.</li>
            <li>While true everyone has different hair, different porosity and different expectations, my expectations and experience is that if I have to leave semi permanent dye on for more than 4hrs to have a hope of gaining pigmentation - it is worthless.</li>

            <li> I was super skeptical because my hair/scalp tends to get oily quickly, but i&#x27;ve been using Suave (of all things!)</li>
            <li> One jar is more than enough to dye a thick, medium-length head of hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty Flamingo - unlike other brands that say \\&quot;flamingo\\</li>
            <li> I grabbed this dye instead of Special Effects which is what I usually use.</li>
            <li> I also pre-rinse with white vinegar to help &#x27;set&#x27; the color before washing it completely out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried manic panic before (Cotton Candy Pink and Atomic Turquoise) and it did not work out very well</li>
            <li> I get a ton of compliments when it&#x27;s freshly dyed, but otherwise it gets called  a green color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it about two weeks now and the other colors are fading a bit-- I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily, and when I do I don&#x27;t use hot water, am sparing with shampoo, and rinse with white vinegar--</li>
            <li> And my hair is so soft, I can use a lot less hydrating products than I normally do.</li>
            <li> However, it turned out lime green and then faded to yellow-green after the first wash.</li>
            <li> None of the other colors came out particularly well--</li>
            <li> and I have to say the blue is a little harder to work with only because it fades so quickly.</li>
            <li> While true everyone has different hair, different porosity and different expectations, my expectations and experience is that if I have to leave semi permanent dye on for more than 4hrs to have a hope of gaining pigmentation - it is worthless.</li>

            <li> I left it on for a few hours, twisted up in foil and under a shower cap; I wore a wool hat over the top to help &#x27;cook&#x27;</li>
            <li> It not only covered the pink completely, it took quite a few washes to get it to start fading.</li>

            <li> We used the entire bottle on my sons hair (short) versus about half of the container (which we&#x27;ve done in the past), so that may have been the key.  </li>

            <li> OMG! Its makes hair blue. It does rub off after a couple of washes though. Be careful not to get this on your clothes.</li>
            <li> This color is really pretty, but it does turn green pretty quickly is your hair isn&#x27;t too bleached. I really like it though, I&#x27;m glad I bought this hair color.</li>
            <li> I have natural moderately blonde hair, and without toner or bleach, I actually get the color I want without it fading to green. Every other color I&#x27;ve tried turns into a weird green-yellow after a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, leave the dye in for as long as possible. It doesn&#x27;t harm your hair, and actually ends up making it softer (in my experience). Don&#x27;t use shampoo when you first wash it out, also, only conditioner if you want to.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long this color has lasted in my coarse, thick hair. Very vibrant, and will last so long you&#x27;ll probably be sick of it before it washes out. Some tips-obviously bleach your hair if it is dark. Wrap in foil and use your blow dryer. Leave in for a few hours or even overnight if possible (its made of ingredients that will actually soften, not hurt your hair). I also like that the pot keeps for a while, since I only use it for a few simple highlights.</li>
            <li> Ive been using Manic Panic dyes for a couple years now and I have to say the blue is a little harder to work with only because it fades so quickly. I find leaving it on for the full 30 minutes and completely coating it and re-applying after 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using less shampoo also helps with fading but over all I really love the color extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful, and lasts a very long time. I dyed my (unbleached) hair in June 2014 and it lasted until about September 2014, with minimal fading. The color was even pretty after fading! One jar is more than enough to dye a thick, medium-length head of hair. The only downside is that you have to do a bleach rinse to get the color out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictured is the the dying process, a couple of weeks after, and the last photo is three months after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair more times than I can remember back in my teens with Manic panic. My 11 year old daughter has now started a trend among the  other girls her age, coloring bits of her bangs and undersides of her hair. The turquoise isn&#x27;t too invasive looking for her age and washes out in a timely manner. You need to be careful about making sure to put coconut oil or petroleum jelly around your hairline, ears and neck to prevent staining. If you do get it on your skin, as long as you wash it off quickly, the stain will wear off quickly. We&#x27;ve found that 2 hours has been working best for her medium blonde hair, the 30 mins the instructions give is not long enough. With Manic Panic you don&#x27;t have to worry about your hair burning off if you leave it too long like caustic conventional dyes.</li>
            <li> The turquoise color is nice at first, but honestly to get it vibrant, you have to leave it in for an hour or more. It also fades VERY quickly. I grabbed this dye instead of Special Effects which is what I usually use. Never again. The dye is runny and just kinda goes everywhere. I get a ton of compliments when it&#x27;s freshly dyed, but otherwise it gets called  a green color. It&#x27;s an ugly green color too. I can&#x27;t wait until I can dye over this with some Special Effects.</li>
            <li> The product it&#x27;s self is great, it&#x27;s in a smaller bottle then I thought. Also you have to have either white hair or put some conditioner in it for a lighter color other then that it&#x27;s a correct color</li>
            <li> My favorite Manic Panic color. I&#x27;ve used this at least a half dozen times and keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> Okay, for starters I have been dyeing my hair for eleven years and know what I am doing. My hair is naturally a very dark brown, so I lighten it using a violet based bleach and a lower level developing cream (I find it does less damage to the hair even if I have to leave it on a bit longer), and I use a cuticle sealer and also a protein pre-dye treatment. Not only that but I have been dyeing my hair the same colours for most of those years. (For SpecialFX, Atomic Pink, Fishbowl, Blue Mayhem, Pimpin&#x27; Purple, for Punky Colour, Flamingo Pink, Violet, Teal and whatever the dark blue is). Due to a move to a different country (from the States to Germany) I had to hold off on dyeing my hair for quite awhile longer than I usually would as I was trying to find a place to purchase the things I would need. In a pinch, because the town I live in is very small and the only place that sells the items I wanted only sells to locally licensed stylists, that meant I had to turn to Amazon, and considering the cost of what I normally purchase (Punky or SpecialFX) I decided to go with Manic Panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atomic Turquoise - on very well lightened, healthy hair, left on for 9 hours, it came out as...looking like it will only take two or three shampoos before I&#x27;m left with a chlorine green tint. (I used an entire jar of this to cover a third of my hair, while for Punky which has a smaller quantity in the jar manages to cover, saturate, pigment, etc, my hair PROPERLY and I only go through half the jar, go figure - &#x27;savings&#x27; right there eaten up and then some)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultraviolet - this one isn&#x27;t so bad, but still I will have to reapply it far sooner than is even remotely acceptable (say two weeks rather than the six to eight weeks I&#x27;m used to for Pimpin&#x27; Purple or Violet). The dye itself is runny, doesn&#x27;t coat well, and slips from your hair rather than staying in place during the dying process. I&#x27;m unsatisfied with the colour, but that is a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shocking Blue - if this lasts more than three washes I&#x27;ll be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty Flamingo - unlike other brands that say \\&quot;flamingo\\&quot; this is like the coral coloured tips of a flamingo&#x27;s feathers and very washed out, unlike the bright fuchsias or strong pinks or purple tinted pinks of other brands. Frankly it&#x27;s hideous. It isn&#x27;t even bright. Not even on nearly white hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ManicPanic was a *horrible* investment and I shouldn&#x27;t have deviated from my usual preferences. While true everyone has different hair, different porosity and different expectations, my expectations and experience is that if I have to leave semi permanent dye on for more than 4hrs to have a hope of gaining pigmentation - it is worthless. If I have to redye my hair in less than a month - again, worthless. If the application is like taking a bottle of watered down yogurt and glooping it on my head so it slides everywhere - worthless. (For the record no I did not gloop and pour the contents of the ManicPanic jar over my head, but even with a tint brush it still managed to do just that.) Yes, my preferred brands and colours cost more initially, but for pigment and durability - my time is also money, you know? If this could have a negative review, I would give it without thought. If you&#x27;ve used ManicPanic and it works for you - good on you. But it didn&#x27;t for me and I don&#x27;t see how it could for others after getting a good look at how the product coats or depth of the pigments..  Shocking Blue - if this lasts more than three washes I&#x27;ll be surprised.

            <li> This was the BRIGHTEST, prettiest, most intense color we have tried from Manic Panic and we will definitely buy it again.  I would recommend using a color protecting shampoo to make the color last longer.  In the sunlight it had hints of other blues and greens and we had many comments on how pretty and bright the color was.  We used the entire bottle on my sons hair (short) versus about half of the container (which we&#x27;ve done in the past), so that may have been the key.  The only downside is that we wish the color lasted longer and didn&#x27;t fade as fast.</li>
            <li> I went to go get my hair done, and I took my own dye; as a result, my hair came out just how i wanted it, so whoever would like their hair to look green but yet kind of blue, i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product sucked. After completely bleaching my hair and applying Manic Panic, I had hoped my hair was going to turn out turquoise, as in the photos on the company website. However, it turned out lime green and then faded to yellow-green after the first wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting this hair dye for years now and I love it, but I&#x27;d like to share a few tips of mine. I recommend mixing this hair dye with some kind of conditioner or deep conditioner. I prefer mixing it with wen hair care cleansing conditioner and an 8th cup of argan oil. I like to leave mine in over night. For me, the colour lasts up to 2 months and there&#x27;s no damage that I can see. From my observations, it&#x27;s actually been getting healthier. My hair used to be totally fried, but now it&#x27;s silky and manageable and without split ends.</li>
            <li> Really nice bold color. Not exactly what color I wanted, but it did turn out lovely. The better you bleach your hair, the better the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand a few times, and have just gone back to having Atomic Turquoise hair again. I mix it up in a bowl with one part conditioner to two parts dye, and then leave it on underneath a shower cap for a few hours. Your hair will feel lovely and soft, and I&#x27;m sure it appreciates the love if you&#x27;ve just bleached your hair like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is past my shoulders by an inch or so, and based on my conditioner/dye ratio I used about three quarters of the pot. The remaining dye I&#x27;ll be mixing into some conditioner to use as a top up between dye jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will see a lot of color coming out when you shower, but don&#x27;t be alarmed! It just looks a lot because it&#x27;s so pigmented. It will last a long time, and if you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ll find that your roots need re-bleaching long before you need to touch up your color.</li>
            <li> The product features pretty much lie when they say that the fading is gradual. The first time I washed this it turned my hair downright moldy-looking. Although, this could probably be the fact that it is turquoise. I bought this because when I think turquoise, I think a pretty bluegreen shade. This made me look kinda gross. I found this product very frustrating, and probably would not recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> The color is lovely and the product is very nice. Not as permanent or easy to extract as Special Effects, but definitely lives up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;The product came in on time and was packaged neatly and wasn&#x27;t a fuss to get out. Thank you for such quality service.</li>
            <li> used it for my dip dye and it turned out really good after bleaching it. i highly recommend this color and this seller.</li>
            <li> I ordered Atomic Turquoise. This color is SO vibrant and velvety looking. Nice pigmented color. Used it on hair that had some washed out purple, and the purple turned to a vibrant blue. It looks wonderful. Also there were patches of hair that weren&#x27;t completely white/blonde, and it did an awesome job of covering it with color. Shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li> ES UN EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, ME ENCANTA, LO RECOMIENDO 100%, EL PRECIO ES JUSTO Y ES UN BUEN PRODUCTO PARA EL CABELLO</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color! I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years now and this is my favorite shade of blue.</li>
            <li> If you have darker hair, you must pre-lighten or this will not work. HOWEVER, for BEST results, you&#x27;d have to lighten hair as blond as possible! If left at only a yellowish shade, your hair will eventually turn GREEN!  I colored my teen daughter&#x27;s hair and it was beautiful the first day. But then after that, it started turning green. Then I realized why... Blue &amp; yellow make green! To get rid of green, we used a bright red shade of Manic Panic. That worked nicely, since red cancels green. Too bad the blue only worked for a day.  But there&#x27;s no way in hell I&#x27;m coloring my daughter&#x27;s hair to a platinum blond just for a temporary blue.</li>
            <li> I used this dye in Atomic Turqouise over some seriously stubborn leftover pink (and i mean hot, hot pink) hair and it completely covered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Manic Panic can be a bit hit or miss (i lov their hot hot pink but their rockabilly blue was horrible.) . It not only covered the pink completely, it took quite a few washes to get it to start fading. (not that i wanted it to, but i expected it to fade much more quickly than it did. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I leave all dyes on my hair for at least 4 hours, wrapped in saran wrap, as this tends to help seal in the color. I also pre-rinse with white vinegar to help &#x27;set&#x27; the color before washing it completely out of my hair. I am so very impressed with this dye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing to help with fading issues- use cold water and a silicone free conditioner to wash your hair. I was super skeptical because my hair/scalp tends to get oily quickly, but i&#x27;ve been using Suave (of all things!) clarifying conditioner in Key Lime and it cleans my hair perfectly without fading my color.</li>
            <li> When I used this color, it turned out very close to a Kelly Green in my hair. After washing, it faded to a teal-ish color that still had too much green in it. I started out with brown hair, so that may have affected the color quite a bit, but even after four or five weeks, the color is not what I&#x27;d expected. I definitely recommend doing a strand test if the exact color result is important to you.</li>
            <li> this product did not work at all! i followed all thhe instruction to every last detail. i do not recommend this product nor the brand</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this to color a portion of her hair. She&#x27;s a redhead, so she first had to bleach the hair to be colored. Manic Panic was then applied according to directions. The final color was definitely more green than blue, but looks good and has stayed for weeks now. Plus it&#x27;s not harmful to the hair shaft (good thing, since bleaching process is.)</li>
            <li> I really love the color, but it fades after only a few washes to an icky greenish color. This is expected with blue dye; I was just hoping it&#x27;d last a little longer. All in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, smells good and so easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Favorite color from Manic Panic.  The Turquoise fades to a great green color and seems to last forever on bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried manic panic before (Cotton Candy Pink and Atomic Turquoise) and it did not work out very well (it was very faint and faded so quickly). It&#x27;s been about a year now and I decided to try it again (on already blue, but faded, hair). I mixed Bad Boy Blue and Atomic Turquoise together.. WOW!!!!! The color of the dye on my hair was the exact color it came out to be (which is beautiful!!).&lt;br /&gt;A few tips when using manic panic (or any other crazy color :p):&lt;br /&gt;*(ONLY) Shampoo your hair and then blow dry it right before dying it (get it as dry as possible without killing your hair!)&lt;br /&gt;*Leave on for at least a few hours&lt;br /&gt;*Use a hair dryer and COMPLETELY dry it (it&#x27;ll feel kind of crunchy)&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t shampoo it when you rinse it out (unless you want to lighten the color)&lt;br /&gt;*Shampoo your hair as LITTLE as possible!! (it&#x27;s ok to condition it every time you take a shower, but only shampoo it once or twice a week.. unless it gets wicked nasty)&lt;br /&gt;*Be careful when you&#x27;re going swimming.. it may bleed (it&#x27;s not as bad with manic panic as it is with other dyes)&lt;br /&gt;*It stains... VERY easily!!! Lay down a towel on the sink when you&#x27;re dying your hair or else it WILL stain it&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about it(:</li>
            <li> I love Manic Panic simply because I&#x27;ve used products like Splat, where it&#x27;s almost all liquid and when you&#x27;re working with a purple or bright blue... liquid is just a diaster waiting to happen. This is more like a lotion, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. It&#x27;s vegan too.</li>
            <li> I love manic panic I won&#x27;t use any other color. The colors came in very fast and I&#x27;m always satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> While it lasts longer then most brands we have used the color did not come out to be a turquoise color at all and was more of a green color over all.</li>
            <li> This turquoise hair dye is great: easy to use, vibrant color.  It was used on natural hair colors of light and medium brown and worked great.</li>
            <li> Atomic turquoise, on unbleached natural blonde hair, came out a gorgeous vibrant lush teal. I bought this, Blue Moon, Rockabilly Blue, and Venus Envy, and used them in random streaks. None of the other colors came out particularly well-- or badly-- but the sections I did with the Atomic Turquoise came out gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it about two weeks now and the other colors are fading a bit-- I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily, and when I do I don&#x27;t use hot water, am sparing with shampoo, and rinse with white vinegar-- but the turquoise is holding pretty steady. And my hair is so soft, I can use a lot less hydrating products than I normally do. (I frequently put coconut or jojoba oil on my ends, especially since it&#x27;s winter, and I haven&#x27;t really had to since the dye.)&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, definitely wear rubber gloves, and a shower cap. I left it on for a few hours, twisted up in foil and under a shower cap; I wore a wool hat over the top to help &#x27;cook&#x27; the dye a little bit. It was so fun and so easy I don&#x27;t know why I waited like 20 years to do this, I&#x27;ve been wanting to since I was a teenager. LOL.</li>
            <li> Over priced for the amount received, I am pretty sure it was part of a set of colors they sell individually</li>
