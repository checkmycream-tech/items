            <li>I just received this perfume oil, and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>The kind of screechy that gives you a metallic taste in your mouth and makes your teeth ache.</li>
            <li>Nice for around 6 hours and then seems to be gone.</li>
            <li>After a while it became kind of cloying almost metallic smelling on me</li>
            <li>A really nice scent.  </li>

            <li>Ginger, Lily, Iris, Tuberose, Rose, Jasmine, Hyacinth, Saffron, Shamamatul Amber,</li>

            <li>Very wearable, and very pleasant to smell on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The swiss Arabia Noora is a product of this great fragrance of natural products, great flavor</li>
            <li>This is by far the best perfume I ever had.</li>
            <li>It is mild and pleasant...</li>
            <li>Middle notes are the best.</li>

            <li>I love this attar</li>
            <li>&amp; I will be ordering more once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li>So for the price its ok.</li>
            <li>but once it starts to warm on your skin it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My sister loves this more than I do, so I gave it to her.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the musky side,  but i still love it.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to see it on my doorstep...</li>
            <li>Interesting.</li>
            <li>love the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, lots of musky after notes without feeling too cloying.</li>
            <li>It stays for quite some time and is unmistakable without being too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This one smells lovely on my mom.</li>
            <li>As it ages, it becomes more of a musky floral.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my wrist whenever I wear it :)  </li>
            <li>It stays a bright, fruity honeyed scent, with a light floral overlayer, and the oud and musk keep it from being too sweet.</li>
            <li>It stays a bright, fruity honeyed scent, with a light floral overlayer, and the oud and musk keep it from being too sweet.</li>
            <li>Decent but not that great</li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrance, and stays on you for a long time, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent would be &#x27;ok&#x27; if it weren&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li>This is ok but its not the rich floral type, its more of a mix floral</li>
            <li>This is a very sweet and spicy smell.</li>
            <li>found a more detailed description of its composition than appears on this listing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>It is extremely strong.</li>
            <li>It smells very good and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>It is nice for a clean fresh out the shower smell.</li>
            <li>One drop of this oil is so strong I can&#x27;t enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>If it were a sound it would be screechy.</li>
            <li>These probably smell much better on darker complected people; I am about as Caucasian as they come - fair skin, blonde hair, light eyes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it out and don&#x27;t know if i will since it is so light.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a  very pretty bottle and the fragrance is unforgettable and it&#x27;s lasts a long time:)</li>
            <li>Noora is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing scent!</li>
            <li>If anyone is interested in getting more Swiss arbaian products I also go to Insiyahatoor.com</li>
            <li>It did, fortunately, and quite quickly.</li>
            <li>It did, fortunately, and quite quickly.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this perfume a try since I&#x27;ve seen so many positive reviews on it.</li>
            <li>This one is a very sweet yet crisp perfume.</li>
            <li>thia is beatiful smell,romantic and sweet</li>
            <li>THEM.Noora has a sweet cherry floral scent to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet smelling &amp; lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and floral, with a bit of saffron and musk to balance it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just that it is cloying and overly sweet.</li>
            <li>This is what you would want and expect from a good middle eastern scent.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s so strong smelling</li>
            <li>The scent is delightful, long lasting and alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Very pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>Noora is a very pretty scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a remarkably well-balanced and complex mukhallat: nothing is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Although it is strong it&#x27;s very sensual, feminine smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a remarkably well-balanced and complex mukhallat: nothing is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The fragrance starts a with a soft orange like Vanilla and then softens to a warm and pleasant slightly floral musky vanilla.</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft, and sophisitcated, long-lasting, and the price is right!!</li>
            <li>Everyone who&#x27;s smelled this comments how darned pretty it is!</li>
            <li>thanks for reading my review!!</li>
            <li>love it long lasting excellent starting note to a very lingering finish I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It contains very pleasant smell and long lasting...</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>I purchased Warda which is a fresh flowery scent for myself, Dhikra and Noora as well for my mom</li>
            <li>Really worth 18 bucks.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice..it evaporates quick on me</li>
            <li>smells very good and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Sweet and feminine, didn&#x27;t deepen much.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe what a truly pretty perfume this is for under $11.</li>
            <li>first it smells a bit almondy</li>
            <li>This is such a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is my first perfume oil</li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle, I caught the strongest scent of almonds.</li>
            <li>At first, it reminds me a berry-flavored cake with a lemony icing.</li>
            <li>first time I put it on, my son walked into my office and said it smelled like the flowery ozone smell of the air before a thunderstorm.</li>
            <li>It is sweet, which I don&#x27;t normally like, but here it just works.  </li>
            <li>I use it at home when i just want to feel pretty in my pjs.</li>
            <li>Intrigued by other reviewers&#x27; assertions that this was a nice orange blossom scent, I hit the purchase button and eagerly awaited its arrival.</li>
            <li>The bottle is elegant  and really does last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a lovely product for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Pleasant enough at first but absolutely no hint of orange blossom.</li>
            <li>Oud is nice, but it&#x27;s so very pervasive, and I really didn&#x27;t want something that was going to be All About Oud, or so oud-y that it was just going to clobber the other notes into submission.</li>
            <li>Oud is nice, but it&#x27;s so very pervasive, and I really didn&#x27;t want something that was going to be All About Oud, or so oud-y that it was just going to clobber the other notes into submission.</li>
            <li>It really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I really like it and plan on buying it again.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>fast service</li>
            <li>This come in a gorgeous bottle with a glass applicator, its was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>On first application on the skin it was a moderately sweet/sugary/nutty smell but after rubbing it into the skin a little more the scent became stronger and to me seemed very floral and extremely sweet.</li>
            <li>Can be a little strong when first applied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an example of high quality without paying a fortune.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This has a strange note that seems headache-inducing in a sweet and citrusy way.  </li>
            <li>I am from East Asia too and it really made me wonder as to why I spend on other perfumes here which contain chemicals when we have always had such healthy and environment-friendly nature-based perfume oils in our culture for ages.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet, vanilla- flower perfume, different and long</li>
            <li>Smells like old lady!</li>
            <li>The bottle is as pictured...very pretty and different</li>
            <li>I was excited by the description of orange blossom and honey, but this is an odd scent.  </li>
            <li>No offense to the old ladies that like this sort of thing.</li>
            <li>, I recommend to all young people who do not know what I know.</li>
            <li>the dry down is just ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not usually a fan of sweet or floral scents, preferring predominately green or woody ones.</li>
            <li>it is a light powdery scent with a subtle floral on me, without much sillage.</li>
            <li>Secondly, i echo another reviewer&#x27;s post...smells like old lady.</li>
            <li>The scent is too strong and just too different for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not going to work for others.</li>
            <li>Powerful and long lasting, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not familiar, it&#x27;s that woody, almost acrid, and very strong note -- it&#x27;s a common basenote in a lot of mukhallats.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not familiar, it&#x27;s that woody, almost acrid, and very strong note -- it&#x27;s a common basenote in a lot of mukhallats.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super long lasting, so a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Lovely scent, lots of musky after notes without feeling too cloying.</li>
            <li> It stays for quite some time and is unmistakable without being too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This one smells lovely on my mom.</li>
            <li> As it ages, it becomes more of a musky floral.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my wrist whenever I wear it :)  </li>
            <li> It stays a bright, fruity honeyed scent, with a light floral overlayer, and the oud and musk keep it from being too sweet.</li>
            <li> It stays a bright, fruity honeyed scent, with a light floral overlayer, and the oud and musk keep it from being too sweet.</li>
            <li> Decent but not that great</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, and stays on you for a long time, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent would be &#x27;ok&#x27; if it weren&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li> This is ok but its not the rich floral type, its more of a mix floral</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet and spicy smell.</li>
            <li> found a more detailed description of its composition than appears on this listing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> It is extremely strong.</li>
            <li> It smells very good and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is nice for a clean fresh out the shower smell.</li>
            <li> One drop of this oil is so strong I can&#x27;t enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> If it were a sound it would be screechy.</li>
            <li> These probably smell much better on darker complected people; I am about as Caucasian as they come - fair skin, blonde hair, light eyes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it out and don&#x27;t know if i will since it is so light.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a  very pretty bottle and the fragrance is unforgettable and it&#x27;s lasts a long time:)</li>
            <li> Noora is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing scent!</li>

            <li> It did, fortunately, and quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this perfume a try since I&#x27;ve seen so many positive reviews on it.</li>
            <li> This one is a very sweet yet crisp perfume.</li>
            <li> thia is beatiful smell,romantic and sweet</li>
            <li> THEM.Noora has a sweet cherry floral scent to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet smelling &amp; lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and floral, with a bit of saffron and musk to balance it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just that it is cloying and overly sweet.</li>
            <li> This is what you would want and expect from a good middle eastern scent.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s so strong smelling</li>
            <li> The scent is delightful, long lasting and alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Very pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> Noora is a very pretty scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a remarkably well-balanced and complex mukhallat: nothing is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Although it is strong it&#x27;s very sensual, feminine smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a remarkably well-balanced and complex mukhallat: nothing is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The fragrance starts a with a soft orange like Vanilla and then softens to a warm and pleasant slightly floral musky vanilla.</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft, and sophisitcated, long-lasting, and the price is right!!</li>
            <li> Everyone who&#x27;s smelled this comments how darned pretty it is!</li>
            <li> thanks for reading my review!!</li>
            <li> love it long lasting excellent starting note to a very lingering finish I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It contains very pleasant smell and long lasting...</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> I purchased Warda which is a fresh flowery scent for myself, Dhikra and Noora as well for my mom</li>
            <li> Really worth 18 bucks.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice..it evaporates quick on me</li>
            <li> smells very good and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Sweet and feminine, didn&#x27;t deepen much.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a truly pretty perfume this is for under $11.</li>
            <li> first it smells a bit almondy</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is my first perfume oil</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle, I caught the strongest scent of almonds.</li>
            <li> At first, it reminds me a berry-flavored cake with a lemony icing.</li>
            <li> first time I put it on, my son walked into my office and said it smelled like the flowery ozone smell of the air before a thunderstorm.</li>
            <li> It is sweet, which I don&#x27;t normally like, but here it just works.  </li>
            <li> I use it at home when i just want to feel pretty in my pjs.</li>
            <li> Intrigued by other reviewers&#x27; assertions that this was a nice orange blossom scent, I hit the purchase button and eagerly awaited its arrival.</li>
            <li> The bottle is elegant  and really does last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a lovely product for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Pleasant enough at first but absolutely no hint of orange blossom.</li>
            <li> Oud is nice, but it&#x27;s so very pervasive, and I really didn&#x27;t want something that was going to be All About Oud, or so oud-y that it was just going to clobber the other notes into submission.</li>
            <li> Oud is nice, but it&#x27;s so very pervasive, and I really didn&#x27;t want something that was going to be All About Oud, or so oud-y that it was just going to clobber the other notes into submission.</li>
            <li> It really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I really like it and plan on buying it again.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> fast service</li>
            <li> This come in a gorgeous bottle with a glass applicator, its was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> On first application on the skin it was a moderately sweet/sugary/nutty smell but after rubbing it into the skin a little more the scent became stronger and to me seemed very floral and extremely sweet.</li>
            <li> Can be a little strong when first applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an example of high quality without paying a fortune.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This has a strange note that seems headache-inducing in a sweet and citrusy way.  </li>
            <li> I am from East Asia too and it really made me wonder as to why I spend on other perfumes here which contain chemicals when we have always had such healthy and environment-friendly nature-based perfume oils in our culture for ages.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sweet, vanilla- flower perfume, different and long</li>
            <li> Smells like old lady!</li>
            <li> The bottle is as pictured...very pretty and different</li>
            <li> I was excited by the description of orange blossom and honey, but this is an odd scent.  </li>
            <li> No offense to the old ladies that like this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> , I recommend to all young people who do not know what I know.</li>
            <li> the dry down is just ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually a fan of sweet or floral scents, preferring predominately green or woody ones.</li>
            <li> it is a light powdery scent with a subtle floral on me, without much sillage.</li>
            <li> Secondly, i echo another reviewer&#x27;s post...smells like old lady.</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong and just too different for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not going to work for others.</li>
            <li> Powerful and long lasting, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not familiar, it&#x27;s that woody, almost acrid, and very strong note -- it&#x27;s a common basenote in a lot of mukhallats.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not familiar, it&#x27;s that woody, almost acrid, and very strong note -- it&#x27;s a common basenote in a lot of mukhallats.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s super long lasting, so a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It is a little stronger than normal western perfumes so if you are too sensitive then be careful.</li>
            <li> The first hit to your nose is a little sharp</li>
            <li> I was looking for a scent that was long lasting &amp; with an Arabic hue, I found it!</li>
            <li> last long, and just melt on to the skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to you if your are not toooo sensitive to the little perfumes..</li>
            <li> It wears very well, but closer to the skin than I expected -- not a lot of sillage (although I was wary of putting on too much, so may have underapplied.</li>
            <li> It wears very well, but closer to the skin than I expected -- not a lot of sillage (although I was wary of putting on too much, so may have underapplied.</li>
            <li> I was a little startled when I unscrewed the cap: the first thing that hit me -- and it hit hard -- was oud.</li>
            <li> I was a little startled when I unscrewed the cap: the first thing that hit me -- and it hit hard -- was oud.</li>
            <li> With oils, especially ones with oud, a little may go a long way.)</li>
            <li> You only need a little to smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> With oils, especially ones with oud, a little may go a long way.)</li>
            <li> is similar to some of Madini&#x27;s oils but softer and less</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I waited to order this because i had other items on my perfume list.</li>
            <li> I finally understand what other perfume reviewers mean when they describe a scent as screechy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, perfume is also heavy so be careful.</li>
            <li> I have since ordered other Swiss Arabian products-I am hooked!</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical buying online since I am not able to smell it.</li>
            <li> I suffered through two hours of an appalling odor that I am at a loss to properly describe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sad that the scent doesn&#x27;t stay around for long.</li>
            <li> A very small amount dabbed behind the ear will last all day long.  </li>
            <li> I dabbed some on the backs of my hands, just a few drops, thinking it might morph into the sought-after orange blossom aroma I was promised.</li>
            <li> So if you do buy and the first application seems like you got a bad batch, don&#x27;t give up on</li>
            <li> so I decided with my past experience and the price if I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> the more cloying, stinky-sweet and pervasively awful it became.</li>
            <li> Hard to smell orange.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several American perfumes but were very disappointed at the quality.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something in it that truly stinks, like a public bathroom that was sprayed with chemical air freshener in a failed attempt to disguise the stench of uncleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> should mention that it smelled absolutely awful the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> At least the bottle wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Even after thoroughly washing my hands I could still smell it faintly.</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all very artificial smell</li>
            <li> But Noora is an exception, probably because of the oudh, civet and patchouli in the base notes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, and stays on you for a long time, too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a truly pretty perfume this is for under $11. It&#x27;s orange blossom, honey, and musk, bittersweet and charming. Since it&#x27;s oil-based, it stays close to the skin with minimum sillage. So you can wear it to work or on the metro, no problem. Everyone who&#x27;s smelled this comments how darned pretty it is! Springtime in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to smell the perfume once it arrived and guess what? It really exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s such a lovely product for such a cheap price. I am from East Asia too and it really made me wonder as to why I spend on other perfumes here which contain chemicals when we have always had such healthy and environment-friendly nature-based perfume oils in our culture for ages.</li>
            <li> thia is beatiful smell,romantic and sweet</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged.Sturdy bottle with glass applicator.Hard to smell orange. Middle notes are the best.Can be a little strong when first applied.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with a nice orange blossom note, and this had popped up in reviews. Since I prefer oils anyway and like mukhallats, this seemed ideal -- and the price is great. I was a little startled when I unscrewed the cap: the first thing that hit me -- and it hit hard -- was oud. If you&#x27;re not familiar, it&#x27;s that woody, almost acrid, and very strong note -- it&#x27;s a common basenote in a lot of mukhallats. It&#x27;s not listed, but it&#x27;s there and it makes its presence known. Oud is nice, but it&#x27;s so very pervasive, and I really didn&#x27;t want something that was going to be All About Oud, or so oud-y that it was just going to clobber the other notes into submission. But underneath was a fruity-candy-floral, which I hoped was robust enough to emerge from that initial oud onslaught. It did, fortunately, and quite quickly. It stays a bright, fruity honeyed scent, with a light floral overlayer, and the oud and musk keep it from being too sweet. It&#x27;s a remarkably well-balanced and complex mukhallat: nothing is overwhelming. It wears very well, but closer to the skin than I expected -- not a lot of sillage (although I was wary of putting on too much, so may have underapplied. With oils, especially ones with oud, a little may go a long way.) It&#x27;s not so orange-blossom as some reviews suggested (I&#x27;ll find that one perfect orange blossom scent eventually), but it&#x27;s a gorgeous scent.</li>
            <li> This come in a gorgeous bottle with a glass applicator, its was bigger than I expected. The fragrance starts a with a soft orange like Vanilla and then softens to a warm and pleasant slightly floral musky vanilla. it is lasting but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;This is similar to some of Madini&#x27;s oils but softer and less concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an example of high quality without paying a fortune.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical buying online since I am not able to smell it. But I have a friend from the Gulf who has bought me perfume oils and I loved them all so I decided with my past experience and the price if I don&#x27;t like it I would not have lost much.&lt;br /&gt;At first it smells a bit almondy but then it transforms into a pleasant, feminine smell. Many people have asked me what I am wearing and commented how great I smell. I have since ordered other Swiss Arabian products-I am hooked!</li>
            <li> It is one of the pleasant perfumes that I have ever came across with....I bought it as I got inspired by one of my friends. It is mild and pleasant... However one the uncle did not like it as he said it has a smell of oudh. I like it and everybody else whom I offer likes it. I gave is as a present to on of my friends travel back to home. I would recommend this to you if your are not toooo sensitive to the little perfumes..lest you may not like it. Otherwise it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Loving this body oil.</li>
            <li> I just started purchasing Arabian perfumes because I got a bottle as a gift and now I am HOOKED. I just received a swift delivery which I am so pleased about and this fragrance smells AMAZING. It&#x27;s a good buy for your money. I have purchased several American perfumes but were very disappointed at the quality. I will only buy Arabian oils from now on. I LOVE THEM.Noora has a sweet cherry floral scent to me. I really like it and plan on buying it again. I wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Very potent oil....it&#x27;s strong. A little goes a long way. Although it is strong it&#x27;s very sensual, feminine smell. Smells like patchouli, sandalwood, and hint of jasmine. Not overly feminine or floral.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scented oil. Its exotic and dreamy. A drop on the skin will last me around 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume. It&#x27;s very sweet, vanilla- flower perfume, different and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;However, perfume is also heavy so be careful. You only need a little to smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> I just received this perfume oil, and I&#x27;m thrilled. It&#x27;s a beautiful oriental floral, and then some with its spicy hints. As it is a concentrated oil, you only need a tiny bit, and the fragrance stays with you all day. So glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It smells very good and stays on for a long time. I will be buying more. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this!!! it&#x27;s a  very pretty bottle and the fragrance is unforgettable and it&#x27;s lasts a long time:) will order more!!!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely wonderful buy.  The scent is delightful, long lasting and alcohol free.  My product arrived swiftly and I had a wonderful experience ordering from this seller.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell when I opened it. But when I put it on, I realized it was beautiful. Do not judge smell based on just opening it, because it&#x27;s a combined concentrated and condensed version of what you put on. It comes off amazing! Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love it.  got here on time  and no problems. smells very good and last a long time. very happy I ordered it</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy it by the gallon. Smooth, soft, and sophisitcated, long-lasting, and the price is right!! I guess there are REASONS why so many perfumes from Arab states have won Fifi Awards!</li>
            <li> Hi my all friends I have Noora Swiss Arabian  attar I got 8/26/2013 I never see  like this attar I love this attar I say this is best in world I will give you addvais you want to buy attar so buy Noora Swiss Arabian attar</li>
            <li> Decent but not that great</li>
            <li> I was looking for a scent that was long lasting &amp; with an Arabic hue, I found it! I love, love, love this oil!! It&#x27;s sweet smelling &amp; lasts for hours. Well worth the price &amp; I will be ordering more once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> While searching for another perfume oil I like to wear, came across this item and after reading the reviews decided to order and I&#x27;m glad I did because it smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> love the product because it smells great and the sent last along time ! I never have tried any swiss Arabian products but it has met my expectations and more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thanks for reading my review!!</li>
            <li> This is ok but its not the rich floral type, its more of a mix floral and I could not quite make out anything out of this and the dry down is just ok. So for the price its ok.</li>
            <li> I read about this on a fragrance blog when I was researching fragrances using orange blossoms, and had to try it.  The first hit to your nose is a little sharp but once it starts to warm on your skin it is fantastic.  Strangers in public are always asking what perfume I have on when I wear this.  Sometimes I have to tell them what brand and how I ordered and they put it in their phone.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this perfume a try since I&#x27;ve seen so many positive reviews on it. I am also a fan of perfume oils since alcohol-based ones tend to give me a headache. After trying on Noora, I am wowed! I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist. It&#x27;s sweet and floral, with a bit of saffron and musk to balance it out. And it&#x27;s super long lasting, so a little bit goes a long way! I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this Perfume!!! Smells delicious!! fast service</li>
            <li> My sister loves this more than I do, so I gave it to her. The scent is too strong and just too different for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not going to work for others.</li>
            <li> love it long lasting excellent starting note to a very lingering finish I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely fragrance.  A very small amount dabbed behind the ear will last all day long.  Noora is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Powerful and long lasting, a tiny bit goes a long way. Sweet and feminine, didn&#x27;t deepen much. A bit too one-note for me.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s so strong smelling it actually gave me a headache by just using 1, i repeat 1 drop to test on my wrist. Secondly, i echo another reviewer&#x27;s post...smells like old lady. No offense to the old ladies that like this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> I really like the Swiss Arabian oils as a rule, but this is one of the few exceptions that I didn&#x27;t immediately adore.  I was excited by the description of orange blossom and honey, but this is an odd scent.  I finally understand what other perfume reviewers mean when they describe a scent as screechy.  This has a strange note that seems headache-inducing in a sweet and citrusy way.  If it were a sound it would be screechy. The kind of screechy that gives you a metallic taste in your mouth and makes your teeth ache. It also has a soapy undertone that just amplifies the screechiness.</li>
            <li> This is my first perfume oil and i love it. The bottle is elegant  and really does last. This isn&#x27;t my favorite scent. It&#x27;s a bit on the musky side,  but i still love it.</li>
            <li> The swiss Arabia Noora is a product of this great fragrance of natural products, great flavor but I think it emblagem podria be prettier, I recommend to all young people who do not know what I know.</li>
            <li> Smells like old lady!</li>
            <li> Intrigued by other reviewers&#x27; assertions that this was a nice orange blossom scent, I hit the purchase button and eagerly awaited its arrival. I was so pleased to see it on my doorstep...opened the package, uncapped the bottle and took a sniff. Interesting. Pleasant enough at first but absolutely no hint of orange blossom. I dabbed some on the backs of my hands, just a few drops, thinking it might morph into the sought-after orange blossom aroma I was promised. That didn&#x27;t happen, and the longer I kept it on, the more cloying, stinky-sweet and pervasively awful it became. I suffered through two hours of an appalling odor that I am at a loss to properly describe. Even after thoroughly washing my hands I could still smell it faintly. It&#x27;s not just that it is cloying and overly sweet. There&#x27;s something in it that truly stinks, like a public bathroom that was sprayed with chemical air freshener in a failed attempt to disguise the stench of uncleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it may be that my skin&#x27;s chemistry is not well suited to these Arab perfumes. I have tried several others from the Al-Rehab line and they didn&#x27;t work for me either. These probably smell much better on darker complected people; I am about as Caucasian as they come - fair skin, blonde hair, light eyes. Sigh. I gave this one to a Peruvian friend and she seemed to like it, so I hope it works out for her.</li>
            <li> love the way it smells on me. It has a clean and fresh scent. I will keep this in my collection</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, lots of musky after notes without feeling too cloying. I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments since I started wearing it this week. Very pretty bottle. I&#x27;m only sad that the scent doesn&#x27;t stay around for long. Nice for around 6 hours and then seems to be gone.</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet and spicy smell. It is extremely strong. This is what you would want and expect from a good middle eastern scent.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful scent it is bold and very popular with compliments. This is such an amazing scent! I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all very artificial smell no deep notes</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle, I caught the strongest scent of almonds. On first application on the skin it was a moderately sweet/sugary/nutty smell but after rubbing it into the skin a little more the scent became stronger and to me seemed very floral and extremely sweet. After a while it became kind of cloying almost metallic smelling on me and I think started to give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well. At least the bottle wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> A really nice scent.  Long lasting and beautiful.  I Would recommend to anyone loving perfume oils as I do.  Nice buy!</li>
            <li> It contains very pleasant smell and long lasting... I bought this for my hubby and he loves it... Definitely I buy once again....</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom who loves perfume oils. This one is a very sweet yet crisp perfume. It stays for quite some time and is unmistakable without being too overwhelming. I can&#x27;t wait to give it to my mom. She is going to be ecstatic!</li>
            <li> Wonderful Fragrances! I purchased Warda which is a fresh flowery scent for myself, Dhikra and Noora as well for my mom (she loves the sweeter scents). My mom loved the fragrances, it was something we weren&#x27;t used to but we have both received compliments on the scents. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;I loved the service from Mukhallat, very timely, well packaged, and just excellent service. I will continue to purchase from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last long, and just melt on to the skin. This one smells lovely on my mom. My dad loves it too! so I highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also try Warda, It just smells of spring!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with a nice orange blossom note, and this had popped up in reviews. Since I prefer oils anyway and like mukhallats, this seemed ideal -- and the price is great. I was a little startled when I unscrewed the cap: the first thing that hit me -- and it hit hard -- was oud. If you&#x27;re not familiar, it&#x27;s that woody, almost acrid, and very strong note -- it&#x27;s a common basenote in a lot of mukhallats. It&#x27;s not listed, but it&#x27;s there and it makes its presence known. Oud is nice, but it&#x27;s so very pervasive, and I really didn&#x27;t want something that was going to be All About Oud, or so oud-y that it was just going to clobber the other notes into submission. But underneath was a fruity-candy-floral, which I hoped was robust enough to emerge from that initial oud onslaught. It did, fortunately, and quite quickly. It stays a bright, fruity honeyed scent, with a light floral overlayer, and the oud and musk keep it from being too sweet. It&#x27;s a remarkably well-balanced and complex mukhallat: nothing is overwhelming. It wears very well, but closer to the skin than I expected -- not a lot of sillage (although I was wary of putting on too much, so may have underapplied. With oils, especially ones with oud, a little may go a long way.) It&#x27;s not so orange-blossom as some reviews suggested (I&#x27;ll find that one perfect orange blossom scent eventually), but it&#x27;s a gorgeous scent.</li>
            <li> One drop of this oil is so strong I can&#x27;t enjoy it.  It does not dissipate with time either....&lt;br /&gt;The scent would be &#x27;ok&#x27; if it weren&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li> Noora is a very pretty scent. At first, it reminds me a berry-flavored cake with a lemony icing. As it ages, it becomes more of a musky floral. Very wearable, and very pleasant to smell on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I put it on, my son walked into my office and said it smelled like the flowery ozone smell of the air before a thunderstorm. Which is about the nicest smell in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a more detailed description of its composition than appears on this listing. Here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top: Orange, Tangerine, Ylang ylang, Plum, Honey&lt;br /&gt;Heart: Ginger, Lily, Iris, Tuberose, Rose, Jasmine, Hyacinth, Saffron, Shamamatul Amber, Blackcurrant&lt;br /&gt;Base: Patchouli, Sandalwood, Musk, Dehn El Ood, Vanilla, Chocolate, Civet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually a fan of sweet or floral scents, preferring predominately green or woody ones. But Noora is an exception, probably because of the oudh, civet and patchouli in the base notes. I keep it on my desk and have been wearing it every day since it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that it smelled absolutely awful the first time I put it on. And then it seemed to come to some sort of agreement with my chemistry and it has been wonderful ever since. So if you do buy and the first application seems like you got a bad batch, don&#x27;t give up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. If you&#x27;re considering buying Noora, I encourage you to try it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best perfume I ever had. Really worth 18 bucks. It is a little stronger than normal western perfumes so if you are too sensitive then be careful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blind based on rave reviews from other perfume fanatics and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  It is sweet, which I don&#x27;t normally like, but here it just works.  I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my wrist whenever I wear it :)  This is a really good choice for anyone who is just beginning to get into Arabian oils.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice..it evaporates quick on me but it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I waited to order this because i had other items on my perfume list. I finally ordered  and when it arrived i couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The bottle is as pictured...very pretty and different so if you collect perfumes for the bottle this one will be a nice addition.  Anyway now for the scent...it is a light powdery scent with a subtle floral on me, without much sillage. It is nice for a clean fresh out the shower smell. I use it at home when i just want to feel pretty in my pjs. I haven&#x27;t worn it out and don&#x27;t know if i will since it is so light. When i put this on with powder scented deodorant it just blends lol&lt;br /&gt;Glad i tried it but if tou really want to ty these oils go with the smaller round roll on bottles sold here on amazon by al rashad... Those smell awesome, strong and exotic</li>
            <li> smell good, but sweetish</li>
            <li> I love this company! NOORA is on of my farvorite products. If anyone is interested in getting more Swiss arbaian products I also go to Insiyahatoor.com</li>
