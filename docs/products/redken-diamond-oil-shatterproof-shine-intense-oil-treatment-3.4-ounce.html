    <ol>
            <li>But I tried this at a salon and was impressed so even though it&#x27;s pricey, I ordered it and am very happy with how well it works....</li>
            <li>Her hair looks great!</li>
            <li>THE BEST OIL TREATMENT YOU CAN GIVE TO YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and the seller was awesome.</li>
            <li>Its awesome as a skin oil but still not working for a hair oil at all.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price!  </li>
            <li>but I just had a beautiful baby girl 4 months ago and now my hair isn&#x27;t so beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, very glad my hair dresser recommended it!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>Had a great price</li>
            <li>This one is OK, but probably not the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives it great shine and makes it look healthy!</li>
            <li>I will keep it because its also good for the skin</li>
            <li>The results are very quickly!!</li>
            <li>It also leaves a wonderful aroma on your skin and it really lift up my mood.</li>
            <li>do a really nice job of packaging this stuff</li>
            <li>and none have made my hair look and feel healthy with smoothness and shine as the redken products.  </li>
            <li>I also use the diamond oil by redden and love the fact that it adds luster and added smoothness without an oily feel.</li>
            <li>This stuff is BETTER the the Moroccan Oil and a much better price than what you can buy it for from&lt;br /&gt;Ulta.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
            <li>, I have a healthy shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I had more shine before I even put this on.</li>
            <li>This product is taming it and she looks lovely.  </li>
            <li>-- the bottle is lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the easiest hair oil to spread, but there are some tricks to distribute it more evenly.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for dryness.</li>
            <li>BUT IT TAMES IT PRETTY GOOD</li>
            <li>It&#x27; s the best product for damage and dry hair...</li>
            <li>My hair in more manageable, feels soft and great shine.  </li>
            <li>Pricey, smells good, really shines the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is now shiny and beautiful and lays down nicely.</li>
            <li>I have tried every product under the sun that promises to make my hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I then apply my Curl Formers and the combination leads to a smooth, frizz free curl.  </li>
            <li>I started using sulfate free shampoos and silicones can build up in hair</li>
            <li>My search for a silicone free serum and styler continues.</li>
            <li>Then lightly touch your hands to your hair so all the oil doesn&#x27;t come off in one place.</li>
            <li>any rate, this is definitely worth a try if you want more softness, shine, or frizz control.</li>
            <li>Works wonders on my dry hair and smells great too.</li>
            <li>Be sure and not use too much</li>
            <li>and my BF will generally comment on how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I was very much looking forward to getting this product - and it does not disappoint!  </li>
            <li>So far I love this.  </li>
            <li>The absolute best oil for coarse hair or mixed chicks hair.  </li>
            <li>and I desired the soft healthy feel of my hair after she styles it, so</li>
            <li>But when I get the amount right it really makes a huge difference</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>You may need to try it a time or two, to figure out the right amount for you.</li>
            <li>(My hairdresser sometimes uses this on me after I get a color touch up, so that&#x27;s a pretty strong endorsement from a professional!)</li>
            <li>(my philosophy is usually that if a little of something is good, then more must be better,</li>
            <li>The first wash I saw results.</li>
            <li>Second wash more improvement.</li>
            <li>like to use it as a treatment before a shower (more than 3-4 drops.. maybe 6-8), then I wash my hair and mix 3-4 drops with my conditioner, and lastly mix 3-4 drops with about a quarter sized amount of Curl Junkie Curl Assurance Smoothing Lotion.  </li>
            <li>One and Only Argan Oil much better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used Diamond Oil I used WAY too much.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product for my dry, thick hair.</li>
            <li>for the product itself, I do think it&#x27;s pretty good at making my hair soft, and I haven&#x27;t had very much frizz lately, despite some rain.</li>
            <li>and I received it really fast.</li>
            <li>So it works reasonably well.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for better results, but it is just like every other hair serum on the market.</li>
            <li>Really brings the shine back instantly and makes hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>After that, brush pretty thoroughly with a natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it only takes a couple of drops to smooth our my frizzy and curly hair!</li>
            <li>My coconut oil, wich is only 8 dollars for a big tub works sooo much better at giving me shine and softness.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Most have been a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>so I switch to Amazon; love the product as I have ultra dry hair that only needs washing once/week.</li>
            <li>(I have color-treated hair and live somewhere with lots of humidity.)</li>
            <li>Occasionally I will use a tiny amount more AFTER I&#x27;ve dried my hair, just a single drop I rub between my palms first and then lightly run my hands over the ends of my hair -</li>
            <li>Not sure if I would buy&lt;br /&gt;it again, have found better products since.</li>
            <li>You can always start with a small amount and use more if that&#x27;s not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just ordered the complete line</li>
            <li>As a skin oil and let me tell you girls I cant believe how soft it is.</li>
            <li>The plus is that it is not as &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as other products and is easily absorbed in my hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s in a dropper, not sure how to use it, it hasn&#x27;t made a huge difference</li>
            <li>Correcting Treament (after washing my hair, while my hair is still wet) and the combination has really improved the health, feel and look of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although only a few drops are recommended on the box, you may need more depending on how dry your hair is, or how long your hair is.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair in which gets dry and frizzy tames and makes hair soft and manageable so as not to be called fuzzy being a guy with extremely long hair</li>
            <li>Well not with this...), and it was apparent that I&#x27;d used too much as my hair had a slightly heavy and greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fairly thick and hangs down to my waist, so I have to use more than the box recommends.</li>

            <li> I use it on towel-dried hair before blow-drying it, and the first few times I thought a few drops wouldn&#x27;t be enough</li>
            <li> My hair is long and dry (from years of coloring and heat-styling), as well as a bit coarse and curly.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to see just how much product is inside.</li>
            <li> I waited so long to order this product.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY COURSE THICK HAIR</li>
            <li> It did make it very soft but left it oily looking and dull.</li>
            <li> I have course, dry, processed hair and have tried aveda products, nexus therappe, biolage, etc., etc</li>
            <li> I put it on my dry crack heels and feet</li>
            <li> I have dry, graying and color treated hair...</li>
            <li> and since you only need a few drops, this bottle will last a loooooooong time.  </li>
            <li> First, apply it to the palms of your hands and rub it around to make a thin layer.</li>
            <li> a little over priced, I noticed a little bit of a difference in my hair but nothing major - will not be purchasing again once I run out...</li>
            <li> Product has had lots  of hype, I have thick, coarse dry hair and this oil not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I try to use this product everyday on my already dried (not wet) hair.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> and I should have ordered the other version, who knows.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because her hair is SO thick &amp; coarse</li>
            <li> Previously purchased from my hair salon for $60</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different hair oils lately in an attempt to tame my frizz.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my very thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little difficult to get the cap back on tightly, so be careful and don&#x27;t pick it up by the cap, ever, unless you want to risk spilling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sometimes it looks all dried out.  </li>
            <li> It might be this is just a bit too heavy</li>
            <li> so its been a few weeks now</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made of heavy, thick, dark glass</li>
            <li> My hair felt stronger and the dull look was toned down.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wirey hair that is dry</li>
            <li> usually I do this when I haven&#x27;t had a trim in a while</li>
            <li> It smelled like crisco oil, not the usual fragrance for this product.</li>
            <li> Sadly my ends were still dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing all this negative things about silicones and</li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick hair that bushes out.  </li>
            <li> It was weak falling out dull and just ugh.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> how bad they are for your hair.</li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have course, dry, processed hair and have tried aveda products, nexus therappe, biolage, etc., etc and none have made my hair look and feel healthy with smoothness and shine as the redken products.  I also use the diamond oil by redden and love the fact that it adds luster and added smoothness without an oily feel.</li>
            <li> I have not received it yet but I just had a beautiful baby girl 4 months ago and now my hair isn&#x27;t so beautiful. It was weak falling out dull and just ugh. I wasn&#x27;t happy. The first wash I saw results. My hair felt stronger and the dull look was toned down. Second wash more improvement. And the 3 wash it what sold me. I just ordered the complete line and I am so looking forward to the shatter proof oil as well.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for better results, but it is just like every other hair serum on the market. The plus is that it is not as &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as other products and is easily absorbed in my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is BETTER the the Moroccan Oil and a much better price than what you can buy it for from&lt;br /&gt;Ulta.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it only takes a couple of drops to smooth our my frizzy and curly hair!</li>
            <li> So far I love this.  Works wonders on my dry hair and smells great too.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my very thick, coarse hair</li>

Well not with this...), and it was apparent that I&#x27;d used too much as my hair had a slightly heavy and greasy feel.  But when I get the amount right it really makes a huge difference and my BF will generally comment on how nice my hair looks. Occasionally I will use a tiny amount more AFTER I&#x27;ve dried my hair, just a single drop I rub between my palms first and then lightly run my hands over the ends of my hair - usually I do this when I haven&#x27;t had a trim in a while and the ends are looking a bit beat up or split, this works well to seal those split ends until I can get back into the salon for a trim.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because her hair is SO thick &amp; coarse sometimes it looks all dried out.  She uses this &amp; gets shape &amp; shine.  Her hair looks great!</li>
            <li> a little over priced, I noticed a little bit of a difference in my hair but nothing major - will not be purchasing again once I run out...</li>
            <li> Pricey, smells good, really shines the hair. Pretty good for dryness. Not sure if I would buy&lt;br /&gt;it again, have found better products since. I would recommend it though.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a year, I cannot beleive what a difference it has made in my coarse, frizzy hair. My hair is now shiny and beautiful and lays down nicely. I use this in conjunction with Diamond Oil shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Excellet product! It&#x27; s the best product for damage and dry hair... The results are very quickly!! Astonished for this product.</li>
            <li> Really brings the shine back instantly and makes hair more manageable. Great stuff, very glad my hair dresser recommended it!</li>
            <li> works really well, but not as well as it used to a few years back. Manufacturing changes? Formula changes?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s in a dropper, not sure how to use it, it hasn&#x27;t made a huge difference</li>
            <li> THE BEST OIL TREATMENT YOU CAN GIVE TO YOUR HAIR MY HAIR IS LIKE A RUGGED FOREST AT TIMES BUT IT TAMES IT PRETTY GOOD I HAVE VERY COURSE THICK HAIR</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The first time I used Diamond Oil I used WAY too much.  You only need 3-4 drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist swears by this stuff.  When she applies it and blow dries my hair, I have a healthy shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it as a treatment before a shower (more than 3-4 drops.. maybe 6-8), then I wash my hair and mix 3-4 drops with my conditioner, and lastly mix 3-4 drops with about a quarter sized amount of Curl Junkie Curl Assurance Smoothing Lotion.  I then apply my Curl Formers and the combination leads to a smooth, frizz free curl.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Product has had lots  of hype, I have thick, coarse dry hair and this oil not strong enough. I am caucasian, not ethnic hair type.  One and Only Argan Oil much better and cheaper.  Also try Monoi oil by Mystic shine</li>
            <li> The absolute best oil for coarse hair or mixed chicks hair.  You&#x27;ll love it. Be sure and not use too much it penetrates well.</li>
            <li> I would not buy from this place again. It smelled like crisco oil, not the usual fragrance for this product.</li>
            <li> Previously purchased from my hair salon for $60 so I switch to Amazon; love the product as I have ultra dry hair that only needs washing once/week. I have used the product on my hands/nails as well</li>
            <li> Awesome product for my dry, thick hair. Gives it great shine and makes it look healthy!</li>
            <li> I waited so long to order this product. I have been hearing all this negative things about silicones and how bad they are for your hair. I started using sulfate free shampoos and silicones can build up in hair so I started looking for serums and conditioners with no silicones to style my hair. I ordered this and the seller was awesome. Had a great price and I received it really fast. I did not like it at all though. I have very thick wirey hair that is dry and this just made it stringy. It did make it very soft but left it oily looking and dull. I had more shine before I even put this on. I will keep it because its also good for the skin and I can also use it as a pree-poo but I am very disappointed. It might be this is just a bit too heavy and I should have ordered the other version, who knows. Not a fan of this oil at all. My coconut oil, wich is only 8 dollars for a big tub works sooo much better at giving me shine and softness. My search for a silicone free serum and styler continues. Might give Phyto a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. so its been a few weeks now and I have started using this oil to mioisturize my skin. As a skin oil and let me tell you girls I cant believe how soft it is. I put it on my dry crack heels and feet and it loos like I just had a pedicure. It also leaves a wonderful aroma on your skin and it really lift up my mood. Like aromatherapy or something. Its awesome as a skin oil but still not working for a hair oil at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick hair that bushes out.  This product is taming it and she looks lovely.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different hair oils lately in an attempt to tame my frizz. (I have color-treated hair and live somewhere with lots of humidity.) This one is OK, but probably not the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do a really nice job of packaging this stuff -- the bottle is lovely. However, it&#x27;s also a bit deceptive -- it&#x27;s made of heavy, thick, dark glass and it&#x27;s hard to see just how much product is inside. It&#x27;s also a little difficult to get the cap back on tightly, so be careful and don&#x27;t pick it up by the cap, ever, unless you want to risk spilling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I do think it&#x27;s pretty good at making my hair soft, and I haven&#x27;t had very much frizz lately, despite some rain. So it works reasonably well. It&#x27;s not the easiest hair oil to spread, but there are some tricks to distribute it more evenly. First, apply it to the palms of your hands and rub it around to make a thin layer. Then lightly touch your hands to your hair so all the oil doesn&#x27;t come off in one place. After that, brush pretty thoroughly with a natural bristle brush. Doing all this together will ensure even distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although only a few drops are recommended on the box, you may need more depending on how dry your hair is, or how long your hair is. My hair is fairly thick and hangs down to my waist, so I have to use more than the box recommends. You may need to try it a time or two, to figure out the right amount for you. You can always start with a small amount and use more if that&#x27;s not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this is definitely worth a try if you want more softness, shine, or frizz control. (My hairdresser sometimes uses this on me after I get a color touch up, so that&#x27;s a pretty strong endorsement from a professional!)</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair in which gets dry and frizzy tames and makes hair soft and manageable so as not to be called fuzzy being a guy with extremely long hair</li>
            <li> I have dry, graying and color treated hair...this is like miracle oil!  My hair in more manageable, feels soft and great shine.  I also like the Diamond line shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m out showering, I spritz a generous amount of detangler on my hair, brushed it and applied this oil on my ends. Sadly my ends were still dry and frizzy. But the problem might be that my hair condition is just way too damaged.</li>
            <li> I try to use this product everyday on my already dried (not wet) hair.  This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser who commented that it would help my hair repair (and alleviate the break-away issues I have been experiencing) from the extensive dying we have put it through recently.  (Brunette going blonde!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser regularly uses this product while I am in the salon and I desired the soft healthy feel of my hair after she styles it, so I was very much looking forward to getting this product - and it does not disappoint!  As soon as I received it in the mail I had to try it out for myself and instantly my hair felt silkier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with Pureology&#x27;s Essential Repair Split End Correcting Treament (after washing my hair, while my hair is still wet) and the combination has really improved the health, feel and look of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this product is everything I had hoped it would be!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
