            <li>So far I have been very pleased, I&#x27;ll keep reading up on different oils, keep learning all I can.</li>
            <li>After showering, I used it the first night I received it.  </li>
            <li>I used more oil the 2nd night......and so forth.  </li>
            <li>As with all oils, keep them away from direct heat and sunlight light.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to try all the Sublime Beauty natural oils product lines!  </li>
            <li>I am very interested in natural oils</li>
            <li>I find this oil to be very soothing for dry or irritated skin (though there are many uses and benefits.)  </li>
            <li>I was a bit uncertain using it as many oils do not absorb well on my skin even though it is very dry.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This is packaged and sealed very well.   </li>
            <li>Fast forward......</li>
            <li>This product has been keeping my skin moisturized and my eczema has been getting so much</li>
            <li>Silky rich oil absorbs very well, heals and moisturizes skin deeply.</li>
            <li>It is cleaner and soaks into my skin better than the other oil I had.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the past couple of weeks for a body moisturizer and love it!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s multiple benefits for centuries and is said to have special powers in resistance to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am finding Baobab Oil now in high end beauty</li>
            <li>The first application really did make a big difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Baobob oil is rich in multiple nutrients including 6x more vitamin C than oranges, calcium, potassium, zinc, magnesium, iron, vitamin A and a variety of complex B vitamins.</li>
            <li>This is a very large bottle, it should last for quite a while.</li>
            <li>oil is new to me</li>
            <li>Baobab Oil is new to me, as I have never heard about it before.</li>
            <li>I have lot of problems with eczema, my skin breaks out especially when it gets hot out.  </li>
            <li>lol  MAJOR FAIL.  </li>
            <li>Baobab Oil from Sublime Beauty is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>I have always been self conscious about these areas.  </li>
            <li>However, having soft skin wasn&#x27;t my goal.  </li>
            <li>Yes, this may sound very, very odd, BUT Baobob Oil does not feel oily.  </li>
            <li>Baobab oil moisturizer the skin, protects the skin from high and low temperatures, helps wounds to heal, a anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.  </li>
            <li>It is really helping the dry skin on my arms from being in the sun this summer!</li>
            <li>I awoke to extra soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a 6 month old scar on my elbow from surgery and have been using baboon oil on it daily.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve tried thus far</li>
            <li>My skin quickly absorbed the oil leaving very little oil left on my skin.  </li>

            <li> This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve tried thus far</li>
            <li> My skin quickly absorbed the oil leaving very little oil left on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little longer to absorb compared to other oils I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a front and center keeper.  </li>
            <li> Surely these claims are exaggerated!  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried Cocoa butter as well as countless other oils to lessen the appearance blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Also calcium, treatment, stretch marks, dry skin, eczema, psoriasis, post surgical scars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to soften dry skin and to help with eczema on my hands.  </li>
            <li> The scar seems to be flattening and is less red.</li>
            <li> I had very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I also have been using it on my dogs rough pads to soften them up and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  2).</li>
            <li> It is not as dark as it use to be which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is Resistant to Death, vital with secret powers antioxidants</li>
            <li> I started using the Baobob Oil and my eczema went away and calmed down in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have rough dry skin and a few scars that this does the trick on!!</li>
            <li> I was given a slight discount to review this item.</li>
            <li> The oil has a yellowish color and a slight odor.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on my c-section scar and it has faded a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried commercialized or harsh chemical peels because the long-term effects frighten me--Google it.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell already that I will have less scaring than past surgeries.</li>
            <li> I have been having an hard time figuring out what will help heal my hands.</li>
            <li> As a result, I was left with a terrible case of unsightly stretch marks---behind my knees, buttocks area, upper arm and breast area.  </li>
            <li> but it definitely confused me!</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema on my hands, scalp and leg.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked at all of the claims that were associated with Certified Organic Baobob Oil.  </li>
            <li> Even tho all of the ink has been zapped out, the scarring still bears its ugly head.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on you either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This oil is super moisturizing. It is really helping the dry skin on my arms from being in the sun this summer!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil to massage in and around a recent surgery incision and I can tell already that I will have less scaring than past surgeries. I also have been using it on my dogs rough pads to soften them up and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this baobab Oil!!  smells great and makes my dry skin so happy!!</li>
            <li> I have lot of problems with eczema, my skin breaks out especially when it gets hot out.  So now that it is summer my eczema is flaring up.  I started using the Baobob Oil and my eczema went away and calmed down in 2 days. The oil doesnt leave a oily feel on your skin and doesnt leave oil spots on cloths which is a HUGE plus. I would recommend this product. I was given a slight discount to review this item.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s spelled BAOBAB.  lol  MAJOR FAIL.  Wouldn&#x27;t use this garbage product if the seller cannot even spell it correctly.  LMAO</li>
            <li> I definetly think this oil is diminishing my stretch marks... I would absolutely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This organic baobob oil is fantastic.  I’m so happy I was able to purchase it at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased evaluation and review.  It is so much better than the last brand I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just last week, I threw away the baobob oil I had from a different company.  It just seemed to be off in some way, though I couldn’t place my finger on what it was.  As well, it came in a pump bottle and no matter what I did, it constantly plugged up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new Sublime Beauty organic baobob oil is fabulous.  It is cleaner and soaks into my skin better than the other oil I had.  It also has a very nice pop-up lid for dispensing, so it does not get plugged up.  I find this oil to be very soothing for dry or irritated skin (though there are many uses and benefits.)  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love, love this oil.  I tested it out on my hands and arm.  I had very dry skin.  And I was starting to get that post menopausal crepey skin on my arms.  The first application really did make a big difference.  While it does not make it disappear, it truly improves the look and feel.</li>
            <li> The tree is beautiful.  Baobab oil is excellent for the skin. Baobab oil moisturizer the skin, protects the skin from high and low temperatures, helps wounds to heal, a anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.  This is one oil that all homes should use. I am finding Baobab Oil now in high end beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;The Baobab Oil from Sublime Beauty is 100% natural. The bottle as 4 ounces of Baobab Oil which smell earthly.&lt;br /&gt;I use Baobab oil on my feet, for a massage, lips, and hair conditioner.  Makes my skin feel smooth and soft with no oily after affectes.</li>
            <li> Got this oil to use after surgery and I really like it. It absorb&#x27;s into the skin so oil doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes. Not much of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is new to me so I am still learning all the different uses for it, and there are many uses.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any improvements, but I just started using it (2 days ago).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an essential oil enthusiast and my purchase of USDA Certified Organic Baobob Oil has been an amazing asset to my collection. Also known as the tree of life, the baobob tree lives for up to 5,000 years, has been respected for it&#x27;s multiple benefits for centuries and is said to have special powers in resistance to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baobob oil is rich in multiple nutrients including 6x more vitamin C than oranges, calcium, potassium, zinc, magnesium, iron, vitamin A and a variety of complex B vitamins. Because of the many nutrients the oil is wonderful for the skin, especially for reducing scars and increasing elasticity. I use it as carrier oil and have had amazing results in treating my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I&#x27;ve used it in my homemade lotions and hair conditioners as well as using it to strengthen my fingernails. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review. Regardless, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would happily purchase again. I definitely recommend this product!!</li>

            <li> The Oil is great, even started to use it on my stretch marks, eventhough i dont think anything really helps with them, but it&#x27;s worth a try! The only problem i have with it, which isn&#x27;t a big problem... The Label says Baobob Oil, when it&#x27;s supposed to be Baobab Oil. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a reason for that but it definitely confused me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this oil!! I have rough dry skin and a few scars that this does the trick on!!</li>
            <li> This lightly scented oil is turning out to be one of my favs.  Honestly, I had never heard of it until about 2 weeks ago.  It&#x27;s not an oil that my local coop carries, nor is it advertised anywhere.  So.....when I saw it in a review group that I&#x27;m in, I immediately Googled it.  I was so shocked at all of the claims that were associated with Certified Organic Baobob Oil.  Surely these claims are exaggerated!  I HAD to purchase a bottle.  When I was a preteen (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now), I hit a rapid growth spurt.  As a result, I was left with a terrible case of unsightly stretch marks---behind my knees, buttocks area, upper arm and breast area.  I have always been self conscious about these areas.  Also, two years ago had a tattoo removed on my left arm.  Even tho all of the ink has been zapped out, the scarring still bears its ugly head.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried Cocoa butter as well as countless other oils to lessen the appearance blemishes.  I&#x27;ve never tried commercialized or harsh chemical peels because the long-term effects frighten me--Google it.  Yes, this may sound very, very odd, BUT Baobob Oil does not feel oily.  In fact, it feels light.  I have to ask myself, &#x27;How can something that doesn&#x27;t even feel oily be effective?&#x27;  Fast forward......After showering, I used it the first night I received it.  I noticed 2 things: 1). A little bit goes a long way.  2). My skin quickly absorbed the oil leaving very little oil left on my skin.  My skin does not feel greasy at all.  I awoke to extra soft skin.  However, having soft skin wasn&#x27;t my goal.  Ha!  But, I&#x27;ll take it.  I took my morning shower and used more oil.  I used more oil the 2nd night......and so forth.  I&#x27;ve used the oil for 7 mornings and 7 nights AND I can honestly say that I CAN see an improvement !!!  My skin is noticeably lighter.  In all honesty, I had planned to add this oil to my collection that didn&#x27;t work.  This is definitely a front and center keeper.  As with all oils, keep them away from direct heat and sunlight light.  If I haven&#x27;t reached my desired goal when this bottle is gone, I will be placing a second order.  I have received this oil at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This feels great on my skin.  It is just what my skin needs.  Feels wonderful and looks wonderful.  I have many skin oils I use for moisturizing but this is by far superior.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to soften dry skin and to help with eczema on my hands.  It worked fine for those purposes.  I had some scarring on my chest from wearing a heart rate monitor while running and the oil also helped to fade the scars.  Then I had some chafing from my armband while running and I tried some of this oil on that.  It helped to soothe the chafing and the area healed very quickly.  The oil has a yellowish color and a slight odor.  It absorbs into the skin quickly.  This is a very large bottle, it should last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. I have been having an hard time figuring out what will help heal my hands. I have really bad eczema on my hands, scalp and leg. This product has been keeping my skin moisturized and my eczema has been getting so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the only thing I have been using it on either. I have been using it on my c-section scar and it has faded a little bit. It is not as dark as it use to be which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe in what this product can do. I bet it can do so much more as well. It is all organic and very rich in nutrients. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on you either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at an discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Excellent for moisturizing and softening scars. I have a 6 month old scar on my elbow from surgery and have been using baboon oil on it daily. I have noticed a differance since using it. The scar seems to be flattening and is less red. I have tried coco butter but this seems to be doing a better job. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past couple of weeks for a body moisturizer and love it!  I&#x27;ve also used it on my face before bedtime and it truly softens the skin and I wake up to smoother and hydrated. I Especially love this for softening my feet and for my cuticles.  It does take a little longer to absorb compared to other oils I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  Makes my skin look so much better. I am excited to try all the Sublime Beauty natural oils product lines!  This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve tried thus far and I look forward to the next.</li>
            <li> very good product,  I use it on my scar</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I had never heard of it before Sublime Beauty offered it. I was a bit uncertain using it as many oils do not absorb well on my skin even though it is very dry. This oil is the exception as it absorbs well and leaves my skin nourished and moisturized. It contains many beneficial vitamins and minerals without the additives. I feel I am doing something good for my skin.</li>
