            <li>Great buy!!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Better than department store make up!!!!!</li>
            <li>It works great on the water line and the colors are all beautiful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly happy with all 3 colors.</li>
            <li>Goes on great, stays put</li>
            <li>all day colors are great,  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ve been successfully converted to non-black eyeliners with this set.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all three, and they deposit good color density, without over-doing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the color and the way my eyes look after application&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great product even better value.</li>
            <li>But, because it seems to be so long-lasting, I am sure it will be quite some time before I need to spend the money on a replacement!</li>
            <li>I am so happy I tried it, because I really think this is splendid stuff.</li>
            <li>Plus it just makes my eyes look amazing.</li>
            <li>so it highlights the eyes nicely.</li>
            <li>love how the handle fits the shape of your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic pack of eyeliner!</li>
            <li>they would be much better if they were retractable so</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>loved it so much that I decided to try another package.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>It does not glide on as smoothly as I had hoped, alot of pigment</li>
            <li>but I just stuffed it back in lol.</li>
            <li>I snapped it back in, and it still works great.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays in place throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The color is rich, has a hint of sparkles</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect shade for daily use since it&#x27;s not too dark, and it carries nicely from day to night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was true for all 3 of the Kohl sticks.</li>
            <li>One broke the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>and I never have a problem with them, they go on smoothly and they really make a difference on your eyes.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t even worth keeping as outer eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I wish the purple eyeliner had more of a red tint.</li>
            <li>I had to return for that reason as they pretty much broke off the first time I used...</li>
            <li>Really like the eyeliner by physicians formula.  </li>
            <li>Color is deep and glides on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Either the tip breaks off, or the whole nub comes off from the handle.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, so you really don&#x27;t get much for your money either.</li>
            <li>I tried everything I knew of to make the color darker, there just wasn&#x27;t much pigment in the product.</li>
            <li>Real cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Breaks super easily, and hard to sharpen.</li>
            <li>The first time, I was able to use the purple one only, the other two broke within</li>
            <li>started using the purple as everyday use, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t waste my money on them any more.</li>
            <li>Glad they seal but can be hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought two packages of these because of a sale, but it was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>The tip is fixed and non-retractable</li>
            <li>However, that is just my perception -- so far, it has given me no problem.</li>
            <li>broke instantly upon first use, the second tip broke in my makeup bag a couple of days</li>
            <li>The black liner broke off on first use.  </li>
            <li>You can wear the colors separately or together for a more dramatic look.</li>

            <li> You can wear the colors separately or together for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Liner is kohl and fixed (can&#x27;t roll down)</li>
            <li> Definitely my new everyday liner.</li>
            <li> I had my eye on these for a long time (pun intended!).  </li>
            <li> I do have brown eyes, and I had been using simple black kohl eyeliners forever.</li>
            <li> But, I am exceptionally careful when handling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT the design is bad, they are way to soft and bend or break off just about right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product has such negative reviews, the reality is that I&#x27;ve used much more expensive products</li>
            <li> so very vulnerable to breaking with light pressure.  </li>
            <li> to only keep a small amount exposed to help avoid breaking..</li>
            <li> The black one fell apart</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the black liner sparingly.</li>
            <li> I ventured out to see how the purple and brown would look for me as everyday use, and it was bonus that it also had the black for me when I feel less</li>
            <li> The lids are a bit to tight for my liking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding something that lasts all day and this does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use is the brown for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer required that I send the entire products (all 3 liners) to replace the one that was broken.  </li>
            <li> I located it in Target, and purchased it despite some negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something less expensive to replace the Bobbi Brown gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve been wearing forever.</li>
            <li> They may be waterproof, but they smudge in all the wrong ways.</li>
            <li> I even tried a base to see if I could get it to stay where I put it, but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Horrible product&lt;</li>

            <li> I have used these for years now and I never have a problem with them, they go on smoothly and they really make a difference on your eyes. I would suggest these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really like the eyeliner by physicians formula.  Color is deep and glides on smooth.  The lids are a bit to tight for my liking.  Glad they seal but can be hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the handle fits the shape of your fingers.  Made for easier application.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! I&#x27;ve been looking for something less expensive to replace the Bobbi Brown gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve been wearing forever. This stuff fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding something that lasts all day and this does. Plus it just makes my eyes look amazing. You can wear the colors separately or together for a more dramatic look. And it&#x27;s inexpensive at around $10. Great buy!! Definitely my new everyday liner.</li>
            <li> It does not glide on as smoothly as I had hoped, alot of pigment so color is there.</li>
            <li> Love the colors.  I use them as an eye brow pencil.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Horrible product&lt;br /&gt;No way to sharpen all tips broke off after 1st use destroyed clothes and makeup case</li>
            <li> Good product. The black one fell apart but I just stuffed it back in lol.</li>
            <li> Great product even better value. I give it 5 stars I&#x27;m truly happy with all 3 colors.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product has such negative reviews, the reality is that I&#x27;ve used much more expensive products and I keep coming back to these eyeliners.  Better than department store make up!!!!!</li>
            <li> I do have brown eyes, and I had been using simple black kohl eyeliners forever. I ventured out to see how the purple and brown would look for me as everyday use, and it was bonus that it also had the black for me when I feel less adventurous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the purple as everyday use, and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s the perfect shade for daily use since it&#x27;s not too dark, and it carries nicely from day to night. I&#x27;ve used it to a stub, and it only broke off once from the holder once. I snapped it back in, and it still works great. The color is rich, has a hint of sparkles so it highlights the eyes nicely. The only problem is it sometimes gathers all around my crease, and I would have to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next pen I&#x27;ll use is the brown for everyday use. I&#x27;ve used the black liner sparingly. I guess I&#x27;ve been successfully converted to non-black eyeliners with this set.</li>
            <li> Because these eyeliners made me look like an overly made up hooker. And not to mention the coon look. I wish the purple eyeliner had more of a red tint.</li>
            <li> I had my eye on these for a long time (pun intended!).  I finally purchased them, and each one broke in fewer than 5 uses.  One broke the very first time I used it.  Either the tip breaks off, or the whole nub comes off from the handle.  Threw them out.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic pack of eyeliner! I use it when I want to put on Arabic-inspired make-up. It works great on the water line and the colors are all beautiful! Highly recommend! Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Breaks super easily, and hard to sharpen. The tip is fixed and non-retractable, so you really don&#x27;t get much for your money either.</li>
            <li> I saw the Physicians Formula Eyeliner Trio referenced on The Today Show. I located it in Target, and purchased it despite some negative reviews. I am so happy I tried it, because I really think this is splendid stuff. I&#x27;ve used all three, and they deposit good color density, without over-doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one flaw that almost prevented me from trying it is the packaging. I&#x27;m not so convinced that the way the product is attached to the holder will last. However, that is just my perception -- so far, it has given me no problem. But, I am exceptionally careful when handling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, I would definitely purchase this again. But, because it seems to be so long-lasting, I am sure it will be quite some time before I need to spend the money on a replacement!</li>
            <li> The black liner broke off on first use.  The manufacturer required that I send the entire products (all 3 liners) to replace the one that was broken.  Liner is kohl and fixed (can&#x27;t roll down) so very vulnerable to breaking with light pressure.  Bought from another seller not listed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the color and the way my eyes look after application&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this on several occasions.  The first time, I was able to use the purple one only, the other two broke within days.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much that I decided to try another package.&lt;br /&gt;One broke instantly upon first use, the second tip broke in my makeup bag a couple of days later.&lt;br /&gt;I only have the bronze/brown one now and I won&#x27;t waste my money on them any more.</li>
            <li> Scarcely pigmented cones on the end of a handle. I tried everything I knew of to make the color darker, there just wasn&#x27;t much pigment in the product. Real cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was true for all 3 of the Kohl sticks. I just threw them out. They weren&#x27;t even worth keeping as outer eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I bought two packages of these because of a sale, but it was a huge waste of money. They may be waterproof, but they smudge in all the wrong ways. I even tried a base to see if I could get it to stay where I put it, but it didn&#x27;t help. I ended up throwing all six in the trash.</li>
            <li> Goes on great, stays put all day colors are great,  BUT the design is bad, they are way to soft and bend or break off just about right out of the box. they would be much better if they were retractable so to only keep a small amount exposed to help avoid breaking.. I had to return for that reason as they pretty much broke off the first time I used...</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. It goes on smooth and stays in place throughout the day.</li>
