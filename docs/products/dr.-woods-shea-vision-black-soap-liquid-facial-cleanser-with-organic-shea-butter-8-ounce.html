            <li>I think this soap did great things for my skin!  </li>
            <li>but this one has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>I just bought another Dr. woods for my son as a body wash and can&#x27;t wait to see if it&#x27;s as great as this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This cleans well and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is great.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>but I wanted my face to smell good for my baby.</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t ideal, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>I use rose salve with it once in the morning.</li>
            <li>and I know how smells can trigger warm fuzzies.</li>
            <li>The cleanser does smell nice, and has a tingly minty feeling, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>I then used Thayer&#x27;s Alcohol Free Rose Petal Toner and I cannot believe how nice my complexion is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too abrasive where I break out but gives me a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I already bought 2 more bottles of this.</li>
            <li>I have been using this soap for 3 days and love it.</li>
            <li>My cheeks feel softer for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to be more radiant than before.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this face wash.</li>
            <li>My skin is an even tone for the most part</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied with it :)</li>
            <li>I love it and my skin is oily in the T-zone if that helps anyone.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and will happily order again.</li>
            <li>This facial soap is excellent!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took a chance and purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Love the soap.  </li>
            <li>I love the way that it cleanses.</li>
            <li>It seems thicker, but is every bit as lovely and effective as the original one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky about skincare products and I always look for the best products at sephora and such and this is by far the best combination of products I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using Dr. Woods&#x27; products, very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its gentle, it smells good, and when I put if on I could feel it working.</li>
            <li>I immediately felt how smooth my skin felt.</li>
            <li>I should also mention that it does a fantastic job in washing away any makeup I might have missed when using makeup removing wipes.</li>
            <li>Its gentle, lathers nicely, removes my makeup and helps my acne.</li>
            <li>I bought it through another retailer but you have to spend $50 to get free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Has a clean fresh scent and leaves my skin super smooth!</li>
            <li>Amazing my skin is so clear I haven&#x27;t even used a moisturizer</li>
            <li>I suffered from acne for 15 years and this has been the only thing to banish pimples for good.</li>
            <li>I definitely ran out of it and loved every drop</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling clean, smooth, and its an amazing price.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive/acne prone/combo skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost a year, and it has helped with my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li>This face wash smells great and leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out, which is normally a big problem with skin-clearing washes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Original Dr. Woods African Black Soap + Shea butter cleanser as a hair,face and body cleanser and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural and safe to use Dr. Woods.</li>
            <li>and together I have a fresh feeling all over</li>
            <li>I also moisturize with pure argan oil and the two have done wonders for my face!</li>
            <li>Fresh and makes your faces feel really soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle soap.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>I really like how the facial soap leaves your face feeling clean you nice and natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% sure this will now be my staple facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference with the first use.</li>
            <li>When using this consistently it improves the redness/patchy within a week.</li>
            <li>This products make my skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews and thought what the heck.</li>
            <li>I dislike the scent, and it feels much more drying than the face soap I&#x27;ve used for a long time.</li>
            <li>.. I never really noticed how powerful the cleanser was until I used it to clean the bathtub &amp; it got the grit up with minimum labor!</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and this stuff didn&#x27;t irritate it or anything.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and any drugstore facial cleanser would surely make me break out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always suffered from acne and got some scars as a result, and this organic cleanser has really helped.</li>
            <li>and I had really given up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin and the price is completely reasonable.</li>
            <li>I also have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this facial cleanser to clean my face cloths after removing cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li>I can say that now I only get one pimple a month verses a jaw line full that won&#x27;t go away for months.  </li>
            <li>I live in Nevada so it is very drying to the skin as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t purchase scented cleansers or cosmetics</li>
            <li>I spend ALOT OF MONEY on facial products and this wash works as good if not BETTER then</li>
            <li>The only reason I dont give this 5 stars is because right after i used it I got 3 blemishes on my chin</li>
            <li>First time user of this facial cleanser scent isn&#x27;t that pleasant to me that is the only negative part about it.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face feels squeeky clean but not tight or dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also excited to try Dr. Woods&#x27; other products.</li>
            <li>Other than that it doesn&#x27;t clean at all unless your using a spin brush.</li>
            <li>Its the only stuff that doesnt cause me to break out, and i love the black soap smell.</li>
            <li>A natural product that leaves my face feeling soft and not stripped.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far, all natural ingredients is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft after using it and my husband likes the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over six months and it works pretty well on my old, dry, wrinkled, lizzard skin.  </li>
            <li>The price is cheap and a tiny bit goes a long way so the bottle lasts long.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using D. Woods facial cleanser if you are an adult struggling with acne on your face.</li>
            <li>I just dab few amounts of the rose salve on trouble dry areas on my face and then proceed into putting my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Smells a little different but really helped my face</li>

            <li> gentle, It will not clean what other soaps will.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same brand but geared for the face, and I was curious to see what the difference was.</li>
            <li> I will probably always use this as long as it keeps working.</li>
            <li> that over dry me, this DOES NOT.</li>
            <li> I like the way my face doesn&#x27;t feel overly dry after using it, but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, rinse without residue, and it is not over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve always used separate products for these parts, using just one big bottle for everything made me feel lacking in some way, odd.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have issues with Lavender, however.  </li>
            <li> Curious to see how it works for my pores.</li>
            <li> Cleanser arrived within expected delivery window.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but present enough to be a bother to those with environmental sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> Now those deep acne spots I had are now just small scars that are fading.</li>
            <li> I typically have combination skin but after having my daughter almost 3 months ago my hormones are changing so I am getting breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use it with the black charcoal all over my face</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling tight after you wash, and it takes about 3 washes before my makeup washes off.</li>
            <li> So I unfortunately don&#x27;t know how it works when applied directly to my skin.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the label, once wet, starts to flake off all over the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely get bumps/acne unless I&#x27;m eating horrible food</li>
            <li> I am addicted.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my face still feels a bit greasy from the residue it failed to remove!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and hate products</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use this facial cleanser to clean my face cloths after removing cleaning my face.  So I unfortunately don&#x27;t know how it works when applied directly to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and any drugstore facial cleanser would surely make me break out. I used to use papaya soap but it got to the point where my face would peel all the time no matter what the weather is. I live in Nevada so it is very drying to the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this and it cleared out my blemishes and my skin is radiant as ever. I use this twice a day in the morning and at night before I go to bed. I just use a few drops everytime because a little goes a long way and can work up a rich lather. I use rose salve with it once in the morning. I just dab few amounts of the rose salve on trouble dry areas on my face and then proceed into putting my moisturizer. At night, just moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order again, forever. I&#x27;m 100% sure this will now be my staple facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I think this soap did great things for my skin!  Be careful if you have issues with Lavender, however.  It&#x27;s subtle but present enough to be a bother to those with environmental sensitivities.  (I have a friend who can smell it on me hours after having used it!).</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with the first use. I immediately felt how smooth my skin felt. I then used Thayer&#x27;s Alcohol Free Rose Petal Toner and I cannot believe how nice my complexion is. I&#x27;m super picky about skincare products and I always look for the best products at sephora and such and this is by far the best combination of products I&#x27;ve used yet. I typically have combination skin but after having my daughter almost 3 months ago my hormones are changing so I am getting breakouts. My skin is super sensitive and this stuff didn&#x27;t irritate it or anything. Curious to see how it works for my pores. I will definitely update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my skin forever. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and I&#x27;ll never go back to another facial cleanser. I always buy it in bulk to use all over my body. I suffered from acne for 15 years and this has been the only thing to banish pimples for good. I also moisturize with pure argan oil and the two have done wonders for my face!</li>
            <li> Although the product lists its benefits, i personally do not see change/improvement in my skin since I&#x27;ve started using it.  I dislike the scent, and it feels much more drying than the face soap I&#x27;ve used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing my skin is so clear I haven&#x27;t even used a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! I&#x27;ve always suffered from acne and got some scars as a result, and this organic cleanser has really helped. My skin is a lot smoother, clearer, radiant, and even. I should also mention that it does a fantastic job in washing away any makeup I might have missed when using makeup removing wipes. I am so thankful to have found a product that not only works, but is 100% organic/natural.  It&#x27;s definitely a product that I will have in my beauty regime for now on. I&#x27;m also excited to try Dr. Woods&#x27; other products.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive/acne prone/combo skin. I have tried ever product under the sun and I had really given up. I gave in and tried this as a last ditch effort and I am so glad I did. The smell is kind of strong but not overpowering. Its gentle, lathers nicely, removes my makeup and helps my acne. I already bought 2 more bottles of this. I am addicted. I just bought another Dr. woods for my son as a body wash and can&#x27;t wait to see if it&#x27;s as great as this stuff.</li>
            <li> I buy this about every 2 months. Its the only stuff that doesnt cause me to break out, and i love the black soap smell. I tend to have patchy red/dryish skin. When using this consistently it improves the redness/patchy within a week.</li>
            <li> Okay, I know its weird but I wanted my face to smell good for my baby. I remember the smell of my moms face when I was a kid and I know how smells can trigger warm fuzzies. I have been using this soap for 3 days and love it. My cheeks feel softer for sure. The only reason I dont give this 5 stars is because right after i used it I got 3 blemishes on my chin and I hadn&#x27;t had any breakouts for months. But that is probably just my skin and not the product. I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve been using it longer</li>
            <li> This stuff is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. A natural product that leaves my face feeling soft and not stripped. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin and the price is completely reasonable. Love it.</li>
            <li> I felt the difference in my skin almost immediately after I started using this.  I noticed a difference in my skin tone within a week.  My skin seems to be more radiant than before.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This face wash smells great and leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out, which is normally a big problem with skin-clearing washes. Definitely planning to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells good. Works great. It&#x27;s not too abrasive where I break out but gives me a good clean feeling. I have oily skin and hate products that over dry me, this DOES NOT. I also like to mix this with scrub ingredients like a paprika or brown sugar once a week and it&#x27;s natural and safe to use Dr. Woods.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again. I like the way my face doesn&#x27;t feel overly dry after using it, but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Original Dr. Woods African Black Soap + Shea butter cleanser as a hair,face and body cleanser and am very happy with it. But since I&#x27;ve always used separate products for these parts, using just one big bottle for everything made me feel lacking in some way, odd. I could have just poured some of the contents of that bottle into separate bottles for the wash basin and bath tub, but then I found this. It&#x27;s the same brand but geared for the face, and I was curious to see what the difference was. It seems thicker, but is every bit as lovely and effective as the original one. (I have a review for that on it&#x27;s page too)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year, and it has helped with my acne tremendously. I would recommend using D. Woods facial cleanser if you are an adult struggling with acne on your face.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Dr. Woods&#x27; products, very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle soap.&lt;br /&gt;Too gentle, It will not clean what other soaps will.</li>
            <li> I really like how the facial soap leaves your face feeling clean you nice and natural. I will be purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! This cleans well and leaves my skin feeling great. I normally don&#x27;t purchase scented cleansers or cosmetics but this one has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over six months and it works pretty well on my old, dry, wrinkled, lizzard skin.  It cleans my face without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Very best face wash I have ever used-Super great clean feeling, that lasts, Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash. My skin is an even tone for the most part and I rarely get bumps/acne unless I&#x27;m eating horrible food.. I never really noticed how powerful the cleanser was until I used it to clean the bathtub &amp; it got the grit up with minimum labor!</li>
            <li> Fresh and makes your faces feel really soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The only facial cleanser I use!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Love! Cleanser arrived within expected delivery window. Has a clean fresh scent and leaves my skin super smooth! I will reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> This products make my skin so soft and clean. It lathers well, rinse without residue, and it is not over dry my skin. The price is cheap and a tiny bit goes a long way so the bottle lasts long. This stuff works wonders. I&#x27;m so satisfied with it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 years.  I bought it through another retailer but you have to spend $50 to get free shipping.  I spend ALOT OF MONEY on facial products and this wash works as good if not BETTER then the expansive stuff out their.  I love it and my skin is oily in the T-zone if that helps anyone.  I do follow with a moisturizer always.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. My face feels squeeky clean but not tight or dry afterwards. Shipping was fast and will happily order again.</li>
            <li> This facial soap is excellent! I had not used it before and decided to give it a try. I use it with the black charcoal all over my face and together I have a fresh feeling all over and my face has never been softer. Has a mild pleasant smell. I am so glad I took a chance and purchased this product. My decision was made based off the reviews that I read.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far, all natural ingredients is definitely a plus. Its gentle, it smells good, and when I put if on I could feel it working. Left my face feeling clean, smooth, and its an amazing price. Thank you Dr. Woods, I look forward to using it again and again.</li>
            <li> First time user of this facial cleanser scent isn&#x27;t that pleasant to me that is the only negative part about it.  I have very sensitive skin and I do suggest using a dime size when applying.  A lot comes out of the bottle so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Love the soap.  The lable disintergrated tho.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling tight after you wash, and it takes about 3 washes before my makeup washes off. Afterwards my face still feels a bit greasy from the residue it failed to remove! The cleanser does smell nice, and has a tingly minty feeling, but that&#x27;s about it. Other than that it doesn&#x27;t clean at all unless your using a spin brush.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is great. I love the way that it cleanses. The smell isn&#x27;t ideal, but it&#x27;s not bad.  My one complaint is that the label, once wet, starts to flake off all over the shower.</li>
            <li> Smells a little different but really helped my face</li>
            <li> I bought this off a recommendation from a Mac makeup artist.  I read all the positive reviews and thought what the heck. I&#x27;ll go ahead and try it, nothing else worked.  I tried everything possible!  I had very deep acne that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of for months. I also have very oily skin.  I used a combination of this product twice a day and the indian healing clay about once a week. Now those deep acne spots I had are now just small scars that are fading. I can say that now I only get one pimple a month verses a jaw line full that won&#x27;t go away for months.  My skin feels really soft after using it and my husband likes the smell.  I will probably always use this as long as it keeps working.</li>
            <li> I definitely ran out of it and loved every drop</li>
