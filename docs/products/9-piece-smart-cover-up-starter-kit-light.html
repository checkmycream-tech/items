    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>When you use this foundation and photograpg, your skin looks silky smoothe and flawless.</li>
            <li>the finish is anything but flawless</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Coverage is so good</li>
            <li>so I ordered this kit, and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>i ended up buying a nice 3/4 sleeve sweater to go over the non-traditional dress (which sucked in the july heat).</li>
            <li>Easy, fast and blends wonderfully.</li>
            <li>so if u have oily or normal skin then it&#x27;s really good product!</li>
            <li>You would be better off just sticking with what ever it is you&#x27;re using at the moment.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to be able to cover up my tattoo that I have on my leg</li>
            <li>I love being able to cover it up and not have problems of it smearing off my skin.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this product :)</li>
            <li>Many movie stars use this too.  </li>
            <li>but it could be better.</li>
            <li>great product and fast</li>
            <li>I bought this for more coverage</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all fairness the coverage is good, I just can&#x27;t seem to get the right color mixture to blend with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>For the money this is a great product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Well, photos can easily be retouched even if the website says they&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply (with a stippling brush), easy wash off with soap and water and stays all day.</li>
            <li>Average at best.</li>
            <li>If you want anything close to what they show on TV, you have to get a huge amout of the product which defeats the purpose because the idea is to look like you&#x27;re not wearing make-up.  </li>
            <li>It works miracles to even out skin tone and looks very nice (and still has great coverage) if you apply it thin.</li>
            <li>The many shades allow you to mix them until you get the right shade for your complexion.</li>
            <li>Overall, an amazing product!</li>
            <li>If super light makeup is your thing, you might wanna skip over this one.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite concealer!</li>
            <li>i was so excited to get it, and when it showed up, i wanted to try it out right away.</li>
            <li>Everything came in the kit exactly as was shown in the photo, and it arrived in the mail three days after I placed my order!</li>
            <li>After using this product for several years I will continue since it is better than anything else available.  </li>
            <li>The Concealing Creme didn&#x27;t cover my facial age spots any better than the inexpensive stuff I&#x27;ve bought at Target or Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, when I bought my first tube.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s thick, which makes it great as a concealer.</li>
            <li>more than the actual concealors!</li>
            <li>a positive note, I like the vitamin stick.</li>
            <li>page picture is square, but my smart cover stick is circle.</li>
            <li>Smart Cover does indeed cover it up very well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s VERY waterproof (comes off well with soap and a rag), so if you&#x27;re out and about in the rain, it will bead off and make you look made of wax.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no need to put too much on.  </li>
            <li>No need for powder, dries fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really cover that well.</li>
            <li>Product works very well however</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>I ordered directly from the Smart Cover website, but they don&#x27;t have a customer feedback area (that should have been my first clue...), so I&#x27;ll place my warning here.    </li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how much I love this product, it&#x27;s such a life saver.</li>
            <li>As for helping with dark circles under the eyes, Smart Cover is a fantastic product and I shall continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I get far better coverage with my Revlon ColorStay Whipped cream makeup, and it costs less.</li>
            <li>(like I&#x27;m not wearing anything, just like I like it), and I get compliments all the time about how clear my skin is!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they Would put dark make up in a \\&quot;light kit\\</li>
            <li>I put this concealer on first time in the morning and it lasts til next time</li>
            <li>I have been using Smart Cover for several years since I saw it on a TV show.   </li>
            <li>I never used if for large body areas such as tattoos</li>
            <li>the Smart Cover Stick is different from what I bought your home page picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On me it looks perfectly natural</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t itch or irritate.  </li>
            <li>do not waste your money</li>
            <li>I cannot show the tattoo at work and would like to make my life a little easier, especially in this hot weather at about 110 degrees right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, thin out, and blend as needed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used any of the Smart Cover products and are curious, just know that it is a cr√®me</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the other reviewers here...</li>
            <li>and it does not dry to a powder finish.  </li>
            <li>I actually use it as pretty much my entire foundation (it isn&#x27;t heavy feeling at all).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it does not dry to a powder finish.  </li>
            <li> I actually use it as pretty much my entire foundation (it isn&#x27;t heavy feeling at all).</li>
            <li> It hides acne, breakouts completely as well as dark circles under the eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> I order this product for my mother and it did nothing that it claimed, my mom has very light skin and when she applied this product after reading the directions carefully it look fake.</li>
            <li> for me very little difference in appearance, I had high expectations</li>
            <li> I actually just now ran a little low</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I suggest that if you use it under your eyes put some eye cream on first as the product is a bit thick; a little also goes a long way</li>
            <li> I use it to cover up dark circles under my eyes and a beauty mark (permanent make-up) which I had done several years ago.</li>
            <li> I paid $40 for a $30 item and would have to pay for $10 shipping just to get it back to them, not worth my time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why there are so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I use it whenever I get any bad acne.</li>
            <li> it sucks getting old.</li>
            <li> It made my skin so rough and cakey</li>
            <li> I feel that it is a waste of time to try to get my money back.</li>
            <li> I bought only one small tube of this and it lasted me a year no joke.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use foundation, powder or any other makeup other than this.</li>
            <li> Stains clothes isnt that easy to apply, Its not that bad</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer I didn&#x27;t find a customer review spot either...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s little bit heavy for me</li>
            <li> what a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; concealer stick was so yellow-toned it actually made them WORSE.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to cover a few birthmarks as well as scars.</li>
            <li> but, the results this is make my face like a dead person ..</li>
            <li> People, please don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is thick but you can thin it down with the color corector or any other OTC liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> i had to mix tons of the \\&quot;filler\\&quot; or whatever it is to lighten it, and it&#x27;s really hard to get a consistant color</li>
            <li> Really thick!</li>
            <li> I have acne-proned skin and it made my condition worse.  </li>
            <li> so I can see why someone would hate it for that ,but if you just want to cover acne or dark spots</li>
            <li> Expensive make up doesn&#x27;t cover as well.  </li>
            <li> had tried once to contact the company, and for some reason I was unable to get through.</li>
            <li> it was the worst product i have ever used with little or no effcet on blemishes.</li>
            <li> It has been a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It clogged my pores up bad...</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this line of products.  </li>
            <li> and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is very very bad</li>
            <li> The coverage is horrible.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m telling you Its bad trust me!!</li>
            <li> It looked terrible and did not cover even freckles.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used this product for years . NOTHING else on the market covers discoloration like it. People comment constantly on how smoothe my skin appears. It is thick but you can thin it down with the color corector or any other OTC liquid foundation. The many shades allow you to mix them until you get the right shade for your complexion. Trust me this can be dine in seconds!!!. When you use this foundation and photograpg, your skin looks silky smoothe and flawless.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money.  this didn&#x27;t cover up anything and is not smear proof!</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from the Smart Cover website, but they don&#x27;t have a customer feedback area (that should have been my first clue...), so I&#x27;ll place my warning here.    I was extremely disappointed with this line of products.  The Concealing Creme didn&#x27;t cover my facial age spots any better than the inexpensive stuff I&#x27;ve bought at Target or Walgreens.  The \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; concealer stick was so yellow-toned it actually made them WORSE.  They&#x27;ve been returned for a refund.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how much I love this product, it&#x27;s such a life saver. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, when I bought my first tube. I actually just now ran a little low so I ordered this kit, and I&#x27;m very pleased. Everything came in the kit exactly as was shown in the photo, and it arrived in the mail three days after I placed my order! If you&#x27;ve never used any of the Smart Cover products and are curious, just know that it is a cr√®me so it&#x27;s thick, which makes it great as a concealer. I actually use it as pretty much my entire foundation (it isn&#x27;t heavy feeling at all). It&#x27;s very easy to apply, thin out, and blend as needed. It works miracles to even out skin tone and looks very nice (and still has great coverage) if you apply it thin. If super light makeup is your thing, you might wanna skip over this one. Overall, an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering this from the website.  Like a previous reviewer I didn&#x27;t find a customer review spot either... only before and after photos.  Well, photos can easily be retouched even if the website says they&#x27;re not.  This &#x27;make-up&#x27; didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I have acne-proned skin and it made my condition worse.  It clogged my pores up bad... the finish is anything but flawless like they say (make-up gets into any line you may have on your face) and it does not dry to a powder finish.  It&#x27;s looks oily, cakey, and runny on your face after a while.  The coverage is horrible.  If you want anything close to what they show on TV, you have to get a huge amout of the product which defeats the purpose because the idea is to look like you&#x27;re not wearing make-up.  All in all, I do not recommend this to anyone.  You would be better off just sticking with what ever it is you&#x27;re using at the moment.</li>
            <li> My scar is in the middle of my shin. In all fairness the coverage is good, I just can&#x27;t seem to get the right color mixture to blend with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> i purchased this to cover up my tattoos for my wedding (i have some on my arm, chest, and back). i was so excited to get it, and when it showed up, i wanted to try it out right away. i put it on the smallest of my tattoos, doing about 4 coverings (i put a layer on, waited a minute, another layer, another minute, etc.) and i could STILL see the tattoo through it. another big downside is that the lightest color it comes with is still about 5 shades darker than my skin tone (and i&#x27;m not even that white). i had to mix tons of the \\&quot;filler\\&quot; or whatever it is to lighten it, and it&#x27;s really hard to get a consistant color that way.   i don&#x27;t like the way it looks on the skin, and even if you were to use it on your face: beware. it&#x27;s VERY waterproof (comes off well with soap and a rag), so if you&#x27;re out and about in the rain, it will bead off and make you look made of wax. i ended up buying a nice 3/4 sleeve sweater to go over the non-traditional dress (which sucked in the july heat). i think next time an event like this arises, i&#x27;ll either spend the $30 on another sweater, or buy Kat Von D&#x27;s coverup instead. i heard that stuff ACTUALLY works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Smart Cover for several years since I saw it on a TV show.   I use it to cover up dark circles under my eyes and a beauty mark (permanent make-up) which I had done several years ago. I no longer care for this \\&quot;beauty mark\\&quot;. Smart Cover does indeed cover it up very well.  For the price, you cannot beat the kit. It works very well. I suggest that if you use it under your eyes put some eye cream on first as the product is a bit thick; a little also goes a long way so there&#x27;s no need to put too much on.  I never used if for large body areas such as tattoos so I can&#x27;t rate it for that.  As for helping with dark circles under the eyes, Smart Cover is a fantastic product and I shall continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It covers!  Expensive make up doesn&#x27;t cover as well.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they Would put dark make up in a \\&quot;light kit\\&quot; it doesn&#x27;t work the way they say . I&#x27;ll never buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this product to be able to cover up my tattoo that I have on my leg and I must say it works wonders. I love being able to cover it up and not have problems of it smearing off my skin. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why there are so many bad reviews. I love this stuff I use it whenever I get any bad acne. I did try to put it over a tattoo I have just to see and it did not do anything so I can see why someone would hate it for that ,but if you just want to cover acne or dark spots this definitely does the trick. Plus it lasts forever I bought only one small tube of this and it lasted me a year no joke.</li>
            <li> Use a stippling brush to apply this makeup!!! Easy, fast and blends wonderfully. Easy to apply (with a stippling brush), easy wash off with soap and water and stays all day. Couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this product :)</li>
            <li> After using this product for several years I will continue since it is better than anything else available.  Many movie stars use this too.  No need for powder, dries fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to cover a few birthmarks as well as scars. Stains clothes isnt that easy to apply, Its not that bad but it could be better.</li>
            <li> great product and fast</li>
            <li> This is very very bad I bought this for more coverage but, the results this is make my face like a dead person ..i&#x27;m telling you Its bad trust me!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But  the Smart Cover Stick is different from what I bought your home page picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home page picture is square, but my smart cover stick is circle. This stick is brighter than before</li>
            <li> Coverage is so good but it&#x27;s little bit heavy for me I like the stick concealor more than the actual concealors! I have dry skin so if u have oily or normal skin then it&#x27;s really good product!</li>
            <li> Really thick! It made my skin so rough and cakey didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I order this product for my mother and it did nothing that it claimed, my mom has very light skin and when she applied this product after reading the directions carefully it look fake. Overall this product doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before, I suppose it takes getting use to. It does cover well, but not something I would want to use every day.</li>
            <li> It does not meet expectations.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and was very impressed.  I should know by now, that this is the only product for me!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the other reviewers here... This is by far my favorite concealer! I&#x27;m a guy - I don&#x27;t use foundation, powder or any other makeup other than this. On me it looks perfectly natural (like I&#x27;m not wearing anything, just like I like it), and I get compliments all the time about how clear my skin is! It hides acne, breakouts completely as well as dark circles under the eyes in the morning. I put this concealer on first time in the morning and it lasts til next time I&#x27;m taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking it would cover a tattoo I got when I was younger. I cannot show the tattoo at work and would like to make my life a little easier, especially in this hot weather at about 110 degrees right now. I am STUCK wearing sweaters to work because of the placement of the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;I had seen this advertised on TV and online, so decided to give it a shot. It has been a bit of a disappointment. You can still see the colors and detail in the tattoo and it looks like I tried to put make up on arm. It looks awful!&lt;br /&gt;I had tried once to contact the company, and for some reason I was unable to get through. I feel that it is a waste of time to try to get my money back. I paid $40 for a $30 item and would have to pay for $10 shipping just to get it back to them, not worth my time.&lt;br /&gt;It may work for others, but it did NOT work for me.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this product!  This is the 3rd time I have ordered it for him.  And I have been known to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; some when I have a blemish.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t itch or irritate.  We both are fans!</li>
            <li> this doesnt do what it says the tubes are smaller then sampe size feels like you are putting putty on your face do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really cover that well.</li>
            <li> Product works very well however things never work the way we always wish they would, let&#x27;s face it sucks getting old. For the money this is a great product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> for me very little difference in appearance, I had high expectations and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as adveretside. it was the worst product i have ever used with little or no effcet on blemishes. It rubbed off with any contact. In my last review I stated &amp;#34;Worthless as Tits on a Boar Hog.&amp;#34; that comment still stands.</li>
            <li> This product does not work and do not use it on anything parts that have even the finest of hair.  It looked terrible and did not cover even freckles.</li>
            <li> Average at best. This stuff does not work like the TV ad shows. I get far better coverage with my Revlon ColorStay Whipped cream makeup, and it costs less. People, please don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, I like the vitamin stick. That&#x27;s the only product I like from the kit, so that&#x27;s why I gave 2 stars.</li>
