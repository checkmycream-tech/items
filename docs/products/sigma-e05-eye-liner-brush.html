            <li>I really loved how it made</li>
            <li>, i have seen good things about Sigma brushes on Youtube</li>
            <li>, i must say excellent wrapping and shipping time, my item came securely packaged and with your brochures.  </li>
            <li>It its veru good quality but not the one i was expecting</li>
            <li>With this type of brush I find that I have more control with liquid or gel liners and can draw a more perfect line.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the quality of this brush.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the quality of the brush itself.  </li>
            <li>I love Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>In love with sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>love, love, love!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, better than the eye liner brush from bobbi brown!</li>
            <li>very precise and angled well.</li>
            <li>low-priced thank you amazon very much love it</li>
            <li>I love the control it gives me</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>would recommend you buy this one for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend.</li>
            <li>my Mac Fluidline just glide on and I was able to control the width of my liner.</li>
            <li>Still, i am so glad i upgraded</li>
            <li>glad i decided to give sigma a try.  </li>
            <li>I also use it for applying shadows over my liner to create a softer, more smokey look.</li>
            <li>If you struggle with eye liner and/or want a cleaner, more perfected line-</li>
            <li>Love sigma brushes, have about 6 of them.</li>
            <li>This brush works okay, but it is a bit fat.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and even the handles seem like excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Easy to draw fine line and thicker line !&lt;</li>
            <li>it was a pretty good comparison</li>
            <li>Thanks keep up the good work</li>
            <li>and I was charged full price!  </li>
            <li>Easy to control.</li>
            <li>Those who claim that they cannot get a precise, clean line with gel liner haven&#x27;t tried this brush!</li>
            <li>I have been an ever-faithful consumer of Bobbi Brown&#x27;s ultra fine brush for ages.</li>
            <li>Not this one, It lets you draw a fine line and not have to continously reload with eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Instead, this sigma E05 is softer and pointed like the tip of a fine paint brush or pen.</li>
            <li>I needed a fine gel liner applicator and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, even line.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and durable.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>My eyeliner always comes out so smooth and precise</li>
            <li>The handle is a good length to allow you to control, product placement, the bristles are substantial as well as soft.</li>
            <li>However, the glowing reviews convinced me it was worth it....and was it ever!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good liner brush for a while, collecting too many that don&#x27;t actually do the job right,</li>
            <li>Could not be happier with this brush, makes application of gel eyeliner SO fast and easy!</li>
            <li>I have really gotten to love these brushes...</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Very well made and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very fine tip, but it&#x27;s substantial enough to get a good solid line.</li>
            <li>I have hooded eyes and so it takes a little work to get my eyeliner to go on, i have used a couple diifferent brushes for this job and quite honestly i wasnt really satisfied</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to beginners and people who have been doing makeup for years, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I like to use gel cream shadow as a colorful eye liner.</li>
            <li>I clean it quickly with a makeup remover wipe after ever use and make sure that the hairs form a neat tip before storing it so that the shape stays the same over time.</li>
            <li>I bought it to use with my L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Gel eyeliner because the brush that came with the eyeliner was very small and dainty.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really difficult to find the best tool for this.  </li>
            <li>I was charged regular price which is ok</li>
            <li>I am very upset!</li>
            <li>I personally love this brush though, and I use it daily.</li>
            <li>purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft on the skin yet still retain their shape to make a perfect thin line.</li>
            <li>I hesitated at first to buy this brush as $12 seemed a bit much for a makeup brush, since you can buy them for a couple of bucks at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>but with this one, adding liner to your upper lid is easy.</li>
            <li>I am still getting the hang of it, but this brush seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the packaging came intact.</li>
            <li>These pieces are very distinctive colors and models like it very well as</li>
            <li>and i decided to try this brush as i dont need a whole makeup brush set</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be a stoop to MAC 210 brush, but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied with this product and will be returning it.</li>
            <li>The I true shows a full size black eyeliner brush</li>
            <li>i ordered 2 brushes thinking that i was getting 2 full size brushes instead i got 2 pink travel size brushes.&lt;br /&gt;the same one that sigma was giving for free with any order of $30.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I think it can be a little challenging for newbies to use this brush as it is softer than the square, diagonally-cut brushes that normally come with gel liners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using gel eyeliner, and this brush was recommended.</li>
            <li>I had some very cheap eyeliner brushes (one from Bare Esscentuals also) and that was just a tad less daintier then the brush i got with the L&#x27;Oreal eye gel.</li>
            <li>It makes a very fine line, which sometimes has been hard for me.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes have a shaky hand, which can make this a challenge and this brush certainly helped it go on smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li>It is also soft and flexible for making thicker lines.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this brush.  </li>
            <li>Sigma brushes are always such high quality.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try the E10 which has received positive reviews for its ability to draw a precise thin line.  </li>
            <li>I just received my order and first and foremost I was sent an E05 from Sigma mini brush in Pink</li>
            <li>The Sigma E05 -eyeliner brush is great,I use it and love it, it is small brush and prefect for doing cat eyes or a simple thin line.:)</li>
            <li>so much that i am looking forward to have every single one in their collection.</li>
            <li>Soft enough for comfort yet bristles stiff enough to apply the liner accurately.</li>
            <li>I love how thin this brush is.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering a full sized black make up brush, yet I received a travel sized pink brush.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, my only complaint is it came in pink and it shorter than pictured.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use.</li>

            <li> The bristles have maintained their shape after numerous washings and are very soft on the eyelid, compared to MAC eyeliner brushes which I personally find to feel harsh and scratchy.</li>
            <li> shipping took a very long time</li>
            <li> It works just like a painting brush, and it&#x27;s strudy enough to make thin, straight lines if you&#x27;re well-versed with eyeliner to begin with.</li>
            <li> Only thing is I definitely have to wash it with brush cleaner every few uses because the bristles dry to an itchy hardness if i dont.</li>
            <li> They still work the same, but I definitely wanted black to match all my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I recieved a mini pink brush</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THE PINK SAMPLE VERSION OF THE BRUSH.</li>
            <li> I will purchase other brushes from this company when I need them.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the brush, and I love sigma brushes, wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I was send a mini pink brush not a full size brush.</li>
            <li> A MONTH LATER, SO I THINK IT WAS TOO LATE TO ASK FOR A REFUND, BESIDES</li>
            <li> The handle is slightly thicker that the MAC eyeliner brush.  </li>
            <li> and I never make a mess now.  </li>
            <li> I received the travel size not these brush its small and pink  color</li>
            <li> , when I received my order the Sigma E05 was a small travel size brush that was pink.</li>
            <li> I love using gel and liquid liner, but I hate the applicators that usually come with them.</li>
            <li> should have ordered one with a little shorter tip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sigma has a poor quality plastic cap only....</li>
            <li> So i was nervouse that all gel liner brushes would be small and skimpy and this would be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the line is a little too thick and dramatic for my conservative office.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out with my gel liner and it went on like a breeze, brush is sturdy but not so hard that it hurts the skin on the eyes, im</li>
            <li> For reference I like to wear neutral colors on my lid with a subtle winged line using gel liner.  </li>
            <li> I would like a finer brush to make thin lines.</li>
            <li> You can make the line as thick or as thin as you want or add a flick/cat eye with ease!</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY</li>
            <li> Very thin but not too floppy.</li>
            <li> MAC&#x27;s brush is very very thin.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy, I can&#x27;t even get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> WORST ITEM EVER....</li>
            <li> Horrible now I have to go out of my way to return this item.</li>

            <li> The best eyeliner brush!</li>
            <li> The Sigma E05 -eyeliner brush is great,I use it and love it, it is small brush and prefect for doing cat eyes or a simple thin line.:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good brush to use with my gel eyeliner, and this one is the best one i&#x27;ve found! It&#x27;s got a very fine tip, but it&#x27;s substantial enough to get a good solid line. I love Sigma brushes! I&#x27;ve tried others, and these are just the best made!!!</li>
            <li> this product was recommended to me, and I have loved it!</li>
            <li> I did not get what was pictured. I recieved a mini pink brush</li>
            <li> I have really gotten to love these brushes...so much that i am looking forward to have every single one in their collection. The bristles are super soft and even the handles seem like excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to draw fine line and thicker line !&lt;br /&gt;Sigma has a poor quality plastic cap only.... I need a cap ! Hope they come with  a decent cap for brash in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the quality is very great.</li>
            <li> I saw this brush reviewed on youtube. I&#x27;m new to using gel eyeliner, and this brush was recommended. I am still getting the hang of it, but this brush seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the perfect brush for my gel liner this brush gives the perfect line.Good quality brush. The shipping was fast and the packaging came intact.</li>
            <li> I love how thin this brush is. It is perfect for winged or cat eyeliner. It is also soft and flexible for making thicker lines. Perfect for use with gel eyeliner!</li>
            <li> These pieces are very distinctive colors and models like it very well as low-priced thank you amazon very much love it</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner brush that I have found to date. Have been using it about a week now. Smooth, even line. Easy to control. (I use gel liner) Already ordered a couple more!!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of eyeliner brushes but this brush is the best I have ever used, I could not go without it, its perfect for gel eyeliners and its my new fav!</li>
            <li> I hesitated at first to buy this brush as $12 seemed a bit much for a makeup brush, since you can buy them for a couple of bucks at the drugstore. However, the glowing reviews convinced me it was worth it....and was it ever! My eyeliner goes on like a dream. I highly recommend this product. What a difference a brush makes! I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy one sooner!</li>
            <li> JUST BUY ANY SIGMA BRUSH, YOU WONT REGRET IT. THEY ALL WORK GUD. I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> With Laura Mercer eyeliner this brush is excellent.  I love the control it gives me and I never make a mess now.  I love it.  Very well made and easy to clean.  Very thin but not too floppy.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace my MAC eyeliner brush.  The handle is slightly thicker that the MAC eyeliner brush.  I am very satisfied with the quality of this brush.  I will purchase other brushes from this company when I need them.</li>
            <li> this is why you buy the best quality so you can apply your eyeliner  flawlessly- would recommend you buy this one for sure.</li>
            <li> I like to use gel cream shadow as a colorful eye liner. But it&#x27;s really difficult to find the best tool for this.  This brush is perfect; makes great lines!</li>
            <li> I love it so much. I have been looking for a good liner brush for a while, collecting too many that don&#x27;t actually do the job right, but with this one, adding liner to your upper lid is easy. I love it and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works perfect with cake eyeliner</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 brushes thinking that i was getting 2 full size brushes instead i got 2 pink travel size brushes.&lt;br /&gt;the same one that sigma was giving for free with any order of $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now i have to go out of my way and return them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also shipping took a very long time</li>
            <li> gets the job done! should have ordered one with a little shorter tip. easy to clean and durable.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a full sized black make up brush, yet I received a travel sized pink brush. They still work the same, but I definitely wanted black to match all my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this brush.  It is bendable, yet sturdy.  It made it way easier to apply eyeliner to my upper lid using gel type.  I sometimes have a shaky hand, which can make this a challenge and this brush certainly helped it go on smooth and straight.  I will definitely look into purchasing another one of these in a blender brush.  It makes a very fine line, which sometimes has been hard for me.  This was a cinch!!!  AAA+++</li>
            <li> love, love, love!! the good reviews are on the money, take good care of this brush and it takes care of you!</li>
            <li> I just received my order and first and foremost I was sent an E05 from Sigma mini brush in Pink and I was charged full price!  That is wrong on so many levels.  I would not have ordered this if that was the case.  I was charged regular price which is ok had I received the regular sized not a mini!     Moreover, this brush is not even sold individually through sigma.  I am very upset!</li>
            <li> I have been an ever-faithful consumer of Bobbi Brown&#x27;s ultra fine brush for ages. I took a risk and bought the Sigma eye liner to use with my Bobbi Brown long-wear gel eyeliner, and I have to say that I was blown away! The bristles are very soft on the skin yet still retain their shape to make a perfect thin line. You have won me over, Sigma!</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice, but if you&#x27;re a fan of gel liners like I am, this brush is a great steal. It works just like a painting brush, and it&#x27;s strudy enough to make thin, straight lines if you&#x27;re well-versed with eyeliner to begin with. I think it can be a little challenging for newbies to use this brush as it is softer than the square, diagonally-cut brushes that normally come with gel liners. I personally love this brush though, and I use it daily. I clean it quickly with a makeup remover wipe after ever use and make sure that the hairs form a neat tip before storing it so that the shape stays the same over time.</li>
            <li> WORST ITEM EVER.... I&#x27;M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SHAPE OR THE QUALITY OF THE BRUSH...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M COMPLAINING ABOUT THE DESCRIPTION.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THE PINK SAMPLE VERSION OF THE BRUSH. UNFORTUNATELY I SAW THE BRUSH A MONTH LATER, SO I THINK IT WAS TOO LATE TO ASK FOR A REFUND, BESIDES, I DID LIKE THE BRUSH EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE SAMPLE VERSION OF IT!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner brush I&#x27;ve ever used! The bristles have maintained their shape after numerous washings and are very soft on the eyelid, compared to MAC eyeliner brushes which I personally find to feel harsh and scratchy. Could not be happier with this brush, makes application of gel eyeliner SO fast and easy!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, my only complaint is it came in pink and it shorter than pictured. However, it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush!!!! My eyeliner always comes out so smooth and precise when I use this brush. I get a perfect wing EVERY time! I love it so much! I would definitely recommend this to beginners and people who have been doing makeup for years, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this actually by mistake, but instead of returning it I decided to give it a try.  I really loved how it made my Mac Fluidline just glide on and I was able to control the width of my liner. Sigma brushes are always such high quality.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I bought it to use with my L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Gel eyeliner because the brush that came with the eyeliner was very small and dainty. I always felt like i was using a toothpick to line my eyes. This is great! The handle is a good length to allow you to control, product placement, the bristles are substantial as well as soft. I had some very cheap eyeliner brushes (one from Bare Esscentuals also) and that was just a tad less daintier then the brush i got with the L&#x27;Oreal eye gel. So i was nervouse that all gel liner brushes would be small and skimpy and this would be a waste of money. Not this one, It lets you draw a fine line and not have to continously reload with eyeliner. Only thing is I definitely have to wash it with brush cleaner every few uses because the bristles dry to an itchy hardness if i dont. The skimpy ones dont do that but maybe thats why they are so skimpy. Still, i am so glad i upgraded</li>
            <li> I have hooded eyes and so it takes a little work to get my eyeliner to go on, i have used a couple diifferent brushes for this job and quite honestly i wasnt really satisfied, i have seen good things about Sigma brushes on Youtube and i decided to try this brush as i dont need a whole makeup brush set, i must say excellent wrapping and shipping time, my item came securely packaged and with your brochures.  I tried it out with my gel liner and it went on like a breeze, brush is sturdy but not so hard that it hurts the skin on the eyes, im glad i decided to give sigma a try.  Thanks keep up the good work</li>
            <li> This brush has helped me draw beautiful winged-eyes!  I am very pleased with the quality of the brush itself.  My only complaint is that the line is a little too thick and dramatic for my conservative office.  I am going to try the E10 which has received positive reviews for its ability to draw a precise thin line.  For reference I like to wear neutral colors on my lid with a subtle winged line using gel liner.  I will continue to use the E05 for nights and weekends.</li>
            <li> amazing liner brush!! very precise and angled well. In love with sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a stoop to MAC 210 brush, but it really isn&#x27;t. MAC&#x27;s brush is very very thin. Regardless, I still use it a lot and I like the quality a lot.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, better than the eye liner brush from bobbi brown!</li>
            <li> I love using gel and liquid liner, but I hate the applicators that usually come with them. Such as the flat-ish brush that came with the Revlon Colorstay charcoal gel liner. Instead, this sigma E05 is softer and pointed like the tip of a fine paint brush or pen. With this type of brush I find that I have more control with liquid or gel liners and can draw a more perfect line. This brush is also perfect for creating a winged eye liner look. I also use it for applying shadows over my liner to create a softer, more smokey look. If you struggle with eye liner and/or want a cleaner, more perfected line- then this Sigma E05 brush is for you! Bottom line- give it a try! Love sigma brushes, have about 6 of them. I will def. purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> This brush works okay, but it is a bit fat.  I would like a finer brush to make thin lines.</li>
            <li> I needed a fine gel liner applicator and this did the trick.  Soft enough for comfort yet bristles stiff enough to apply the liner accurately.</li>
            <li> I was send a mini pink brush not a full size brush. Very unhappy, I can&#x27;t even get a replacement. Horrible now I have to go out of my way to return this item. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. i normally only use MAC brushes, I decided to give this a try and to my surprise it was a pretty good comparison</li>
            <li> Best gel liner brush you&#x27;ll ever purchase. Those who claim that they cannot get a precise, clean line with gel liner haven&#x27;t tried this brush! You can make the line as thick or as thin as you want or add a flick/cat eye with ease! Makes it so effortless....</li>
            <li> I received the travel size not these brush its small and pink  color not even close to these one that its in the picture !  It its veru good quality but not the one i was expecting</li>
            <li> The I true shows a full size black eyeliner brush, when I received my order the Sigma E05 was a small travel size brush that was pink. I am very unsatisfied with this product and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> My go to for gel eyeliner</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product. The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the brush, and I love sigma brushes, wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for. Service was excellent though!</li>
