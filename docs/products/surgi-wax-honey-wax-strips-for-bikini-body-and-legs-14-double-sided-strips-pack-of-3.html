    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was really impressed.</li>
            <li>you will not be happy, it needs sometime to work with and unstick itself so it does not stick to your clothes.</li>
            <li>On my legs and arms worked great</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for at home waxing, these are great.  </li>
            <li>They are really great.</li>
            <li>Great for underarms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands, and these are THE BEST strips for efficiently removing leg and underarm hair.</li>
            <li>Convenient, effective and a lot of strips!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking to the good stuff or sticking it out with the razor from now on.</li>
            <li>, I found that after an hour or two it would just disappear on it&#x27;s own, don&#x27;t do this just before you intend to go out on for a fancy occassion</li>
            <li>It was also kind of patchy with the hair that was longer.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t slathered in wax, so there isn&#x27;t globs of wax stuck to my skin, yet it effectively removes hair.</li>
            <li>stuck together so all you have to do is warm the strip against your skin</li>
            <li>Aveeno was kind of gloopy sticky</li>
            <li>It was ok, I was kind of disapointed that it didn&#x27;t take all of the hair.</li>
            <li>It worked great, super easy</li>
            <li>Gave it 3 stars because it sort of worked but not the best results, and because you may be happy if you used it in a small area</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Of course, you have to make sure you pull against the direction of the hair...</li>
            <li>it gets MOST of the hair off.</li>
            <li>There are some that I guess is finer than the rest and no matter how many times I went over it still didn&#x27;t pick it up.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would work better there</li>
            <li>I like it that the strips are wax paper, not plastic, making them more malleable and negotiable.     </li>
            <li>Make sure you leave an \\&quot;edge\\&quot; to grab hold of without having to get your hands sticky.  </li>
            <li>If you rub more than 3 times, the honey can get soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does get most of the hairs you want removed too.  </li>
            <li>then you will be satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for salon results then your best bet (in my opinion) is to continue with the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to go back to the salon and then try the product again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Was able to use each strip 2 or 3 times, and cut them for better placing in some spots&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my bikini line and it didn&#x27;t get all the hairs off, so it works better on fine hair.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get them warm enough, or too warm, the rip isn&#x27;t as effective.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other wax strips, and I like these the best.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and work well.  </li>
            <li>and if they do, it is easily removable.</li>
            <li>And pull very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- make sure your skin isn&#x27;t moist or greasy, it has to be a clean surface to work from&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some wax residue, but it was easily cleaned up with a bit of baby oil and a couple cotton balls&lt;</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use, they don&#x27;t leave any wax on you.  </li>
            <li>I really love this waxing strips, they are very sticky and get the hair out!!</li>
            <li>Never got the result I had hoped for... smooth legs.   </li>
            <li>I was waxed professionally before trying this product, and I just didn&#x27;t get good results.</li>
            <li>a bristle brush on your leg or wherever your waxing and go with the direction of hair to make sure the hairs are going the right way and will be picked up</li>
            <li>I noticed that the hot wax hurts more.   </li>
            <li>Tried on bikini line, works OK - I recommend the Brazilian hot wax for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and will definitely purchase again when my first 3 boxes run out!</li>
            <li>I have only ever used wax strips and these are by far the best that I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to return the item for full refund.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, they really are quite tidy to use--no goopy wax or burning wax to deal with.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a year now and absolutely love it and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I also plan on trying them on my husband&#x27;s back, where I hope the results are astounding.</li>
            <li>like right now they are still sticking to my keyboard as i type this.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering if you&#x27;re pulling the right direction: your fingers should be closest to the end of the hair and farthest from the root.  </li>
            <li>No microwaving means that it was super easy and not very messy</li>
            <li>Maybe you have to be really hairy to get really good results, but who wants to wait until hair is really long to rip it out?    </li>
            <li>And the hot wax had a tendency to leave wax on the skin.</li>
            <li>however, this was my first time waxing.</li>
            <li>I tried this wax as a first time leg waxer.</li>
            <li>I will go with a hot wax system.      </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>You really have to pull fast enough and make sure you&#x27;re pulling the right direction.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much hair and it was pretty short, maybe 1/8th inch, and pretty fine.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe my leg hair was too fine, but even after using these on my pits after not shaving for 3 days these strips left me patchy and sticky.</li>
            <li>Pros: Didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>but this was gentle no redness or itching or burning.             </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even remove much of the bikini hair which is longer than leg hair</li>
            <li>so you get as much tension as possible.&lt;br /&gt;-rip</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of hair removal (especially for fine hair).</li>
            <li>Well, okay, it hurts, just not as much as other methods I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many other brands</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most make me brake out or look like a burn victim</li>
            <li>The only thing I would like better would be if the strips were bigger.</li>
            <li>I normally use Parisa way for my brows but decided to start waxing my pits and legs as well.</li>
            <li>Not as good for my thin leg hair.</li>
            <li>These strips are easy to use and you can reuse them several times on different areas.</li>
            <li>use the big ones for my face too, just use scissors to cut the right shape.  </li>
            <li>Just right takes a little practice, but worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>I heat these up with a little space heater, pull them apart and everything is so easy.  </li>
            <li>They also work fantastic on the armpits, and I&#x27;m noticing my hair regrowth is slowing down.</li>
            <li>These do not pull out all the hairs on the leg, make sure you don&#x27;t leave the strips on too long, or not long enough.</li>
            <li>The other brands&#x27; wax residue have to be removed with greasy oil, and even then it doesn&#x27;t do a super job in getting the wax off.</li>
            <li>The strips (clear, plastic strips)are prewaxed and</li>
            <li>I have had professional bikini waxes and have tried at home waxes as well.</li>
            <li>These are not messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no mess and no fuss.  </li>
            <li>My bikini area was not waxed professionally and it did a nice job there will little pain and little irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a week and my legs are still perfectly smooth, compared to the stubbled nightmare they usually are a week after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the strips for facial hair by the same company were NOT very good at removing facial hair AND left a lot of sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, warming them between my hands for a few seconds, smooth on in the direction of hair growth and tear off in opposite direction; I even went over some areas in different directions because not all the hair grew in one direction.  </li>
            <li>These leave barely any reside</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these on my really thick pubic hairs (yes TMI, I know) as well as fine facial hair</li>
            <li>The brand I used to buy at my local Safeway (Sally Hensen) took out more hair than this, and I wasn&#x27;t even satisfied with that brand which is why I looked for a new one, so this one was just especially bad.</li>
            <li>barely any hair would come off, I would try to reuse the strips again in another spot but it would only take a couple hairs if any off.  </li>

            <li> Cons: Didn&#x27;t take all of the hair even the hair that was long enough, it was patchy.</li>
            <li> I like these strips because they&#x27;re so much quicker and less mess and cleanup than heating wax and dealing with strips.  </li>
            <li> This product I believe would work well if you were doing an upper lip or under the arms but not a large area.  </li>
            <li> for those of you who haven&#x27;t waxed before: everyone said it would be a sharp pain that went away almost instantly, like ripping off a bandaid, but i waxed like twenty minutes ago and it still stings...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get out, and as soon as the skin was dry it was still sticky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Had to go over a few areas multiple times, but that&#x27;s not entirely the wax&#x27;s fault--</li>
            <li> For me, the results did last a little longer (about 10 days) than</li>
            <li> BUT... my main complaint is that it leaves the area sticky!</li>
            <li> The strips were not consistent in taking alot of hair off,  sometimes they would pull alot other times</li>
            <li> I know that seems extreme</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it only takes a small amount of hair off.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other brands I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t feel as though it is ripping skin off along with the hair.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> As I used it after shaving for the past several months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their microwave honey wax in the past and it was OK, but these are total crap.</li>
            <li> One big problem was that it left traces of the wax on my skin that was near impossible to get off me.</li>
            <li> I have cut it in half like other reviewers have suggested, but I find that wax leaks out where you cut it with scissors.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t leave strips of black glue-looking wax afterward.</li>
            <li> some of the hair grows in odd directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will not work for hair that is rather thick, its really sticky but somehow does not even work on the thin hairs.</li>
            <li> but it didnt even take out half of the hair.</li>
            <li> I used the strips only on by upper legs (above the knee); I did it in 4 days because it was sticky, a bit painful and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit painful when you rip them off but the pain quickly subsides.  </li>
            <li> and i guess i&#x27;m going commando for a little while because my underwear was sticking to my crotch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to let my hair grow a little longer &amp; try these again.</li>
            <li> Actually not that painful, which I was worried about since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I wanted to save a few bucks</li>
            <li> , I could even reuse the strip if I missed a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> You just rub the prewaxed strips between your palms for a few seconds, apply, &amp; let &#x27;er rip.     </li>
            <li> I have tried them a few times both on leg and pubic hair and neither time have they worked in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Then, I used the used strip to pull off any of the honey wax that stuck to my skin, which was very little.  </li>
            <li> I had let my hair growth on the leg to 1/2 an inch and even experimented on my lower leg with one strip which was at 1/4 inch of hair growth but the results were no better.  </li>
            <li> Once you place it on, rub it 2-3 times, no more, and then pull against the grain.  </li>
            <li> It took about 45 minutes to remove the hair on one leg (which I found to be excessive as shaving would be faster).</li>
            <li> The hair comes off quite well and even though you are not applying oil or powder to the skin, it hardly hurts.</li>
            <li> I have rather thick hair.</li>
            <li> Plus they leave a sticky honey residue behind.</li>
            <li> Sally hansen are absolutely the worst.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well for my bikini area, but was horrible on my legs.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind some stickiness.</li>
            <li> I hate paying a small fortune to let someone else do this for me and the at home waxes were messy and</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> i was not thrilled with this product because , it stick extremely hard, it was very painful, wich i was expecting</li>
            <li> That may be because it&#x27;s a cold honey wax.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for salon results then this is not the product for you as it will be disappointing.</li>
            <li> That hurts so bad can&#x27;tUse</li>
            <li> Does not stick well :(</li>
            <li> These are horrible!!</li>
            <li> Very bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brand I used to buy at my local Safeway (Sally Hensen) took out more hair than this, and I wasn&#x27;t even satisfied with that brand which is why I looked for a new one, so this one was just especially bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands, and these are THE BEST strips for efficiently removing leg and underarm hair. Surprisingly, the strips for facial hair by the same company were NOT very good at removing facial hair AND left a lot of sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I have had professional bikini waxes and have tried at home waxes as well. I hate paying a small fortune to let someone else do this for me and the at home waxes were messy and you risked getting burned. And after heating the wax you might as well just throw the pot away because it had wax all over it. And the hot wax had a tendency to leave wax on the skin. These strips are easy to use and you can reuse them several times on different areas. You just cut to the desired width, which doubles the amount they give you, apply and pull. The hair comes off quite well and even though you are not applying oil or powder to the skin, it hardly hurts. Well, okay, it hurts, just not as much as other methods I&#x27;ve used. I would order these again and again. I love them.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and work well.  Of course, you have to make sure you pull against the direction of the hair...so some areas you may have to do a couple of times laying the strips in different directions.  I&#x27;d definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> We bought the same item (same brand, same item number) as individual units to test the product before using the 3 pack purchased from Amazon.  Item does not remove thicker hairs in the bikini/private parts area as advertised. To get the job done, we are looking at Surgi-wax Brazilian Waxing Kit.    I&#x27;ll have to return the item for full refund.</li>
            <li> I bought the Bikini, Body &amp; Legs honey wax strips at Ulta.  There are 14 double sided strips, giving you a total of 28 strips.  It is a bit painful when you rip them off but the pain quickly subsides.  I used the strips only on by upper legs (above the knee); I did it in 4 days because it was sticky, a bit painful and time consuming.  After using all 28 strips my upper legs still have some hair on it.  The strips were not consistent in taking alot of hair off,  sometimes they would pull alot other times barely any hair would come off, I would try to reuse the strips again in another spot but it would only take a couple hairs if any off.  I followed the directions, warming them between my hands for a few seconds, smooth on in the direction of hair growth and tear off in opposite direction; I even went over some areas in different directions because not all the hair grew in one direction.  Never got the result I had hoped for... smooth legs.   This product I believe would work well if you were doing an upper lip or under the arms but not a large area.  I had let my hair growth on the leg to 1/2 an inch and even experimented on my lower leg with one strip which was at 1/4 inch of hair growth but the results were no better.  Gave it 3 stars because it sort of worked but not the best results, and because you may be happy if you used it in a small area but you would probably need a couple applications over the same spot.  Also some of the stips would get sticky on my legs, did not wash off with soap and water, I found that after an hour or two it would just disappear on it&#x27;s own, don&#x27;t do this just before you intend to go out on for a fancy occassion you will not be happy, it needs sometime to work with and unstick itself so it does not stick to your clothes.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product. I got it for my daughter and I both to use. Neither of us like it. If I can get the ones she has at her house I will send them make for a refund.</li>
            <li> I normally use Parisa way for my brows but decided to start waxing my pits and legs as well. I wanted to save a few bucks so I tried this cheaper brand. I&#x27;ve used their microwave honey wax in the past and it was OK, but these are total crap. At first I thought maybe my leg hair was too fine, but even after using these on my pits after not shaving for 3 days these strips left me patchy and sticky. I won&#x27;t get these again - I&#x27;m sticking to the good stuff or sticking it out with the razor from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my bikini line and it didn&#x27;t get all the hairs off, so it works better on fine hair. On my legs and arms worked great and sometimes I use it on my cheeks. I have cut it in half like other reviewers have suggested, but I find that wax leaks out where you cut it with scissors.</li>
            <li> i got this product a while ago but wanted to wait till i actually tried it before writing a review. so here i go.   it works. it gets MOST of the hair off. if you&#x27;re looking for a product that works, here you go.  BUT... my main complaint is that it leaves the area sticky! and my fingers accidentally touched part of the strip, and i&#x27;ve washed my hands about seven times since then and they are still sticky. like right now they are still sticking to my keyboard as i type this. and i guess i&#x27;m going commando for a little while because my underwear was sticking to my crotch.  i&#x27;m not going to complain about the pain, because any waxing product could cause it. so it is not the fault of the product. however, this was my first time waxing. for those of you who haven&#x27;t waxed before: everyone said it would be a sharp pain that went away almost instantly, like ripping off a bandaid, but i waxed like twenty minutes ago and it still stings...  so anyway, yeah, it works...but i think i&#x27;m going to go back to shaving...</li>
            <li> I tried this wax as a first time leg waxer. It was ok, I was kind of disapointed that it didn&#x27;t take all of the hair. There are some that I guess is finer than the rest and no matter how many times I went over it still didn&#x27;t pick it up. It was also kind of patchy with the hair that was longer. I don&#x27;t think I will do this one again. I will go with a hot wax system.      Pros: Didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would. That may be because it&#x27;s a cold honey wax. I noticed that the hot wax hurts more.   I have sensitive skin and most make me brake out or look like a burn victim but this was gentle no redness or itching or burning.             Cons: Didn&#x27;t take all of the hair even the hair that was long enough, it was patchy. One big problem was that it left traces of the wax on my skin that was near impossible to get off me. I took three showers to get this off! I know that seems extreme but every time I thought it was off I&#x27;d get out, and as soon as the skin was dry it was still sticky.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it only takes a small amount of hair off. With the reviews here I thought that it would take almost all the hair in the area applied but it leaves about 1/3 of the hair there. Is my hair different? I won&#x27;t buy this again because i don&#x27;t feel it removes enough hair. It didn&#x27;t even remove much of the bikini hair which is longer than leg hair so I thought it would work better there but it doesn&#x27;t. I would still have to shave.</li>
            <li> These do not pull out all the hairs on the leg, make sure you don&#x27;t leave the strips on too long, or not long enough. It depends on the temperature. You can also reuse them, especially if you aren&#x27;t too hairy like me. They also work fantastic on the armpits, and I&#x27;m noticing my hair regrowth is slowing down. Place the strips in the direction of the hair growth and pull out against the hair growth. You may have to try multiple times as my hair growth isn&#x27;t the same direction. Tried on bikini line, works OK - I recommend the Brazilian hot wax for that.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed my upper lip before, myself or at a salon.  I don&#x27;t have much hair and it was pretty short, maybe 1/8th inch, and pretty fine.  But, I could see it through my makeup.  It worked great, super easy, I could even reuse the strip if I missed a few hairs.  I just stuck it back on, rubbed it a couple of times and it worked again!  Then, I used the used strip to pull off any of the honey wax that stuck to my skin, which was very little.  I was really impressed.</li>
            <li> I have tried other wax strips, and I like these the best. It isn&#x27;t slathered in wax, so there isn&#x27;t globs of wax stuck to my skin, yet it effectively removes hair. The other brands&#x27; wax residue have to be removed with greasy oil, and even then it doesn&#x27;t do a super job in getting the wax off. These leave barely any reside and if they do, it is easily removable. Unlike the other brands I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t feel as though it is ripping skin off along with the hair. I like it that the strips are wax paper, not plastic, making them more malleable and negotiable.     The only thing I would like better would be if the strips were bigger. But in any case, I&#x27;m stocking up on these.</li>
            <li> Convenient, effective and a lot of strips!  I don&#x27;t use anything else. These are not messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the big ones for my face too, just use scissors to cut the right shape.  Make sure you leave an \\&quot;edge\\&quot; to grab hold of without having to get your hands sticky.  Once you place it on, rub it 2-3 times, no more, and then pull against the grain.  If you rub more than 3 times, the honey can get soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Years later I still use this stuff!  I read some other reviews on this product.  You really have to pull fast enough and make sure you&#x27;re pulling the right direction.  That is key.  I&#x27;ve used these on my really thick pubic hairs (yes TMI, I know) as well as fine facial hair and it works.  If you&#x27;re wondering if you&#x27;re pulling the right direction: your fingers should be closest to the end of the hair and farthest from the root.  When you pull you should NOT pull UP (perpendicular to your skin) you have to pull in a direction that is PARALLEL to your skin.  And pull very quickly.</li>
            <li> ...it seems to only remove a couple of hairs per strip. Maybe you have to be really hairy to get really good results, but who wants to wait until hair is really long to rip it out?    On the positive side, they really are quite tidy to use--no goopy wax or burning wax to deal with. You just rub the prewaxed strips between your palms for a few seconds, apply, &amp; let &#x27;er rip.     I&#x27;m going to let my hair grow a little longer &amp; try these again. I also plan on trying them on my husband&#x27;s back, where I hope the results are astounding.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this product awhile back and I just didn&#x27;t believe it could work.  Boy was I wrong.  The strips (clear, plastic strips)are prewaxed and stuck together so all you have to do is warm the strip against your skin (I put the wax strip against my stomach and place my hand over it) and tear them apart, then place the strip where you want hair removed, yank it off (against the way the hair grows) and viola the hair is gone.  You just throw away the used strip once you are done with it.  There is no mess and no fuss.  It does get most of the hairs you want removed too.  I have used this for a year now and absolutely love it and highly recommend it.  You can get this at Ulta which is where I get mine.</li>
            <li> That hurts so bad can&#x27;tUse that stuff</li>
            <li> The product did not work as well as I was hoping. If you are looking for salon results then this is not the product for you as it will be disappointing. It does a decent job of hair removal (especially for fine hair). It does not work as well on course hair. It took about 45 minutes to remove the hair on one leg (which I found to be excessive as shaving would be faster). For me, the results did last a little longer (about 10 days) than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the labor intensive nature of using this product then you will be satisfied with the results. If you&#x27;re looking for salon results then your best bet (in my opinion) is to continue with the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to go back to the salon and then try the product again. As I used it after shaving for the past several months.</li>
            <li> These are horrible!! I have tried them a few times both on leg and pubic hair and neither time have they worked in the slightest. Plus they leave a sticky honey residue behind.</li>
            <li> I have only ever used wax strips and these are by far the best that I have used. Aveeno was kind of gloopy sticky so it often didn&#x27;t take off hair but did take off skin. Sally hansen are absolutely the worst. But these are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Some tips to make it better:&lt;br /&gt;-exfoliate with a body scrub the shower before you wax&lt;br /&gt;-use a bristle brush on your leg or wherever your waxing and go with the direction of hair to make sure the hairs are going the right way and will be picked up&lt;br /&gt;- make sure your skin isn&#x27;t moist or greasy, it has to be a clean surface to work from&lt;br /&gt;- pull the skin in the opposite direction from the way your ripping the strip off so you get as much tension as possible.&lt;br /&gt;-rip the strip off so its as close to the skin as possible don&#x27;t pull up, pull back</li>
            <li> This product worked really well for my bikini area, but was horrible on my legs. It just didn&#x27;t grab any of the hair. I was waxed professionally before trying this product, and I just didn&#x27;t get good results. My bikini area was not waxed professionally and it did a nice job there will little pain and little irritation. I will try it again soon on my bikini line and see how it works there on hair that&#x27;s now thinner, but on legs that had been waxed one before it was a dud.</li>
            <li> I like these strips because they&#x27;re so much quicker and less mess and cleanup than heating wax and dealing with strips.  I heat these up with a little space heater, pull them apart and everything is so easy.  They also don&#x27;t leave strips of black glue-looking wax afterward. If you don&#x27;t get them warm enough, or too warm, the rip isn&#x27;t as effective.  Just right takes a little practice, but worth it in the end. I&#x27;ve done this in my car in a pinch before - no one knew the wiser.....</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim to try waxing my legs (something which I&#x27;d never done before at home OR at a salon). It&#x27;s been a week and my legs are still perfectly smooth, compared to the stubbled nightmare they usually are a week after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- No microwaving means that it was super easy and not very messy&lt;br /&gt;- Only a handful of stray hair didn&#x27;t get grabbed, probably because they were to short&lt;br /&gt;- Actually not that painful, which I was worried about since I have sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;- Was able to use each strip 2 or 3 times, and cut them for better placing in some spots&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Some wax residue, but it was easily cleaned up with a bit of baby oil and a couple cotton balls&lt;br /&gt;- Had to go over a few areas multiple times, but that&#x27;s not entirely the wax&#x27;s fault--some of the hair grows in odd directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and will definitely purchase again when my first 3 boxes run out! ;-)</li>
            <li> Very bad! Left my skin with bruises.</li>
            <li> too sticky. i was sticky for 3 days after using. not for me at all. will not buy</li>
            <li> Does not stick well :(</li>
            <li> This is a great product. it cleans well and I have tried many other brands this is the one i stick to.</li>
            <li> This will not work for hair that is rather thick, its really sticky but somehow does not even work on the thin hairs.</li>
            <li> i was not thrilled with this product because , it stick extremely hard, it was very painful, wich i was expecting but it didnt even take out half of the hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this waxing strips, they are very sticky and get the hair out!! Nothing to compare with the brands at the local store!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for at home waxing, these are great.  They are so easy to use, they don&#x27;t leave any wax on you.  They are really great.</li>
            <li> Great for underarms. I have rather thick hair. I use 2 strips per pit. Not as good for my thin leg hair. Leaves behind some stickiness. I use some oil on a cotton pad to wipe it off, then take a shower.</li>
