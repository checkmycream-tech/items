            <li> purchased based on reviews and was happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! It works great when I spray tan. I don&#x27;t have to worry about orange hands or feet. Nice and creamy mixture in a convenient pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Not a barrier cream I&#x27;d recommend. If anything the solution sticks to it more and does not come off in the areas that I applied the barrier cream.</li>
            <li> leaked everywhere as I opened the package.  a little over a quarter gone.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Does the job and prevents the orange hands and feet!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Great price and making it a lot easier to get my own spray tan going at home!</li>
            <li> I have used sunless spray tanning products for about 10 years.  The barrier cream works great for the elbows, knees, and on your heels.</li>
            <li> Works great for my light freckles skin tone, not orangey at all. Dries nicely &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave residue or clothes or in the shower, doesn&#x27;t rub off during sweaty situationsðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works well, but so will any lotion you already have.</li>
            <li> This works really well.  I put barrier cream on my palms and one hand ended up with a lot of tanning spray on it.  The barrier cream worked perfectly.  I washed my hands and they completely returned to normal color.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a great price!</li>
            <li> LOVE Amazon Prime, this arrived a day early. For a sunless tanning solution I am really pleased with the scent of this product. I like the color. Its more brown than orange. was not very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34;. dried quickly. I bought this size and I think it will last along time. Im excited for bikini season!</li>
            <li> Works great. I apply it to my elbows, knees, feet, and hands before applying the Venetian solution. Really helps avoice stains in those areas.</li>
            <li> Works good! My friend and I get spray tans alot and this has helped so much!</li>
            <li> This is the best barrier cream I have used.</li>
            <li> Product is great but arrived with a broken pump and lotion spilled all over.</li>
            <li> As described!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Started using this product at my local salon when I was going for a spray tan. It always works great. So I bought it for at home use.</li>
            <li> Norvell has always worked great for my&lt;br /&gt;Business. Can&#x27;t go wrong with these products:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the best reviews with customers since I&#x27;ve been using Norvell.</li>
            <li> I have used twice and it seems to be a nice protective lotion. It dries quick. I still wash my hands after being sprayed at home.</li>
            <li> Regular lotions seem to work just as well and not as expensive, was not to impressed with it at all.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Not the best in preventing tanning</li>
            <li> Works great. A little bit goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> Bottle had exploded during shipment</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I am having a difficult time getting the cream just right to prevent any splotching or streaking on my clients. I&#x27;m hoping I will see exactly how much I need to apply to get their tan just right!</li>
            <li> Works well u just have to use more than expected to keep from the places u put it. I find on your hands an feet u almost have to leave it white</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bit thicker.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT !!! OUR CUSTOMERS LOVE THE RESULTS NO ORANGE COLOR OR WEIRD SMELL</li>
