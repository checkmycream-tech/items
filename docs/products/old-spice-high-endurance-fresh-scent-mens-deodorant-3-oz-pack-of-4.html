            <li>, this makes me more manly than I already are, recommend buying without hesitation and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>The best deodorant I have ever found and the only deodorant that I have found that dosent give me a rash.</li>
            <li>Its was ok</li>
            <li>Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought these smelled good</li>
            <li>However, it does wash off much more easily than deodorants with antiperspirants included.</li>
            <li>The pure sport smells good too</li>
            <li>Old Spice is always great</li>
            <li>This is a great product that last all day and even better at night if you&#x27;re the type to wear deodorant then.</li>
            <li>Smells strong though.</li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased with this particular brand and style.</li>
            <li>It is effective and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering (as most Old Spice scents are).</li>
            <li>but fresh is his favorite.</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived on time and in the proper packaging.  </li>
            <li>hmm, it was fresh!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m more confidence all day even in hot summer day</li>
            <li>Super cheap for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>This is such a good program offered by amazon</li>
            <li>Rest assured, if it&#x27;s Old Spice, it has to be Nice.</li>
            <li>The time and effort that I saved winded up being worth getting them through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>since speedstick no longer makes my FRESH..</li>
            <li>do you guys remember fresh?</li>
            <li>fresh.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better than old spice</li>
            <li>Theeze keep my pits smellin so fresh and so cleeeeeeeenn.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and manly.</li>
            <li>They love Old Spice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did the rash go away, but the performance of the product was much better than I had previously experienced with any other deodorant.</li>
            <li>It is a great deodorant, he is &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and has had challenges with other deodorants being strong enough.  </li>
            <li>I only buy Old Spice because it smells good, but not for sweat protection.</li>
            <li>I thought about trying the different scents outside of Fresh and Original though just to kind of test the waters.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice High Endurance deodorants are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Really consistent product.</li>
            <li>The different scents are not that drastic, but I prefer the Fresh scent, as it is pretty neutral compared to the others, and won&#x27;t conflict much with your cologne, should you like to wear that most of the time.</li>
            <li>I decided to research it some and found many people with similar reactions with this product.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells good, but definitely does not last 24 hours.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an antiperspirant built in, so any amount of manual labor or movement will pretty much override it after 6-12 hours.</li>
            <li>None, only Old Spice provides it&#x27;s costumers with such great experience</li>
            <li>This works great and is though on sweat and smell and soft on my armpits, reading the back label pushed me to buy this product and keep on buying it when I run out, what other deodorant contains &amp;#34;odor-fighting Atomic Robot that shoot lasers at your stench monsters and replaces them with fresh, clean, masculine scent elves&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store.  </li>
            <li>The scent, while strong is definitely not overpowering or offensive.</li>
            <li>way too much fragrance.</li>
            <li>This one, not so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I just sweat too much?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s important to note that it is a deodorant only NO antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>the original blue.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice High Endurance Fresh Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant, 3 Oz size (</li>
            <li>They are non-messy, smell nice, and last a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a fresh smell its more like musk.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite deodorant for function and smell.</li>
            <li>I started using this many years ago when I had to make a switch based on getting a rash with my previous brand, which was a roll-on product.</li>
            <li>As much of a fan of Old Spice as I am, I can&#x27;t really recommend this product out of fear of the discomfort it may cause someone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and none of them keep me as fresh, dry and non chaffing as this brand does.</li>
            <li>Does not last 24 hours by far, more like half a work day.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice keeps on improving to become the clear dominant winner in men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used old spice for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t sweat much so he doesn&#x27;t need the antiperspirant and deodorant, this is ONLY a deoderant.</li>
            <li>I have been using Old Spice for year now.</li>
            <li>The stick is the same price, but has left width (more application needed) and .2oz less than the old packaging.</li>
            <li>These also do not leave yellow stains on your clothes, unlike some older Gillette deodorant sticks I have used.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, has been shipped very fast</li>
            <li>The only reason I docked it one star is that the new packaging is inferior.</li>
            <li>Old spice seems to last the longest for me in two ways.</li>
            <li>a far second..</li>
            <li>old spice keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li>Also not liking the roll-on &#x27;wetness&#x27;, I thought about trying several different types and settled upon Old Spice to test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I switched to deodorant only within a few days I was significantly less sweaty my shirts looks better and last longer.</li>
            <li>After using it the first few days, I noticed a stinging sensation when using it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on clothes as bad as Dove Men + Care, good on order</li>

            <li> /&gt;Not sure that it lasts as long as advertised, but, provided you don&#x27;t partake in excessively strenuous activities, it will probably at least 1/2 as long.</li>
            <li> YES they&#x27;ve made it for that long the containers changed over the years</li>
            <li> Compared to other Old Spice products I had been using, this one appears to actually last longer than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each tube seems to last longer before replacement is needed, and when using the scent lasts longer than other brands for me.</li>
            <li> , got a 4-pack on Amazon Prime for less than the price of 2 at the local Drug Store.</li>
            <li> To be honest, it was a total blind purchase, so it was probably silly of me to buy 4 off the bat.</li>
            <li> over the years he&#x27;s gotten 1-2 other stick brands</li>
            <li> i tried gels and other stuff over time</li>
            <li> some vendors are a little (or a lot) pricier!</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Not really sure why</li>
            <li> I hardly write rating</li>
            <li> Not a good smell.</li>
            <li> If they ever discontinue this product it will be a sad day.</li>
            <li> I used to have terrible sweaty pits and all of my shirts turned yellow or eventually had marks in the pits from the deodorant itself.</li>
            <li> Stopping use of this product made the bad rash and stinging go away, thankfully.</li>
            <li> I bet my co-workers are probably sick of the smell.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great protection, smells good and a great price from Amazon.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I only buy Old Spice because it smells good, but not for sweat protection. It just doesn&#x27;t work. I use it like a cologne just for the smell and nothing more</li>
            <li> The Old Spice High Endurance deodorants are my favorite. They are non-messy, smell nice, and last a long time. A stick can easily last me about 6 months. These also do not leave yellow stains on your clothes, unlike some older Gillette deodorant sticks I have used.</li>
            <li> keeps me from smelling, what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> I picked these up using the subscribe and save plan from Amazon.  The final price per unit winded up being cheaper then what I could get it in the store without coupons.  The time and effort that I saved winded up being worth getting them through Amazon.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> way too much fragrance. It&#x27;s like getting a big dose of cologne under your arms even if you only do one swipe. It&#x27;s not really a fresh smell its more like musk. everywhere you go you stink up the place. the smell lingers in clothes even after washing. would be a great product if they didn&#x27;t use so much fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant out there, PERIOD!!! This is a great product that last all day and even better at night if you&#x27;re the type to wear deodorant then. I&#x27;ve tried them all and none of them keep me as fresh, dry and non chaffing as this brand does. Old Spice keeps on improving to become the clear dominant winner in men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> Super cheap for the amount you get. The scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This scent is probably my favorite. Old spice seems to last the longest for me in two ways. Each tube seems to last longer before replacement is needed, and when using the scent lasts longer than other brands for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and size for the price. My husband is very pleased with this particular brand and style.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this deodorant for years.  It is a great deodorant, he is &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and has had challenges with other deodorants being strong enough.  The scent, while strong is definitely not overpowering or offensive.</li>
            <li> Compared to other Old Spice products I had been using, this one appears to actually last longer than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure that it lasts as long as advertised, but, provided you don&#x27;t partake in excessively strenuous activities, it will probably at least 1/2 as long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used old spice for a couple years now. it has a great smell. Works great. I like it. I also got a great deal it on it!</li>
            <li> The Old Spice High Endurance Fresh Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant, 3 Oz size (Pack of 4) sold by this vendor is of excellent quality and for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> since speedstick no longer makes my FRESH.. this is second best... a far second.. do you guys remember fresh? not the antiperspirant one.. the original blue. fresh. hmm, it was fresh! i miss it</li>
            <li> I hardly write rating but I think this product is excellent. Nice smell, good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really consistent product. I started using this many years ago when I had to make a switch based on getting a rash with my previous brand, which was a roll-on product. Also not liking the roll-on &#x27;wetness&#x27;, I thought about trying several different types and settled upon Old Spice to test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did the rash go away, but the performance of the product was much better than I had previously experienced with any other deodorant. The different scents are not that drastic, but I prefer the Fresh scent, as it is pretty neutral compared to the others, and won&#x27;t conflict much with your cologne, should you like to wear that most of the time.</li>
            <li> Burn city!! At first, I thought these smelled good and I thought I found a great deal buying this pack of 4. To be honest, it was a total blind purchase, so it was probably silly of me to buy 4 off the bat. I saw so many great reviews and decided to give it a shot. After using it the first few days, I noticed a stinging sensation when using it. I figured it was just something temporary and would go away eventually. Well... after some time, I began developing a rash and that stinging definitely never went away. I decided to research it some and found many people with similar reactions with this product. As much of a fan of Old Spice as I am, I can&#x27;t really recommend this product out of fear of the discomfort it may cause someone. Stopping use of this product made the bad rash and stinging go away, thankfully. I tried the tips that others left in terms of applying the product, but it still didn&#x27;t lessen the pain or reaction to the product. What a shame.</li>
            <li> Not a good smell. I bought it for my husband and son and I cringe over the smell. Uuuhhh. The Sport scent is really nice. This one, not so much.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells good, but definitely does not last 24 hours. It doesn&#x27;t have an antiperspirant built in, so any amount of manual labor or movement will pretty much override it after 6-12 hours. However, it does wash off much more easily than deodorants with antiperspirants included.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for the past 10 years. It is effective and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering (as most Old Spice scents are). The only reason I docked it one star is that the new packaging is inferior. The stick is the same price, but has left width (more application needed) and .2oz less than the old packaging.</li>
            <li> It is not the best but it does not stain your shirts.  Controls 50% body odor</li>
            <li> Wish I could find an organic version that matched the strength and lasting power of this.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just sweat too much?</li>
            <li> My husband has used the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent of this deodorant for 18+ years YES they&#x27;ve made it for that long the containers changed over the years but the product hasn&#x27;t. It seems AMAZING, I love this scent once or twice over the years he&#x27;s gotten 1-2 other stick brands and well it just doesn&#x27;t smell like his scent. The pure sport smells good too but fresh is his favorite. He doesn&#x27;t sweat much so he doesn&#x27;t need the antiperspirant and deodorant, this is ONLY a deoderant.</li>
            <li> Greatest of all time. No overpowering cologne scent when you put a shirt on</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better than old spice</li>
            <li> Not really sure why but I like this deodorant. I&#x27;m a creature of habit and I think I&#x27;ve been wearing it for multiple years. I bet my co-workers are probably sick of the smell. Hmm, o-well, I like it.</li>
            <li> Finaly i found good deodorant&lt;br /&gt;Now i&#x27;m more confidence all day even in hot summer day i don&#x27;t need to worry about smell .</li>
            <li> Not much to say, has been shipped very fast</li>
            <li> Theeze keep my pits smellin so fresh and so cleeeeeeeenn. It almost masks the stench of my funky balls</li>
            <li> I have been using Old Spice for year now. Great product, arrived on time and in the proper packaging.  Ladies love me even more now!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice deal. Smells strong though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on clothes as bad as Dove Men + Care, good on order</li>
            <li> Does not last 24 hours by far, more like half a work day.  But it does smell nice.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite deodorant for function and smell. If they ever discontinue this product it will be a sad day. I&#x27;ve been using this for many years now and it&#x27;s important to note that it is a deodorant only NO antiperspirant. I used to have terrible sweaty pits and all of my shirts turned yellow or eventually had marks in the pits from the deodorant itself. After I switched to deodorant only within a few days I was significantly less sweaty my shirts looks better and last longer. If you have a problem with sweaty pits try a deodorant only like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, got a 4-pack on Amazon Prime for less than the price of 2 at the local Drug Store.</li>
            <li> This works great and is though on sweat and smell and soft on my armpits, reading the back label pushed me to buy this product and keep on buying it when I run out, what other deodorant contains &amp;#34;odor-fighting Atomic Robot that shoot lasers at your stench monsters and replaces them with fresh, clean, masculine scent elves&amp;#34;? None, only Old Spice provides it&#x27;s costumers with such great experience and I love it would give an extra star if I could, this makes me more manly than I already are, recommend buying without hesitation and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is really good. My husband uses it all the time with good results. I buy this through the subscribe and save program. This is such a good program offered by amazon</li>
            <li> smells nice and works</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and manly.</li>
            <li> Old Spice is always great and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 years already. Can&#x27;t complain because the product is long-lasting and smells amazing. I thought about trying the different scents outside of Fresh and Original though just to kind of test the waters. Rest assured, if it&#x27;s Old Spice, it has to be Nice.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Deodorant is deodorant, and this is a good as it gets. Nice, fresh, good deal on four pack. But watch which four pack and price - some vendors are a little (or a lot) pricier!</li>
            <li> good deodorant. makes me not smell. haven&#x27;t seen any scent elves but i think i prefer it that way. i tried gels and other stuff over time and i just don&#x27;t like it. old spice keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li> Very Nice Product !!!!</li>
            <li> The best deodorant I have ever found and the only deodorant that I have found that dosent give me a rash.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves the smell</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t prevent sweat.</li>
            <li> Its was ok but I brock out in rashes but I appreciate the product but I think I should have used a different type of deodorant</li>
            <li> Best deodorant made .</li>
            <li> For  Grandsons Christmas stocking stuffers.  They love Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store.  Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop.  Buy with confidence.</li>
