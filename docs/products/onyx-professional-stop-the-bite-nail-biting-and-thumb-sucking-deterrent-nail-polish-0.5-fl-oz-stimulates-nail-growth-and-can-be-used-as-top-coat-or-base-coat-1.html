            <li>Worked as advertised, For Sure!!</li>
            <li>Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>this stuff is very effective.</li>
            <li>so it is very effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is very effective.  </li>
            <li>First time I ever have had nails!!!!!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly!</li>
            <li>But this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Good product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Finger foods isn&#x27;t really a good idea while using this.</li>
            <li>and although I don&#x27;t see him suck his thumb anymore, I&#x27;m still going to continue to paint it on for another couple of weeks, to ensure that he&#x27;s done with thumb-sucking for good.</li>
            <li>It works good, but it affects on my life , I cannot eat, I cannot make any thing by my hand because it affects the taste of food ..</li>
            <li>if i remember to apply it to his nails every morning, it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>Good price, too.</li>
            <li>My daughter immediately learned after trying to suck her thumb twice that it wasn&#x27;t a good idea anymore</li>
            <li>Very potent taste and smell.</li>
            <li>Ok people!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the way it stays on...and on...and reminds them of what they biting (when they are not even aware of it).</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Of course the look on his face was priceless and so funny.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>This stuff works amazingly.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and helped me to stop biting my nails</li>
            <li>Guys this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Kind of torn between 1 and 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Went for a swim in the pool and it remained effective afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for ages and wanted to have nice nails for my wedding.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for selling this great product!</li>
            <li>Lasted nicely, and none of his classmates noticed the polish.&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really an effective product,</li>
            <li>I really liked it and my nails grew the longest ive seen them in years!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I couldn’t taste anything on my own fingernails when I tried it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the way his food tastes either, which is nice.</li>
            <li>No biting taste awful.&lt;br /&gt;Shared it with a coworker and she too liked the results.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked for me; I continue to use it intermittently, just to keep myself honest (and my fingernails out of my mouth).  </li>
            <li>It is truly hideous, but effective.  </li>
            <li>I am super happy.</li>
            <li>Tastes like crap...works pretty good!</li>
            <li>With that being said though, it really does work and I am happy to say that my nails are growing quite nicely.</li>
            <li>but I washed my hands many times in the day</li>
            <li>Love it?  </li>
            <li>OK, but it had to be applied twice a day.</li>
            <li>If you find that you can&#x27;t, milk will get the taste out of your mouth if it becomes overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>but when he was eating things with his fingers, he was able to taste it.  </li>
            <li>my daughter  is on a week without sucking her thumb bc of this. :)</li>
            <li>I am glad I did...</li>
            <li>Great product and would highly recommend to anyone who has a biter!</li>
            <li>Her desire to suck her thumb is greater than her desire to avoid the taste of this.</li>
            <li>Love it-</li>
            <li>better idea, get some plastic gloves, easier.  </li>
            <li>Has a lovely shine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to eat my lunch today as it consisted of a sandwich and chips and somehow the taste of this polish gets on my lips</li>
            <li>(okay, make him stop..</li>
            <li>I just swiped the polish along the top edge of his nails.</li>
            <li>But I do suggest that if you are eating just make sure that you put it on before you start eating</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many modalities to stop biting and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I truly believe that it can help many people.</li>
            <li>That may be one reason it works ok.</li>
            <li>but then figured this was better.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I rated it okay because you have to paint your nails with this stuff twice a day - as it states or it will literally peel off of your nails.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Fantactic product :)</li>
            <li>made them stop :-)</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Which is what makes this such an excellent product and drove me to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this stuff at walmart or walgreens, but they discontinued it.</li>
            <li>but I sure wouldn&#x27;t have forgiven them for it</li>
            <li>the remainder sat at the top of the medicine cabinet unused.</li>
            <li>love it, 3 of my 4 kids have a problem with this</li>
            <li>I wear this over my nail polish and top</li>
            <li>I am sure to be a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>make sure to eat everything with a fork</li>
            <li>for the last three weeks I haven&#x27;t because of this polish it is the best!</li>
            <li>I waited to give my review to see how successful it would really be of breaking me of my habit.</li>
            <li>The best quick solution for those who&#x27;ve been suffering from constant nail biting habits.</li>
            <li>Came off easy and the taste did not phase my son.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove and is shiny</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rubing off so easy on everything</li>
            <li>It does not wash off easily..</li>
            <li>problem is that it transfers easily..</li>
            <li>She would pull them off easily.</li>
            <li>and I very quickly regretted it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be that easy.</li>
            <li>, it did not wear off easily.  </li>
            <li>The taste was strong for a couple of hours and lingered for about another hour.  </li>
            <li>actually to be completely honest this is the first product I have tried to stop my nail biting.</li>
            <li>but I would not call that flavor mild by any means!</li>
            <li>This is huge for him.</li>
            <li>This polish a distinct  taste that makes you want to avoid eating or even touching your face.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the primary purpose of thumb sucking, but she also used to bite her nails as well.</li>
            <li>It is great for quitting biting your nails, but it also gets in your mouth about a hundred times a day when you are eating finger food, washing your face, putting on makeup, simply existing, etc.  </li>
            <li>Maybe, good parenting more likely.</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any other of its kind!</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t want any finger foods for a while, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>and I am pretty pleased with the results..</li>
            <li>I originally tried this when a coworker let me use it.</li>
            <li>The product actually stays on your fingers a couple days at a time, even after scrubbing with soap (I got it on my own fingers)!</li>
            <li>, no, we are looking for child friendly to help our kids stop chewing on stuff</li>
            <li>It worked great for my youngest but my 4 year old not so much.</li>
            <li>Has the unexpected problem/benefit of making the eating of finger foods challenging -- you don&#x27;t want your food or your lips to touch those nails!</li>
            <li>Probably great for older kids &amp; adult nail biters</li>
            <li>Good luck to future polishers!</li>
            <li>This stuff is true to the name..</li>
            <li>It gets into the nooks &amp; crannies of your nails &amp; you can taste it for a good week or so after only one application.</li>
            <li>This stuff tastes HORRID and stays on your nails for a good while, even with regular hand washing.</li>
            <li>this one has been tremendously helpful.</li>
            <li>It dries quick as well.    </li>
            <li>So, it does work - usually quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It wears off quickly, so you must apply daily.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Wears off too quickly.</li>
            <li>I just show her the &amp;#34;stop the bite&amp;#34; and she quickly moves her fingers.</li>
            <li>I applied a quick coat of this as soon as I got it</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only takes one coat because it is so potent, and it stays for a while!</li>
            <li>Completely agree with most people on here.</li>
            <li>A fresh coat would have me running to the sink to rinse my mouth with water.  </li>
            <li>I paint her nails with regular nail polish and put this over it sometimes, or just use it on its own.</li>
            <li>It does take 1-2 days to completely wear off, so make sure you keep applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>price for product, now I haven&#x27;t seen her suck her thumb/bite nails in over 2 weeks, so I would say it was worth it.</li>
            <li>and I am okay so far.</li>
            <li>I started putting this stuff on and no lie within 4 weeks I completely stopped biting or even going near my nails because of the not so good taste.</li>
            <li>it is working on my five year old more thumb sucking and</li>
            <li>I would suggest using this in addition to regular nail maintenance like filing/buffing to keep them looking nice and taking pride in your progress.</li>
            <li>But the benefits are far better than the setbacks.</li>
            <li>This is an update to my previous 5 star review for the first bottle I bought, which worked great.</li>
            <li>does it help him stop biting his nails, but his nails are growing super fast!  </li>
            <li>Item received was exactly as described and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The directions say to apply twice a day, but if you re-apply a just few times a week it&#x27;s still very effective.</li>
            <li>I bit my nails right to the cuticle and have done so for 32 years.</li>
            <li>I learned my lesson right then.  </li>
            <li>I just tried this yesterday and I am positive it will help me stop biting my nails along with losing weight, 2 for 1 bonus!</li>
            <li>The taste is very strong on foods, such as chips, when you grab them with your hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective but it remains in the finger for long time.</li>
            <li>Now he is habit free in only a free weeks of applying once each morning.</li>
            <li>She instantly stopped biting her nails and after 2 weeks I could notice her nails growing again after more than a year of not cutting her nails as they never grew.</li>
            <li>While I can taste this faintly on my own fingernails, my 4 year old stepdaughter is completely oblivious to it and her fingers continue to go in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that it will highlight how many times you put your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Have not seen my son chew on his nails since the first application.</li>
            <li>I must say that this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I tried it myself because my son cried the first time he put his finger in his mouth</li>
            <li>3weeks ago, he stopped sucking his thumb permanently with no slip-ups 2weeks after we first started using it.</li>
            <li>: I found out later, the trick is making sure that whoever you bought it for, uses it.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years after all else failed-she stopped-</li>
            <li>Ive only used the stuff for three weeks, but I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>We tried another product at first that works</li>
            <li>Made him cry the first time since he couldn&#x27;t pick up food and eat that either (somehow got onto that too).</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s definatly not putting his fingernails/ hands in his mouth as much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since stopthebite comes in a slightly larger bottle (.5oz) and cost 1/3 the price, my cheapness got the better of me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and already my nails look better.</li>
            <li>Well funny until he started projectile vomiting all over the place.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>It works,  although is not necessary to use it twice a day , and after a while even if you don&#x27;t use it any more you still have the bitterness flavor in your nails.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>oh well, hopefully I will stop biting quickly and can go back to eating normally :)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much what it&#x27;s for</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have used that really works for me.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first; didn&#x27;t want her getting any kind chemical in her mouth but one little taste reminded her.</li>
            <li>I personally disagree  with some people said it wash&#x27;s off to easily</li>
            <li>its strong enough that I notice when I try to bite my nails without thinking about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days, and already know it&#x27;s going to make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>You would really have to be determined if you kept gnawing despite the taste.</li>
            <li>Has a bitter taste (which is the point) and works ok.</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>Thanks 😄</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you want to stop biting your nails, thumb sucking, etc!</li>
            <li>so I had to do something fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this much nail growth</li>
            <li>is a lot more bitter than Barielle;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>peels/wears off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>I really like this polish for my daughter, who is 8.</li>
            <li>so, it should last...but exercise caution, this thing is intense</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This stuff really really works.</li>
            <li>Almost too much.</li>
            <li>I have bitten my nails my whole life and this product works.</li>
            <li>I made iced tea and the whole batch had to be thrown out</li>
            <li>his whole life.&lt;br /&gt;Cut</li>
            <li>You do not need to coat the whole nail.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect any miracles fast.</li>
            <li>To my surprise this is very close.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it much anymore</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My wife has bitten her nails her whole life.</li>
            <li>I know that twice a day doesn&#x27;t sound unreasonable, but when your caught up in the day with 3 children, you tend to forget that you needed that second coat.</li>
            <li>and my nails are growing prettt fast.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really find the taste all that offensive.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works - 100%.  </li>
            <li>fast.</li>
            <li>But it dries really fast and</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My son has stopped sucking his thumb, thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>but my son not so much.  </li>
            <li>Tge taste lingers to remind you just how much you don&#x27;t want your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Then you end up wiping your tongue on the nearest thing to get the taste off, causing everyone around you to find you much stranger than if you were just biting your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any behavioral changes.</li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>so much so that it make you want to scrape your tongue.</li>
            <li>When I put this stuff on he says it tastes good and just sucks it off.</li>
            <li>Go back to the old formula it was much better, I would pay twice as much for the old formula!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not really expensive as the bottle does go very far.</li>
            <li>This one seems to work better than the other product that is intended to stop nail biting/thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>Only con is have to remember to apply everyday,but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It worked the first time but my 9 year old wouldn&#x27;t apply it thereafter.</li>
            <li>This is the first product we&#x27;ve bought to get our 3 year old to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>My nails are actually normal now and they even grew fast.</li>
            <li>It might be useful for a very taste sensitive child or an adult that just want&#x27;s a reminder.</li>
            <li>True to its word…  I definitely cringe just looking at my hands..  </li>
            <li>this worked the first time I used it with my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>That way the first &#x27;finger-in-mouth&#x27; afterwards meets the very strong Onyx as a reminder, and while the Onyx tends to wear off after a couple days, the Barielle stays for at least a week.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a try for the money but will go back to my other product as I had better success with it.</li>
            <li>, she could taste the polish on her finger foods while eating, this is the main thing she didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>My main concern with both Hoof and Malvala is that the lingering bitterness will desensitize my daughter too it.</li>
            <li>For a mild to moderate nail biter, this stuff works!</li>
            <li>I my nails are completely grown out and my nails are strong and long.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that repeat offenders will eventually desensitize themselves to the ingredient, but I highly doubt that claim.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who has or is a nail biter or thumbsucker.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old quit biting his fingers after one application!!</li>
            <li>Tried it for my very determined 7 year old.</li>
            <li>So far this has really helped solve the problem my son and husband have with biting their cuticles.  </li>
            <li>It really made me realize how often I have my hands near my mouth.</li>
            <li>Between the two, her nail chewing is pretty much stopped, except for an occasional slip.</li>
            <li>For small children/thumbsuckers - Mavala might be the less potent and therefore better option.</li>
            <li>Ive been biting my nails for 15+ years and used a gross nail polish as a kid to get me to stop but that polish didnt work, i chewed it right off.</li>
            <li>Glad I did plain and</li>
            <li>Needs replaced much more often then the recommended times per day because it constantly washes off due to being highly water soluble.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly.</li>
            <li>It worked on stopping my 8 year old grand daughter from sucking her thumb with just a few application.  </li>
            <li>since he always has them chewed down to the quick, but now he does!</li>
            <li>Stopped my 2 year old from sucking her thumb after one week!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Used on a 5 year old to stop sucking her pinky...day 4...and still she is not sucking her finger!</li>
            <li>his nails with a nail clipper last week for the first time since he was a baby.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>The brand I had many years ago only required one coat every other day.</li>
            <li>I got a taste of it and nearly gagged!</li>
            <li>My fingers stay far away from mouth and anything else that could come in contact with my tongue!</li>
            <li>Even after removing it with nail polish remover, and washing my hands numerous times with soap and hot water, I could still get the taste of it lingering on my fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gross but without being crippling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish wears off after 2-3 days and will need to be reapplied.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it human nature took over and, of course, I had to taste it.  </li>
            <li>It tastes like utter death and it lingers on your lips/in your mouth, which is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super bitter and stays on your nails for days.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why, because it was a true deterrent for me when I tried it first, however he completely ignored it and kept his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li>It is a little shiny like a cheap clear nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Word</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and makes your nails look shiny.</li>
            <li>so it looks like clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Looks just like clear coat nail polish as you can see from the pictures.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s never needed to clip his finger nails as an adult</li>
            <li>I used it to help my 3 year old stop sucking her thumb, and I used it to help me stop biting my nails.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been sucking his fingers since he was 1 year old</li>
            <li>Used this polish on my 2 1/2 year old.</li>
            <li>That said, my 20 month old doesn&#x27;t like it, but she&#x27;ll suck it off or suffer through the bitterness (whimpering).</li>
            <li>This did not stop my 4 year old from biting his nails.</li>
            <li>I use them on my 8 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got it for a friend who&#x27;s almost 4 year old wouldn&#x27;t stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old and have chewed my nails ever since I can remember.</li>
            <li>It will make it that you don&#x27;t want your fingers near your face at all.  </li>
            <li>Did not help my 1 year old</li>
            <li>My 5 year old hates this stuff.</li>
            <li>Did not deter my 5 yr old at all.</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old has been biting his nails since he was about 1.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my 3 year old</li>
            <li>We initially used the gentle thumb glove to try to get our five-year-old son to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>It 100% does what it says it does - you will not ever want to put your fingers anywhere near your mouth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t scratch or rub anywhere near my mouth or it will transfer to my lips and I will taste it all day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think the product would effect daily life like this, but I&#x27;m going to try to stick it out.</li>
            <li>This certainly fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m trying to help my 6 yr old stop biting her nails</li>
            <li>My 6 yr old says she doesn&#x27;t like the taste</li>
            <li>So far this has done the trick</li>
            <li>This works wonders for my 14 year old.  </li>
            <li>MY 9 YEAR OLD STOPPED SUCKING HER THUMB AND BITTING HER NAILS WITHIN 3 WEEKS.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8 year old and my 3 year old who are both nail biters.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old says mom</li>
            <li>I am a 25 year old who bites her nails when nervous so to help my control</li>
            <li>my three year old isn&#x27;t as bothered by it though.</li>
            <li>My 6-year old has been a nail biter for 4 years.</li>
            <li>Since they quit sticking their fingers in their mouths I completely forgot all about putting the solution on their nails.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m thinking of using it on my 8 year old to get him to use his utensils and stop eating with his hands!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Im 25 years old</li>
            <li>Also her mother put it on the 5 year old&#x27;s Boogar picking finger to stop her from picking her nose and eating her boogars.  </li>
            <li>:) There are a few that have been bitten so we will continue with this and use trial and error when he finally stops biting.</li>
            <li>its like they changed the formula for this - it now peels off like crazy, no matter how many coats I put on, the taste is a lot less strong and its less effective.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the foreign competitor, and works exactly the same as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting to, but, fortunately, the odor was barely noticeable when applied and after a few minutes of drying disappeared altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I get the urge to bite my nails a put a small dab on the tips and it most definitely discourages the bite.</li>
            <li>It stays on your nails much longer than the package says, so it is rather economical, and you cannot get past the flavor to bite your nails even if you try.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t taste as strong as other products I&#x27;ve tried but is bitter tasting as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same brand, but I noticed the new bottle looked different and they must&#x27;ve used a new formula.</li>
            <li>brush on well, dry very quickly, and add a slight shine to the nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bit my nails for a long time, but this isn&#x27;t  my first time stopping and starting again.</li>
            <li>For the first time my baby boy has nails long enough to have dirt under them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not pleased with it as much as the first stuff I tried.</li>
            <li>My son quickly learned how to rub it off before it dried.</li>
            <li>After only about 3 weeks my 6 year old daughter was done chewing her nails!</li>
            <li>Since putting it on in the morning, I find that the taste is still there in the evening but not strong enough that I can&#x27;t enjoy a finger food type of snack in the evening.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful to use utensils where you might want to use your fingers, but otherwise it certainly does what it is supposed to:  keeps your fingers out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>So summary 9 years old good, 3 years old bad.</li>
            <li>I had used the Mavala Stop for about three weeks when I left the bottle in my car and it completely leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Taste can be noticed when eating finger foods if not careful.</li>
            <li>not wet, mind you, but 2 or 4 days after applied</li>
            <li>and it is still there enough to serve as a reminder that I don&#x27;t want my fingers anywhere near my mouth.  </li>
            <li>With the old stuff I didn&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating food when I cooked, ONLY when I would bite my nails.</li>
            <li>i put this on my one fingernail and it tasted gross for nearly a week.</li>
            <li>I got it for my 2 yr old because she was biting her nails all the way back into the cuticle.</li>
            <li>(our 4th is only a month old)</li>
            <li>The taste does &amp;#34;spread&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I am a busy mom, so I typically only put one coat on a day and it still works.</li>
            <li>so I do make sure that if I&#x27;m behind the wheels, I put this on before I leave the house.</li>
            <li>Only down side,  a fresh coat will transfer to whatever your nail touches.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, this has really helped me stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li>stop the bite&amp;#34; is very bitter and the taste comes on much quicker than Malvala.</li>
            <li>it is a constant reminder that u want your hands as far away as possible from your mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely pretty hard to live like this, but hopefully within a week or two I won&#x27;t need it anymore.</li>
            <li>No more nail biting after the first time using it!</li>
            <li>She now has long nails that I had to clip the other day for the first time in months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 years old, and have been biting my nails as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>I was applying it about three times a day for the first few days.  </li>
            <li>It was a little smaller than i expected but after reading other reviews and looking at pictures i realized that the size was appropriate.</li>
            <li>I am a 22 year old male i have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> Yes it worked great.</li>
            <li> Fingernails look great and that touch of nervousness that accompanies the compulsive chewing has gone away.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy.  </li>
            <li> Worked as advertised, For Sure!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is very effective.</li>
            <li> so it is very effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is very effective.  </li>
            <li> First time I ever have had nails!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly!</li>
            <li> But this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Good product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Finger foods isn&#x27;t really a good idea while using this.</li>
            <li> and although I don&#x27;t see him suck his thumb anymore, I&#x27;m still going to continue to paint it on for another couple of weeks, to ensure that he&#x27;s done with thumb-sucking for good.</li>
            <li> It works good, but it affects on my life , I cannot eat, I cannot make any thing by my hand because it affects the taste of food ..</li>
            <li> if i remember to apply it to his nails every morning, it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> Good price, too.</li>
            <li> My daughter immediately learned after trying to suck her thumb twice that it wasn&#x27;t a good idea anymore</li>
            <li> Very potent taste and smell.</li>
            <li> Ok people!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the way it stays on...and on...and reminds them of what they biting (when they are not even aware of it).</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Of course the look on his face was priceless and so funny.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and helped me to stop biting my nails</li>
            <li> Guys this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Kind of torn between 1 and 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Went for a swim in the pool and it remained effective afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for ages and wanted to have nice nails for my wedding.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for selling this great product!</li>
            <li> Lasted nicely, and none of his classmates noticed the polish.&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really an effective product,</li>
            <li> I really liked it and my nails grew the longest ive seen them in years!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I couldn’t taste anything on my own fingernails when I tried it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the way his food tastes either, which is nice.</li>
            <li> No biting taste awful.&lt;br /&gt;Shared it with a coworker and she too liked the results.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for me; I continue to use it intermittently, just to keep myself honest (and my fingernails out of my mouth).  </li>
            <li> It is truly hideous, but effective.  </li>
            <li> I am super happy.</li>
            <li> Tastes like crap...works pretty good!</li>
            <li> With that being said though, it really does work and I am happy to say that my nails are growing quite nicely.</li>
            <li> but I washed my hands many times in the day</li>
            <li> Love it?  </li>
            <li> OK, but it had to be applied twice a day.</li>
            <li> If you find that you can&#x27;t, milk will get the taste out of your mouth if it becomes overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> but when he was eating things with his fingers, he was able to taste it.  </li>
            <li> my daughter  is on a week without sucking her thumb bc of this. :)</li>
            <li> I am glad I did...</li>
            <li> Great product and would highly recommend to anyone who has a biter!</li>
            <li> Her desire to suck her thumb is greater than her desire to avoid the taste of this.</li>
            <li> Love it-</li>
            <li> better idea, get some plastic gloves, easier.  </li>
            <li> Has a lovely shine.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to eat my lunch today as it consisted of a sandwich and chips and somehow the taste of this polish gets on my lips</li>
            <li> (okay, make him stop..</li>
            <li> I just swiped the polish along the top edge of his nails.</li>
            <li> But I do suggest that if you are eating just make sure that you put it on before you start eating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many modalities to stop biting and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I truly believe that it can help many people.</li>
            <li> That may be one reason it works ok.</li>
            <li> but then figured this was better.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I rated it okay because you have to paint your nails with this stuff twice a day - as it states or it will literally peel off of your nails.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Fantactic product :)</li>
            <li> made them stop :-)</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Which is what makes this such an excellent product and drove me to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this stuff at walmart or walgreens, but they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> but I sure wouldn&#x27;t have forgiven them for it</li>
            <li> the remainder sat at the top of the medicine cabinet unused.</li>
            <li> love it, 3 of my 4 kids have a problem with this</li>
            <li> I wear this over my nail polish and top</li>
            <li> I am sure to be a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> make sure to eat everything with a fork</li>
            <li> for the last three weeks I haven&#x27;t because of this polish it is the best!</li>
            <li> I waited to give my review to see how successful it would really be of breaking me of my habit.</li>
            <li> The best quick solution for those who&#x27;ve been suffering from constant nail biting habits.</li>
            <li> Came off easy and the taste did not phase my son.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove and is shiny</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rubing off so easy on everything</li>
            <li> It does not wash off easily..</li>
            <li> problem is that it transfers easily..</li>
            <li> She would pull them off easily.</li>
            <li> and I very quickly regretted it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be that easy.</li>
            <li> , it did not wear off easily.  </li>
            <li> The taste was strong for a couple of hours and lingered for about another hour.  </li>
            <li> actually to be completely honest this is the first product I have tried to stop my nail biting.</li>
            <li> but I would not call that flavor mild by any means!</li>
            <li> This is huge for him.</li>
            <li> This polish a distinct  taste that makes you want to avoid eating or even touching your face.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the primary purpose of thumb sucking, but she also used to bite her nails as well.</li>
            <li> It is great for quitting biting your nails, but it also gets in your mouth about a hundred times a day when you are eating finger food, washing your face, putting on makeup, simply existing, etc.  </li>
            <li> Maybe, good parenting more likely.</li>
            <li> It really works!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any other of its kind!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t want any finger foods for a while, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> and I am pretty pleased with the results..</li>
            <li> I originally tried this when a coworker let me use it.</li>
            <li> The product actually stays on your fingers a couple days at a time, even after scrubbing with soap (I got it on my own fingers)!</li>
            <li> , no, we are looking for child friendly to help our kids stop chewing on stuff</li>
            <li> It worked great for my youngest but my 4 year old not so much.</li>
            <li> Has the unexpected problem/benefit of making the eating of finger foods challenging -- you don&#x27;t want your food or your lips to touch those nails!</li>
            <li> Probably great for older kids &amp; adult nail biters</li>
            <li> Good luck to future polishers!</li>
            <li> This stuff is true to the name..</li>
            <li> It gets into the nooks &amp; crannies of your nails &amp; you can taste it for a good week or so after only one application.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes HORRID and stays on your nails for a good while, even with regular hand washing.</li>
            <li> this one has been tremendously helpful.</li>
            <li> It dries quick as well.    </li>
            <li> So, it does work - usually quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It wears off quickly, so you must apply daily.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Wears off too quickly.</li>
            <li> I just show her the &amp;#34;stop the bite&amp;#34; and she quickly moves her fingers.</li>
            <li> I applied a quick coat of this as soon as I got it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes one coat because it is so potent, and it stays for a while!</li>
            <li> Completely agree with most people on here.</li>
            <li> A fresh coat would have me running to the sink to rinse my mouth with water.  </li>
            <li> I paint her nails with regular nail polish and put this over it sometimes, or just use it on its own.</li>
            <li> It does take 1-2 days to completely wear off, so make sure you keep applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> price for product, now I haven&#x27;t seen her suck her thumb/bite nails in over 2 weeks, so I would say it was worth it.</li>
            <li> and I am okay so far.</li>
            <li> I started putting this stuff on and no lie within 4 weeks I completely stopped biting or even going near my nails because of the not so good taste.</li>
            <li> it is working on my five year old more thumb sucking and</li>
            <li> I would suggest using this in addition to regular nail maintenance like filing/buffing to keep them looking nice and taking pride in your progress.</li>
            <li> But the benefits are far better than the setbacks.</li>
            <li> This is an update to my previous 5 star review for the first bottle I bought, which worked great.</li>
            <li> does it help him stop biting his nails, but his nails are growing super fast!  </li>
            <li> Item received was exactly as described and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply twice a day, but if you re-apply a just few times a week it&#x27;s still very effective.</li>
            <li> I bit my nails right to the cuticle and have done so for 32 years.</li>
            <li> I learned my lesson right then.  </li>
            <li> I just tried this yesterday and I am positive it will help me stop biting my nails along with losing weight, 2 for 1 bonus!</li>
            <li> The taste is very strong on foods, such as chips, when you grab them with your hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective but it remains in the finger for long time.</li>
            <li> Now he is habit free in only a free weeks of applying once each morning.</li>
            <li> She instantly stopped biting her nails and after 2 weeks I could notice her nails growing again after more than a year of not cutting her nails as they never grew.</li>
            <li> While I can taste this faintly on my own fingernails, my 4 year old stepdaughter is completely oblivious to it and her fingers continue to go in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it will highlight how many times you put your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Have not seen my son chew on his nails since the first application.</li>
            <li> I must say that this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I tried it myself because my son cried the first time he put his finger in his mouth</li>
            <li> 3weeks ago, he stopped sucking his thumb permanently with no slip-ups 2weeks after we first started using it.</li>
            <li> : I found out later, the trick is making sure that whoever you bought it for, uses it.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years after all else failed-she stopped-</li>
            <li> Ive only used the stuff for three weeks, but I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> Which is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> We tried another product at first that works</li>
            <li> Made him cry the first time since he couldn&#x27;t pick up food and eat that either (somehow got onto that too).</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s definatly not putting his fingernails/ hands in his mouth as much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since stopthebite comes in a slightly larger bottle (.5oz) and cost 1/3 the price, my cheapness got the better of me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and already my nails look better.</li>
            <li> Well funny until he started projectile vomiting all over the place.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Which is exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> It works,  although is not necessary to use it twice a day , and after a while even if you don&#x27;t use it any more you still have the bitterness flavor in your nails.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> oh well, hopefully I will stop biting quickly and can go back to eating normally :)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much what it&#x27;s for</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have used that really works for me.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first; didn&#x27;t want her getting any kind chemical in her mouth but one little taste reminded her.</li>
            <li> I personally disagree  with some people said it wash&#x27;s off to easily</li>
            <li> its strong enough that I notice when I try to bite my nails without thinking about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days, and already know it&#x27;s going to make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> You would really have to be determined if you kept gnawing despite the taste.</li>
            <li> Has a bitter taste (which is the point) and works ok.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> Thanks 😄</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you want to stop biting your nails, thumb sucking, etc!</li>
            <li> so I had to do something fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this much nail growth</li>
            <li> is a lot more bitter than Barielle;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> peels/wears off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish for my daughter, who is 8.</li>
            <li> so, it should last...but exercise caution, this thing is intense</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff really really works.</li>
            <li> Almost too much.</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails my whole life and this product works.</li>
            <li> I made iced tea and the whole batch had to be thrown out</li>
            <li> his whole life.&lt;br /&gt;Cut</li>
            <li> You do not need to coat the whole nail.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect any miracles fast.</li>
            <li> To my surprise this is very close.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it much anymore</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife has bitten her nails her whole life.</li>
            <li> I know that twice a day doesn&#x27;t sound unreasonable, but when your caught up in the day with 3 children, you tend to forget that you needed that second coat.</li>
            <li> and my nails are growing prettt fast.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really find the taste all that offensive.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works - 100%.  </li>
            <li> fast.</li>
            <li> But it dries really fast and</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My son has stopped sucking his thumb, thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> but my son not so much.  </li>
            <li> Tge taste lingers to remind you just how much you don&#x27;t want your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Then you end up wiping your tongue on the nearest thing to get the taste off, causing everyone around you to find you much stranger than if you were just biting your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any behavioral changes.</li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> so much so that it make you want to scrape your tongue.</li>
            <li> When I put this stuff on he says it tastes good and just sucks it off.</li>
            <li> Go back to the old formula it was much better, I would pay twice as much for the old formula!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not really expensive as the bottle does go very far.</li>
            <li> This one seems to work better than the other product that is intended to stop nail biting/thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Only con is have to remember to apply everyday,but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It worked the first time but my 9 year old wouldn&#x27;t apply it thereafter.</li>
            <li> This is the first product we&#x27;ve bought to get our 3 year old to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> My nails are actually normal now and they even grew fast.</li>
            <li> It might be useful for a very taste sensitive child or an adult that just want&#x27;s a reminder.</li>
            <li> True to its word…  I definitely cringe just looking at my hands..  </li>
            <li> this worked the first time I used it with my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> That way the first &#x27;finger-in-mouth&#x27; afterwards meets the very strong Onyx as a reminder, and while the Onyx tends to wear off after a couple days, the Barielle stays for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a try for the money but will go back to my other product as I had better success with it.</li>
            <li> , she could taste the polish on her finger foods while eating, this is the main thing she didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> My main concern with both Hoof and Malvala is that the lingering bitterness will desensitize my daughter too it.</li>
            <li> For a mild to moderate nail biter, this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I my nails are completely grown out and my nails are strong and long.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that repeat offenders will eventually desensitize themselves to the ingredient, but I highly doubt that claim.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who has or is a nail biter or thumbsucker.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old quit biting his fingers after one application!!</li>
            <li> Tried it for my very determined 7 year old.</li>
            <li> So far this has really helped solve the problem my son and husband have with biting their cuticles.  </li>
            <li> It really made me realize how often I have my hands near my mouth.</li>
            <li> Between the two, her nail chewing is pretty much stopped, except for an occasional slip.</li>
            <li> For small children/thumbsuckers - Mavala might be the less potent and therefore better option.</li>
            <li> Ive been biting my nails for 15+ years and used a gross nail polish as a kid to get me to stop but that polish didnt work, i chewed it right off.</li>
            <li> Glad I did plain and</li>
            <li> Needs replaced much more often then the recommended times per day because it constantly washes off due to being highly water soluble.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly.</li>
            <li> It worked on stopping my 8 year old grand daughter from sucking her thumb with just a few application.  </li>
            <li> since he always has them chewed down to the quick, but now he does!</li>
            <li> Stopped my 2 year old from sucking her thumb after one week!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Used on a 5 year old to stop sucking her pinky...day 4...and still she is not sucking her finger!</li>
            <li> his nails with a nail clipper last week for the first time since he was a baby.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> The brand I had many years ago only required one coat every other day.</li>
            <li> I got a taste of it and nearly gagged!</li>
            <li> My fingers stay far away from mouth and anything else that could come in contact with my tongue!</li>
            <li> Even after removing it with nail polish remover, and washing my hands numerous times with soap and hot water, I could still get the taste of it lingering on my fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gross but without being crippling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish wears off after 2-3 days and will need to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it human nature took over and, of course, I had to taste it.  </li>
            <li> It tastes like utter death and it lingers on your lips/in your mouth, which is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super bitter and stays on your nails for days.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why, because it was a true deterrent for me when I tried it first, however he completely ignored it and kept his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li> It is a little shiny like a cheap clear nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Word</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and makes your nails look shiny.</li>
            <li> so it looks like clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Looks just like clear coat nail polish as you can see from the pictures.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never needed to clip his finger nails as an adult</li>
            <li> I used it to help my 3 year old stop sucking her thumb, and I used it to help me stop biting my nails.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been sucking his fingers since he was 1 year old</li>
            <li> Used this polish on my 2 1/2 year old.</li>
            <li> That said, my 20 month old doesn&#x27;t like it, but she&#x27;ll suck it off or suffer through the bitterness (whimpering).</li>
            <li> This did not stop my 4 year old from biting his nails.</li>
            <li> I use them on my 8 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got it for a friend who&#x27;s almost 4 year old wouldn&#x27;t stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have chewed my nails ever since I can remember.</li>
            <li> It will make it that you don&#x27;t want your fingers near your face at all.  </li>
            <li> Did not help my 1 year old</li>
            <li> My 5 year old hates this stuff.</li>
            <li> Did not deter my 5 yr old at all.</li>
            <li> My 4 yr old has been biting his nails since he was about 1.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my 3 year old</li>
            <li> We initially used the gentle thumb glove to try to get our five-year-old son to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> It 100% does what it says it does - you will not ever want to put your fingers anywhere near your mouth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t scratch or rub anywhere near my mouth or it will transfer to my lips and I will taste it all day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think the product would effect daily life like this, but I&#x27;m going to try to stick it out.</li>
            <li> This certainly fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to help my 6 yr old stop biting her nails</li>
            <li> My 6 yr old says she doesn&#x27;t like the taste</li>
            <li> So far this has done the trick</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my 14 year old.  </li>
            <li> MY 9 YEAR OLD STOPPED SUCKING HER THUMB AND BITTING HER NAILS WITHIN 3 WEEKS.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old and my 3 year old who are both nail biters.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old says mom</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old who bites her nails when nervous so to help my control</li>
            <li> my three year old isn&#x27;t as bothered by it though.</li>
            <li> My 6-year old has been a nail biter for 4 years.</li>
            <li> Since they quit sticking their fingers in their mouths I completely forgot all about putting the solution on their nails.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m thinking of using it on my 8 year old to get him to use his utensils and stop eating with his hands!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Im 25 years old</li>
            <li> Also her mother put it on the 5 year old&#x27;s Boogar picking finger to stop her from picking her nose and eating her boogars.  </li>
            <li> :) There are a few that have been bitten so we will continue with this and use trial and error when he finally stops biting.</li>
            <li> its like they changed the formula for this - it now peels off like crazy, no matter how many coats I put on, the taste is a lot less strong and its less effective.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the foreign competitor, and works exactly the same as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting to, but, fortunately, the odor was barely noticeable when applied and after a few minutes of drying disappeared altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I get the urge to bite my nails a put a small dab on the tips and it most definitely discourages the bite.</li>
            <li> It stays on your nails much longer than the package says, so it is rather economical, and you cannot get past the flavor to bite your nails even if you try.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste as strong as other products I&#x27;ve tried but is bitter tasting as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same brand, but I noticed the new bottle looked different and they must&#x27;ve used a new formula.</li>
            <li> brush on well, dry very quickly, and add a slight shine to the nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bit my nails for a long time, but this isn&#x27;t  my first time stopping and starting again.</li>
            <li> For the first time my baby boy has nails long enough to have dirt under them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with it as much as the first stuff I tried.</li>
            <li> My son quickly learned how to rub it off before it dried.</li>
            <li> After only about 3 weeks my 6 year old daughter was done chewing her nails!</li>
            <li> Since putting it on in the morning, I find that the taste is still there in the evening but not strong enough that I can&#x27;t enjoy a finger food type of snack in the evening.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful to use utensils where you might want to use your fingers, but otherwise it certainly does what it is supposed to:  keeps your fingers out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> So summary 9 years old good, 3 years old bad.</li>
            <li> I had used the Mavala Stop for about three weeks when I left the bottle in my car and it completely leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Taste can be noticed when eating finger foods if not careful.</li>
            <li> not wet, mind you, but 2 or 4 days after applied</li>
            <li> and it is still there enough to serve as a reminder that I don&#x27;t want my fingers anywhere near my mouth.  </li>
            <li> With the old stuff I didn&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating food when I cooked, ONLY when I would bite my nails.</li>
            <li> i put this on my one fingernail and it tasted gross for nearly a week.</li>
            <li> I got it for my 2 yr old because she was biting her nails all the way back into the cuticle.</li>
            <li> (our 4th is only a month old)</li>
            <li> The taste does &amp;#34;spread&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I am a busy mom, so I typically only put one coat on a day and it still works.</li>
            <li> so I do make sure that if I&#x27;m behind the wheels, I put this on before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> Only down side,  a fresh coat will transfer to whatever your nail touches.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, this has really helped me stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> stop the bite&amp;#34; is very bitter and the taste comes on much quicker than Malvala.</li>
            <li> it is a constant reminder that u want your hands as far away as possible from your mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely pretty hard to live like this, but hopefully within a week or two I won&#x27;t need it anymore.</li>
            <li> No more nail biting after the first time using it!</li>
            <li> She now has long nails that I had to clip the other day for the first time in months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 years old, and have been biting my nails as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I was applying it about three times a day for the first few days.  </li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than i expected but after reading other reviews and looking at pictures i realized that the size was appropriate.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old male i have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other brands - this is the only one that has worked so far.</li>
            <li> We only put it on about twice a week and it lasts long enough to help deter our son from chewing on his finger nails.</li>
            <li> only reason for docking Onyx one star is the fact that it does not adhere as well as the Mavala; I can scratch and peel the nail polish off, which isn&#x27;t a major issue because you are supposed apply and reapply every other day for both.</li>
            <li> But it does really discourage him when he&#x27;s awake - no more finding him sucking his thumb while watching TV.</li>
            <li> They recommend putting it on lots, but I found 1x a week was fine, and it only takes a few unconscious moves to the lips to cure you of doing THAT again---probably too cruel to do to a child, but a teen might be okay, and certainly an adult.  </li>
            <li> I could just buy clear polish for much less money though.  </li>
            <li> I painted it on my nails and waited for it to dry, then i applied some regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> It stopped my 5 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking in less than 1 week.  </li>
            <li> Got me to stop biting my nails bjut I still chewed up my fingers, and it unfortunately turned me off fingr foods because the taste transferred so easily.</li>
            <li> The next day, after numerous hand washes, I licked sour cream off my finger and that taste stayed in my mouth for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and dries just a little glossy.</li>
            <li> So yeah, it&#x27;s effective punishment for a bad habit like chewing your cuticles.</li>
            <li> It drove me crazy and it just wasn&#x27;t cute anymore</li>
            <li> and I knew it would harm his teeth in the long run</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ll have to apply it for her to quit this habit.</li>
            <li> It is bitter and gross tasting and leaves the taste on your tongue and on your lips.</li>
            <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t bitter enough to make me gag or vomit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifelong nail biter and have tried various products - this one is worse tasting &amp; longer lasting than Mavala Stop (which is higher rated) in my opinion.</li>
            <li> hope this time i can keep them long</li>
            <li> and it stops them for as long as your apply it.</li>
            <li> Bitterness lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been this long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> This stuff stays on for a long long time.</li>
            <li> , I brushed, I rinsed my nose out, but it&#x27;s still bitter</li>
            <li> I actually totally forgot about re-upping the coating of bitter soap on my kid&#x27;s nails</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not a soft &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; taste.</li>
            <li> Bitter taste, long lasting and works!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick,  hard, shinny coating and as a result dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails since I was a little kid, and finally had enough.</li>
            <li> If you chew your nails and are looking to put the most nastiest tasting thing on to stop your bad habit search no further!</li>
            <li> brush on the Barielle, let it dry, then brush on the Onyx.  </li>
            <li> I initially got it for my 2yr old who sucks his fingers, after applying it to his hands</li>
            <li> Only one coat every few days is necessary.</li>
            <li> It definitely will kick a nail biting habit with only a few applications.</li>
            <li> I only had to use the product a few weeks to break her habit and now she has fingernails that we can actually paint.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like about using it is that you can&#x27;t eat food with your fingers or cook, it gets the bitter from your nails so if you want to cook you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> works as expected and stays on long</li>
            <li> She sucked it off the first day because she was still addicted to sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate about it is that it rubs off onto my lips very easily.  </li>
            <li> My first grade son really had a bad habit going and couldn&#x27;t stop.  </li>
            <li> Considering it is half the price I am only docking it one star for the issue</li>
            <li> Hate the taste, but that&#x27;s why I love it!  </li>
            <li> I have a bad nervous nail biting habit and have never been able to grow my nails.</li>
            <li> And nasty is a great reminder to your brain to keep your fingers out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It tastes and smells atrocious, but the nails look better, so it works.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my 4 year old who sucks his index fingers.</li>
            <li> My 30month old son had been a chronic thumb sucker since he was one.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 3 year son who likes to bite his nails and 9 year old daughter that still sucks her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Taste is aweful...very bitter.</li>
            <li> &gt;  is not as bitter as Onyx;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Bitter.</li>
            <li> She tries to hide her hands when I go to put it on her.</li>
            <li> This stuff also affects the way you eat, makes your food taste bitter.</li>
            <li> so if she had food in her hand it had that bitter taste</li>
            <li> It works, but definitely follow the directions and apply everyday, the potency does wear off after a day or two.</li>
            <li> ; is bitter</li>
            <li> When ever I wet my lips</li>
            <li> My son does say you have to be careful when you eat</li>
            <li> The memory of that bitter taste still lingers in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is really bitter tasting.</li>
            <li> You never really realize where that nail dust goes until you inhale it and it tastes like Stopthebite for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> active ingredient is Denatonium Benzoate and makes the dry polish tastes like bitter, bitter soap.</li>
            <li> I did notice that some of my vege dishes tasted mildly bitter...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be careful if you have to make food with your hands, though.</li>
            <li> The taste is REALLY bitter...</li>
            <li> Be careful if you&#x27;re eating food with your hands as it can in fact even get on the food.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of seeing my 7 year old daughter chew her nails.  </li>
            <li> I however, hate the taste, so make your own assessment from my review.</li>
            <li> None of the reviewers have said anything about getting sick, but I feel like this is an important fact to know when considering a product like this, especially as it&#x27;s marketed for thumb sucking which generally involves small children.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> But, as soon as I begin to apply it daily/every other day for a few weeks my nails will grow back again!</li>
            <li> His biting got progressively worse as he got older.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know what other people are washing their hands with</li>
            <li> Be careful eating finger food with this stuff on!</li>
            <li> It says to use it every other day</li>
            <li> Whatever the other stuff was it worked in days.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well as a reminder to not bite my nails (which is all I needed.)</li>
            <li> He literally had a lil stub of nail on each finger and would often get hang nails and other issues with his skin.</li>
            <li> Other than that this product worked as promised.</li>
            <li> It stays on when the other brands don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> EVERYThing else we tried, the thumb guard, other nail biting polishes..</li>
            <li> After a few finger slip-ups I was already consciously not putting them in my mouth.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very bitter and lasts.  </li>
            <li> Immediately ... Very bitter from what she says ....</li>
            <li> It does suck when he forgets about it and gets the bad taste when he goes to lick sauce off his finger while eating, but he says it&#x27;s worth it to finally stop biting his nails.</li>
            <li> so it has a chance to thoroughly harden, making it less noticeable and harder to pick at.</li>
            <li> Active ingredient listed as Cayenne pepper extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Active ingredient</li>
            <li> Active ingredient Denatonium Benzoate (branded Bitrex).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoof</li>
            <li> The only thing is that you MUST let it dry before touching anything else, otherwise it gets everywhere &amp; it tastes horrible.</li>
            <li> re-application is quick and dirty and takes less than a minute.</li>
            <li> when first put on it seemed to make your entire finger taste bad</li>
            <li> Only negative is when you eat finger foods or floss your teeth you might get an accidental tasting.  </li>
            <li> at least until it physically wears off;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My son is 5 and has been constantly biting his nails for the past few years.</li>
            <li> but she only thumb sucks when asleep.</li>
            <li> The only complaint i have is that the taste rubs off on food.</li>
            <li> wins in that it tastes the worst and must have a higher concentration of Denatonium Benzoate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product for nail bitters and thumb suckers.</li>
            <li> only complaint is it can rub off on whatever your eating/preparing with your hands.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll LOVE (Hate the taste and stop biting) it.</li>
            <li> the worst (in a good way).</li>
            <li> My son bites his nails down into the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> if that and when I have, I have noticed and either stopped immediately or noticed before even fully biting down</li>
            <li> People do need to be aware that flossing, food prep, and other things you do with the tips of your fingers will pick up the awful taste, so be mindful of that before you use it, but it certainly deters nail biting.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it lasts so long (I can go for days without re-coating) that eating anything that requires finger-licking is not nearly as enjoyable!</li>
            <li> And a plus was that it came in less than a week from the day I ordered it.</li>
            <li> its got a half life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way home</li>
            <li> It also made my nails slightly stronger.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see my sons chewing their nails in church as they typically do.</li>
            <li> May use this for the next finger sucker in the house!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that little push that he needed to get over his thumb-sucking.</li>
            <li> My little girl pulls a face every time so puts her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Now the new stuff comes off in just one shower, and it contaminates ANY food I touch that makes my nails wet like chicken breast.</li>
            <li> She tired one time and never put her thumb back in her mouth.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for it to wear off.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the nails with dried residue...</li>
            <li> I put this on my boyfriend everyday for like 2 weeks or so</li>
            <li> Lasts a while too; even after washing your hands a few times.  </li>
            <li> Like chewing up an Advil only worse.....</li>
            <li> my nails have dried).</li>
            <li> Deadly stuff and toxic to all who might taste</li>
            <li> so when it dried I tried it and the taste was not strong at all.</li>
            <li> At least, my son says he &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t like the taste&amp;#34; with this one, as opposed to the other one, where he said it tasted like food.</li>
            <li> I painted half of one of my nails to test since I bought this to use on my son&#x27;s nails that he chews on and the terrible bitter taste lasted at least a week through many hand washes and showers.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re willing to have the midas touch of bad taste, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I feel like a horrible mother because I know my little boy got a lot more of it in his mouth than I did.</li>
            <li> and yes, it&#x27;s nasty strong!</li>
            <li> She was biting her nails and fingers were raw and sore.</li>
            <li> I would bite the skin raw, get infected hangnails, and deformed nails from messing up the root.</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible and it kept my four year old&#x27;s fingers out of her mouth and her nails grew fast.</li>
            <li> He likes spicy &amp; sour food, so unfortunately this product is still not a complete cure for thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Even if your eating say French fries and your finger hits your lip, it&#x27;s that awful taste right away..    </li>
            <li> I brought the for my little girl who sucks her index finger.  </li>
            <li> but kids don&#x27;t really know bad from baddd</li>
            <li> works very well at making your fingers nails taste bad.  </li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t LIKE it, but thats the point, taste bad so keep fingers out of mouth</li>
            <li> but especially those with the long term bad habit.</li>
            <li> Tastes awful as it is supposed too. :)</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for the past 19 years.</li>
            <li> Its the most disgusting taste ever.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and has been instrumental in helping two of my children leave the nail-biting habit in the past.  </li>
            <li> But the second day she was tired of the taste!</li>
            <li> STARS FOR DISGUSTING TASTE!!:)</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes nasty and it lasts a long time which is exactly what I need to stop biting my nails.  </li>
            <li> It really does taste horrible enough to keep your fingers out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> None of the other polishes tasted bad enough to stop.</li>
            <li> And Im a hard core nail chewer i do it with out even knowing it.</li>
            <li> Still requires some discipline to not pick it at... and also has the unintended side effect of making it hard to eat finger</li>
            <li> My son hardly ever throws up</li>
            <li> It helped our little one to stop sucking her fingers within a week!!</li>
            <li> It does taste terrible and you may taste it slightly while eating finger foods right after application.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter chews on her nails really bad</li>
            <li> my 3 year old&#x27;s hands were so bad that he began to have the skin on his fingers peel</li>
            <li> The taste lingers for at least two days.  </li>
            <li> Not effective for us.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year doesn&#x27;t mind the weird bitter taste.</li>
            <li> She still sucks her thumb with or without it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible and if you enjoy finger foods or ever need to scratch your face around your mouth, you will taste the polish.</li>
            <li> still sucks his thumb</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for at least 30 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this product late June and wanted to use it for at least a month before i reviewed.</li>
            <li> Stopped our thumb sucker immediately.</li>
            <li> My daughter sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> (my son a non-thumb sucker wanted to try, and he was gagging from a lick, did not want anything to do with it afterwords).</li>
            <li> My daughter no longer sucks her thumb,</li>
            <li> Even lightly wiping off your mouth can wind up getting this nasty taste on your lips.  </li>
            <li> The taste is slow to develop.</li>
            <li> no more worries for me!</li>
            <li> So, encourages table manners (using utensils) and no more biting!</li>
            <li> but it seems that even a small amount is enough to make someone sick.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately she has moved down to her fingers</li>
            <li> When the product arrived I read the directions, which ask you to apply 2x per day, and  Warning label which states will cause serious illness and can be fatal</li>
            <li> Seriously, the nicorette gum of nail biting.</li>
            <li> I seriously reccommend this to anyone trying to quit.</li>
            <li> This seriously stops you nail biting habits.</li>
            <li> I need it to stop and previous attempts have failed because I don&#x27;t even catch myself until the nail is wrecked.</li>
            <li> Every time i go to bite my nails, my stomach immediately turns as I am quickly reminded of the horrible taste.</li>
            <li> the taste is super nasty.</li>
            <li> so bad they are starting to bleed.  </li>
            <li> after it was on several days this improved and it was just the nail that tasted bad.</li>
            <li> It doesnt wear off at all the only bad thing</li>
            <li> As a determined nail biter, I need the extra bad taste as incentive, so this product is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely tastes bad --</li>
            <li> I had a few sad moments with finger foods.</li>
            <li> It was difficult for her to eat foods with her fingers for a few days</li>
            <li> it is the worst tasting and long lasting stuff you can put on your nails.</li>
            <li> Hate the taste, wow does it do the job.  </li>
            <li> I mention neither kid got sick last cold/flu season?</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had this bad habit for so long</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t this nasty stuff once since that first encounter.  </li>
            <li> In all seriousness, my two younger kids (9 and 6) bite their fingernails down to nothing, and it looks awful!  </li>
            <li> While I guess it does what it says - it does taste horrible - it really isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li> It really does taste awful...</li>
            <li> I had ordered another product online but got tired of waiting for it to be delivered.  </li>
            <li> My worse time for this habit has always been when I&#x27;m driving</li>
            <li> In an effort to stop biting my nails I have begun applying a thin layer of this to my finger tips.</li>
            <li> The amazon reviews for these types of products are really frustrating.</li>
            <li> It really tastes horrible!</li>
            <li> It tastes absolutely TERRIBLE and it doesn&#x27;t give off any odor, so in that respect, it does really well.  </li>
            <li> This stuff tastes terrible, which is the whole point.  </li>
            <li> The bitter (terrible) taste lasts longer than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> But unlike other reviewers have stated, he has never had an issue with it making his food taste bad, or getting nauseous, or whatever.</li>
            <li> WOW Does this stuff taste awful, just like it says.</li>
            <li> I am using this product on my 4 yr old daughter by applying it during the night when she is sleeping to make her believe that the awful taste is a consequence of biting her nails.</li>
            <li> But when Opened the package it shipped in I immediately knew from the smell the contents were toxic and not for small children to EVER taste!!!  </li>
            <li> complained it affected the way food tasted, when they used their fingers(chips, goldfish,etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Again, too bad.</li>
            <li> the Onyx and Mavala Stop have the same disgusting taste that keeps my fingers out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Even my water tasted weird because I touched the ice cubes...</li>
            <li> This definitely tastes awful, and the bitterness lingers for awhile.  </li>
            <li> Multiple coats are advised because it does peel off after a while but even after not replenishing the coats for a day the taste was still lingering on my nails and was just as disgusting!</li>
            <li> You absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> ; is totally useless and doesn&#x27;t taste like anything.</li>
            <li> I could feel the same nasty taste in my lips.</li>
            <li> Well it definitely tastes absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> The next day I could still see the sheen on their nails, and by the way, the taste is truly awful!  </li>
            <li> and I really do mean sit in your mouth, stay on your lips, linger on your tongue bad.</li>
            <li> I thought it tasted disgusting but apparently not for her.</li>
            <li> The down side is that if you put your fingers in your mouth even to not bite the nails, you still get the horrible taste.     </li>
            <li> so when eating you want to avoid foods like fried chicken.  </li>
            <li> so I was feeling desperate to keep those fingers out of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> He was crying hysterically because he couldn&#x27;t get the taste out of his mouth even after taking a drink</li>
            <li> Yes, I desperately want my son to stop chewing his fingernails to the point of bleeding</li>
            <li> Nasty stuff,, got this to get our little kids to quit chewing on computer headphone cords at our school!  </li>
            <li> I have a nasty habit of chewing my nails raw and not even noticing that I do it!</li>
            <li> /eat with your fingers will taste unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The result is intensely unpleasant (try to stifle your laughter at my discomfort).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still stuck on my fingers, tasting as bad as ever.</li>
            <li> It tasted really bad.  </li>
            <li> Really bad.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they get it tastes bad</li>
            <li> They say it takes 6 weeks to 8 weeks to stop a bad habit.</li>
            <li> Too bad, we put it on anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> otherwise it will tastes bad on your food if you lick your fingers.</li>
            <li> The taste is so bad that it stays on your lips and in your mouth for a while.</li>
            <li> he has started biting his nails (bad habit) but hand foot mouth is going around</li>
            <li> This stuff clings to everything you touch, which sounds like a bad thing, but is a blessing bc</li>
            <li> My daughter stopped biting her nails to bad</li>
            <li> Does the trick and tastes bad</li>
            <li> My kids are bad nail biters and the skin around the nail as well</li>
            <li> Since the bad taste doesn&#x27;t go away she may just keep biting once she starts.</li>
            <li> Yes, it tastes bad.</li>
            <li> So bad, in fact, that it induced vomiting in my son within minutes of putting it on his fingers.</li>
            <li> so I knew it was bad.</li>
            <li> It says that the &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; bad flavor will discourage biting of the nails</li>
            <li> But the problem is if you eat anything with your fingers that is bad too.</li>
            <li> It tastes so bad that she would gag to start with</li>
            <li> but then she figured out she just needed to use a spoon or fork and her food wouldn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
            <li> The taste is bad...</li>
            <li> He kept getting sick every time ANY kids at school were sick from chewing on his germ covered nails and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> It will also sometimes stay on your lips, so every time you lick your lips, you&#x27;re reminded of how stupid it was to try to bite your fingernails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it tastes like crap.  </li>
            <li> My nails have been bloody stubs since I was 8.</li>
            <li> And it became worthless.</li>
            <li> It does make your nails taste bad, but it also makes your chips, wings, candy, pizza, and anything else you touch taste awful as well...</li>
            <li> He hated it and has never sucked his thumb since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It tastes so nasty that even accidentally putting some to my lips when eating with my hands</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible to my child...</li>
            <li> however it will plague you with the nasty taste regardless, for example by eating anything with your hands.</li>
            <li> It is NASTY!  </li>
            <li> it just tastes awful..</li>
            <li> It has deterred my daughter from sucking her thumb as well, because the taste is so horrible.</li>

            <li> I tasted and it was nasty</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful, but works!</li>
            <li> It is so disgusting.</li>
            <li> The horrible taste stayed on my fingers for a week - even after I tried using nail polish remover to take it off.</li>
            <li> Anything I touched got this horrible taste on it - including my fiance and food I ate with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Tastes awful.</li>
            <li> My nails now taste terrible.</li>
            <li> The taste is horrible and lingers in your mouth for a while, which is the reason it works.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get used to the awful taste in this product.</li>
            <li> Product recommends re application twice per day,  but the taste is still awful day 2.  </li>
            <li> and she hated the taste of it...and it worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> Horrible taste</li>

            <li> I bought this because I found out that my husband&#x27;s horribly ragged nails were that way because he had been chewing on them.  </li>
            <li> He said it tasted terrible and he could not wash it off.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is the best stuff to make your nails strong used alot of stuff by this is the best</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.  Much cheaper than the foreign competitor, and works exactly the same as far as I can tell.  People do need to be aware that flossing, food prep, and other things you do with the tips of your fingers will pick up the awful taste, so be mindful of that before you use it, but it certainly deters nail biting.</li>
            <li> Kind of torn between 1 and 5 stars. It works. Too well. It says to apply 3 times a day. Lol. Do it once and everything you touch will be cursed. I suppose it does its job excellently, if you keep up with it and apply it weekly.</li>
            <li> I personally disagree  with some people said it wash&#x27;s off to easily, I don&#x27;t know what other people are washing their hands with but I washed my hands many times in the day and it&#x27;s still stuck on my fingers, tasting as bad as ever. Good product!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how some of the people said they still bit their nails either. I am a determined&amp;#34; nail biter as well and this stuff stopped me in my tracks! It tastes so nasty that even accidentally putting some to my lips when eating with my hands is enough to deter me from even trying to bite my nails. It works</li>
            <li> Seems to work.  Tastes terrible to my child...</li>
            <li> Love it?  Hah!  It tastes aweful!  But that is a good thing.  The taste lingers for at least two days.  You have to be careful to use utensils where you might want to use your fingers, but otherwise it certainly does what it is supposed to:  keeps your fingers out of your mouth.  You would really have to be determined if you kept gnawing despite the taste.</li>
            <li> We put this on my daughter&#x27;s thumb every night and she still sucked it off.  Not effective for us.  I thought it tasted disgusting but apparently not for her.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very effective. you won&#x27;t even think about putting your fingers in the mouth. however it will plague you with the nasty taste regardless, for example by eating anything with your hands. be also prepared to go on a fasting diet or use gloves for its entire use.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband (he asked me to find something to stop his habit). It&#x27;s already working great! He&#x27;s only used it for a week and, not only does it help him stop biting his nails, but his nails are growing super fast!  He&#x27;s never needed to clip his finger nails as an adult since he always has them chewed down to the quick, but now he does! It does suck when he forgets about it and gets the bad taste when he goes to lick sauce off his finger while eating, but he says it&#x27;s worth it to finally stop biting his nails. Great product!</li>
            <li> My 3 year doesn&#x27;t mind the weird bitter taste. She still sucks her thumb with or without it. I however, hate the taste, so make your own assessment from my review.</li>
            <li> OK, but it had to be applied twice a day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Stopped my 2 year old from sucking her thumb after one week!</li>
            <li> This product works well. I&#x27;ve bit my nails for a long time, but this isn&#x27;t  my first time stopping and starting again. This polish a distinct  taste that makes you want to avoid eating or even touching your face. Third day in and haven&#x27;t  bitten my nails yet. If you find that you can&#x27;t, milk will get the taste out of your mouth if it becomes overwhelming.  Good luck to future polishers!</li>
            <li> Taste is aweful...very bitter. Dont spill it becasue it removed the paint off my cabinet.  Stays on for about 2 -3 days.  I used it to help my 3 year old stop sucking her thumb, and I used it to help me stop biting my nails.  Worked for both of us.  She tired one time and never put her thumb back in her mouth. Victory!  Only negative is when you eat finger foods or floss your teeth you might get an accidental tasting.  Went for a swim in the pool and it remained effective afterwards.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  For adults &amp; children. I have bit my nails for 30+ years and it truly works! It is NASTY!  And nasty is a great reminder to your brain to keep your fingers out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very bitter and lasts.  i tried this once before with another product and it didn&#x27;t work.  this one has been tremendously helpful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is true to the name.. Although I still want to bite my nails it just tastes awful.. It dries quick as well.    The only problem is that it will highlight how many times you put your fingers in your mouth. Even if your eating say French fries and your finger hits your lip, it&#x27;s that awful taste right away..    It has deterred my daughter from sucking her thumb as well, because the taste is so horrible.</li>
            <li> Works great! Stays on after repeated hand washings.</li>
            <li> My son, who is 3, has already started biting his nails so bad they are starting to bleed.  I put the two coats on his nail like it said.  It tasted really bad.  Really bad.  He eats a lot of finger foods (he&#x27;s a fruit and veggie boy) but when he was eating things with his fingers, he was able to taste it.  I felt horrible.  I tried to take it off with nail polish remover, but it didn&#x27;t come off.  It took a few days for it to wear off.  I stopped using it because it worked too well.</li>
            <li> my daughter  is on a week without sucking her thumb bc of this. :)</li>
            <li> Kid eats this off I don&#x27;t think they get it tastes bad I tasted and it was nasty but kids don&#x27;t really know bad from baddd</li>
            <li> Comparing this to &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34; I would say for the price it is definitely comparable. Considering it is half the price I am only docking it one star for the issue I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back story...I am a 22 year old male i have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Onyx and Mavala Stop have the same disgusting taste that keeps my fingers out of my mouth. I had used the Mavala Stop for about three weeks when I left the bottle in my car and it completely leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I did not want to sped another $13 and chose to give Onyx a try. I am glad I did...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for docking Onyx one star is the fact that it does not adhere as well as the Mavala; I can scratch and peel the nail polish off, which isn&#x27;t a major issue because you are supposed apply and reapply every other day for both.</li>
            <li> This one seems to work better than the other product that is intended to stop nail biting/thumb sucking. At least, my son says he &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t like the taste&amp;#34; with this one, as opposed to the other one, where he said it tasted like food. But unlike other reviewers have stated, he has never had an issue with it making his food taste bad, or getting nauseous, or whatever. He likes spicy &amp; sour food, so unfortunately this product is still not a complete cure for thumb sucking. But it does really discourage him when he&#x27;s awake - no more finding him sucking his thumb while watching TV. It&#x27;s just in the middle of the night that he doesn&#x27;t seem to notice the taste.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. It has no taste for them to stop biting their fingernails. You have to reapply it all the time. It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> 3 boys and all have stopped biting their nails. I am super happy.</li>
            <li> Completely agree with most people on here. I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for probably 25 years. And this is the ONLY thing that is working. I have zero desire to put my fingers in my mouth. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is like others have said, it effects your food. Even my water tasted weird because I touched the ice cubes...oh well, hopefully I will stop biting quickly and can go back to eating normally :)</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful, but works! Been a great product to have to help my toddler give up sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li> The bitter (terrible) taste lasts longer than I expected it to. I painted half of one of my nails to test since I bought this to use on my son&#x27;s nails that he chews on and the terrible bitter taste lasted at least a week through many hand washes and showers. Have not seen my son chew on his nails since the first application. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Has a bitter taste (which is the point) and works ok.</li>
            <li> My son quickly learned how to rub it off before it dried.</li>
            <li> I have a nasty habit of chewing my nails raw and not even noticing that I do it! Well let me tell youuuu, I can not even imagine biting with this stuff on. It is so disgusting. Also if I scratch my lip or something and later lick my lip it is gross and a reminder to not even THINK about it! Be careful eating finger food with this stuff on!</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this. I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for ages and wanted to have nice nails for my wedding. While I guess it does what it says - it does taste horrible - it really isn&#x27;t practical. The horrible taste stayed on my fingers for a week - even after I tried using nail polish remover to take it off. Anything I touched got this horrible taste on it - including my fiance and food I ate with my fingers. Unless you&#x27;re willing to have the midas touch of bad taste, I don&#x27;t recommend it. It does make your nails taste bad, but it also makes your chips, wings, candy, pizza, and anything else you touch taste awful as well...</li>
            <li> Tastes awful. Thanks 😄</li>
            <li> Works great. My nails now taste terrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! My daughter stopped biting her nails after one application (she&#x27;s 6). It really does taste awful...the taste lingers and you definitely don&#x27;t want that in your mouth. Highly recommended if you want to stop biting your nails, thumb sucking, etc!</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised, For Sure!! It helped our little one to stop sucking her fingers within a week!! And we had tried everything.  Did some research and found this.  May use this for the next finger sucker in the house!</li>
            <li> I brought this for my 4 year old who sucks his index fingers. It drove me crazy and it just wasn&#x27;t cute anymore and I knew it would harm his teeth in the long run so I had to do something fast. I must say that this stuff really works! The taste is horrible and lingers in your mouth for a while, which is the reason it works. I tried it myself because my son cried the first time he put his finger in his mouth (he forgot he had the nail polish on). It says to use it every other day but I only used it once a week. By week 2 he was over the finger sucking. If at anytime I catch him trying to put in his finger in his mouth, I tell him I&#x27;m going to put the nail stuff on and he cries and begs me not too. Lol. He&#x27;s been sucking his fingers since he was 1 year old and now he doesn&#x27;t anymore. And a plus was that it came in less than a week from the day I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter since age 2 after picking up the habit from my mother.  I have tried tons of similar products, but would just get used to the taste of them and continue to bite my nails.  You can&#x27;t get used to the awful taste in this product. Product recommends re application twice per day,  but the taste is still awful day 2.  A fresh coat would have me running to the sink to rinse my mouth with water.  It&#x27;s been a week into use and I&#x27;m so happy ! I&#x27;ve never had this much nail growth and I have absolutely no desire to put my hands anywhere near my mouth.  Only down side,  a fresh coat will transfer to whatever your nail touches.  I had a few sad moments with finger foods.</li>
            <li> Used this polish on my 2 1/2 year old. She was biting her nails and fingers were raw and sore. I got this and she hated the taste of it...and it worked like a charm! She now has long nails that I had to clip the other day for the first time in months. I paint her nails with regular nail polish and put this over it sometimes, or just use it on its own. Even put it around her nails to stop her from biting around them where the skin was red and sore. Great product and would highly recommend to anyone who has a biter!</li>
            <li> Tried it for my very determined 7 year old. He does not seem deterred at all, will need to find something stronger.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my thumb sucker. She didn&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> Horrible taste so it is very effective. We only put it on about twice a week and it lasts long enough to help deter our son from chewing on his finger nails.</li>
            <li> This definitely tastes awful, and the bitterness lingers for awhile.  That said, my 20 month old doesn&#x27;t like it, but she&#x27;ll suck it off or suffer through the bitterness (whimpering). Her desire to suck her thumb is greater than her desire to avoid the taste of this.</li>
            <li> This did not stop my 4 year old from biting his nails. It smelled just like nail polish so when it dried I tried it and the taste was not strong at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with Barielle No Bite Pro Growth.  (written by Marc, not Marlow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brush on well, dry very quickly, and add a slight shine to the nails.  I use them on my 8 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onyx:&lt;br /&gt;  is a lot more bitter than Barielle;&lt;br /&gt;  bitterness stays &amp;#34;nasty&amp;#34; at least until it physically wears off;&lt;br /&gt;  peels/wears off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barielle:&lt;br /&gt;  is not as bitter as Onyx;&lt;br /&gt;  bitterness lasts for around 5 days;&lt;br /&gt;  doesn&#x27;t peel/wear off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brush on the Barielle, let it dry, then brush on the Onyx.  That way the first &#x27;finger-in-mouth&#x27; afterwards meets the very strong Onyx as a reminder, and while the Onyx tends to wear off after a couple days, the Barielle stays for at least a week.  Between the two, her nail chewing is pretty much stopped, except for an occasional slip.</li>
            <li> WOW Does this stuff taste awful, just like it says. It has all but stopped my nail bitting habit. And Im a hard core nail chewer i do it with out even knowing it. But with this stuff I am definitely consious when my hands head for my mouth. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails since I was a little kid, and finally had enough. This stuff is disgusting. Bitter. It makes me gag. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days, and already know it&#x27;s going to make a huge difference. The only downside is that the taste gets everywhere. It lingers in your mouth, can get on your food, everywhere. My husband even ended up with it on him after holding hands.</li>
            <li> My son hates this!  That means it works.  I like that you paint it on so he cannot wash it off.</li>
            <li> Ok people! If you chew your nails and are looking to put the most nastiest tasting thing on to stop your bad habit search no further! This stuff is super bitter and stays on your nails for days. It has helped me quit a habit I have had for 26 years!</li>
            <li> My 30month old son had been a chronic thumb sucker since he was one. Got this product 3weeks ago, he stopped sucking his thumb permanently with no slip-ups 2weeks after we first started using it. The Lord be praised! Lol</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other brands - this is the only one that has worked so far.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream. Seven year olds nails are finally growing back again! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It works! I got it from walmart for like $3.00. Tried it out, forgot it was on. When to adjust my lipbalm.  GAWD, taste awful!! SO going to try this on my nieces.</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t like the taste so she did stop.  On the day I forgot to put it on, she&#x27;ll be back at it. Don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ll have to apply it for her to quit this habit.</li>
            <li> I bought something years ago to help my son stop sucking his thumb and then loaned it to my sister-in-law who never returned it. This stuff obviously wasn&#x27;t it. My son now bites his nails until they bleed. When I put this stuff on he says it tastes good and just sucks it off. Very dissappointed. Whatever the other stuff was it worked in days. He hated it and has never sucked his thumb since. I guess I am still on the search for it.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old quit biting his fingers after one application!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!  My first grade son really had a bad habit going and couldn&#x27;t stop.  He kept getting sick every time ANY kids at school were sick from chewing on his germ covered nails and cuticles.  Now he is habit free in only a free weeks of applying once each morning.</li>
            <li> Leaves the nails with dried residue...</li>
            <li> I really like this polish for my daughter, who is 8. I bought it for the primary purpose of thumb sucking, but she also used to bite her nails as well. If used twice a day as instructed, she didn&#x27;t suck her thumb at all. If I forgot to put it on that night, she would sometimes put it in her mouth while sleeping. It does take 1-2 days to completely wear off, so make sure you keep applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, she could taste the polish on her finger foods while eating, this is the main thing she didn&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price for product, now I haven&#x27;t seen her suck her thumb/bite nails in over 2 weeks, so I would say it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!! The only thing that worked on my adult bitter.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for! Bitter taste, long lasting and works!</li>
            <li> Nasty taste prevents you from wanting to bite your nails. Taste can be noticed when eating finger foods if not careful.</li>
            <li> Got it for a friend who&#x27;s almost 4 year old wouldn&#x27;t stop sucking his thumb. He stopped within a week!!!</li>
            <li> works very well at making your fingers nails taste bad.  when first put on it seemed to make your entire finger taste bad so when eating you want to avoid foods like fried chicken.  after it was on several days this improved and it was just the nail that tasted bad.</li>
            <li> Love it- well, in a perverse way.  Been a nail biter for 50 years (ugh) its 4 weeks and I am okay so far. This stuff is GODAWFUL, and it spreads by molecular whim. You wake up with it on your lips- no clue how it got there. You can&#x27;t handle food or it gets on it- not wet, mind you, but 2 or 4 days after applied it ends up on your balogna sandwich or in the onion you just chopped up for salsa...its got a half life.  I ended up scrubbing like a surgeon to get it all off before I tried cooking...better idea, get some plastic gloves, easier.  Has a lovely shine. They recommend putting it on lots, but I found 1x a week was fine, and it only takes a few unconscious moves to the lips to cure you of doing THAT again---probably too cruel to do to a child, but a teen might be okay, and certainly an adult.  They say it takes 6 weeks to 8 weeks to stop a bad habit. I&#x27;m half way home and I have only used 2 applications...so, it should last...but exercise caution, this thing is intense</li>
            <li> Works amazingly! My son is 5 and has been constantly biting his nails for the past few years. We have tried home remedies, monitoring him, rewards system, etc. It got to the point where we don&#x27;t see him bite but yet his nails are still torn/bitten! I tried this and on the 2nd day, I saw nail growth! (We&#x27;re thinking he must be biting in his sleep.) His nails are still growing and it is a &amp;#34;miracle!&amp;#34; We stopped using it for a week and some of his nails are still growing. :) There are a few that have been bitten so we will continue with this and use trial and error when he finally stops biting. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff tastes nasty and it lasts a long time which is exactly what I need to stop biting my nails.  My only complaint is that it lasts so long (I can go for days without re-coating) that eating anything that requires finger-licking is not nearly as enjoyable!</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have chewed my nails ever since I can remember. This product has kept me from chewing my nails for over a month. One cautionary note. Any time I lick my fingers it tastes like this product. But I will buy it again because I don&#x27;t have the embarrassing habit of biting my finger nails any more!!!!</li>
            <li> taste rubs off on everything you touch</li>
            <li> Working great my son has stopped biting his nails and skin!!</li>
            <li> It worked the first time but my 9 year old wouldn&#x27;t apply it thereafter. Not a produce problem&lt;br /&gt;but kid problem.</li>
            <li> Tastes awful as it is supposed too. :)</li>
            <li> Hate the taste, but that&#x27;s why I love it!  As a nail biter all of my life, I wanted to finally quit (at the age of 49).  I had ordered another product online but got tired of waiting for it to be delivered.  So I purchased this at walmart on an impulse.  This works great!  I was applying it about three times a day for the first few days.  But I&#x27;ve already noticed that i only have to put it on in the morning and it is still there enough to serve as a reminder that I don&#x27;t want my fingers anywhere near my mouth.  It will make it that you don&#x27;t want your fingers near your face at all.  Since putting it on in the morning, I find that the taste is still there in the evening but not strong enough that I can&#x27;t enjoy a finger food type of snack in the evening.  My worse time for this habit has always been when I&#x27;m driving so I do make sure that if I&#x27;m behind the wheels, I put this on before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> Did not help my 1 year old</li>
            <li> This stuff really really works. Almost too much. It tastes horrible and you can taste it with even the slightest touch. You can&#x27;t even get it on your lips without regretting it. My 7 year old daughter chews on her nails really bad and it has been great to help her stop.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t touch anything after! Works great for my Gf</li>
            <li> My 5 year old hates this stuff. She refuses to put her thumb in her mouth. She tries to hide her hands when I go to put it on her. Would recommend for people trying to stop their kids from sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> I like the product but not the taste. There is no need to apply two coats twice a day. Once every couple days if that. Today is day 4 for me with no bite. I have bitten my nails my whole life and this product works.</li>
            <li> Ive been biting my nails for 15+ years and used a gross nail polish as a kid to get me to stop but that polish didnt work, i chewed it right off. This stuff works amazingly. It is bitter and gross tasting and leaves the taste on your tongue and on your lips. I highly recomend this product. It goes on clear and makes your nails look shiny. Multiple coats are advised because it does peel off after a while but even after not replenishing the coats for a day the taste was still lingering on my nails and was just as disgusting! Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I found out that my husband&#x27;s horribly ragged nails were that way because he had been chewing on them.  Well, I was fixing his nails (I&#x27;m a cosmetologist) and I just added this in without mentioning it and I waited to see if it worked.  The next day, he was at work and called me to ask what I put on his nails.  He said it tasted terrible and he could not wash it off.  The instructions say to apply it 1 - 2 times a day but I only put it on his nails once or twice a week and it seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a husband who is a nail chewer, get this stuff!  It really works!!!</li>
            <li> This it&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;m trying to make my boy stop sucking,  but I gotta tell, this ain&#x27;t working.  Not for this.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend using for thumb sucking in younger kids. Tastes beyond horrible (I get it&#x27;s supposed to) and won&#x27;t come off (get that too). Probably great for older kids &amp; adult nail biters</li>
            <li> Used on a 5 year old to stop sucking her pinky...day 4...and still she is not sucking her finger! I used malva stop for years and it didnt work after she washed her hands so this one sticks and its AWESOME! Thank you so much for selling this great product!</li>
            <li> I just tried this yesterday and I am positive it will help me stop biting my nails along with losing weight, 2 for 1 bonus! This stuff is horrible and if you enjoy finger foods or ever need to scratch your face around your mouth, you will taste the polish. I wasn&#x27;t able to eat my lunch today as it consisted of a sandwich and chips and somehow the taste of this polish gets on my lips (nope, I don&#x27;t suck on my fingers when I eat).  Every time i go to bite my nails, my stomach immediately turns as I am quickly reminded of the horrible taste.</li>
            <li> I put this on my boyfriend everyday for like 2 weeks or so and he literally never even attempts to bite his nails anymore. The only thing is that you MUST let it dry before touching anything else, otherwise it gets everywhere &amp; it tastes horrible.</li>
            <li> My son bites his nails down into the nail bed.  I was at my wits end trying to help him stop (okay, make him stop.. he didn&#x27;t care either way).  We used this twice and he stopped biting his nails altogether.  I gave only 3 stars because it stays on your fingers for days.  Everything you touch/eat with your fingers will taste unpleasant.  I made iced tea and the whole batch had to be thrown out (I tested it on my nails).  So, it does work - usually quickly.  I would use it again since I have the product.  But, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Worked Great... even on a 12-year-old boy who had been biting his nails his whole life.&lt;br /&gt;Cut his nails with a nail clipper last week for the first time since he was a baby.&lt;br /&gt;Only applied every 5-7 days. Lasted nicely, and none of his classmates noticed the polish.&lt;br /&gt;PS. You do not need to coat the whole nail. I just swiped the polish along the top edge of his nails.</li>
            <li> Even though I didn&#x27;t buy it for myself, I had to try it-to see if it would work.  And I must admit, the taste is simply repugnant.  Try it... You&#x27;ll LOVE (Hate the taste and stop biting) it.</li>
            <li> Did not deter my 5 yr old at all.</li>
            <li> This has a shiny look, so it was noticed on my boys at school.  Too bad, we put it on anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It wears off quickly, so you must apply daily.&lt;br /&gt;They complained it affected the way food tasted, when they used their fingers(chips, goldfish,etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Again, too bad. Stop biting the nails fellas and you won&#x27;t have to complain.</li>
            <li> still sucks his thumb</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It really does taste horrible enough to keep your fingers out of your mouth. The only downside is that it rubs off on everything. So... Finger foods isn&#x27;t really a good idea while using this. But other than that, this has really helped me stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> This is an update to my previous 5 star review for the first bottle I bought, which worked great. I purchased a second bottle, and its like they changed the formula for this - it now peels off like crazy, no matter how many coats I put on, the taste is a lot less strong and its less effective. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I initially got it for my 2yr old who sucks his fingers, after applying it to his hands i noticed he was still sucking his fingers so i tried it for myself.  This stuff taste horrible, i don&#x27;t see how he&#x27;s still sucking his fingers. This stuff also affects the way you eat, makes your food taste bitter.</li>
            <li> Came off easy and the taste did not phase my son.</li>
            <li> Perfect and works amazing I started noticing my nails growing . But I do suggest that if you are eating just make sure that you put it on before you start eating otherwise it will tastes bad on your food if you lick your fingers.</li>
            <li> The best quick solution for those who&#x27;ve been suffering from constant nail biting habits. I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for at least 30 years. I&#x27;ve tried many modalities to stop biting and nothing worked. I decided to give the hoof stop the bite product a chance.  I&#x27;m so glad I did. It also made my nails slightly stronger. I truly believe that it can help many people. I&#x27;ve tried it on for two weeks and I only put it 4 times.This is the best discovery for me, but you have to keep at it. Since I&#x27;ve had this bad habit for so long I didn&#x27;t expect any miracles fast. To my surprise this is very close. Moreover I got it for excellent price. You absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do the job for my son. I am not sure why, because it was a true deterrent for me when I tried it first, however he completely ignored it and kept his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I put 1 coat on my nails last night - today I have used nail polish remover and it is still on my hands/nails/and even face around my mouth! If you touch your mouth even a day after it will stay on your lips and anything you eat tastes HORRIBLE!!!! I will NEVER use this again!!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for the past 19 years. It was a habit that I could NOT get rid of. I started putting this stuff on and no lie within 4 weeks I completely stopped biting or even going near my nails because of the not so good taste. I my nails are completely grown out and my nails are strong and long. I recommend this product to anyone but especially those with the long term bad habit.</li>
            <li> In an effort to stop biting my nails I have begun applying a thin layer of this to my finger tips. Works extremely well as a reminder to not bite my nails (which is all I needed.) Still requires some discipline to not pick it at... and also has the unintended side effect of making it hard to eat finger foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it dries in seconds, I recommend applying it at night before bed so it has a chance to thoroughly harden, making it less noticeable and harder to pick at.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it much anymore but it tastes like crap.  Easy to remove and is shiny so it looks like clear nail polish.  That may be one reason it works ok.</li>
            <li> Worked great it broke me of nail biting.</li>
            <li> it is working on my five year old more thumb sucking and the nail biting only happens if I forget to paint them for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Baby sucked through it.</li>
            <li> Did not stop the nail biting;  I think it tastes horrible, but does not a determined nailbiter!  I&#x27;m trying to find out if it&#x27;s returnable.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! it is the worst tasting and long lasting stuff you can put on your nails. The taste is so bad that it stays on your lips and in your mouth for a while. It&#x27;s really an effective product,</li>
            <li> This stuff works! If you&#x27;re looking for an inhibitor for nail biting, this it it! Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! My daughter isn&#x27;t bothered by how it tastes when she&#x27;s asleep and still thumbsucks. When she&#x27;s awake she notices the taste and doesn&#x27;t like it (I had her taste it after I applied it on her nails) but she only thumb sucks when asleep.</li>
            <li> Its the most disgusting taste ever. But hey that&#x27;s what does allow you to bite your nails. Works great.</li>
            <li> After 36 years of biting my nails. I have stoped 100% the taste is super nasty. It doesnt wear off at all the only bad thing is you cant touch finger foods it sticks too it.</li>
            <li> Great for nail biters</li>
            <li> Has a putrid taste that dissuades you from biting your nails but unfortunately the foul taste also rubs off whenever you try to enjoy any finger foods!</li>
            <li> After only about 3 weeks my 6 year old daughter was done chewing her nails! Awesome product.</li>
            <li> My 4 yr old has been biting his nails since he was about 1. His biting got progressively worse as he got older. He literally had a lil stub of nail on each finger and would often get hang nails and other issues with his skin. Nothing I did helped him to stop. But this product does!! For the first time my baby boy has nails long enough to have dirt under them! This is huge for him. He&#x27;s actually getting the white nail part that grows over the finger! Only con is have to remember to apply everyday,but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I brought the for my little girl who sucks her index finger.  After using for 2weeks, she got use to the taste.  It did work for my boys, that bite their nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my 3 year old he has started biting his nails (bad habit) but hand foot mouth is going around so I was feeling desperate to keep those fingers out of his mouth.  The reviewers seemed to feel the product worked well, and for $4 I figured we could try it.  When the product arrived I read the directions, which ask you to apply 2x per day, and  Warning label which states will cause serious illness and can be fatal if swallowed - do not induce vomiting immediately call poison control.  I know this warning is for larger consumption, but obviously there is something harmful in this product - and this product is intended to go on your nails knowing that people will be putting them in their mouths.  None of the reviewers have said anything about getting sick, but I feel like this is an important fact to know when considering a product like this, especially as it&#x27;s marketed for thumb sucking which generally involves small children.  I threw our bottle away so I can&#x27;t speak to how well the product works</li>
            <li> This has cured my nail biting habit. I bought this product late June and wanted to use it for at least a month before i reviewed. In just 3 weeks i was done biting my nails. It was a little smaller than i expected but after reading other reviews and looking at pictures i realized that the size was appropriate. I painted it on my nails and waited for it to dry, then i applied some regular nail polish. Every time i would go to bite my nails the taste steered me away. It tastes like chemicals or something. The taste wasn&#x27;t bitter enough to make me gag or vomit but it was enough to make me remember to not bite my nails again. The only complaint i have is that the taste rubs off on food. Other than that this product worked as promised.</li>
            <li> This is the first product we&#x27;ve bought to get our 3 year old to stop sucking his thumb. I think it lasted for about an hour and then wore off. He was back to sucking his thumb in no time! Wears off too quickly. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> We initially used the gentle thumb glove to try to get our five-year-old son to stop sucking his thumb. Even though it helped, he fell back into thumb-sucking after a bout of fever/cold. I read the reviews for this &amp;#34;Stop the Bite&amp;#34; on Amazon and decided to get it. I got it at Walmart because it was $2.49 in the beauty section with the nail polishes and on the way home from work. It goes on clear and dries just a little glossy. I thought I needed to put it on twice a day as suggested, but I&#x27;ve only put it on his nails twice this week and his thumb-sucking has totally stopped. Maybe we should have gotten this sooner for him...It&#x27;s just that little push that he needed to get over his thumb-sucking. It&#x27;s been about a week and although I don&#x27;t see him suck his thumb anymore, I&#x27;m still going to continue to paint it on for another couple of weeks, to ensure that he&#x27;s done with thumb-sucking for good. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My wife has bitten her nails her whole life. I threatened sticking her hands in dog poop but then figured this was better. Glad I purchased this product. It works. Tastes very nasty. The down side is that if you put your fingers in your mouth even to not bite the nails, you still get the horrible taste.     Update: I found out later, the trick is making sure that whoever you bought it for, uses it. The product still works great when it is used. I will have to paint her nails with this stuff in her sleep.</li>
            <li> It does the job and tastes horrible if you attempt to bite your nails. I rated it okay because you have to paint your nails with this stuff twice a day - as it states or it will literally peel off of your nails.  The brand I had many years ago only required one coat every other day. I know that twice a day doesn&#x27;t sound unreasonable, but when your caught up in the day with 3 children, you tend to forget that you needed that second coat. With that being said though, it really does work and I am happy to say that my nails are growing quite nicely.</li>
            <li> It worked great for my youngest but my 4 year old not so much.</li>
            <li> My nails have been bloody stubs since I was 8. I would bite the skin raw, get infected hangnails, and deformed nails from messing up the root. I know so disgusting. I always told myself, well I could be smoking, but after getting strep throat 3x in 6months and with this Ebola epidemic, I needed something asap. This stuff clings to everything you touch, which sounds like a bad thing, but is a blessing bc it is a constant reminder that u want your hands as far away as possible from your mouth. My nails are actually normal now and they even grew fast. Seriously, the nicorette gum of nail biting.</li>
            <li> This has helped me stop my daughter from thumbsucking. Unfortunately she has moved down to her fingers so I paint this on every one of them. It stays on when the other brands don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> works as expected and stays on long</li>
            <li> This stuff worked!!!! It tastes horrible and it kept my four year old&#x27;s fingers out of her mouth and her nails grew fast. The skin around her nails also healed well. I still use it, a month later to remind her not to put her fingers in her mouth. Only one coat every few days is necessary.</li>
            <li> Stuff works. My daughter stopped biting her nails to bad it&#x27;s rubing off so easy on everything so if she had food in her hand it had that bitter taste and she would not eat it anymore. So for now we stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifelong nail biter and have tried various products - this one is worse tasting &amp; longer lasting than Mavala Stop (which is higher rated) in my opinion. As a determined nail biter, I need the extra bad taste as incentive, so this product is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a nail biter this product is the way to go. For small children/thumbsuckers - Mavala might be the less potent and therefore better option.</li>
            <li> Works but the taste gets on EVERYTHING you touch. Can&#x27;t eat finger foods without tasting and it</li>
            <li> Does the trick and tastes bad so you don&#x27;t want to continue bitting.</li>
            <li> Horrible taste omg but it works perfectly. I have been using it almost three weeks and my nails are growing prettt fast.</li>
            <li> Product works great! My son doesn&#x27;t bite his nails when we use it! Great product. I Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is working. I have not been biting my nails.</li>
            <li> It works good, but it affects on my life , I cannot eat, I cannot make any thing by my hand because it affects the taste of food .. so I need wear gloves when I want to eat or cook , or even when I want to turn the page of my book 😯</li>
            <li> So it tastes horrible. Which is the point. I have been biting my nails for 21 years and now I&#x27;m a month in to no nail biting. I seriously reccommend this to anyone trying to quit. But don&#x27;t lick your fingers lol.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and helped me to stop biting my nails</li>
            <li> My son stopped sucking his thumb the day we put it on. Love this stuff! Very potent taste and smell.</li>
            <li> I was debating what is the best rating to give this product. It 100% does what it says it does - you will not ever want to put your fingers anywhere near your mouth. It does not wash off easily.. Since I&#x27;ve applied the polish 14 hours ago, I&#x27;ve washed my hands several times, and it&#x27;s still strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it transfers easily.. I can no longer eat finger foods (with my hands anyway). The taste is very strong on foods, such as chips, when you grab them with your hands. I can&#x27;t scratch or rub anywhere near my mouth or it will transfer to my lips and I will taste it all day. I didn&#x27;t really think the product would effect daily life like this, but I&#x27;m going to try to stick it out.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and has been instrumental in helping two of my children leave the nail-biting habit in the past.  :)  I&#x27;m very happy with the way it stays on...and on...and reminds them of what they biting (when they are not even aware of it).</li>
            <li> Life saver. I chewed my skin around nails for years after a break up and this finally stopped me.</li>
            <li> it tastes awful... but i haven&#x27;t been biting my nails lol sooo woo... hope this time i can keep them long .. wish me luck !</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any other of its kind! It definitely will kick a nail biting habit with only a few applications. It gets into the nooks &amp; crannies of your nails &amp; you can taste it for a good week or so after only one application. You won&#x27;t want any finger foods for a while, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It works, but definitely follow the directions and apply everyday, the potency does wear off after a day or two. My kids are bad nail biters and the skin around the nail as well and it stops them for as long as your apply it. Yes, this does &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; into any finger food you prepare and yes, your kids will complain that their food taste like the nail polish. My solution is handing them a utensil and telling them: &amp;#34;it wouldn&#x27;t taste like that if you would keep your fingers out of your mouth. Stop biting your fingers, the polish goes away.&amp;#34; My children have not had any illness with this, I have tried this with myself and yes, it&#x27;s nasty strong! That&#x27;s pretty much what it&#x27;s for and I am pretty pleased with the results.. now if I could only keep up with the schedule of applications!!</li>
            <li> Think this has been the longest I&#x27;ve ever went without biting my nails. Fantactic product :)</li>
            <li> I originally tried this when a coworker let me use it. I really liked it and my nails grew the longest ive seen them in years!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So months later I ordered myself a bottle. I&#x27;m not pleased with it as much as the first stuff I tried. It&#x27;s the same brand, but I noticed the new bottle looked different and they must&#x27;ve used a new formula. With the old stuff I didn&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating food when I cooked, ONLY when I would bite my nails. And it didn&#x27;t come off in the shower until like 3 or 4 days. Now the new stuff comes off in just one shower, and it contaminates ANY food I touch that makes my nails wet like chicken breast. Go back to the old formula it was much better, I would pay twice as much for the old formula!!</li>
            <li> It works. This stuff tastes HORRID and stays on your nails for a good while, even with regular hand washing. I have a bad nervous nail biting habit and have never been able to grow my nails. This certainly fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you bite your nails, this stuff gets in your mouth, which is gross. It will also sometimes stay on your lips, so every time you lick your lips, you&#x27;re reminded of how stupid it was to try to bite your fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really expensive as the bottle does go very far.</li>
            <li> Actually bought this for my granddaughter who keeps putting her fingers in her mouth- I was concerned at first; didn&#x27;t want her getting any kind chemical in her mouth but one little taste reminded her. For the first time in years after all else failed-she stopped-this did the trick.</li>
            <li> The amazon reviews for these types of products are really frustrating. Most 5 star reviews are clearly fake testimonials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to help my 6 yr old stop biting her nails and I&#x27;ve tried each product on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thumb&amp;#34; is totally useless and doesn&#x27;t taste like anything. Active ingredient listed as Cayenne pepper extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Malvala Stop&amp;#34; is bitter but I don&#x27;t really find the taste all that offensive. It might be useful for a very taste sensitive child or an adult that just want&#x27;s a reminder. My 6 yr old says she doesn&#x27;t like the taste but it&#x27;s not enough to get her to stop. The taste is slow to develop. Active ingredient Denatonium Benzoate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hoof stop the bite&amp;#34; is very bitter and the taste comes on much quicker than Malvala. Bitterness lingers for a long time. Active ingredient Denatonium Benzoate (branded Bitrex).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoof wins in that it tastes the worst and must have a higher concentration of Denatonium Benzoate. My main concern with both Hoof and Malvala is that the lingering bitterness will desensitize my daughter too it. Since the bad taste doesn&#x27;t go away she may just keep biting once she starts. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Stopped our thumb sucker immediately.</li>
            <li> Worked for a day.  Then my daughter stoped carrying. And it became worthless.</li>
            <li> my daughter and son were constantly chewing on their fingers.. this stuff WORKS!!!! made them stop :-)</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t use this for nail biting. My daughter sucks her thumb. We used this for one week and after that she stopped sucking her thumb. We tried the gloves but they didn&#x27;t work. She would pull them off easily. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick,  hard, shinny coating and as a result dries very quickly. Needs replaced much more often then the recommended times per day because it constantly washes off due to being highly water soluble.  Doesn&#x27;t taste as strong as other products I&#x27;ve tried but is bitter tasting as described. I gave it a try for the money but will go back to my other product as I had better success with it. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works. I&#x27;m review in thai version as link http://pantip.com/topic/32675902.</li>
            <li> The stuff tastes awful after getting this in your mouth you will avoid contact with your tongue at all costs guaranteed to help you stop biting your nails</li>
            <li> actually to be completely honest this is the first product I have tried to stop my nail biting. I&#x27;m 26 years old, and have been biting my nails as long as I can remember. So far this has done the trick, I tried to bite my nails out of habit immediately after using this stuff and gagged as soon as my nails hit my lips. I cant even eat finger foods either lol! Ive only used the stuff for three weeks, but I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> It really tastes horrible! That&#x27;s why my thumb sucking daughter does not even THINK about sucking her thumb. She sucked it off the first day because she was still addicted to sucking her thumb. But the second day she was tired of the taste! (my son a non-thumb sucker wanted to try, and he was gagging from a lick, did not want anything to do with it afterwords). My daughter no longer sucks her thumb, no more worries for me! We used it for about 4 to 5 days stright and it&#x27;s not a problem anymore. EVERYThing else we tried, the thumb guard, other nail biting polishes.. and they didn&#x27;t work. This did. FINALLY!</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible! Yes, it tastes bad. So bad, in fact, that it induced vomiting in my son within minutes of putting it on his fingers. He was crying hysterically because he couldn&#x27;t get the taste out of his mouth even after taking a drink and then he just started throwing up, a lot!! My son hardly ever throws up so I knew it was bad. I just happened to get a tiny bit on my finger from applying it on him and I touched my lips with that finger not knowing it was there. I got a taste of it and nearly gagged! It&#x27;s been an hour since that happened and I still can&#x27;t get the taste out of my mouth. I forgot it was on my finger and picked up a piece of food with that hand and ate it and the horrible taste transferred from my finger, to the food, to my mouth! Ugh! I feel like a horrible mother because I know my little boy got a lot more of it in his mouth than I did. It says that the &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; bad flavor will discourage biting of the nails but I would not call that flavor mild by any means! I would call it tortuous and lingering, and I am not exaggerating. Yes, I desperately want my son to stop chewing his fingernails to the point of bleeding but I will not be torturing my child with this again. The warning label also says that it is not to be ingested. I know that is for a larger amount but it seems that even a small amount is enough to make someone sick. Please do not use this on your children!! It&#x27;s just not worth the risk. If you still want to try it, I would suggest getting a mouthful of it yourself before subjecting your kids to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective but it remains in the finger for long time. When ever I wet my lips I could feel the same nasty taste in my lips. I don&#x27;t know wen my lips and finger made contact.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my 14 year old.  He says it stays in his mouth and he doesn&#x27;t even want to stick his fingers in his mouth. Even when he eats oreos it get in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST OF ITS KIND. MY 9 YEAR OLD STOPPED SUCKING HER THUMB AND BITTING HER NAILS WITHIN 3 WEEKS.</li>
            <li> They meant it when they named this product Stop the Bite! My fingers stay far away from mouth and anything else that could come in contact with my tongue! The taste is aweful! Which is what makes this such an excellent product and drove me to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes one coat because it is so potent, and it stays for a while! Even after removing it with nail polish remover, and washing my hands numerous times with soap and hot water, I could still get the taste of it lingering on my fingers. If you want to stop biting then take it from me, this should be your go to stuff.</li>
            <li> So far this has really helped solve the problem my son and husband have with biting their cuticles.  My son does say you have to be careful when you eat so you don&#x27;t get the nasty taste on your food or in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the results. I am using this product on my 4 yr old daughter by applying it during the night when she is sleeping to make her believe that the awful taste is a consequence of biting her nails. She instantly stopped biting her nails and after 2 weeks I could notice her nails growing again after more than a year of not cutting her nails as they never grew.</li>
            <li> Mmm I added like 3 coats and my daughter still bite her nails and suck her thumb</li>
            <li> I actually put this stuff on the skin around my nails because that&#x27;s what I bite. (I know Hannibal) but it tastes so nasty, it makes me not want to bite anymore! I used to be able to buy this stuff at walmart or walgreens, but they discontinued it. So I will keep buying from these people. Thank you for having it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works - 100%.  My nails have never been this long.  It takes disgusting!!  Which is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old and my 3 year old who are both nail biters. my 3 year old&#x27;s hands were so bad that he began to have the skin on his fingers peel and he would eat that as well. We tried another product at first that works so so... But this stuff is amazing! Both boys just 10 days later now have nails that I have to cut with a clipper. My 8 year old says mom this stuff is so gross. I put it on their nails on Sunday after bath Wednesday after bath and again on Friday mornings. It last on their nails. If you are looking for something to stop this horrible germ spreading habit. Then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Perfect - he hates it! Made him cry the first time since he couldn&#x27;t pick up food and eat that either (somehow got onto that too). So, encourages table manners (using utensils) and no more biting! Yay!</li>
            <li> This awful thing made my life a living hell. I am a 25 year old who bites her nails when nervous so to help my control I bought this. I could not knead dough, use my hands for any sort of cooking- I wore food gloves that entire week(even after trying the nail polish remover). The memory of that bitter taste still lingers in my mouth. If my parents had done this to be when I was a kid maybe I would not have the habit of biting my nails when nervous but I sure wouldn&#x27;t have forgiven them for it</li>
            <li> My little girl pulls a face every time so puts her thumb in her mouth. It is really bitter tasting.</li>
            <li> This did what I wanted it to do.  It stopped my 5 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking in less than 1 week.  She put her thumb in her mouth 2 times and has not put it back in even after we stopped putting the polish on her.</li>
            <li> This seriously stops you nail biting habits. It stops you like a truck hitting you in the face! the worst (in a good way).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for as long as I can remember and I just decided to give this a try.  It tastes absolutely TERRIBLE and it doesn&#x27;t give off any odor, so in that respect, it does really well.  I have only bitten my nails once since I started using this, 2 weeks ago and I very quickly regretted it.  The only thing I hate about it is that it rubs off onto my lips very easily.  I don&#x27;t even know how, but I find myself licking my lips and getting a taste of it on a daily basis.  Can&#x27;t wait til I don&#x27;t need to put this stuff on anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the instructions say 2 coats twice a day.  I found that one coat is enough to repulse me even 3 days later!</li>
            <li> While I can taste this faintly on my own fingernails, my 4 year old stepdaughter is completely oblivious to it and her fingers continue to go in her mouth.  The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars is because the ritual of putting it on her nails and discussing why we are doing it seems to help her remember that her fingers shouldn’t go in her mouth.  I could just buy clear polish for much less money though.  I do recognize that people react to things differently so while this doesn’t work for us, it may work for others.  Thum did not work for us either and I couldn’t taste anything on my own fingernails when I tried it.</li>
            <li> He hates the taste of it.  So does not want to bite fingernails.  But the problem is if you eat anything with your fingers that is bad too.</li>
            <li> It definitely reduces my urge to bite my nails, but it also transfers onto everything.  Even lightly wiping off your mouth can wind up getting this nasty taste on your lips.  It&#x27;s definitely pretty hard to live like this, but hopefully within a week or two I won&#x27;t need it anymore.</li>
            <li> i put this on my one fingernail and it tasted gross for nearly a week. my three year old isn&#x27;t as bothered by it though. if i remember to apply it to his nails every morning, it works fairly well.  he&#x27;s definatly not putting his fingernails/ hands in his mouth as much!</li>
            <li> My 6-year old has been a nail biter for 4 years. We bought Stop the Bite a month ago and put it on nightly. He&#x27;s had a couple of slip-ups but otherwise hasn&#x27;t bitten his nails since! It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the way his food tastes either, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Cured me of a 30 year nail biting habit inside of 2 weeks. I didn&#x27;t think it would be that easy. Watch out for finger foods while you have this stuff on.</li>
            <li> I bit my nails right to the cuticle and have done so for 32 years. I need it to stop and previous attempts have failed because I don&#x27;t even catch myself until the nail is wrecked. This stuff stays on for a long long time. I put it on Friday afternoon and now Monday morning, after dozens of hand washes, dishes, couple showers, and it&#x27;s still there. It&#x27;s so horrible. Once you taste it you can&#x27;t get the taste out of your mouth for an hour. It is a great reminder and a punishment for slip-ups. I think this is going to make me finally quit.</li>
            <li> does what it says it will.  fast.</li>
            <li> Well it definitely tastes absolutely disgusting. After a few finger slip-ups I was already consciously not putting them in my mouth. It is a little shiny like a cheap clear nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning though, do not, I STRESS, do not use an electric nail file after using it. The result is intensely unpleasant (try to stifle your laughter at my discomfort). You never really realize where that nail dust goes until you inhale it and it tastes like Stopthebite for 20 minutes. I drank, I rinsed, I brushed, I rinsed my nose out, but it&#x27;s still bitter and I&#x27;m waiting it out.</li>
            <li> What can I say that hasn&#x27;t been said. IT WORKS!!! Plain and simple. I was debating on whether to go with http://amzn.to/1RHYPiG or the Onyx brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since stopthebite comes in a slightly larger bottle (.5oz) and cost 1/3 the price, my cheapness got the better of me so I went with Onyx brand. Glad I did plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the polish doesn&#x27;t smell. I was expecting to, but, fortunately, the odor was barely noticeable when applied and after a few minutes of drying disappeared altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient is Denatonium Benzoate and makes the dry polish tastes like bitter, bitter soap. I&#x27;ve read that repeat offenders will eventually desensitize themselves to the ingredient, but I highly doubt that claim. It&#x27;s pretty gross but without being crippling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish wears off after 2-3 days and will need to be reapplied. But it dries really fast and re-application is quick and dirty and takes less than a minute. When my kids (4 &amp; 6) hands started creeping back to their face and back into their months, it gave me all the reminder I needed to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one month went by I forgot all about the polish and the remainder sat at the top of the medicine cabinet unused. Two months went by, then three. I actually totally forgot about re-upping the coating of bitter soap on my kid&#x27;s nails and I bet you know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks on the stuff, my kids caught the hint and quit sticking their fingers in their mouths. Since they quit sticking their fingers in their mouths I completely forgot all about putting the solution on their nails. That was eight months ago. Mission accomplished. Would buy again, but don&#x27;t need to. Maybe for my grandchildren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention neither kid got sick last cold/flu season? Coincidence? Maybe, good parenting more likely.</li>
            <li> For a mild to moderate nail biter, this stuff works! It&#x27;s REALLY GROSS, and the taste stays in your mouth for almost a minute to remind you to stop your habit. The directions say to apply twice a day, but if you re-apply a just few times a week it&#x27;s still very effective. Good price, too. I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and already my nails look better. I would suggest using this in addition to regular nail maintenance like filing/buffing to keep them looking nice and taking pride in your progress.</li>
            <li> True to its word…  I definitely cringe just looking at my hands..  Lol I was picking a piece of hair out my mouth and was promtly jolted with bitterness.  Absolutely gross! I love it! Its been five days since ive bit my nails!!!</li>
            <li> When I get the urge to bite my nails a put a small dab on the tips and it most definitely discourages the bite. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! I got it for my 2 yr old because she was biting her nails all the way back into the cuticle. I had tried everything and bought several products before finding this one. It tastes so bad that she would gag to start with and she would tell me that her nails tasted nasty. It was difficult for her to eat foods with her fingers for a few days but then she figured out she just needed to use a spoon or fork and her food wouldn&#x27;t taste bad. The product actually stays on your fingers a couple days at a time, even after scrubbing with soap (I got it on my own fingers)! I only had to use the product a few weeks to break her habit and now she has fingernails that we can actually paint. If I see her thinking about putting her nails in her mouth I just show her the &amp;#34;stop the bite&amp;#34; and she quickly moves her fingers. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does the job, my son hates it.</li>
            <li> My son has stopped sucking his thumb, thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 3 year son who likes to bite his nails and 9 year old daughter that still sucks her thumb.  It works great for my daughter but my son not so much.  Put it on his fingers and almost immediately he put his fingers in his mouth.  Of course the look on his face was priceless and so funny.  Well funny until he started projectile vomiting all over the place.  So summary 9 years old good, 3 years old bad.</li>
            <li> stopped biting my nails immediately! works because the taste is nasty and you immediately pull your fingers away from your mouth.</li>
            <li> Got me to stop biting my nails bjut I still chewed up my fingers, and it unfortunately turned me off fingr foods because the taste transferred so easily. So yes it did its job, but the cons outweighed the pros.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> It worked great. My daughter stopped sucking her thumb in 4 days.</li>
            <li> Yes it worked great. No biting taste awful.&lt;br /&gt;Shared it with a coworker and she too liked the results. Finally</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  It tastes awful.  Lasts a while too; even after washing your hands a few times.  I did notice that some of my vege dishes tasted mildly bitter...I believe it was from some of the Onyx solution washing off my fingers and into the food during meal preparation.  However, there are a couple ways to get around this - gloves or modifying how you prepare food that needs to be washed under tap water. This stuff worked for me; I continue to use it intermittently, just to keep myself honest (and my fingernails out of my mouth).  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it human nature took over and, of course, I had to taste it.  WOW it&#x27;s so incredibly disgusting!  The taste was strong for a couple of hours and lingered for about another hour.  Believe me I learned my lesson right then.  I chewed my fingernails for 40 years!  This was about 6 weeks ago and I haven&#x27;t this nasty stuff once since that first encounter.  Fingernails look great and that touch of nervousness that accompanies the compulsive chewing has gone away.  I would recommend this to anyone with this problem!</li>
            <li> Tastes like crap...works pretty good! 👍😜</li>
            <li> love it, 3 of my 4 kids have a problem with this (our 4th is only a month old)</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. No more nail biting after the first time using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;ve been putting it on my 2 yr olds fingers. His nail biting is noticeably changed and its working. I would totally recommend this product for nail bitters and thumb suckers. Tge taste lingers to remind you just how much you don&#x27;t want your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Item received was exactly as described and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> 😬this stuff tastes nasty!!!! It seems to last awhile too. My daughter is quickly breaking the habit of chewing off her cuticles!!!! She forgets and puts her finger In her mouth and wham!!!!!!! It bites her back!!!!!!! Immediately ... Very bitter from what she says .... Like chewing up an Advil only worse.....she has to go get a drink. So yeah, it&#x27;s effective punishment for a bad habit like chewing your cuticles.</li>
            <li> The flavor is awful.  It is great for quitting biting your nails, but it also gets in your mouth about a hundred times a day when you are eating finger food, washing your face, putting on makeup, simply existing, etc.  Then you end up wiping your tongue on the nearest thing to get the taste off, causing everyone around you to find you much stranger than if you were just biting your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is very effective.  It stays on your nails much longer than the package says, so it is rather economical, and you cannot get past the flavor to bite your nails even if you try.  However, because it constantly gets in your mouth, I would not recommend it for thumb-sucking children.  They will get it in their mouths while eating finger food and be deterred from eating altogether.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Definitely tastes bad -- didn&#x27;t see my sons chewing their nails in church as they typically do. Has the unexpected problem/benefit of making the eating of finger foods challenging -- you don&#x27;t want your food or your lips to touch those nails! But I&#x27;m thinking of using it on my 8 year old to get him to use his utensils and stop eating with his hands!&lt;br /&gt;I still need to check back and see if it&#x27;s worn off after 5 days though, or if it&#x27;s time to reapply.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely disgusting. AND IT&#x27;S AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;Im 25 years old and I&#x27;ve have a nail biting habit since I can remember.. and finally I found something that works. I wear this over my nail polish and top coat(after my nails have dried). And it doesnt ruin the polish or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to apply a coat twice daily... but one coat every couple days still works to repel my fingers from my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS FOR DISGUSTING TASTE!!:)</li>
            <li> It worked on stopping my 8 year old grand daughter from sucking her thumb with just a few application.  Also her mother put it on the 5 year old&#x27;s Boogar picking finger to stop her from picking her nose and eating her boogars.  It worked!!!!</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t LIKE it, but thats the point, taste bad so keep fingers out of mouth</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I put it on the moment I received it in the mail and I can assure you, I will be kicking the nail biting habit because the taste is horrific.  Which is exactly what I was hoping for.  The seller was great and offered exceptional customer service!!  I am sure to be a repeat customer.  :)</li>
            <li> It keeps my 8 yr thumbs out of his mouth...but we still have to use it every once in a while....</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes terrible, which is the whole point.  I found it does not wear off for a week with regular washing and God forbid you do put your hand to your mouth and it gets on your lips, it stays there too.  If you want to train yourself to stop biting your nails, use this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works. It tastes and smells atrocious, but the nails look better, so it works.</li>
            <li> Hate the taste, wow does it do the job.  Not chewing my nails anymore!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to apply this twice daily like it says. I applied a quick coat of this as soon as I got it and the taste is STILL there, even after two days. And it&#x27;s not a soft &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; taste. It tastes like utter death and it lingers on your lips/in your mouth, which is exactly what I need. It really made me realize how often I have my hands near my mouth. I&#x27;d be careful if you have to make food with your hands, though. The taste does &amp;#34;spread&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Guys this stuff is amazing. I have been a nail biter from childhood and figured I would always bite my nails. I didn&#x27;t think any &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; would defer me. Attached are pictures from April 7th 2012 and April 22, 2012. First time I ever have had nails!!!!! I have been using this product since then and I admit, sometimes I forget to apply it and bite my nails again. But, as soon as I begin to apply it daily/every other day for a few weeks my nails will grow back again! It does taste terrible and you may taste it slightly while eating finger foods right after application. But the benefits are far better than the setbacks. Looks just like clear coat nail polish as you can see from the pictures. I wish I had found this product sooner. I bought it at Walmart for about 3.99. I highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Nasty stuff,, got this to get our little kids to quit chewing on computer headphone cords at our school!  But when Opened the package it shipped in I immediately knew from the smell the contents were toxic and not for small children to EVER taste!!!  The number one component in this stuff is acetone!!! Deadly stuff and toxic to all who might taste it,,,,so, no, we are looking for child friendly to help our kids stop chewing on stuff</li>
            <li> It works,  although is not necessary to use it twice a day , and after a while even if you don&#x27;t use it any more you still have the bitterness flavor in your nails.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about using it is that you can&#x27;t eat food with your fingers or cook, it gets the bitter from your nails so if you want to cook you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> My 3yo son just licked his nails and said, &amp;#34;yum.&amp;#34;  Didn&#x27;t really see any behavioral changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and have always bitten my nails. None of the other polishes tasted bad enough to stop. This stuff is horrid and lasts 3-4 days. I also like that its strong enough that I notice when I try to bite my nails without thinking about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is it can rub off on whatever your eating/preparing with your hands.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  It really does work.  I finally got tired of seeing my 7 year old daughter chew her nails.  So I asked around to my friends on what I should use and they recommended this product.  I ordered it immediately and after just a week I can see nail growing.  I am so happy.  The package recommends that you a coat on two times a day for three months. I am a busy mom, so I typically only put one coat on a day and it still works.</li>
            <li> this worked the first time I used it with my 2 year old. The taste is REALLY bitter...so much so that it make you want to scrape your tongue. My daughter immediately learned after trying to suck her thumb twice that it wasn&#x27;t a good idea anymore and I can personally say for my child it worked in breaking the thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> Definitely works but gets on everything so be prepared.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have used that really works for me. I waited to give my review to see how successful it would really be of breaking me of my habit. Its been over a month now and I have only bitten my nails a handful of times if that and when I have, I have noticed and either stopped immediately or noticed before even fully biting down (this is even without it applied). The taste is bad... and I really do mean sit in your mouth, stay on your lips, linger on your tongue bad. Be careful if you&#x27;re eating food with your hands as it can in fact even get on the food. However, if you want a product that can get the job done, look no further.</li>
            <li> My kids have fingernails! Who knew?!  In all seriousness, my two younger kids (9 and 6) bite their fingernails down to nothing, and it looks awful!  My 9-year-old was also still sucking his thumb.  This stuff works great!  After only 3 weeks, he has stopped sucking his thumb and both of my younger children have fingernails!  I did not use it every day, because no matter how often they washed their hands (and I make them do that a lot!), it did not wear off easily.  The next day I could still see the sheen on their nails, and by the way, the taste is truly awful!  I accidentally got some on my finger and did not realize it.  The next day, after numerous hand washes, I licked sour cream off my finger and that taste stayed in my mouth for several minutes.  It is truly hideous, but effective.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has or is a nail biter or thumbsucker.</li>
            <li> works. but it gets all over your food. make sure to eat everything with a fork</li>
            <li> I have always bite my nails...for the last three weeks I haven&#x27;t because of this polish it is the best!</li>
