            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>They were very nice about making suggestions that were cheaper than the things they sold at their shop.</li>
            <li>The smell is also excellent, it doesnt smell like the tequila-frito chips after smell most tanning lotions make you have after you&#x27;ve gone in a bed.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, smells good, just doesn&#x27;t tingle at all.</li>
            <li>A really good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Good product for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li>I have used many tanning lotions over the years, but have come to the conclusion that this one if not the BEST lotion I&#x27;ve used!! :)</li>
            <li>Great price for a great product, along with free samples.  </li>
            <li>Bombshell is the bomb, you get a great tan with this lotion, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the fact that my daughter no longer can tell by the way I smell whether or not I went to the tanning bed after work... just an added bonus!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>You do get that rose after color, and warming sensation as with all tingles.</li>
            <li>Have my own tanning bed and salons over price all their lotions, along with everything else.  </li>
            <li>I am an experienced tanner, and according to the tanning advisory label \\&quot;Experienced tanners only!\\&quot; This product will show you an instant result, however, once the accelerator wears off so does the color.</li>
            <li>Ok, then she said, \\&quot;well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a burn then a tingle, but don&#x27;t scratch it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never tried touching it before bathing because I kept wanting to scratch it.</li>
            <li>what more can be said?  </li>
            <li>All in all I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>where I apply the most)</li>
            <li>Also, for anyone worried about trying tingle lotions, this one is not bad!!</li>
            <li>I have always been told and read that if you leave it on it tans you more.</li>
            <li>I love Bombshell and always have a bottle around.</li>
            <li>have been using this forever, love it</li>
            <li>If you want a great tingle and color in one tanning session use plenty of lotion and you will look really tanned.</li>
            <li>She has tried many lotions and this one is wrapped around her....body.... :-)</li>
            <li>The thing that I love most is there&#x27;s no after tan smell that you get from most bronzers</li>
            <li>I really do like this lotion, I love the smell &amp; it blends in very nicely.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it, the delivery was about what I expected and I love the product was so excited to get it again!</li>
            <li>For experienced tanners only, for sure.</li>
            <li>I tan farely easy</li>
            <li>I must have reached my plateau already, or it just wasn&#x27;t as strong as I need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product and would recommend it to anyone who tans rather regularly and wants a great tan with a tingle!</li>
            <li>Since buying my own bed that was the first product I ordered.</li>
            <li>It must leave your skin smooth</li>
            <li>Once you get it on, the smell mellows and is not so loud and smells good.</li>
            <li>keep in mind rub in really good, other wise it will streak and make sure you spray and or wash your hands and wipe dry before it goes in, otherwise it will streak :)</li>
            <li>There are much better accelerators that I have used that are a far better product.</li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;m male 45 and own my own tanning bed</li>
            <li>but I wanted something more intense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought a packet of it rather than a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I suggest buying a packet to see if it works on you rather then spending more money on a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>but this is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for someone with a good base tan and likes to feel the tingle/burn.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice red/brown color for several hours after tanning</li>
            <li>I have used my fair share of tanning lotions, tried many different brands, and end up always coming back to this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have always tanned in a salon up until recently when I purchased my own tanning bed.</li>
            <li>&amp; I could see the results right away.</li>
            <li>so I always take a shower right out of the bed.</li>
            <li>But sure enough and true to it&#x27;s word, I was darker on my legs and evened out my tan.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product many times on Amzon and have been very pleased, but this time I feel like the lotion may have been old, or watered down...</li>
            <li>I originally bought pink diamond which was a greater starter lotion</li>
            <li>I first opened the bottle I was worried about the smell.  </li>
            <li>Now that I can use it on a regular basis I love it.</li>
            <li>Does have a tingle factor.you need to be aware of.</li>
            <li>I love it because you get instant color.  </li>
            <li>have a tanning bed and have used many different lotions but have never kept the bronzer look like I have with this one.  </li>
            <li>Mom is an avid tanner...has been for years.</li>
            <li>Tanning Lotion 100XX is the first tingle lotion I have tried,</li>
            <li>It made me much darker right after I got out of the bed.</li>
            <li>The extreme tingle factor works amazing , it&#x27;s extremely hot but makes your skin tan faster.</li>
            <li>The stuff is a classic!</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high tolerance for pain and my skin is not sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I asked the staff and they said because skin circulation is so a kin to oxygen in your skin that binds with stuff in your cells to cause the pigment change, they said I would notice places that didn&#x27;t get as much oxygen</li>
            <li>I had previously tried a different tingle lotion, and had read great reviews of this particular lotion so decided to order.</li>
            <li>After about 3-4 minutes you really feel it.  </li>
            <li>The sizzling sensation makes you really feel it working.</li>
            <li>It was like a slight burning sensation but more like an itching sensation.</li>
            <li>My first time using it, I did get a little tingly and warm, but by the next day when I went to tan again, it wasnt bothering me anymore, and I have naturally verrrrrry sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>I just started using tingle lotions after a customer of mine had developed her tan much quicker than mine &amp; recommended I try tingle lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a great tingle factor (which I love) that isn&#x27;t painful and doesn&#x27;t turn me too red.</li>
            <li>and yes it was completely normal.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, and have even mixed this with the Snooki Black Bronzing ((sold on Amazon), and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>If you can handle the tingle, this will take your tan to a new level.</li>
            <li>Now being new to it, my skin didn&#x27;t tingle at all.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions and I get the best tan from this one,all you have to do is spread it thinly and you won&#x27;t get a bad tingle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tingler lotions before and this one, by far, is the strongest.</li>
            <li>but my tanned parts I don&#x27;t notice the red as much</li>
            <li>This product keeps me looking dark and bronzed, I love this look and it keeps for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>results for using this product only a few times is pretty amazing, and I believe I have already gotten a little darker.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was having an allergic reaction, lol, so I researched if it was normal to burn and itch that bad</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion to those who tan regularly, if you can bare some burning and itching sensation for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>but it would get my legs dark if I was willing to endure the burn.</li>
            <li>I do notice the less tanned parts of my body (Near arm pit) gets pretty red</li>
            <li>She said it wasn&#x27;t as intense as other products</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice being a tiny bit darker but nothing major.</li>
            <li>I had a nice base before using this lotion, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this right when you start tanning.</li>
            <li>I thought that it would get better with each time of use, however, I have used almost half the bottle and still not satisfied.</li>
            <li>The tingle was much less intense</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The tingle was much less intense</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tingles &amp; the last tingle I used was a few days ago &amp; that was Ruby by DS.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; brings instant color to the surface, and you literally look like you have been at the beach or pool laying out for 5 hours, in only the 12-15 minutes you spent in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had expected since the company was within my state that I would receive my package at the earliest possible date.</li>
            <li> pretty bad right</li>
            <li> I wanted something to stimulate my skin to tan darker, especially in the areas I tan less, which is my upper chest, neck, and tops of my arms.</li>
            <li> I had a strong base tan before using this product, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference from using it, so</li>
            <li> I had used bombshell before every once and a while and never really noticed how well it worked...</li>
            <li> Not really my thing.  </li>
            <li> Really not for beginners or for people who do not like the tingle.</li>
            <li> I had Designer skin spellbound but noticed that my legs never tanned as dark as say my arms did.</li>
            <li> and once I start I continue to get dark.</li>
            <li> Hardley any burn and not as dark of a tan.</li>
            <li> You either love the tingle factor or hate it.  </li>
            <li> but I find it only last about 20-30 min after applying the product and its really not that bad certainly not enough burning to make me want to take the stuff off</li>
            <li> The other lotions have been a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I have a distaste for strong scents usually, this lotion smells slightly of spiced watermelon and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad after tan scent.</li>
            <li> &amp; i always go a little lighter on my neck area</li>
            <li> I have never had trouble getting a tan, but this lotion has taken me beyond any tan I&#x27;ve ever gotten, in less time!</li>
            <li> It gets less and less irritating after time.</li>
            <li> My color never looked fake, and I actually was mistaken for being Hispanic twice!</li>
            <li> For me at least.</li>
            <li> Not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but wear gloves when putting it on or wash your hands right away or you&#x27;ll notice that the skin between your fingers begins to itch really bad.</li>
            <li> It hurts way worse.</li>
            <li> Wash your hands after tanning because it might be irritating to your face.</li>

            <li> This product was also suggested by the tannig staff at the salon I went to. They were very nice about making suggestions that were cheaper than the things they sold at their shop. I was having problems tanning my legs. I had Designer skin spellbound but noticed that my legs never tanned as dark as say my arms did. I asked the staff and they said because skin circulation is so a kin to oxygen in your skin that binds with stuff in your cells to cause the pigment change, they said I would notice places that didn&#x27;t get as much oxygen wouldn&#x27;t tan so well. They said this product \\&quot;tingles\\&quot; to oxygenate your skin. Ok, then she said, \\&quot;well it&#x27;s more of a burn then a tingle, but don&#x27;t scratch it\\&quot;. She said it wasn&#x27;t as intense as other products but it would get my legs dark if I was willing to endure the burn. Of course, I did. Ouch. Not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but wear gloves when putting it on or wash your hands right away or you&#x27;ll notice that the skin between your fingers begins to itch really bad. It was like a slight burning sensation but more like an itching sensation. I did get red. But sure enough and true to it&#x27;s word, I was darker on my legs and evened out my tan. It must leave your skin smooth but I&#x27;ve never tried touching it before bathing because I kept wanting to scratch it. It does smell kinda yucky though. I thought they could have made it smell fruity or something. Not for beginers!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for quite some time and had never used a tingle lotion before. I wanted something to stimulate my skin to tan darker, especially in the areas I tan less, which is my upper chest, neck, and tops of my arms. I have an addiction of buying tanning lotions so I thought I would give this a try. It made me much darker right after I got out of the bed. It started to burn and itch pretty bad right when I got out of the bed. I thought I was having an allergic reaction, lol, so I researched if it was normal to burn and itch that bad and yes it was completely normal. It gets less and less irritating after time. Within 10 minutes the itching and heat from the skin decreases but leaves the color. It&#x27;s excellent. I would highly recommend this lotion to those who tan regularly, if you can bare some burning and itching sensation for 10 minutes. Do not itch! It hurts way worse. This lotion is not for beginners!</li>
            <li> Used this lotion the same day I received it and saw instant results!! LOVE IT!! Just got to get used to the \\&quot;tingling\\&quot;/slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Bombshell...what more can be said?  Oh the fact it has white tea extract soy and CoQ-10.  The stuff is a classic!</li>
            <li> Got my lotion on time and the product itself was just what I was looking for ! The extreme tingle factor works amazing , it&#x27;s extremely hot but makes your skin tan faster.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a different tingle lotion, and had read great reviews of this particular lotion so decided to order. I had expected since the company was within my state that I would receive my package at the earliest possible date. It arrived a bit later then when I actually needed it, but it was packaged well and within the date range they quoted. I had a strong base tan before using this product, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference from using it, so I must have reached my plateau already, or it just wasn&#x27;t as strong as I need. The tingle was much less intense then I had anticipated. You do get that rose after color, and warming sensation as with all tingles. I have a distaste for strong scents usually, this lotion smells slightly of spiced watermelon and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad after tan scent. All in all I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I just started using tingle lotions after a customer of mine had developed her tan much quicker than mine &amp; recommended I try tingle lotion. I originally bought pink diamond which was a greater starter lotion but I wanted something more intense. A girl at my tanning salon recommended this &amp; I could see the results right away. The other lotions have been a waste of time. I had a nice base before using this lotion, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this right when you start tanning. If you can handle the tingle, this will take your tan to a new level. Definitely do not use on your face or butt... and if you don&#x27;t like tingling don&#x27;t try this. I can feel the tingle on my legs sometimes up to 2 hours after tanning (thats where I apply the most) &amp; i always go a little lighter on my neck area but this is by far my favorite lotion. Plus I love the fact that my daughter no longer can tell by the way I smell whether or not I went to the tanning bed after work... just an added bonus!</li>
            <li> This is not for a beginner in the tingle tanning lotion world.  It is perfect for someone with a good base tan and likes to feel the tingle/burn.  I use it in a stand up 12 minute bed.  After about 3-4 minutes you really feel it.  Leaves a nice red/brown color for several hours after tanning and then it goes into a deep tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bottle I was worried about the smell.  Once you get it on, the smell mellows and is not so loud and smells good.</li>
            <li> A really good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> The product came 2 days after I ordered it. Very impressed with that. Once I&#x27;ve used it, I noticed instant results! This has given me a great tan! For experienced tanners only, for sure. I&#x27;ve used tingler lotions before and this one, by far, is the strongest. I&#x27;m in love with this product and would recommend it to anyone who tans rather regularly and wants a great tan with a tingle!</li>
            <li> I have used my fair share of tanning lotions, tried many different brands, and end up always coming back to this lotion. I am very happy with it, the delivery was about what I expected and I love the product was so excited to get it again! If you like tingle lotion this is one of the very best!</li>
            <li> I have gotten my best tan from this lotion!! I have never had trouble getting a tan, but this lotion has taken me beyond any tan I&#x27;ve ever gotten, in less time! My color never looked fake, and I actually was mistaken for being Hispanic twice! The smell is also excellent, it doesnt smell like the tequila-frito chips after smell most tanning lotions make you have after you&#x27;ve gone in a bed. LOL. Definitely recommend it. Also, for anyone worried about trying tingle lotions, this one is not bad!! My first time using it, I did get a little tingly and warm, but by the next day when I went to tan again, it wasnt bothering me anymore, and I have naturally verrrrrry sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> I really do like this lotion, I love the smell &amp; it blends in very nicely. The bronzer in it isn&#x27;t orange or streaky &amp; you don&#x27;t get that after tan smell. I&#x27;m glad I bought a packet of it rather than a whole bottle. I&#x27;m new to tingles &amp; the last tingle I used was a few days ago &amp; that was Ruby by DS. Now being new to it, my skin didn&#x27;t tingle at all. It didn&#x27;t even get red, just a tiny bit on my feet, otherwise nothing. I read the reviews on it &amp; a lot of people said it worked great but I felt nothing. I didn&#x27;t notice being a tiny bit darker but nothing major. Great lotion, smells good, just doesn&#x27;t tingle at all. For me at least. I suggest buying a packet to see if it works on you rather then spending more money on a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I have always tanned in a salon up until recently when I purchased my own tanning bed. I had used bombshell before every once and a while and never really noticed how well it worked... probably because I didn&#x27;t use it very regular. Since buying my own bed that was the first product I ordered. Now that I can use it on a regular basis I love it. It has a great tingle factor (which I love) that isn&#x27;t painful and doesn&#x27;t turn me too red. I do not however like the after smell of any tanning lotions so I always take a shower right out of the bed. I have always been told and read that if you leave it on it tans you more. Not really my thing.  But Bombshell works wondreful. I tan farely easy and once I start I continue to get dark. I love Bombshell and always have a bottle around. For me Bombshell gives me the results that I want!</li>
            <li> Good product for indoor tanning. Does have a tingle factor.you need to be aware of. Wash your hands after tanning because it might be irritating to your face.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The sizzling sensation makes you really feel it working. It leaves you with a great tan!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times on Amzon and have been very pleased, but this time I feel like the lotion may have been old, or watered down... Normaly I would get an intence burning feeling after application but not with the bottle I received this time. Hardley any burn and not as dark of a tan.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion that I rotate tans with.  Gives off a beautiful color and does not have that &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; smell!</li>
            <li> You either love the tingle factor or hate it.  I love it because you get instant color.  The &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; brings instant color to the surface, and you literally look like you have been at the beach or pool laying out for 5 hours, in only the 12-15 minutes you spent in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and have even mixed this with the Snooki Black Bronzing ((sold on Amazon), and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is not a recommendation from myself. I am an experienced tanner, and according to the tanning advisory label \\&quot;Experienced tanners only!\\&quot; This product will show you an instant result, however, once the accelerator wears off so does the color. I thought that it would get better with each time of use, however, I have used almost half the bottle and still not satisfied. There are much better accelerators that I have used that are a far better product. I would only recommend this product if you are looking to have a fast immediate glow for a few hours only.</li>
            <li> have been using this forever, love it</li>
            <li> I Love this product!!!!  I have used many tanning lotions over the years, but have come to the conclusion that this one if not the BEST lotion I&#x27;ve used!! :)&lt;br /&gt;I have a tanning bed and have used many different lotions but have never kept the bronzer look like I have with this one.  This product keeps me looking dark and bronzed, I love this look and it keeps for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind rub in really good, other wise it will streak and make sure you spray and or wash your hands and wipe dry before it goes in, otherwise it will streak :)&lt;br /&gt;However this happens alot with bronzers.</li>
            <li> Bombshell is the bomb, you get a great tan with this lotion, this one is my favorite. You must like a tingle lotion to use this one. I have tried many lotions and I get the best tan from this one,all you have to do is spread it thinly and you won&#x27;t get a bad tingle. If you want a great tingle and color in one tanning session use plenty of lotion and you will look really tanned.Do not start with this lotion.</li>
            <li> My tanning had hit a plateau, and this product kicked it into gear.  I definitely has a tingle that will last 15-20 minutes after tanning, and your skin will stay red for hours, so don&#x27;t panic.</li>
            <li> Mom is an avid tanner...has been for years. She has tried many lotions and this one is wrapped around her....body.... :-)</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m male 45 and own my own tanning bed, I have been tanning for several months now and while I have a great base tan I reached a plateau. Designer Skin Bombshell Tanning Lotion 100XX is the first tingle lotion I have tried, The thing that I love most is there&#x27;s no after tan smell that you get from most bronzers and I leave this stuff on for hours after tanning. Now for the tingle does it tingle yes but I find it only last about 20-30 min after applying the product and its really not that bad certainly not enough burning to make me want to take the stuff off and yes I even apply it to my face, I would not recommend using it on your face (product even says not recommend for face) but I have no issues with it, after all if I always did what was recommend I would not be tanning to begin with,  I have a pretty high tolerance for pain and my skin is not sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results for using this product only a few times is pretty amazing, and I believe I have already gotten a little darker.  I do notice the less tanned parts of my body (Near arm pit) gets pretty red but my tanned parts I don&#x27;t notice the red as much, The red disappears in under 2 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is defiantly not a product for beginner&#x27;s, but if you have been tanning for awhile and your looking to get darker I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have my own tanning bed and salons over price all their lotions, along with everything else.  Synergy, Designer Skin are both excellent products and the bronzing is great!  Great price for a great product, along with free samples.  Arrived on time and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love it!!!!!!!!! Really not for beginners or for people who do not like the tingle. Cause it has plenty of that!!!!!!</li>
