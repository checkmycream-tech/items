            <li>they were in great shape.</li>

            <li>These are a great substitute for floss.</li>
            <li>so was happy to find them on line.</li>
            <li>Great to use when not flossing.</li>
            <li>These are great for getting food out from between my teeth and cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>so I had to get more!!</li>
            <li>Very effective if one does not like to floss, as recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>these were recommended by my dentist years ago and they are one of the best tools for protecting my gums and teeth from tartar buildup and keeping my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to get a good price on these.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great being able to buy them in bulk on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Great quality product at a super great price!!</li>
            <li>Very good price for so many that are encluded.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Delighted to find them again and will continue to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good for your Thoth health</li>
            <li>The quality of the product has diminished over 30 years, but still good.</li>
            <li>and I have a good supply now for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Good for gums.</li>
            <li>My check-ups are always good.</li>
            <li>Good Price.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I am at it, J&amp;J unwaxed floss is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Its made in China by the Nature Dentist (the picture is faithful, to be fair).</li>
            <li>I loved my sample pack</li>
            <li>They were just what I was used to using and at a good price.</li>
            <li>But the shape and size are perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse and very useful.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist always compliments me on how great my gums are, and I&#x27;m sure these are part of the reason.</li>
            <li>J&amp;J is a great company and I use many of their products.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly, between your teeth right at the gum line.</li>
            <li>The porous wood makes them perfect for  economical application of hygiene products at the gumline, where antiseptics do the most good.</li>
            <li>Works much better than a toothpick for me!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>However, the one problem I have experienced with it is the tip breaks off too easily.</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth nice after meals without having to brush.</li>
            <li>Toothpicks break and splinter  while these picks, once moistened by your own saliva before using, don&#x27;t come apart.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure these softer sticks will be great for many people.</li>
            <li>The product is effective - does the job just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>They have been around forever, and are just as handy today as they were 50 years ago.</li>
            <li>Stim-U-Dents are great for massaging the gums and keeping the teeth clean between brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li>A great toothpick and the supplier provided wonderful service and the tooth picks are just what I ordered and expected.</li>
            <li>Great Price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>and I still find them to be a worthwhile aid in maintaining good oral hygiene and healthy gums.</li>
            <li>This product breaks very easily.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and have found it to be most effective.</li>
            <li>Best soft toothpicks.</li>
            <li>These toothpicks are the most effective tool I&#x27;ve found for cleaning all the hard-to-reach places on the teeth without damage.  </li>
            <li>but I have not found a suitable substitute, so I will continue to buy on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>These are not as good as the original Johnson &amp; Johnson brand.  </li>
            <li>Much better feel and more effective for cleaning.</li>
            <li>Good quality, helps clean your teeth at the gum line.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t stop using them, as my dentist says they&#x27;re doing a great job of keeping my teeth and gums healthy, but I wish they could be more consistent with their manufacturing.</li>
            <li>we have not been able to find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The toothpick is more splintered and not as finished.</li>
            <li>Still better than &#x27;no Stim-U-Dents&#x27;</li>
            <li>Love the item.</li>
            <li>Best dental checks ever since beginning to use this product several years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the best oral health product imaginable.</li>
            <li>Each time I go in for cleaning, they RAVE about how healthy my gums are, and how little-to-no plaque I have.</li>
            <li>I love the J &amp; J stimudent product and could not find them in any retail store as I always had.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>then you will love these.  </li>
            <li>But they work like a toothpick but better.</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;:)]  As part of oral health they cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>I love this product and they came as promised</li>
            <li>And then the price turns out to more than what you pay in the store.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find this product.  </li>
            <li>do a better job for me than dental floss because they massage the gums.</li>
            <li>Using these for many years now.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to buy at store or drug store; so glad that we can get them on line.</li>
            <li>Been using these for years, help keep my teeth healthy and plaque free.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I have been using J &amp; J Stim-U-Dent for many years.</li>
            <li>However, using Stim-U-Dent is probably the next best thing to flossing, IMO.</li>
            <li>These are much better than tooth picks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for many many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can still get them via Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have to keep reminding myself that Amazon has so much more.</li>
            <li>My father-in-law introduced them to me 25 years ago (or more)</li>
            <li>My husband and I use these plaque removers daily - great tool for good dental health.</li>
            <li>They have a refreshing taste.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dentist, and received a free sample, after trying it [and finishing the box], I decided to continues using it, thus the purchase!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just using more of them.  </li>
            <li>So glad I was able to still get these.</li>
            <li>a real find for a great price.</li>
            <li>I have used Stim-U-Dents for many years.  </li>
            <li>the wood  was softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li>What  more must I to do to bring this to a satisfactory resolution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so glad to have found them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I used the Johnson&amp;Johnson unflavored Stim-U-Dents for many years.  </li>
            <li>BTW, they are wonderful for getting out bits of food stuck in tiny spaces between teeth along gum line.  </li>
            <li>Also stimulates and keeps gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>When my gums get tender, all I have to do is use these twice or three times over as many days to toughen them up.</li>
            <li>PRICE on Amazon was outstanding.</li>
            <li>Keep my gums in tip top shape</li>
            <li>Always work well, much better than toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Not a complete substitute for floss, but the best I know in conjunction with my WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>In fact we have pretty good looking teeth.</li>
            <li>Have used stim-u-dents very successfully for long time.</li>
            <li>Clean your teeth under the gum line after brushing and flossing, keep your teeth, take care of them!  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist that I trace the gum line and clean between my teeth (without forcing!)</li>
            <li>I wished more stores carried stim-u-dents because I have gaps in some of my back teeth that they do a real good job of cleaning quickly.</li>
            <li>I just love this product ,its easy on the gums cleans teeth well ,and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>A great toothpick made of soft wood.</li>
            <li>The review by the dentist who claimed that these plaque removers splinter and become too soft to use after moistening might have been experienced by some users, but never by me, and I&#x27;ve used them for years.  </li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It bends way to easily.</li>
            <li>Using Stim-U-Dents is easy and they work.</li>
            <li>We have always used the stim-u-dents because they are  easy on gums but still do the job.  </li>
            <li>They break way to easily and tend to splinter.  </li>
            <li>NO LONGER SEEMS AS STRONG AS IT USED TO BE.  </li>
            <li>The Stimudent picks are fine for their sturdiness and construction, but I did NOT want MINT flavored picks.  </li>
            <li>This product is becoming more rare in stores.  </li>
            <li>But they will do a fine job.</li>
            <li>Another company bought them from Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the quality of the Stim-u-dents has degraded as they are now not so finely made.</li>
            <li>Great hard-to-find locally product.</li>
            <li>It was helpful to have these available in bulk.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use, and equally effective.  </li>
            <li>Remove food particles better than toothpicks, contribute to health of the gum, and leave a person&#x27;s breath reasonably fresh.</li>
            <li>Packets fit well in pockets, purses, cars, etc.</li>
            <li>This is the second time ordering this product and they are great.</li>
            <li>soft on gums and good product</li>
            <li>Originally got from my dentist a year or so ago...</li>
            <li>If there is a class action suit happening I will be very glad to put my name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my gums do not bleed because they are pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to find some that are like the original product.</li>
            <li>the new manufacturer will get production right and make the Stim-U-Dent as good as Johnson &amp; Johnson did.</li>
            <li>Leaves your teeth clean and feeling like you came out of the dentist office.</li>
            <li>They break before I can finish using them to clean all of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Clean teeth...</li>
            <li>They are made of a soft wood but stand up nicely to being wedged in between one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used these for more than a decade, and it really helps remove food from in between the gums until you can floss.</li>
            <li>Amazon and was pleased to find them, in quantity, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old and still have all my own teeth (with a couple of crowns from before I used Stim-U-Dents).</li>
            <li>I credit this product with the good oral health I am experiencing, along with brushing daily of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The current product is not quite as good as when they were made by Johnson &amp; Johnson.  </li>
            <li>These are so easy to use and really help my gums!</li>
            <li>After I use them, my teeth feel really clean and my breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally - WAY better than floss</li>
            <li>The product i super</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, works as advetised.</li>
            <li>While I am sure I paid a little more for them, I was glad to find them, because I like them.</li>
            <li>They are good to use when not near a toothbrush and work quite well.</li>
            <li>New mfg. is OK..</li>
            <li>My dentist highly recommended these!!!</li>
            <li>Product is hard to get and I was glad to be able to get so many.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but difficult to find in pharmacies; ordering direct is great</li>
            <li>These are knock off copy&#x27;s of the real deal with 100% counter fit packaging.</li>
            <li>Poor Africans almost always have perfect teeth.  </li>
            <li>Eversince i have used them the check up at the dentist office has been a success.</li>
            <li>Good product for the money spent.</li>
            <li>I have been using stimudents for many years and a marked improvement in the health of my gums has occured.</li>
            <li>But they are still worth buying.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>I guess it serves me right to try and save money...</li>
            <li>As I said earlier I would still get this product since I don&#x27;t know of a suitable alternative.</li>
            <li>You know, the kind of thing that just annoys you all day long.  </li>
            <li>Stim-U-Dents, an old and true plaque remover and easy/fast to order thru Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as thick as a toothpick, and does a great job cleaning with a fresh taste of mint in your mouth afterwards.</li>
            <li>Because these are not the original Johnson &amp; Johnson Stim U Dent, I have discovered that if you &#x27;do not&#x27; moisten them before use, a single pick will last all the way through your teeth rather than having to use two or even three because they break so easily.&lt;br /&gt;Still a great idea, and they really do work.</li>
            <li>Delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>noticed wood is not same, but they are much better than toothpicks.</li>
            <li>If you love popcorn and all kinds of nuts, these are essential.</li>
            <li>i love these wooden sticks and use them all the time.  </li>
            <li>Love these and for the last year couldn&#x27;t find them in any drugstore, Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li>My dentist is always amazed at how healthy my teeth are, and equally amazed that I don&#x27;t \\&quot;floss.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these wooden picks for many years, since they were first manufactured here in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>and they are much better for your gums than regular toothpicks.  </li>
            <li>These regular size ones work much better for me.</li>
            <li>Why is it that every time i find something I really like, its always pulled off the shelves at the stores?!</li>
            <li>Love them!&lt;br /&gt;Could only find here!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these dental picks for several years, and really love them.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and ordered.</li>
            <li>quickly exactly as i wanted.  </li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE &amp;#34;ORIGINAL&amp;#34; (TOO THICK), BUT THE &amp;#34;THIN&amp;#34; ARE GREAT.</li>
            <li>The price was much better than I found in my local stores.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use Stimudents differently than most of you.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is the use of stimudents on a daily basis returned my gums to a healthy state, no surgery needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>They are the only gum stimulants that keep my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and Seller shiped quickly.</li>
            <li>The Stim-U-Dent from &amp;#34;The Natural Dentist&amp;#34; is identical to the original</li>
            <li>loved, bought from various local merchants.</li>
            <li>Good for those who can&#x27;t use dental floss, such as with permanent bridges (an alternate to floss).</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t break as easy and it won&#x27;t damage your gums because it becomes pliable and soft and the fibers on the end will clean better like a small brush.</li>
            <li>They have a subtle triangular shape that fits perfectly and provide gum massage or can act as a toothpick if necessary.</li>
            <li>The balsa wood doesn&#x27;t splinter, and is just soft enough to compress a bit as you push them in, giving you a light friction against the tooth surface and polishing it clean.  </li>
            <li>I certainly do know that</li>
            <li>It is some kind of chemical that just tastes a little like mint.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Found out Johnson &amp; Johnson sold product line to someone and are now made in China...seems only available thru mail order.</li>
            <li>was fast, as ordered, etc.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.......................</li>
            <li>The last technician I saw said to me, in a genuinely astonished tone of voice, \\&quot;Whatever</li>
            <li>you are doing, it really works!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product I can save my flossing for night time.</li>
            <li>I was very dependent upon them for day time \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; between meals and ended up looking in every store I would go into - in the U.S. and abroad.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They have made my visits to the dentist a much nicer experience.</li>
            <li>Never had a splintering issue but even when the tip would break (too much pressure)</li>
            <li>Who would buy the synthetic cleaners made from plastic when you can buy these biodegradable ones, and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>but since I started using these everyday,my teeth and gums are much improved.</li>
            <li>Very prompt response after submitting my request.</li>
            <li>When I called the manufacturer regarding my dissatisfaction with the product the representative apologized for the product not meeting my expectation and sent me a free pack of 200 picks, which of course turned out to be of equally unsatisfactory quality.</li>
            <li>The originals that were made by Johnson &amp; Johnson were very well made.</li>
            <li>The Stem-U-Dent performs its intended purpose very well.  </li>
            <li>I do get cavities because I eat too much candy</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is so much simpler than flossing, which I never did.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The mint smells a little strong but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>These slender wedge-shaped balsa wood picks slide gently between the teeth and clean the sides of the teeth where otherwise only floss would reach.</li>
            <li>This knock off company needs to stop trying to fool the public into believing they are the original Johnson &amp; Johnson stim-u-dents.  </li>
            <li>Originally, when I started buying from Amazon, I was only ordering one type of product.</li>
            <li>I like them much better than other flossing aids I have tried.</li>
            <li>Apparently they are no longer made, and these Natural Dentist mint sticks are the closest thing available.  </li>
            <li>The tips on the Stim-U-Dents get soft very fast.  </li>
            <li>Unlike common toothpicks, these things are soft wood and wedge-shaped which makes them considerably more comfortable to insert between teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a great value, and are hard to find in our local stores.</li>
            <li>The product is now more brittle and not as uniform as previously.</li>
            <li>Toothpicks work much better for me, they have 2 usable ends and cost a ton less.  </li>
            <li>particularly if you don&#x27;t like flossing.  </li>
            <li>Really cheap because I had some loose teeth and bleeding gums</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had tight contacts and floss was not an option, and this does a better job.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I have used them for years, and my dentist is always amazed at how healthy my gums are and how little tartar I have between my teeth.</li>
            <li>When I was unable to find them at the store, I was happy to find this multi pack on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>These Plaque Removers work very well, and with 40 used so far, there have been no slivers.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I agree with other reviews I have seen about this product in that the Picks are very soft, they collapse very easily because they are very soft and as a result you need to use multiple picks to go through your whole mouth just once.  </li>
            <li>When I do this white sticky stuff comes off right on the Stimudent.  </li>
            <li>It is a great go-between because it easily slides between your teeth picking up debri and other food particles left behind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that they are no longer available in all supermarkets, drugstores, or other places</li>
            <li>I agree with some of the other reviews, the new version is not as strong as the old ones.  </li>
            <li>The flat side goes to the gum and you press it in between the teeth right at the gum line.  </li>
            <li>Also the wood is very soft now that China has their fingers in the pot.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be exactly the same as the Johnson and Johnson one although maybe made somewhere else now - it tastes minty too.</li>
            <li>Sadly, this was in fact true, but at the cost of the thickness being too large to fit between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love these things, there not as hard as toothpicks and seem to massage your gums while cleaning between teeth...</li>
            <li>These are so hard to find in stores any more.  </li>
            <li>Stim-u-dents tapered triangular shape and soft wood make them what toothpicks should have always been.</li>
            <li>I remember the old product</li>
            <li>These are soft as balsa, and flavored to boot.  </li>
            <li>All I can find locally is Natural Dentist Plaque Removers.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson Plaque Removers, but received Natural Dentist Plaque Removers.  </li>
            <li>I have to agree with everyone here who sees through these bogus stim-u-dents with the soft wood.</li>
            <li>Do NOT blast your teeth with a solution containing solid particles as that&#x27;s highly abrasive!</li>
            <li>As a dental professional I recommend these things to all of my patients.</li>
            <li>The quality has really deteriorated, but I could not find a close enough competitor brand/style.</li>
            <li>No MINT FLAVOR even box is marked as flavored sticks...</li>
            <li>My 91 year old loves these toothpicks - he has a pack by his recliner in the den, a pack in his car, a pack in his office, etc.  </li>
            <li>The ones sold by \\&quot;Natural Dentist\\&quot; are made is China.  </li>
            <li>No better tooth pick made easy on teath and gums.</li>
            <li>This is a simple and effective product and it saved me from serious oral surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>if they will still pass out the original J&amp;Js of which I have a few packs left.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fall apart before you can clean your teeth and do not fit between your teeth.</li>
            <li>However, based on my use of the current product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s exactly the same.</li>
            <li>It does take a little time but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>And I am always pleasantly surprised when I find the things here on Amazon that I can no longer find locally.</li>
            <li>I have been waiting patiently for the complete order of the product as noted above to be delivered to me.  </li>
            <li>The sticks are splintered and too thick to fit between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Use ONLY a clear solution with all the solid soda particles settled out.  </li>
            <li>Decent price and faster than expected delivery.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this product has diminished significantly over the past year, as the individual picks are narrower, much less sturdy and fracture readily.</li>
            <li>the packaging is harder to open - splintering is more common when peeling out a stick and the tip breaks off sooner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And while it does bear the ADA endorsement, few dentists I&#x27;ve known are aware of it.  </li>
            <li>While there is no substitute for flossing and brushing, after a meal when this is not possible these plaque removers are indispensable and much preferable to the hard, round toothpicks some restaurants offer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this useful product for quite some time, but it is now hard to come by in stores.  </li>
            <li>All was okay just a little slow getting here.</li>

            <li> they were in great shape.</li>

            <li> so was happy to find them on line.</li>
            <li> Great to use when not flossing.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting food out from between my teeth and cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> so I had to get more!!</li>
            <li> Very effective if one does not like to floss, as recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> these were recommended by my dentist years ago and they are one of the best tools for protecting my gums and teeth from tartar buildup and keeping my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to get a good price on these.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great being able to buy them in bulk on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great quality product at a super great price!!</li>
            <li> Very good price for so many that are encluded.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Delighted to find them again and will continue to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good for your Thoth health</li>
            <li> The quality of the product has diminished over 30 years, but still good.</li>
            <li> and I have a good supply now for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Good for gums.</li>
            <li> My check-ups are always good.</li>
            <li> Good Price.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am at it, J&amp;J unwaxed floss is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Its made in China by the Nature Dentist (the picture is faithful, to be fair).</li>
            <li> I loved my sample pack</li>
            <li> They were just what I was used to using and at a good price.</li>
            <li> But the shape and size are perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse and very useful.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist always compliments me on how great my gums are, and I&#x27;m sure these are part of the reason.</li>
            <li> J&amp;J is a great company and I use many of their products.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly, between your teeth right at the gum line.</li>
            <li> The porous wood makes them perfect for  economical application of hygiene products at the gumline, where antiseptics do the most good.</li>
            <li> Works much better than a toothpick for me!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> However, the one problem I have experienced with it is the tip breaks off too easily.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth nice after meals without having to brush.</li>
            <li> Toothpicks break and splinter  while these picks, once moistened by your own saliva before using, don&#x27;t come apart.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure these softer sticks will be great for many people.</li>
            <li> The product is effective - does the job just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> They have been around forever, and are just as handy today as they were 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> Stim-U-Dents are great for massaging the gums and keeping the teeth clean between brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li> A great toothpick and the supplier provided wonderful service and the tooth picks are just what I ordered and expected.</li>
            <li> Great Price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> and I still find them to be a worthwhile aid in maintaining good oral hygiene and healthy gums.</li>
            <li> This product breaks very easily.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have found it to be most effective.</li>
            <li> Best soft toothpicks.</li>
            <li> These toothpicks are the most effective tool I&#x27;ve found for cleaning all the hard-to-reach places on the teeth without damage.  </li>
            <li> but I have not found a suitable substitute, so I will continue to buy on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> These are not as good as the original Johnson &amp; Johnson brand.  </li>
            <li> Much better feel and more effective for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Good quality, helps clean your teeth at the gum line.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t stop using them, as my dentist says they&#x27;re doing a great job of keeping my teeth and gums healthy, but I wish they could be more consistent with their manufacturing.</li>
            <li> we have not been able to find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The toothpick is more splintered and not as finished.</li>
            <li> Still better than &#x27;no Stim-U-Dents&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love the item.</li>
            <li> Best dental checks ever since beginning to use this product several years ago.  </li>
            <li> This is simply the best oral health product imaginable.</li>
            <li> Each time I go in for cleaning, they RAVE about how healthy my gums are, and how little-to-no plaque I have.</li>
            <li> I love the J &amp; J stimudent product and could not find them in any retail store as I always had.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> then you will love these.  </li>
            <li> But they work like a toothpick but better.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;:)]  As part of oral health they cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> I love this product and they came as promised</li>
            <li> And then the price turns out to more than what you pay in the store.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to find this product.  </li>
            <li> do a better job for me than dental floss because they massage the gums.</li>
            <li> Using these for many years now.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to buy at store or drug store; so glad that we can get them on line.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years, help keep my teeth healthy and plaque free.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I have been using J &amp; J Stim-U-Dent for many years.</li>
            <li> However, using Stim-U-Dent is probably the next best thing to flossing, IMO.</li>
            <li> These are much better than tooth picks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for many many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can still get them via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have to keep reminding myself that Amazon has so much more.</li>
            <li> My father-in-law introduced them to me 25 years ago (or more)</li>
            <li> My husband and I use these plaque removers daily - great tool for good dental health.</li>
            <li> They have a refreshing taste.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist, and received a free sample, after trying it [and finishing the box], I decided to continues using it, thus the purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just using more of them.  </li>
            <li> So glad I was able to still get these.</li>
            <li> a real find for a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used Stim-U-Dents for many years.  </li>
            <li> the wood  was softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li> What  more must I to do to bring this to a satisfactory resolution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so glad to have found them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I used the Johnson&amp;Johnson unflavored Stim-U-Dents for many years.  </li>
            <li> BTW, they are wonderful for getting out bits of food stuck in tiny spaces between teeth along gum line.  </li>
            <li> Also stimulates and keeps gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> When my gums get tender, all I have to do is use these twice or three times over as many days to toughen them up.</li>
            <li> PRICE on Amazon was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Keep my gums in tip top shape</li>
            <li> Always work well, much better than toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Not a complete substitute for floss, but the best I know in conjunction with my WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> In fact we have pretty good looking teeth.</li>
            <li> Have used stim-u-dents very successfully for long time.</li>
            <li> Clean your teeth under the gum line after brushing and flossing, keep your teeth, take care of them!  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist that I trace the gum line and clean between my teeth (without forcing!)</li>
            <li> I wished more stores carried stim-u-dents because I have gaps in some of my back teeth that they do a real good job of cleaning quickly.</li>
            <li> I just love this product ,its easy on the gums cleans teeth well ,and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> A great toothpick made of soft wood.</li>
            <li> The review by the dentist who claimed that these plaque removers splinter and become too soft to use after moistening might have been experienced by some users, but never by me, and I&#x27;ve used them for years.  </li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It bends way to easily.</li>
            <li> Using Stim-U-Dents is easy and they work.</li>
            <li> We have always used the stim-u-dents because they are  easy on gums but still do the job.  </li>
            <li> They break way to easily and tend to splinter.  </li>
            <li> NO LONGER SEEMS AS STRONG AS IT USED TO BE.  </li>
            <li> The Stimudent picks are fine for their sturdiness and construction, but I did NOT want MINT flavored picks.  </li>
            <li> This product is becoming more rare in stores.  </li>
            <li> But they will do a fine job.</li>
            <li> Another company bought them from Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the quality of the Stim-u-dents has degraded as they are now not so finely made.</li>
            <li> Great hard-to-find locally product.</li>
            <li> It was helpful to have these available in bulk.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to use, and equally effective.  </li>
            <li> Remove food particles better than toothpicks, contribute to health of the gum, and leave a person&#x27;s breath reasonably fresh.</li>
            <li> Packets fit well in pockets, purses, cars, etc.</li>
            <li> This is the second time ordering this product and they are great.</li>
            <li> soft on gums and good product</li>
            <li> Originally got from my dentist a year or so ago...</li>
            <li> If there is a class action suit happening I will be very glad to put my name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my gums do not bleed because they are pretty healthy.</li>
            <li> I am hoping to find some that are like the original product.</li>
            <li> the new manufacturer will get production right and make the Stim-U-Dent as good as Johnson &amp; Johnson did.</li>
            <li> Leaves your teeth clean and feeling like you came out of the dentist office.</li>
            <li> They break before I can finish using them to clean all of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth...</li>
            <li> They are made of a soft wood but stand up nicely to being wedged in between one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used these for more than a decade, and it really helps remove food from in between the gums until you can floss.</li>
            <li> Amazon and was pleased to find them, in quantity, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and still have all my own teeth (with a couple of crowns from before I used Stim-U-Dents).</li>
            <li> I credit this product with the good oral health I am experiencing, along with brushing daily of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The current product is not quite as good as when they were made by Johnson &amp; Johnson.  </li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and really help my gums!</li>
            <li> After I use them, my teeth feel really clean and my breath fresh.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally - WAY better than floss</li>
            <li> The product i super</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, works as advetised.</li>
            <li> While I am sure I paid a little more for them, I was glad to find them, because I like them.</li>
            <li> They are good to use when not near a toothbrush and work quite well.</li>
            <li> New mfg. is OK..</li>
            <li> My dentist highly recommended these!!!</li>
            <li> Product is hard to get and I was glad to be able to get so many.  </li>
            <li> Great product, but difficult to find in pharmacies; ordering direct is great</li>
            <li> These are knock off copy&#x27;s of the real deal with 100% counter fit packaging.</li>
            <li> Poor Africans almost always have perfect teeth.  </li>
            <li> Eversince i have used them the check up at the dentist office has been a success.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I have been using stimudents for many years and a marked improvement in the health of my gums has occured.</li>
            <li> But they are still worth buying.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> I guess it serves me right to try and save money...</li>
            <li> As I said earlier I would still get this product since I don&#x27;t know of a suitable alternative.</li>
            <li> You know, the kind of thing that just annoys you all day long.  </li>
            <li> Stim-U-Dents, an old and true plaque remover and easy/fast to order thru Amazon!  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick as a toothpick, and does a great job cleaning with a fresh taste of mint in your mouth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Because these are not the original Johnson &amp; Johnson Stim U Dent, I have discovered that if you &#x27;do not&#x27; moisten them before use, a single pick will last all the way through your teeth rather than having to use two or even three because they break so easily.&lt;br /&gt;Still a great idea, and they really do work.</li>
            <li> Delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> noticed wood is not same, but they are much better than toothpicks.</li>
            <li> If you love popcorn and all kinds of nuts, these are essential.</li>
            <li> i love these wooden sticks and use them all the time.  </li>
            <li> Love these and for the last year couldn&#x27;t find them in any drugstore, Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li> My dentist is always amazed at how healthy my teeth are, and equally amazed that I don&#x27;t \\&quot;floss.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these wooden picks for many years, since they were first manufactured here in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> and they are much better for your gums than regular toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> These regular size ones work much better for me.</li>
            <li> Why is it that every time i find something I really like, its always pulled off the shelves at the stores?!</li>
            <li> Love them!&lt;br /&gt;Could only find here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these dental picks for several years, and really love them.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and ordered.</li>
            <li> quickly exactly as i wanted.  </li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE &amp;#34;ORIGINAL&amp;#34; (TOO THICK), BUT THE &amp;#34;THIN&amp;#34; ARE GREAT.</li>
            <li> The price was much better than I found in my local stores.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I use Stimudents differently than most of you.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is the use of stimudents on a daily basis returned my gums to a healthy state, no surgery needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> They are the only gum stimulants that keep my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and Seller shiped quickly.</li>
            <li> The Stim-U-Dent from &amp;#34;The Natural Dentist&amp;#34; is identical to the original</li>
            <li> loved, bought from various local merchants.</li>
            <li> Good for those who can&#x27;t use dental floss, such as with permanent bridges (an alternate to floss).</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t break as easy and it won&#x27;t damage your gums because it becomes pliable and soft and the fibers on the end will clean better like a small brush.</li>
            <li> They have a subtle triangular shape that fits perfectly and provide gum massage or can act as a toothpick if necessary.</li>
            <li> The balsa wood doesn&#x27;t splinter, and is just soft enough to compress a bit as you push them in, giving you a light friction against the tooth surface and polishing it clean.  </li>
            <li> I certainly do know that</li>
            <li> It is some kind of chemical that just tastes a little like mint.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Found out Johnson &amp; Johnson sold product line to someone and are now made in China...seems only available thru mail order.</li>
            <li> was fast, as ordered, etc.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.......................</li>
            <li> The last technician I saw said to me, in a genuinely astonished tone of voice, \\&quot;Whatever</li>
            <li> you are doing, it really works!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Fast service</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I can save my flossing for night time.</li>
            <li> I was very dependent upon them for day time \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; between meals and ended up looking in every store I would go into - in the U.S. and abroad.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> They have made my visits to the dentist a much nicer experience.</li>
            <li> Never had a splintering issue but even when the tip would break (too much pressure)</li>
            <li> Who would buy the synthetic cleaners made from plastic when you can buy these biodegradable ones, and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> but since I started using these everyday,my teeth and gums are much improved.</li>
            <li> Very prompt response after submitting my request.</li>
            <li> When I called the manufacturer regarding my dissatisfaction with the product the representative apologized for the product not meeting my expectation and sent me a free pack of 200 picks, which of course turned out to be of equally unsatisfactory quality.</li>
            <li> The originals that were made by Johnson &amp; Johnson were very well made.</li>
            <li> The Stem-U-Dent performs its intended purpose very well.  </li>
            <li> I do get cavities because I eat too much candy</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is so much simpler than flossing, which I never did.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The mint smells a little strong but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> These slender wedge-shaped balsa wood picks slide gently between the teeth and clean the sides of the teeth where otherwise only floss would reach.</li>
            <li> This knock off company needs to stop trying to fool the public into believing they are the original Johnson &amp; Johnson stim-u-dents.  </li>
            <li> Originally, when I started buying from Amazon, I was only ordering one type of product.</li>
            <li> I like them much better than other flossing aids I have tried.</li>
            <li> Apparently they are no longer made, and these Natural Dentist mint sticks are the closest thing available.  </li>
            <li> The tips on the Stim-U-Dents get soft very fast.  </li>
            <li> Unlike common toothpicks, these things are soft wood and wedge-shaped which makes them considerably more comfortable to insert between teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a great value, and are hard to find in our local stores.</li>
            <li> The product is now more brittle and not as uniform as previously.</li>
            <li> Toothpicks work much better for me, they have 2 usable ends and cost a ton less.  </li>
            <li> particularly if you don&#x27;t like flossing.  </li>
            <li> Really cheap because I had some loose teeth and bleeding gums</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had tight contacts and floss was not an option, and this does a better job.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I have used them for years, and my dentist is always amazed at how healthy my gums are and how little tartar I have between my teeth.</li>
            <li> When I was unable to find them at the store, I was happy to find this multi pack on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> These Plaque Removers work very well, and with 40 used so far, there have been no slivers.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews I have seen about this product in that the Picks are very soft, they collapse very easily because they are very soft and as a result you need to use multiple picks to go through your whole mouth just once.  </li>
            <li> When I do this white sticky stuff comes off right on the Stimudent.  </li>
            <li> It is a great go-between because it easily slides between your teeth picking up debri and other food particles left behind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that they are no longer available in all supermarkets, drugstores, or other places</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews, the new version is not as strong as the old ones.  </li>
            <li> The flat side goes to the gum and you press it in between the teeth right at the gum line.  </li>
            <li> Also the wood is very soft now that China has their fingers in the pot.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be exactly the same as the Johnson and Johnson one although maybe made somewhere else now - it tastes minty too.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this was in fact true, but at the cost of the thickness being too large to fit between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love these things, there not as hard as toothpicks and seem to massage your gums while cleaning between teeth...</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find in stores any more.  </li>
            <li> Stim-u-dents tapered triangular shape and soft wood make them what toothpicks should have always been.</li>
            <li> I remember the old product</li>
            <li> These are soft as balsa, and flavored to boot.  </li>
            <li> All I can find locally is Natural Dentist Plaque Removers.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson Plaque Removers, but received Natural Dentist Plaque Removers.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with everyone here who sees through these bogus stim-u-dents with the soft wood.</li>
            <li> Do NOT blast your teeth with a solution containing solid particles as that&#x27;s highly abrasive!</li>
            <li> As a dental professional I recommend these things to all of my patients.</li>
            <li> The quality has really deteriorated, but I could not find a close enough competitor brand/style.</li>
            <li> No MINT FLAVOR even box is marked as flavored sticks...</li>
            <li> My 91 year old loves these toothpicks - he has a pack by his recliner in the den, a pack in his car, a pack in his office, etc.  </li>
            <li> The ones sold by \\&quot;Natural Dentist\\&quot; are made is China.  </li>
            <li> No better tooth pick made easy on teath and gums.</li>
            <li> This is a simple and effective product and it saved me from serious oral surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> if they will still pass out the original J&amp;Js of which I have a few packs left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fall apart before you can clean your teeth and do not fit between your teeth.</li>
            <li> However, based on my use of the current product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s exactly the same.</li>
            <li> It does take a little time but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> And I am always pleasantly surprised when I find the things here on Amazon that I can no longer find locally.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting patiently for the complete order of the product as noted above to be delivered to me.  </li>
            <li> The sticks are splintered and too thick to fit between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Use ONLY a clear solution with all the solid soda particles settled out.  </li>
            <li> Decent price and faster than expected delivery.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this product has diminished significantly over the past year, as the individual picks are narrower, much less sturdy and fracture readily.</li>
            <li> the packaging is harder to open - splintering is more common when peeling out a stick and the tip breaks off sooner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And while it does bear the ADA endorsement, few dentists I&#x27;ve known are aware of it.  </li>
            <li> While there is no substitute for flossing and brushing, after a meal when this is not possible these plaque removers are indispensable and much preferable to the hard, round toothpicks some restaurants offer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this useful product for quite some time, but it is now hard to come by in stores.  </li>
            <li> All was okay just a little slow getting here.</li>
            <li> the old&lt;br /&gt;J&amp;J mint stim-U-dents are vastly superior to this soft and almost totally worthless sticks of wood from china.</li>
            <li> Dentist is surprised at her dental care for an elderly person and it is due to her using these religiously!</li>
            <li> I use them after pretty much every meal since I have a few open contacts that trap food, they seem to be hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> There is not a doubt in my mind that I will have my teeth for my entire life, with no major dental problems (and the resulting pain &amp; bills ) in the interim.</li>
            <li> A little harder and a little thicker than the original, but still serve it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be poor imitation, not as sturdy and break easily.</li>
            <li> However, I am not aware of any similar wooden product on the market</li>
            <li> Hopefully, with time (don&#x27;t take too long)</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended them a long time ago for bleeding gums.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this company advertising one thing, but selling another, these plaque removers do not soften when wet, they splinter and have drawn blood on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have used these daily for years, and for some reason they&#x27;re getting harder and harder to find in any local stores.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; teeth, so I hate dental floss; it tears apart when I try to get it between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find them in my small town, but found them in a new store.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other plastic floss / tooth-pick type products and find them awkward to use and much less effective than the tapered wood tooth-pick I have come to love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using them religiously for the past nine or ten years.</li>
            <li> These simple little things work for me.</li>
            <li> My Husband &amp; I have been using Stim-U-Dents since the late 1950&#x27;s-or early 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I no longer have any dental issues and plaque build-up is minimal between cleanings.</li>
            <li> I received a partial order of 9 packs insteat of 12, there was no invoice in my package.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> It takes only a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Stim-U-Dent, which also appeared in the photo at the time of placing the order, but received some other brand (Revive?)</li>
            <li> I am not interested in rating this product at this time.</li>
            <li> If the plaque is left there it builds up, gets hard and just rubs and irritates your gums.  </li>
            <li> You get so much gunk out from between your teeth when you use them that you can get addicted to them!</li>
            <li> and then they have less tarter and the&lt;br /&gt;little particles between my teeth age</li>
            <li> gone with less abrasive scratching.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to Stim-U-Dent Plaque Removers about 13 years ago and find that they get into the tight areas around my teeth and remove some of the plaque that builds up in between my bottom front teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product because his teeth have little space between them for dental floss.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they are made in China!  </li>
            <li> As a disabled person I can&#x27;t always get up to brush as often as I would like</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will go see my dentist in a few months</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Other stick-like plaque removers are too hard and hurt the gums.  </li>
            <li> A small but invaluable addition to anyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> In the past when made by Johnson &amp; Johnson</li>
            <li> Stim-u-dent is hard to find where I am</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, so grateful I can still get them online.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area of California.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> I have read the negative reviews</li>
            <li> At least I can buy them here in bulk and save money.</li>
            <li> Compared to other picks purchased both from retail stores and on-line, these picks are very weak.  </li>
            <li> No more gunk in my teeth!</li>
            <li> Stim-U-Dent Plaque Removers are almost impossible to find in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> My dentist introduced me to Stimudents when I was facing a serious gum problem that would have needed surgery if not addressed.  </li>
            <li> If that stuff is left there it decays and the process is bad for your gums.  </li>
            <li> They are cut to a small triangle shape that fits well between the teeth to get plaque and food particles that are difficult to get with even floss and water pic.</li>
            <li> I received are a poor knock off.</li>
            <li> not as thin as US Stim-U-Dent</li>
            <li> All in all it was and is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> For some reason, stores around here quit carrying these, except for one which has some of the thin ones.</li>
            <li> It is so frustrating.</li>
            <li> This experience is frustrating for me.</li>
            <li> We are now in our eightieth years and neither of us have false teeth.</li>
            <li> Very subtle mint flavor and very hard to find at the stores.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in retail stores now</li>
            <li> But they are extremely expensive.  </li>
            <li> He still keeps trying to push floss (silly man).</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to find in any of the drugstores in my immediate area.</li>
            <li> The wood is horrible, shreds as soon as wet.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> I remain disappointed , as it appears the quality control standards for this product have been lowered.  </li>
            <li> If you hate to floss</li>
            <li> I hate to floss</li>
            <li> I have to admit it, I hate to floss.</li>
            <li> I hated when I found the stores were no longer selling stimudents.  </li>
            <li> I hate the idea of putting something in my mouth that was made in China!  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> Everything worked great, no problems.</li>
            <li> stim-u-dent plaque removers 12 packs of 25</li>
            <li> Excellent product and we have not been able to find it in the stores.  Glad to find it on Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Originally got from my dentist a year or so ago...loved, bought from various local merchants. Then could not find after a while. Found out Johnson &amp; Johnson sold product line to someone and are now made in China...seems only available thru mail order. Oh well...probably not profitable for J &amp; J...New mfg. is OK..noticed wood is not same, but they are much better than toothpicks. This last order shipped to me was fast, as ordered, etc. will reorder when time comes from same supplier.</li>
            <li> Stim-u-dents tapered triangular shape and soft wood make them what toothpicks should have always been. The porous wood makes them perfect for  economical application of hygiene products at the gumline, where antiseptics do the most good.</li>
            <li> I wished more stores carried stim-u-dents because I have gaps in some of my back teeth that they do a real good job of cleaning quickly.</li>
            <li> Product is hard to get and I was glad to be able to get so many.  Great for bridge work.  I highly recommend it and Seller shiped quickly.</li>
            <li> Totally dissatisfied with this product...all of a sudden, what was made in the USA is now made in china...I will not use any product that is made in china...shame on johnson &amp; Johnson....lost me as a customer....was going to return poduct, but lost paperwork....Very dissatisfied.......................</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist - these are the best.  I can never find them in the store.  If you love popcorn and all kinds of nuts, these are essential.</li>
            <li> This product is no longer made by Johnson &amp; Johnson. I would still use this product. However, based on my use of the current product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s exactly the same. The toothpick is more splintered and not as finished. As I said earlier I would still get this product since I don&#x27;t know of a suitable alternative. Hopefully, with time (don&#x27;t take too long) the new manufacturer will get production right and make the Stim-U-Dent as good as Johnson &amp; Johnson did.</li>
            <li> no longer made by Johnson and Johnson. no longer made in the USA.  They should remove the words Johnson and Johnson.  I could tell that it wasn&#x27;t the same even when I was opening the package.  Still better than &#x27;no Stim-U-Dents&#x27;</li>
            <li> A great toothpick made of soft wood. Gets in between the teeth where a brush can&#x27;t.  Good for those who can&#x27;t use dental floss, such as with permanent bridges (an alternate to floss).</li>
            <li> I have been using this useful product for quite some time, but it is now hard to come by in stores.  The ability to purchase this product in bulk and via mail is both convenient and cost-saving.</li>
            <li> Love the item. Works for what we need. We use them daily and have had no problems. Wish we could get them locally.</li>
            <li> Best dental checks ever since beginning to use this product several years ago.  Difficult to find in retail stores now and I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Stim-U-Dents, an old and true plaque remover and easy/fast to order thru Amazon!  I checked every drugstore in town and even the Johnson &amp; Johnson web site to no avail.  Then I remembered, Amazon knows where EVERYTHING is.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best oral health product imaginable. A dental technician recommended it to me 15-20 years ago, and am I ever grateful that she did! Each time I go in for cleaning, they RAVE about how healthy my gums are, and how little-to-no plaque I have. The last technician I saw said to me, in a genuinely astonished tone of voice, \\&quot;Whatever you are doing, it really works!\\&quot; I answered, \\&quot;Each evening as I watch TV (may as well make additional use of that time), I brush, then floss, then use a Stim-U-Dent pic, and finally a pereo aid.\\&quot; The Stim-U-Dent pic removes plaque BETWEEN the teeth, and the pereo aid removes plaque from the gumline ALONG the teeth. There is not a doubt in my mind that I will have my teeth for my entire life, with no major dental problems (and the resulting pain &amp; bills ) in the interim. In conclusion, if you value your teeth and oral health, use this product. You will NEVER regret doing so. BTW, in 12/08 Johnson &amp; Johnson sold the rights for this wonderful product to Caldwell Consumer Health (1-888-317-4402). CCH now markets it (in the same packaging, although not necessarily via the same retail outlets).</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist  gave me a couple of packs of these and now I am hooked. They are made of a soft wood but stand up nicely to being wedged in between one&#x27;s teeth. They have a subtle triangular shape that fits perfectly and provide gum massage or can act as a toothpick if necessary. I keep them stashed in my purse and with&lt;br /&gt;my floss. Try them and see for yourself!</li>
            <li> A little harder and a little thicker than the original, but still serve it&#x27;s purpose.  The mint smells a little strong but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I received are a poor knock off. They are not made by Johnson and Johnson as the product page states. They are made in China. The wood is horrible, shreds as soon as wet.  This knock off company needs to stop trying to fool the public into believing they are the original Johnson &amp; Johnson stim-u-dents.  This is deceiving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Stim-U-Dents for over 50 years. They&#x27;ve worked--I still have my teeth after having had gum problems in my 20s. The production switched from Puerto Rico to China a year or so ago. The product is now more brittle and not as uniform as previously. However, there is nothing else like it on the market.</li>
            <li> I have read the negative reviews and I noticed they were all about the product splintering or breaking.  You should soften the wood with your saliva for a couple of minutes before attempting to floss/pick.  It won&#x27;t break as easy and it won&#x27;t damage your gums because it becomes pliable and soft and the fibers on the end will clean better like a small brush. I remember the old product and I think these work just as well.  My wife is from Africa and they use a similar wood stick to floss with.  Poor Africans almost always have perfect teeth.  My wife didn&#x27;t see a Dentist until she was 30 and she has perfect teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have found it to be most effective.</li>
            <li> No better tooth pick made easy on teath and gums. Always buy this brand from amazon. Would recomend to all</li>
            <li> I have used Stim-U-Dents for years. You can use these picks to remove plaque in the front and back of your teeth,under the gum line, where floss can&#x27;t go. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Stim-U-Dent Plaque Removers about 13 years ago and find that they get into the tight areas around my teeth and remove some of the plaque that builds up in between my bottom front teeth. I use them twice a day and will continue to do so. They stimulate the gum area and my teeth cleaned every six months is not an ordeal. I also floss as well.</li>
            <li> I love the J &amp; J stimudent product and could not find them in any retail store as I always had. Tried Amazon.com and could not believe I found them and at the best price ever. Great price. Fast service</li>
            <li> In the mornings when I am rushing for work I don&#x27;t have time for flossing so I use this product.  It is a great go-between because it easily slides between your teeth picking up debri and other food particles left behind.  Thanks to this product I can save my flossing for night time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with all my purchases and appreciate the savings.</li>
            <li> i love this product. Leaves your teeth clean and feeling like you came out of the dentist office. Eversince i have used them the check up at the dentist office has been a success.</li>
            <li> i love these wooden sticks and use them all the time.  But they are extremely expensive.  I only received 12 packs of 25 sticks and they cost a lot of money.</li>
            <li> A great toothpick and the supplier provided wonderful service and the tooth picks are just what I ordered and expected. Functional and compact - a excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without Stimudents! I use them after every meal. My dental hygienist always compliments me on how great my gums are, and I&#x27;m sure these are part of the reason.</li>
            <li> Great hard-to-find locally product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Got hooked on them, then couldn&#x27;t find them in any store in town. Was so happy to find them online. Anyone who has teeth should order these in bulk.</li>
            <li> Since S-U-D moved it&#x27;s mfg to China the packaging is harder to open - splintering is more common when peeling out a stick and the tip breaks off sooner.&lt;br /&gt;They are still the best of its kind and I won&#x27;t stop using them but I was saddened when I read &#x27;Made in China&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> If you hate to floss like I do then you will love these.  One of the things I don&#x27;t like is the fact you have to break apart each one in the pack. But they work like a toothpick but better. I just wipe the plaque off with a tissue after some build up. I use them after meals instead of floss.</li>
            <li> The Stimudent picks are fine for their sturdiness and construction, but I did NOT want MINT flavored picks.  No where on the package does the word mint appear.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth nice after meals without having to brush.</li>
            <li> Love these and for the last year couldn&#x27;t find them in any drugstore, Target or Walmart.  I was very dependent upon them for day time \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; between meals and ended up looking in every store I would go into - in the U.S. and abroad.  Finally had given up when I thought of the Internet and Amazon.  Delighted to find them again and will continue to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had to resort to buying these online since Wal Mart and Walgreen&#x27;s do not carry them anymore.  While I am sure I paid a little more for them, I was glad to find them, because I like them.</li>
            <li> Good for your Thoth health</li>
            <li> I hated when I found the stores were no longer selling stimudents.  I have been using them since I was a teenager.  Unlike flossing, they are great for cleaning between the teeth AND massaging the gums.  My dentist recommended them a long time ago for bleeding gums.  I&#x27;ve had no bleeding gums since then.  They are great. At least I can buy them here in bulk and save money. The quality of the product has diminished over 30 years, but still good.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and really help my gums!</li>
            <li> Delivery on time and product as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> These were not Johnson &amp; Johnson as shown on line.  They were made in China and&lt;br /&gt;are not as thin as US Stim-U-Dent</li>
            <li> Works much better than a toothpick for me!</li>
            <li> used theses for years . soft on gums and good product</li>
            <li> My dentist turned me on to these. As a disabled person I can&#x27;t always get up to brush as often as I would like and these do my flossing perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product is becoming more rare in stores.  It was helpful to have these available in bulk.  I have used these for more than a decade, and it really helps remove food from in between the gums until you can floss.</li>
            <li> These toothpicks are the best - they are my substitute for dental floss.  Much easier to use, and equally effective.  My dentist is always amazed at how healthy my teeth are, and equally amazed that I don&#x27;t \\&quot;floss.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally - WAY better than floss</li>
            <li> Good product for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Stimudents in lieu of flossing for over 50 years. They work for me and I can use them after eating at home or away.</li>
            <li> Great Price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Everything satisfactory...item was as advertised and shipping was speedy.</li>
            <li> Stim-u-dent has been a staple of mine for years. Cleans teeth, stimulates gums and removes plaque. My last visit to the dental hygienist ended by having her say to me: &amp;#34;Keep up doing whatever you are doing with your teeth they were in great shape.</li>
            <li> Had used these regularly for some time and then for some reason had lost track of them. [Living in Arctic AK can cause that to happen some times.  &amp;#60;:)]  As part of oral health they cannot be beat. Remove food particles better than toothpicks, contribute to health of the gum, and leave a person&#x27;s breath reasonably fresh.</li>
            <li> Great product, but difficult to find in pharmacies; ordering direct is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these wooden picks for many years, since they were first manufactured here in the U.S.  They are a wonderful cleaning instrument for removing food particles between the teeth.  I keep them with me and use them after each meal.  Toothpicks break and splinter  while these picks, once moistened by your own saliva before using, don&#x27;t come apart.  I&#x27;ve noticed that they are no longer available in all supermarkets, drugstores, or other places so I have to mail order them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will always be sold somewhere.  They&#x27;re an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at my local store but they stopped selling them.  I love this product and they came as promised and I have a good supply now for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Amazon and was pleased to find them, in quantity, and at a reasonable price.These are the best... particularly if you don&#x27;t like flossing.  Not a complete substitute for floss, but the best I know in conjunction with my WaterPik.  Other stick-like plaque removers are too hard and hurt the gums.  These are soft as balsa, and flavored to boot.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without them... keep a pack in my pocket.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore and they are much better for your gums than regular toothpicks.  I&#x27;ve been using them for over 40 years and have no gum problems.</li>
            <li> seem to do the job.  I hate to floss</li>
            <li> These Stim-U-Dents used to be made in the USA and were very good. And you could get them without the flavoring. Now you have to buy the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavor. It is not mint. It is some kind of chemical that just tastes a little like mint. Also the wood is very soft now that China has their fingers in the pot. It bends way to easily. And then the price turns out to more than what you pay in the store. All in all it was and is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to find this product.  I have used Stim-U-Dents for years!&lt;br /&gt;They do a better job for me than dental floss because they massage the gums.</li>
            <li> Stim-U-Dents are great for massaging the gums and keeping the teeth clean between brushing and flossing.  This is a great product; practical, affordable and best of all it works.</li>
            <li> Perfectly shaped for its intended purpose. Made of wood and not plastic. Much better feel and more effective for cleaning. Using these for many years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product at the request of my dentist for 16 years. Quality control is nonexistent with the current manufacturer.  The sticks are splintered and too thick to fit between my teeth. My dentist agrees. Time to try something else.</li>
            <li> Have used these plaque removers for years.  Used to be able to buy at store or drug store; so glad that we can get them on line.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years, help keep my teeth healthy and plaque free.&lt;br /&gt;Great for in between brushings. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Compared to other picks purchased both from retail stores and on-line, these picks are very weak.  They break before I can finish using them to clean all of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using J &amp; J Stim-U-Dent for many years. The quality of this product has diminished significantly over the past year, as the individual picks are narrower, much less sturdy and fracture readily. I&#x27;ve also noted that they are now made in China, and distributed by Revive Personal Products Company, Madison, NJ. I remain disappointed , as it appears the quality control standards for this product have been lowered.  Kenneth Schultheis, Des Moines, Iowa</li>
            <li> My husband and I use these every day. Excellent for cleaning teeth at home and away. Good for gums.</li>
            <li> Best soft toothpicks. Recommended by my dentist and Ive been using them for years. Packets fit well in pockets, purses, cars, etc.</li>
            <li> Stim-u-dent is hard to find where I am and I like it because not like floss it doesn&#x27;t shove the food into the gum. It isn&#x27;t as thick as a toothpick, and does a great job cleaning with a fresh taste of mint in your mouth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I looked &amp; looked for Johnson &amp; Johnson Plaque Removers because I could no longer find them locally.  All I can find locally is Natural Dentist Plaque Removers.  I ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson Plaque Removers, but received Natural Dentist Plaque Removers.  Not only is this company advertising one thing, but selling another, these plaque removers do not soften when wet, they splinter and have drawn blood on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DEMAND THAT AMAZON REMOVE THIS AD!</li>
            <li> I have to admit it, I hate to floss. That means I don&#x27;t do it. That&#x27;s bad. However, using Stim-U-Dent is probably the next best thing to flossing, IMO. I have been using them religiously for the past nine or ten years. They have made my visits to the dentist a much nicer experience. My check-ups are always good. I no longer have any dental issues and plaque build-up is minimal between cleanings. I am 56 years old and still have all my own teeth (with a couple of crowns from before I used Stim-U-Dents). I credit this product with the good oral health I am experiencing, along with brushing daily of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one after each meal, and when possible, after snacks. It actually bothers me now to feel any food between my teeth. Using Stim-U-Dents is easy and they work. I am very happy with this product and always carry a pack in my pocket everywhere I go. I have tried the other plastic floss / tooth-pick type products and find them awkward to use and much less effective than the tapered wood tooth-pick I have come to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all the local pharmacies and grocery stores carry them all the time therefore, I order them in bulk on-line so I always have plenty on hand without fear of running out!</li>
            <li> These are much better than tooth picks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always great to have stimudents around for times when flossing can&#x27;t be done but when stuff gets stuck in between your teeth. I&#x27;ve used these for many many years. A perfect product for the job.</li>
            <li> The purchase was as described. It was well-packed and arrived promptly. I&#x27;ve used these for years. I kerp them in my purse, car, et.  I use them during the movie when I finish my popcorn.</li>
            <li> I have fairly &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; teeth, so I hate dental floss; it tears apart when I try to get it between my teeth. Stim-U-Dents are the perfect solution. I have used them for years, and my dentist is always amazed at how healthy my gums are and how little tartar I have between my teeth. He still keeps trying to push floss (silly man). In the last couple of years this product has been disappearing from many drug stores, which is unfortunate. I&#x27;m glad I can still get them via Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is no longer offered for sale by Johnson &amp; Johnson.  And while it does bear the ADA endorsement, few dentists I&#x27;ve known are aware of it.  The review by the dentist who claimed that these plaque removers splinter and become too soft to use after moistening might have been experienced by some users, but never by me, and I&#x27;ve used them for years.  While there is no substitute for flossing and brushing, after a meal when this is not possible these plaque removers are indispensable and much preferable to the hard, round toothpicks some restaurants offer.</li>
            <li> as advertised - speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Never use anything else!</li>
            <li> For some reason, stores around here quit carrying these, except for one which has some of the thin ones. These regular size ones work much better for me.</li>
            <li> I just love this product ,its easy on the gums cleans teeth well ,and easy to carry. like having a tooth brush in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Great product. My dental hygienist recommended them to me. Have been using for years now. Hard to find in stores, so grateful I can still get them online.</li>
            <li> I have been using stimudents for many years and a marked improvement in the health of my gums has occured.</li>
            <li> This is not a Johnson and Johnson product as advertised.  This product breaks very easily.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;D HAVE GIVEN THEM FIVE STARS EXCEPT THAT THE WOOD OF THE PICKS NO LONGER SEEMS AS STRONG AS IT USED TO BE.  HOW COME???</li>
            <li> I used these for years. They&#x27;re great after meals before brushing your teeth. J&amp;J is a great company and I use many of their products.</li>
            <li> Why is it that every time i find something I really like, its always pulled off the shelves at the stores?! It is so frustrating. Originally, when I started buying from Amazon, I was only ordering one type of product. I have to keep reminding myself that Amazon has so much more. And I am always pleasantly surprised when I find the things here on Amazon that I can no longer find locally. Such is the case with these things. My father-in-law introduced them to me 25 years ago (or more) and I have faithfully used them ever since--that is, until recently when I could no longer find them locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that I can no longer find them locally? ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to receive this product from the Amazon order, but like them that much--to actually go out and order toothpicks on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, yeah, might help to explain why.... Unlike common toothpicks, these things are soft wood and wedge-shaped which makes them considerably more comfortable to insert between teeth. Never had a splintering issue but even when the tip would break (too much pressure), I would peel it off and keep using the rest of the pick. I prefer the unscented ones but they do have scented (or flavored) ones as well.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended these 25 years ago - been using them ever since.</li>
            <li> Been using Stim-U-Dents since my callow youth 50 years ago.  A great adjunct to flossing.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use these plaque removers daily - great tool for good dental health.</li>
            <li> Love them!&lt;br /&gt;Could only find here!</li>
            <li> These plaque removers are EXCELLENT! They are cut to a small triangle shape that fits well between the teeth to get plaque and food particles that are difficult to get with even floss and water pic. They have a refreshing taste. After I use them, my teeth feel really clean and my breath fresh.  Who would buy the synthetic cleaners made from plastic when you can buy these biodegradable ones, and much cheaper. I use all the time.</li>
            <li> I got the slim version this time and they are even easier to use.</li>
            <li> Good Price.  Good product.  Promptly shipped</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is not the same as what I buy in the store.  They seem to be poor imitation, not as sturdy and break easily.</li>
            <li> You gotta stimulate those gums and these are the best way to do it!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with everyone here who sees through these bogus stim-u-dents with the soft wood. I certainly do know that the old&lt;br /&gt;J&amp;J mint stim-U-dents are vastly superior to this soft and almost totally worthless sticks of wood from china. I also detest that J&amp;J sold&lt;br /&gt;out the originals stim-u-dents to an inferior product. If there is a class action suit happening I will be very glad to put my name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go see my dentist in a few months and I will ask him/her if they will still pass out the original J&amp;Js of which I have a few packs left.&lt;br /&gt;While I am at it, J&amp;J unwaxed floss is a good product.</li>
            <li> A small but invaluable addition to anyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.  There simply is no substitute.</li>
            <li> As best as I can determine, as good as the ones Dad used decades ago.</li>
            <li> I ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Stim-U-Dent, which also appeared in the photo at the time of placing the order, but received some other brand (Revive?)</li>
            <li> Stim-U-Dents are great!  They are good to use when not near a toothbrush and work quite well.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist, and received a free sample, after trying it [and finishing the box], I decided to continues using it, thus the purchase!</li>
            <li> I prefer toothpicks over these sticks.  The tips on the Stim-U-Dents get soft very fast.  Toothpicks work much better for me, they have 2 usable ends and cost a ton less.  But I&#x27;m sure these softer sticks will be great for many people.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product because his teeth have little space between them for dental floss. He gets so aggrivated at the floss breaking, or stuck between his teeth. These seem to do the trick   with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and I know they have helped me keep the teeth I have left.  My gums don&#x27;t bleed the way they used to.  Especially during dental cleanings. My dentist recommended them.    However, the Stim-U-Dents that are made now do break easier then the ones I&#x27;ve bought before.  (I compared them to some I bought back in 2008 and the ones I just bought here do break easier)  But they are still worth buying.  I&#x27;m just using more of them.  Worth the extra money.  Really cheap because I had some loose teeth and bleeding gums but since I started using these everyday,my teeth and gums are much improved.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs these.  Dentist recommended</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Stimudents for years and swears by them.</li>
            <li> Great service and product.  So glad I was able to still get these.</li>
            <li> these were recommended by my dentist years ago and they are one of the best tools for protecting my gums and teeth from tartar buildup and keeping my gums healthy.  a real find for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love these things, there not as hard as toothpicks and seem to massage your gums while cleaning between teeth...</li>
            <li> I have used Stim-U-Dents for many years.  The current product is not quite as good as when they were made by Johnson &amp; Johnson.  In the past when made by Johnson &amp; Johnson the wood  was softer and more supple.  However, I am not aware of any similar wooden product on the market and I still find them to be a worthwhile aid in maintaining good oral hygiene and healthy gums. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I am not interested in rating this product at this time. Reason---- I have been waiting patiently for the complete order of the product as noted above to be delivered to me.  I ordered 12 packs of Stim-U-Dent on 2/14, (300 picks) on 2/21 I received a partial order of 9 packs insteat of 12, there was no invoice in my package. I have been trying since 2/21 to get this issue resolved. This experience is frustrating for me. What  more must I to do to bring this to a satisfactory resolution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to a reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Morgan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Very prompt response after submitting my request. The product is effective - does the job just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these dental picks for several years, and really love them.  When I was unable to find them at the store, I was happy to find this multi pack on Amazon.  My only complaint is that they are made in China!  I hate the idea of putting something in my mouth that was made in China!  At any rate, they work great, just wish they were produced here in the US!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and ordered.</li>
            <li> Best part of tooth-cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Clean your teeth under the gum line after brushing and flossing, keep your teeth, take care of them!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> excellent shipiingtime</li>
            <li> My mom loves them and has used them for years.  Dentist is surprised at her dental care for an elderly person and it is due to her using these religiously!</li>
            <li> Because these are not the original Johnson &amp; Johnson Stim U Dent, I have discovered that if you &#x27;do not&#x27; moisten them before use, a single pick will last all the way through your teeth rather than having to use two or even three because they break so easily.&lt;br /&gt;Still a great idea, and they really do work.</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to find in any of the drugstores in my immediate area. I decided to buy several packages in order to avoid looking for them in the drugstores. The product does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> Stim-U-Dent Plaque Removers are almost impossible to find in the local stores.  I was so glad to have found them on Amazon.  I agree with some of the other reviews, the new version is not as strong as the old ones.  But they will do a fine job.</li>
            <li> Perfekt, it is the only I can use, and it is what I tell all my friends. The product i super</li>
            <li> Great quality product at a super great price!!</li>
            <li> My teeth often felt grundgy even after brushing, but with one of these now and then they have less tarter and the&lt;br /&gt;little particles between my teeth age gone with less abrasive scratching.  So happy I found these.  Great product,&lt;br /&gt;shipped quickly exactly as i wanted.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews I have seen about this product in that the Picks are very soft, they collapse very easily because they are very soft and as a result you need to use multiple picks to go through your whole mouth just once.  When I called the manufacturer regarding my dissatisfaction with the product the representative apologized for the product not meeting my expectation and sent me a free pack of 200 picks, which of course turned out to be of equally unsatisfactory quality.</li>
            <li> These are knock off copy&#x27;s of the real deal with 100% counter fit packaging. I ended up throwing them away as soon as they arrived as who knows where this wood product came from and with what quality or sterility it was produced with.</li>
            <li> These balsa wood dental plaque toothpick like removers work well. The originals that were made by Johnson &amp; Johnson were very well made. Another company bought them from Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the quality of the Stim-u-dents has degraded as they are now not so finely made. They are somewhat rougher around the individual Stim-U-Dent removers.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good price. Delivered promptly. Use stim u dents all the time.</li>
            <li> These Plaque Removers work very well, and with 40 used so far, there have been no slivers.</li>
            <li> Have used stim-u-dents for years and have never had any problems.  It helps keeping food particales from between my teeth between brushings.</li>
            <li> Good quality, helps clean your teeth at the gum line.  Recommended by my dentist that I trace the gum line and clean between my teeth (without forcing!) with these.&lt;br /&gt;I also water-pik with a baking-soda solution with 1/6 or so 3% hydrogen peroxide added.  Use ONLY a clear solution with all the solid soda particles settled out.  Do NOT blast your teeth with a solution containing solid particles as that&#x27;s highly abrasive!</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE &amp;#34;ORIGINAL&amp;#34; (TOO THICK), BUT THE &amp;#34;THIN&amp;#34; ARE GREAT.</li>
            <li> No more gunk in my teeth! Hip, Hip, Hooray!</li>
            <li> As a dental professional I recommend these things to all of my patients. I use them after pretty much every meal since I have a few open contacts that trap food, they seem to be hard to find in the stores so it&#x27;s great being able to buy them in bulk on Amazon!</li>
            <li> We have always used the stim-u-dents because they are  easy on gums but still do the job.  Best on the market.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be exactly the same as the Johnson and Johnson one although maybe made somewhere else now - it tastes minty too.</li>
            <li> Misleading description. Its made in China by the Nature Dentist (the picture is faithful, to be fair). Pay no attention to the product vendor in the name. Local drugstores do carry the J&amp;J made product - I&#x27;ve seen them at CVS. I guess it serves me right to try and save money...</li>
            <li> Just the job for when I am in a restaurant or anywhere that I may be eating without access to my waterpik or floss.</li>
            <li> I used the Johnson&amp;Johnson unflavored Stim-U-Dents for many years.  Apparently they are no longer made, and these Natural Dentist mint sticks are the closest thing available.  I don&#x27;t like them as well.</li>
            <li> My Husband &amp; I have been using Stim-U-Dents since the late 1950&#x27;s-or early 1960&#x27;s. Our dentist in California started us on&lt;br /&gt;this regime. We are now in our eightieth years and neither of us have false teeth. In fact we have pretty good looking teeth.</li>
            <li> All was okay just a little slow getting here.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in lieu of dental floss for years. I was really happy to find them on Amazon at this price. Everything was as expected. The price was much better than I found in my local stores. If the rpice remains the same, I&#x27;ll be coming back for a replacement order in the future.</li>
            <li> The Stim-U-Dent from &amp;#34;The Natural Dentist&amp;#34; is identical to the original J&amp;J.  Yes it&#x27;s made in China but it is identical to the USA stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades and still have BOTH in my grab box to compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had tight contacts and floss was not an option, and this does a better job.  Check out &amp;#34;http://www.bleedinggums.com/stim-u-dent/&amp;#34; for an explanation on the manufacturing.</li>
            <li> These picks are great. You get so much gunk out from between your teeth when you use them that you can get addicted to them! The pointy end does sometimes break, so you have to be a bit careful/gentle with them.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area of California.  Decent price and faster than expected delivery.  Very effective if one does not like to floss, as recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, works as advetised.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and can&#x27;t do without it.  It helps my plaque removal. I will keep ordering</li>
            <li> The quality has really deteriorated, but I could not find a close enough competitor brand/style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. Sometimes the tip bends or breaks between the teeth. This happens only with some packages of the product. I won&#x27;t stop using them, as my dentist says they&#x27;re doing a great job of keeping my teeth and gums healthy, but I wish they could be more consistent with their manufacturing.</li>
            <li> The Stem-U-Dent performs its intended purpose very well.  However, the one problem I have experienced with it is the tip breaks off too easily.</li>
            <li> Have used these daily for years, and for some reason they&#x27;re getting harder and harder to find in any local stores.  So decided to order them online this time.  Competitive pricing through Amazon!  Might not bother looking in local stores anymore.  BTW, they are wonderful for getting out bits of food stuck in tiny spaces between teeth along gum line.  Also stimulates and keeps gums healthy.  Nothing I&#x27;ve found can compare.</li>
            <li> My dentist highly recommended these!!! I loved my sample pack so I had to get more!!</li>
            <li> They always work well and I saved a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> These are not as good as the original Johnson &amp; Johnson brand.  They break way to easily and tend to splinter.  But the shape and size are perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse and very useful.</li>
            <li> Have used stim-u-dents very successfully for long time. Hard to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> No MINT FLAVOR even box is marked as flavored sticks...&lt;br /&gt; I guess Chinese companies geting smarter than Americans to save money.</li>
            <li> These simple little things work for me. The dental hygienist slipped some into my take-home new-toothbrush-and-dental-floss sample bag. I like them much better than other flossing aids I have tried. I brush, floss, use one of these and then use mouthwash. That should just about cover it in the dental hygiene department!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Exactly as described. Delivered very fast. Will order again.</li>
            <li> excellent effective alternative to flossing</li>
            <li> I have been using Stimudeents for 40 years. At the point I began using them I had severe gum disease (gingivitis), on my way to pyorrhea-- I do eat alot of sugar (even today) but I spend 20 minutes in the evening taking care of my teeth. I use Stimudents differently than most of you.I use it the way a dentist uses a tool to take plaque off my teeth, around the gum line. I know if I did not do this, I would have gum disease and would probably have lost all of my teeth.  When I do this white sticky stuff comes off right on the Stimudent.  It does take a little time but it is well worth it.  I get my teeth cleaned twice a year and my gums do not bleed because they are pretty healthy. I do get cavities because I eat too much candy but I get them taken care of when they are tiny cavities.</li>
            <li> My dentist introduced me to Stimudents when I was facing a serious gum problem that would have needed surgery if not addressed.  Bottom line is the use of stimudents on a daily basis returned my gums to a healthy state, no surgery needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How these are used would not have been obvious to me so I am going to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are triangle shaped.  It fits perfectly, between your teeth right at the gum line. The flat side goes to the gum and you press it in between the teeth right at the gum line.  It lifts the gum and pushes out all sorts of stuff that get stuck there.  Seeds, pieces of food, and of coures plaque.  If that stuff is left there it decays and the process is bad for your gums.  If the plaque is left there it builds up, gets hard and just rubs and irritates your gums.  It gets out things like seeds, bits of peanut, strands of meat irritate the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever had something stuck between your teeth and gums?  You know, the kind of thing that just annoys you all day long.  This will get it out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use them several times a week or whenever anything bothers my gums.  It takes only a few seconds.  This is so much simpler than flossing, which I never did.  I use them before I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t work for the company and get no money for my endorsement.  This is a simple and effective product and it saved me from serious oral surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks J&amp;J for making Stimudent.</li>
            <li> Between these and my spin brush... my Dental check-ups have take&lt;br /&gt;a turn towards perfection.  Clean teeth...&lt;br /&gt;These are a great value, and are hard to find in our local stores.</li>
            <li> These are the best for getting food from between my teeth.  I carry a pack with me all of the time.</li>
            <li> These toothpicks are awesome. Very subtle mint flavor and very hard to find at the stores. These are a great substitute for floss.</li>
            <li> This is the second time ordering this product and they are great. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like these a lot and they so work well. I preferred it when they were J&amp;J but these will do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to get a good price on these. They are the only gum stimulants that keep my gums healthy. When my gums get tender, all I have to do is use these twice or three times over as many days to toughen them up.</li>
            <li> Like these!  Husband loves them!</li>
            <li> Been using these for years. PRICE on Amazon was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Keep my gums in tip top shape</li>
            <li> Been using them for over 5 years !!best in the world!!</li>
            <li> These toothpicks are the most effective tool I&#x27;ve found for cleaning all the hard-to-reach places on the teeth without damage.  My dental checkups have vastly improved since using these!  Unfortunately, local stores stopped carrying them...but I have not found a suitable substitute, so I will continue to buy on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Got these in hope that they would be a stronger version of the [[ASIN:B005E4A6KQ GUM Soft-picks]]. Sadly, this was in fact true, but at the cost of the thickness being too large to fit between my teeth. Guess I&#x27;m back to using the soft-picks. I suggest trying out some [[ASIN:B002YGHXPS floss picks]] as well if neither do the job.</li>
            <li> These are not plaque removers or even tooth picks. Horrible. They fall apart before you can clean your teeth and do not fit between your teeth. Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Have been using them for quite a few years and they work very well for me.  Hard to find in the stores so was happy to find them on line.</li>
            <li> My 91 year old loves these toothpicks - he has a pack by his recliner in the den, a pack in his car, a pack in his office, etc.  I am a repeat customer for this item.</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find in stores any more.  Very good price for so many that are encluded.  Always work well, much better than toothpicks. Great to use when not flossing. Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting food out from between my teeth and cleaning my teeth.  Recommended by dental hygienist.  I couldn&#x27;t find them in my small town, but found them in a new store.</li>
            <li> These slender wedge-shaped balsa wood picks slide gently between the teeth and clean the sides of the teeth where otherwise only floss would reach. The balsa wood doesn&#x27;t splinter, and is just soft enough to compress a bit as you push them in, giving you a light friction against the tooth surface and polishing it clean.  They have been around forever, and are just as handy today as they were 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use these, then you need to give them a try.  You&#x27;ll like them!</li>
            <li> They were just what I was used to using and at a good price.</li>
            <li> A pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> Yhese are the best tootpicks on the market. After putting them in your mouth, let them soften up a bit before using them, or the tips will break off.</li>
            <li> The ones sold by \\&quot;Natural Dentist\\&quot; are made is China.  I have found the quality is inferior. I have had them splinter and break. I am hoping to find some that are like the original product.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
