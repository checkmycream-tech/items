            <li>and it works great</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>If you run out of bottled shampoo, this would be a great substitute.  </li>
            <li>Really great stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great product.</li>

            <li>Another great transaction, love the product!</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have officially switched my shampoo for good.</li>
            <li>(that was the reason I purchased it - thinking it would smell good.</li>
            <li>I have read a lot about the Liggett&#x27;s shampoos and thought it might be a good change.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suds up nice and isn&#x27;t too perfumey.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>They lather nicely.  </li>
            <li>They pack nicely because of their size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss because my scalp feels wonderful, moisturized, not flaky, not itchy, not dry.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but I fell in love with J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo..  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>have waist-length hair, so keeping my hair healthy is problematic.</li>
            <li>My favorite is jojoba and peppermint.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite hair soaps.  </li>
            <li>My scalp has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I purchased the herbal scent but it is very mild and&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>I love how clean this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t experienced any build up and dont currently use Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li>An overall great hair product.</li>
            <li>They lather just like regular shampoo and make my hair feel and smell amazing!</li>
            <li>I do wish the rosemary fragrance lingered longer, but my hair just stays smelling like clean.</li>
            <li>I totally didn&#x27;t expect it to be so good though.</li>
            <li>I have been using cheap $2.00 shampoo&#x27;s for many years and finally thought it was time to start using something with more natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>It left my hair flat and with fly aways, something the Tee Tree Oil, Peppermint oil, Aragon oil and Balanced bars do not.</li>
            <li>My second favorite from JR Liggett.</li>
            <li>Perhaps others with different hair type will have better hair results.</li>
            <li>Then I rub some of it on the top of my head, some on the top of my hair that hangs down and the the underside of that same mass of hair.</li>
            <li>leave-in on the very ends.  </li>
            <li>Really saves time and hassle in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love this product and wholeheartedly recommend it, with the caveat that I have not tried other bar shampoos.</li>
            <li>I had oily, sensitive and flaky scalp and with a couple swipes of the bar around my wet head, I can massage the lovely lather all around.</li>
            <li>One of these bars lathered up as well as any liquid shampoo, lasted as long as a normal size bottle and left our hair in better shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a week now everyday and will say that my hair feels much cleaner, brighter and more natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with fine, stringy, oily hair all of my adult life, and had established a delusional program of shampooing daily, alternating two to three different products, presuming that each was preventing or removing the residue of the others.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair and it leaves it full and soft.  </li>
            <li>I tried using a coconut oil conditioner but that only left my hair super oily.</li>
            <li>I wanted to switch my shampoo to something natural, and was intrigued by the idea of a bar shampoo.</li>
            <li>Once your hair is wet, it only takes a couple of swipes of the bar over your head on the top and around the back and sides.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going with the action of working up a lather in my hands with the bar, then applying the lather to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have been using natural products for months now and it is always a struggle figure out which one works for you.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>Not only did it beat down my ridiculously oily scalp, It left my hair thick and full, restored the natural wave that oiliness had flattened into submission, and kept it that way for more than 24 hours, which is more than i can say for any product i have used before.</li>
            <li>These soaps last a longggggg time and there is no harsh ingredients or chemicals in them.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, naturally oily hair if that helps.</li>
            <li>I know there is another method of sliding a solid shampoo bar down the hair, but I really don&#x27;t think that is going to improve my hair</li>
            <li>I do have soft water, so if your water is hard, you may not get as much lather.  </li>

            <li> With traditional shampoo and conditioner, my hair was flat and never quite manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair is very soft, fuller, and tangles less.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and it feel out it clumps in the shower.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this&lt;br /&gt;instead of shampoos with ingredient lists a mile long.  </li>
            <li> Looks like i will get two months out of this 3.5 oz bar with almost daily use (old habits are hard to break) for long hair (shoulder plus about four inches).</li>
            <li> It lathers very well with just a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and a very sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> Do not really like the smell either</li>
            <li> I started using a homemade recipe which worked but not very well.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other product in my hair either.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the finest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more dandruff issues, no more itching, hair loss under control.</li>
            <li> I have already received my order for the variety pack of Virgin Coconut &amp; Argan Oil, Tea Tree &amp; Hemp Oil, and Jojoba &amp; Peppermint, which I am anxious to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the soap&#x27;s fault, the hard water is the problem.  </li>
            <li> but I can estimate I will probably get three months use at least out of a bar.  </li>
            <li> Within a few hours of drying after a shampoo, my hair was matted and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Desperate, I decided to try the JR Liggett&#x27;s Herbal Formula.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>

            <li> I switched from regular shampoo to shampoo bars about 3 months ago and I love it. I have tried several different kinds of shampoo bars but I fell in love with J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.  They lather just like regular shampoo and make my hair feel and smell amazing! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo..  I have fine thin hair and it leaves it full and soft.  I don&#x27;t use a conditioner anymore only&lt;br /&gt;a leave-in on the very ends.  It lathers very well with just a very small amount.  I will continue to use this&lt;br /&gt;instead of shampoos with ingredient lists a mile long.  I purchased the herbal scent but it is very mild and&lt;br /&gt;not overpowering.  The packaging is so quaint - like something from days gone by.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great to skip TSA bottle</li>
            <li> Hands down, the finest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist-length hair, so keeping my hair healthy is problematic. With traditional shampoo and conditioner, my hair was flat and never quite manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, my mother bought me a bar of this soap at an organic store. Boy, was I ever impressed! I&#x27;ve been using it since May and my hair is very soft, fuller, and tangles less. I use it daily with no conditioner. Really saves time and hassle in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love how clean this makes my hair feel. It&#x27;s suds up nice and isn&#x27;t too perfumey.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for use on children since it does sting when it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo.  I have thick hair and a very sensitive scalp and it works great</li>
            <li> Very good. My second favorite from JR Liggett. My favorite is jojoba and peppermint. No more dandruff issues, no more itching, hair loss under control.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch my shampoo to something natural, and was intrigued by the idea of a bar shampoo. I totally didn&#x27;t expect it to be so good though. One of these bars lathered up as well as any liquid shampoo, lasted as long as a normal size bottle and left our hair in better shape. Good stuff. I have officially switched my shampoo for good.</li>
            <li> Out of all the Liggetts bar shampoos I have tried, this one does not do the job. It left my hair flat and with fly aways, something the Tee Tree Oil, Peppermint oil, Aragon oil and Balanced bars do not. Do not really like the smell either (that was the reason I purchased it - thinking it would smell good. Prefer the Peppermint for that now!)</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  If you run out of bottled shampoo, this would be a great substitute.  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> I have been using cheap $2.00 shampoo&#x27;s for many years and finally thought it was time to start using something with more natural ingredients.  I have read a lot about the Liggett&#x27;s shampoos and thought it might be a good change.  I&#x27;ve used it a week now everyday and will say that my hair feels much cleaner, brighter and more natural.  The scent is nice and not overbearing.  My hair is not oily the next morning.  The bar is on the smaller side but I can estimate I will probably get three months use at least out of a bar.  Once your hair is wet, it only takes a couple of swipes of the bar over your head on the top and around the back and sides.  I get lots of lather.  I do have soft water, so if your water is hard, you may not get as much lather.  It&#x27;s not the soap&#x27;s fault, the hard water is the problem.  Shipping was fast and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic deal&lt;br /&gt;Deliver the shipment on time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to cooperate with you again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Really great stuff. I noticed a difference in my hair almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to use condition with this bar. I had oily, sensitive and flaky scalp and with a couple swipes of the bar around my wet head, I can massage the lovely lather all around. I let it sit while I finish my shower and rinse it out. Haven&#x27;t experienced any build up and dont currently use Apple Cider Vinegar. Just this by itself and even after over a week I haven&#x27;t even noticed a dent in the bar. I do wish the rosemary fragrance lingered longer, but my hair just stays smelling like clean. I even get volume while airdrying and my curls stay intact which I used to have to try and mix shampoo and conditioners to get moisture without weight.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite hair soaps.  Since I discovered these, I don&#x27;t even use liquid shampoo anymore.  These soaps last a longggggg time and there is no harsh ingredients or chemicals in them.  They lather nicely.  Doesn&#x27;t take but one swipe on your head to get the cleaning you need for your hair.  They pack nicely because of their size.  An overall great hair product.</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for years. Love it!</li>
            <li> My scalp feels cleaner after using this product. My hair is another story. My hair is now stringy,heavy and waxy in texture. I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss because my scalp feels wonderful, moisturized, not flaky, not itchy, not dry. But my hair is suffering. I&#x27;ve read different ways to apply solid shampoo bars to the head. I&#x27;ve been going with the action of working up a lather in my hands with the bar, then applying the lather to my scalp. I know there is another method of sliding a solid shampoo bar down the hair, but I really don&#x27;t think that is going to improve my hair situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product. My scalp has never felt better. Maybe it&#x27;s my type of hair. (I have coarse,thick,frizzy hair.) Perhaps others with different hair type will have better hair results.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I have been using natural products for months now and it is always a struggle figure out which one works for you. I started using a homemade recipe which worked but not very well. It left my hair dry and it feel out it clumps in the shower. I tried using a coconut oil conditioner but that only left my hair super oily. Then I found this bar. You only need a small amount. I rub it in my hands (like a bar of soap) and  count to 10. Then I rub some of it on the top of my head, some on the top of my hair that hangs down and the the underside of that same mass of hair. I have pretty long hair and that is all I do. I don&#x27;t use any other product in my hair either. I have fine, thin, naturally oily hair if that helps. My advice to anyone would be to try this wonderful product and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with fine, stringy, oily hair all of my adult life, and had established a delusional program of shampooing daily, alternating two to three different products, presuming that each was preventing or removing the residue of the others. After turning 55, my scalp went ballistic. Within a few hours of drying after a shampoo, my hair was matted and disgusting. It was awful. Desperate, I decided to try the JR Liggett&#x27;s Herbal Formula. Was i ever impressed! Not only did it beat down my ridiculously oily scalp, It left my hair thick and full, restored the natural wave that oiliness had flattened into submission, and kept it that way for more than 24 hours, which is more than i can say for any product i have used before. And, yes, all of this without the need for conditioner. Looks like i will get two months out of this 3.5 oz bar with almost daily use (old habits are hard to break) for long hair (shoulder plus about four inches). I have already received my order for the variety pack of Virgin Coconut &amp; Argan Oil, Tea Tree &amp; Hemp Oil, and Jojoba &amp; Peppermint, which I am anxious to try. I love this product and wholeheartedly recommend it, with the caveat that I have not tried other bar shampoos.</li>
            <li> Another great transaction, love the product!</li>
