            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>I ordered five cases and after the use of fifty razors I ordered five more cases.</li>
            <li>They are used in a health care facility is why we use so many.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent but very basic disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>Functionality is simple and effective, so it&#x27;s good for their need.</li>
            <li>Now it is fine</li>
            <li>These work perfectly fine</li>
            <li>These are pretty decent razors at an insanely great price.  </li>
            <li>But with the huge quantity, you can do that.</li>
            <li>But at this cheap price, that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li>At 0.30 cents per razor (when I bought them) this was the cheapest option available.  </li>
            <li>to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Cheap, cheap razors.  </li>
            <li>you want a clean surface but dont want to irritate the area first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade is not quite strong or positioned right angle(s), according to him.  </li>
            <li>Great quantity and price too for our limited budget!</li>
            <li>Good enough disposable razor to use in a tattoo shop.</li>
            <li>If they&#x27;re good enough to shave animal hair they can handle my puny whiskers.</li>
            <li>It could work perfectly for someone who has easy hair to take care...not for someone who has tough hair like my husband.</li>
            <li>great little razors for tattooing</li>
            <li>I generally prefer the twin blade razors since they&#x27;re thinner than the triple blades and conform to the shape of your face better.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY!</li>
            <li>Better quality &amp; cheaper per razor price than the generic razors I had been purchasing at Wal-Mart!</li>
            <li>These are as good as or even better than the expensive disposable razors.</li>
            <li>After he used the blade from the major brand, he noticed the huge quality difference between then.  </li>
            <li>I got them to put in first aid kits and defibrillator cases; in which case it&#x27;s a real money saver.</li>
            <li>But in this case, I find it takes way too much effort to get a close shave with these razors.</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re so cheap I only use them 1 or 2 times and then toss them.</li>
            <li>and I realize that I do not have to put as much pressure on these blades as I have had to do with others.</li>
            <li>does the job really well.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and efficient, would definitely buy again when I run out (wont be for a while though ;-) )</li>
            <li>I had to use two razors just to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t comprehend exactly how many razors I was ordering and was a little surprised by the size of the box.</li>
            <li>Has provided a clean close shave without those unexplained nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, fast shipping and yes razors are good for just one of two shaves but at this price its a deal comared to the crazy muti-blade razor prices</li>
            <li>I would personally give them a &amp;#34;-1 star&amp;#34; if possible because I could not shave one full leg before it dulled out.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, and we&#x27;re usually only shaving the tiny hair on a woman&#x27;s wrist.</li>
            <li>I usually only shave with the razor once or twice a week at most and use an electric when I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li>If you have a small area to shave for a single use I think they may be ok.  </li>
            <li>I am a school nurse and these basic razors are stocked in my clinic so the young men at our private high school can shave (if their grooming doesn&#x27;t meet the uniform standard) during the school day.</li>
            <li>One caution though, the blades were very sharp and I cut myself a lot the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>cheap, but if you have tough beard like me, this product is not a reliable alternative</li>

            <li> These blades are not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> at this price (less than $20 for 300 razors), whos counting.</li>
            <li> These are truly disposable razors - dull after one use.......not recommended for those who want to leave as small a carbon imprint as possible.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the razor with removable double edge blade for a while and kept cutting myself, especially with the corners.  </li>
            <li> They are just if not better than any 10 pack disposable</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m set for at least a few years!</li>
            <li> That is absolutely ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> These razors are very dull; they will cut your face.  </li>

            <li> I am a school nurse and these basic razors are stocked in my clinic so the young men at our private high school can shave (if their grooming doesn&#x27;t meet the uniform standard) during the school day. As one may imagine, we go through A LOT of razors. These fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> These blades are not worth the money.  It takes too long for me to get a close shave because the blades are not very sharp and the head doesn&#x27;t pivot. I generally prefer the twin blade razors since they&#x27;re thinner than the triple blades and conform to the shape of your face better. But in this case, I find it takes way too much effort to get a close shave with these razors.</li>
            <li> For the cost the razors work well.  Get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> I purchaesed there for my church, as we work with our many unhoused neighbors in DC and they are great for folks trying to clean up for the spring.  Great quantity and price too for our limited budget!</li>
            <li> Good enough disposable razor to use in a tattoo shop. The price is right, and we&#x27;re usually only shaving the tiny hair on a woman&#x27;s wrist. For a hairy mans back, we might have to use 1/2dozen razors. But at this cheap price, that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> great little razors for tattooing</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, and the quality is the same as any other disposable I have purchased before.  Just know what it is that you are buying.  These are not meant to be expensive razors, they are inexpensive bulk and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> We only received 6 packs that contained 10 razors totaling 60 razors.  There should be 300.</li>
            <li> These razors are very dull; they will cut your face.  Not recommended.  I had to use two razors just to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> We purchased thease and we are again my husband was happy with them  would love if they came with a bag holder for them</li>
            <li> These are truly disposable razors - dull after one use.......not recommended for those who want to leave as small a carbon imprint as possible. I got them to put in first aid kits and defibrillator cases; in which case it&#x27;s a real money saver.</li>
            <li> At 0.30 cents per razor (when I bought them) this was the cheapest option available.  I only use these disposable razors once and then throw them away as the blades are always torn up by the end of the shave.  I usually only shave with the razor once or twice a week at most and use an electric when I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> Was purchasing for a donation for Halo, so the quantity was great. Functionality is simple and effective, so it&#x27;s good for their need.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, fast shipping and yes razors are good for just one of two shaves but at this price its a deal comared to the crazy muti-blade razor prices</li>
            <li> Bought these razors and used my Prime Acct. to get free shipping. These are as good as or even better than the expensive disposable razors. The price was excellent too.</li>
            <li> I give these a 1 star rating because my husband said they are ok for shaving his face.  I would personally give them a &amp;#34;-1 star&amp;#34; if possible because I could not shave one full leg before it dulled out.  If you have a small area to shave for a single use I think they may be ok.  I would not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> cheap, but if you have tough beard like me, this product is not a reliable alternative</li>
            <li> These were shipped from a vet supply store. If they&#x27;re good enough to shave animal hair they can handle my puny whiskers. These actually seem sharper than the yellow handled BICS I usually buy. Since they&#x27;re so cheap I only use them 1 or 2 times and then toss them. I didn&#x27;t comprehend exactly how many razors I was ordering and was a little surprised by the size of the box. I only shave like once or twice a week so I&#x27;m set for at least a few years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with them.  I decided to try the razor with removable double edge blade for a while and kept cutting myself, especially with the corners.  These do well enough for me with thorough washing before shaving.</li>
            <li> Well package and as described.  One caution though, the blades were very sharp and I cut myself a lot the first time I used them.  Now it is fine and I realize that I do not have to put as much pressure on these blades as I have had to do with others.</li>
            <li> We occasionally have to shave body hair in order for our taping techniques to stay on. These work perfectly fine</li>
            <li> They work great. They are just if not better than any 10 pack disposable I&#x27;ve purchased from any store. Has provided a clean close shave without those unexplained nicks or cuts. I ordered five cases and after the use of fifty razors I ordered five more cases. They are used in a health care facility is why we use so many.</li>
            <li> Found this really good deal when i was looking for something to shave my head with.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job really well. Although the razors last only a shave or two at the most.&lt;br /&gt;But at this price (less than $20 for 300 razors), whos counting. Delivery was quick and efficient, would definitely buy again when I run out (wont be for a while though ;-) )</li>
            <li> My husband told me that this is not the winner from the competition.  After he used the blade from the major brand, he noticed the huge quality difference between then.  The blade is not quite strong or positioned right angle(s), according to him.  This twin blade is priced nicely.  It could work perfectly for someone who has easy hair to take care...not for someone who has tough hair like my husband.</li>
            <li> Are these the best shaving razors in the universe? Nahhh. Are they awesome for the price? ABSOLUTELY! Better quality &amp; cheaper per razor price than the generic razors I had been purchasing at Wal-Mart! If you have a little bit of extra closet space pick up these 300 razors and you&#x27;ll be set for awhile!</li>
            <li> These are pretty decent razors at an insanely great price.  300 for $27!  That is absolutely ridiculous.  I would definitely buy again -- after my year supply runs out!</li>
            <li> No lubricating strips on these razors they are a step up from the razor you get in jail. Still a good price</li>
            <li> great for tattooing without breaking the bank which is important.  you want a clean surface but dont want to irritate the area first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you use on face, i cant help you as we just shave hairy arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Cheap, cheap razors.  But I use one daily in the shower (I am female) and then pitch it.  No re-using of these babies.  But with the huge quantity, you can do that.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent but very basic disposable razor.  The head does not swivel and there is no gel strip but the blade quality is very good and the price is outstanding.</li>
