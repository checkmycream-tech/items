            <li>RefectoCil Cream Hair Dye (NATURAL BROWN) is perfect to use.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to see it on Amazon, as initially I had to go through a specialized Beauty Supplies.  </li>
            <li>Many of the so called \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; dyes, including some sold at health stores, also contain PPD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you choose the correct color.</li>
            <li>You will probably stain the towel, so make sure it is</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is best to do it at night before bed, then exfoliate the area the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I have used a lot of tints, This one is my favorite &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>better than paying for salon treatment.  </li>
            <li>the the vitiligo turned most of my eye brow white.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to mix, much better than henna.</li>
            <li>I want a full refund!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mix with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I started using this product for my eye brows and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It colors quickly, so wipe off and check!</li>
            <li>If your brows are really light like mine</li>
            <li>i found this product I was so excited.</li>
            <li>Works great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Amazing brow tint and lash tint  love the color and it lasts so long</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month now and every week I have to re-do them because the color fades quickly.</li>
            <li>My upper lashes and brows look amazing</li>
            <li>It only takes 10 minutes to set though, so it&#x27;s very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>and it says right on it: \\&quot;This product must not be used for dyeing eyelashes or eyebrows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;im very light skin, so this illness isn&#x27;t so apparent on me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and let a natural look.</li>
            <li>Maybe couple of years back ago they made it better quality.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to try dying my brows and lashes for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>I am blonde, and I dye my lashes and brows to give my face more definition.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I dye my lashes first then go in for extensions</li>
            <li>have white spots all over my body and most of the pigmentation on my face is gone</li>
            <li>can just put on some sunscreen and go hiking without having to do my eyebrow, and without having people look at me funny</li>
            <li>I can dye my brows while getting ready for an evening out - not days in advance.</li>
            <li>Guys, if you have been burned by the PPD in just for men, you need to be very carefull about the ingredients in any product.</li>
            <li>This product really works well .</li>
            <li>was spending so much money on whole boxes of hair dye just to do my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recomend this product.</li>
            <li>I could of used the light brown since I am a blonde, but the medium still worked out.</li>
            <li>It was very embarrassing</li>
            <li>I really like it, it does work well</li>
            <li>i really like this product because about 3 years ago i began to get Vitiligo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t leave the color on for more than 30 secs the first time you use it, just in case it&#x27;s too dark.</li>
            <li>I have used two other similar brands and this is by far the darkest and quickest to take which is great</li>
            <li>Not quite dark enough for lashes unless your guest is extremely fair.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the flimsy packaging came all beaten up and looked as if someone had ripped the top open and put it back together.</li>
            <li>I love this product and actually mix it with regular over the counter hydrogen peroxide using a disposable mascara wand.</li>
            <li>it last, i wash my face 2-3 times a day and my brow looks the same no fading after a week :)</li>
            <li>Color is very rich and if you&#x27;re blonde, maybe try a lighter shade for brows or only leave it on for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, I bought this item a little more than a year ago</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always have a old towel ready to blot your eyes as they may sting a bit.  </li>
            <li>Then I wipe most of it away with a cotton ball and earbud, and wash my face with soap and water a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dye is far better than the Tintocil dye I previously used.</li>
            <li>I got the product it clearly says on the tube \\&quot;this product must not be used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows;</li>
            <li>saves a fortune too - not having to know to a spa that offers tinting for $35 a pop.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and it works fast too, but it will also stain your fingers if you touch it accidentally..</li>
            <li>the natural brown has a ton of orange in it</li>
            <li>Complete scam.  </li>
            <li>B0013ZGQNG RefectoCil Cream Hair Dye (NATURAL BROWN) .5oz]]I purchased this cream at a salon in Toronto to tint my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Like the color- looks natural</li>
            <li>dyed both eyebrows with the natural brown color.</li>
            <li>First off, the company sells them separately, and is not clear that you need both in order to work.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it though because it makes it very quick to get dark brows.</li>
            <li>Be very careful not to get on your skin, as it stains just as quickly and takes several days to fade off the skin.</li>
            <li>I understand that this is becoming a common problem and may be related to a change in formula.</li>
            <li>After years of using \\&quot;Just for Men\\&quot; dye on my beard, I developed a chemical burn or allergic reaction to it that left my face swollen, itching and weeping clear fluid.</li>
            <li>And obviously, it needed another product to complete it&#x27;s use</li>
            <li>My clients feel that their lash and brow tints last longe when we use Reflectocil, there is simply no other product like it</li>
            <li>I remember I used to apply on my eyebrows and it would last a month with the color, while now it barely stays on for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I was using messy tablets and they made a huge mess, no matter whether I wore gloves or not.</li>

            <li> I was using messy tablets and they made a huge mess, no matter whether I wore gloves or not.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and finally am running low.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this on my lashes as well, but left it stay on my lashes as long as I can before removing it.</li>
            <li> It looks a little harsh the first day, but then it blends in.</li>
            <li> The dark brown barely gave my brows any color.</li>
            <li> This hair dye does not stay on as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> so looks natural even in the sun and is heavy duty for those stubborn greys.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> totally recommend this product to anyone who has vitiligo and needs a little help with the white hair patches</li>
            <li> In addition was shipped without any instructions in English and only realized what was missing by U-tube.</li>
            <li> She uses very little and it goes a far way.</li>
            <li> big tinted dark patch on my skin,</li>
            <li> know this little tube is going to last a long time and when it runs out, I&#x27;ll buy another.  </li>
            <li> It provides a darker color with less red irritation around the brow.</li>
            <li> A small amount of dye you mixed up with a second product.  </li>
            <li> but beware if you are used to others that can sit on your eyebrows for several minutes, not this product, on and off unless you want very dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Many men are having bad reactions to it.</li>
            <li> Product really helped me, its silly but having two eye brows of the same color saves me</li>
            <li> , my face is coated with Hydrocortisone cream, that I have to replace every few hours, because the weeping fluid keeps running it off.</li>
            <li> My bottom lashes are short so the round cotton pad cut in 2 didn&#x27;t let the dye get to them.</li>
            <li> It came highly recommended by the lady working behind the counter.  </li>
            <li> WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and used very little on my brows, after I mixed the ingredients and put the dye on I</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, usually in about a week and a half I have to touch it up again.</li>
            <li> I did some research, and the problem seems to be that the active ingredient in both dyes is Phenylenediamine, or PPD.</li>
            <li> The swelling went down after a few days and the redness went away leaving dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> I leave them on for about 15 minutes and they are soo dark to start out with but soon fade.</li>
            <li> was a little nervous about the result, but I must say my apprehension was unfounded.  </li>
            <li> With all said and done, I did look a little closer at the packaging to realize that it does indeed say not to use this product around your eyes.</li>
            <li> because i have little to no pigment on my face</li>
            <li> She does warn not to forget it on, because you will have very dark brows then</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Giving a product a poor rating because you couldn&#x27;t use it or didn&#x27;t have all the items you needed to use it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me because the product WORKS when you actually do use</li>
            <li> It was hard to measure and lots of waste.</li>
            <li> I received the product I followed the instructions on mixing a small amount and put a test spot on my belly.</li>
            <li> I apply the dye thickly and wait 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So disappointed :o(</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, the Refectocil dye was sold by Online Beauty Supply, not Amazon, and they will not accept returns.</li>
            <li> no English instructions included so it&#x27;s worthless unless I feel like getting them</li>
            <li> I recommend being very careful there:(</li>
            <li> She has tried a different product once and was very disappointed, she said she will never use anything else but refectocil.</li>
            <li> When I ordered I didn&#x27;t know that you also needed to order an activator, so this is useless to me without it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> She was drawing them in, and the effect was very fake.  </li>
            <li> It was like I had a really bad sun burn.  </li>
            <li> , it is bad that they don&#x27;t tell you from start that you need another product sort of a developer for this</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad and works.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> the color looks awful -</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Definitelly the best eyebrow dye. Lasts a long time! Easy to mix, much better than henna. Color is perfect, very natural.</li>
            <li> The product description states that it is for eyelashes and brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got the product it clearly says on the tube \\&quot;this product must not be used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows; to do so may cause blindness.\\&quot; I did not use it, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and finally am running low.  I was very happy to see it on Amazon, as initially I had to go through a specialized Beauty Supplies.  Works great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I prefer to dye my own brows. Amazon helped me find this product and it works well. I can dye my brows while getting ready for an evening out - not days in advance. The color covers the greys nicely and lasts so that I don&#x27;t have to &#x27;mark&#x27; my brows for weeks!</li>
            <li> LOVE this item! My facialist recommended this to me when I was at a 5star spa in Florida and I have used it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;It saves a fortune too - not having to know to a spa that offers tinting for $35 a pop.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t leave the color on for more than 30 secs the first time you use it, just in case it&#x27;s too dark. And remember you can mix colors to get your perfect tone.</li>
            <li> Does not work! The dark brown barely gave my brows any color. On second note, it made my eyebrows itchy and burn. Not to mention the flimsy packaging came all beaten up and looked as if someone had ripped the top open and put it back together. Waste of money. I want a full refund!</li>
            <li> After years of using \\&quot;Just for Men\\&quot; dye on my beard, I developed a chemical burn or allergic reaction to it that left my face swollen, itching and weeping clear fluid. I understand that this is becoming a common problem and may be related to a change in formula. Since I obviously cannot use that product anymore, I bought a tube of Refectocil cream and a bottle of the Oxidant chemical that has to be mixed with it. First off, the company sells them separately, and is not clear that you need both in order to work. Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product I followed the instructions on mixing a small amount and put a test spot on my belly. The instructions said to wait 24 hrs. to see if there was a reaction. after 36 hrs I had no reaction and applied it to my beard. Shortly, the spot on my belly flared up, and about 12 hrs after application my face began to develop the same problem I had with JFM. Just as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I type this, my face is coated with Hydrocortisone cream, that I have to replace every few hours, because the weeping fluid keeps running it off. I did some research, and the problem seems to be that the active ingredient in both dyes is Phenylenediamine, or PPD. Many men are having bad reactions to it. I was going to go to Brown Betty, by Betty Beauty, as my next possible alternative, but I see that it also contains PPD. Many of the so called \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; dyes, including some sold at health stores, also contain PPD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try a Henna based product next. Guys, if you have been burned by the PPD in just for men, you need to be very carefull about the ingredients in any product. To make matters worse, the Refectocil dye was sold by Online Beauty Supply, not Amazon, and they will not accept returns.</li>
            <li> This product really works well . If your brows are really light like mine I think you&#x27;d love it. I will buy again. the price is really great too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is great for eyebrows! I am so glad to purchase it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 3 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always tattooed my eyebrows, but I dont shave them, so i have still had to die them.&lt;br /&gt;I was spending so much money on whole boxes of hair dye just to do my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i found this product I was so excited. When I opened it, the die had a reddish color to it, I just thought that it would change color once it started to set in on the hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the dye on for 45 minutes!!! And not one ounce of color clung to the hair! It did absolutely nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed :o(</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and this is the only product she has been using for years. She has blond eyebrows and lashes and uses this color. She has tried a different product once and was very disappointed, she said she will never use anything else but refectocil. It&#x27;s easy to mix with the [[ASIN:B0013Z9HDM RefectoCil Oxidant 3% 10 VOL 1.7oz]]. She uses very little and it goes a far way. She does warn not to forget it on, because you will have very dark brows then</li>
            <li> I started using this product for my eye brows and it is easy to use. I didn&#x27;t purchase the developer but it still worked, I just had to leave it on longer. I&#x27;ve read reviews of others using hydrogen peroxide instead of the developer and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product, if you want good quality dye for you eyebrows and your eye lashes this is the one.</li>
            <li> I have used two other similar brands and this is by far the darkest and quickest to take which is great but beware if you are used to others that can sit on your eyebrows for several minutes, not this product, on and off unless you want very dark eyebrows. Be very careful not to get on your skin, as it stains just as quickly and takes several days to fade off the skin. I would definitely recommend it though because it makes it very quick to get dark brows.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and it works fast too, but it will also stain your fingers if you touch it accidentally..</li>
            <li> I love this product and actually mix it with regular over the counter hydrogen peroxide using a disposable mascara wand. It takes about a minute of mashing and mixing to get it well blended. It need only be left on brows a minute or 2. I&#x27;m using this on my lashes as well, but left it stay on my lashes as long as I can before removing it. I reapply every 10 days or so. This DOES sting the eyes when putting on lashes - stings A LOT. Color is very rich and if you&#x27;re blonde, maybe try a lighter shade for brows or only leave it on for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> 1. The product package is written in a different language and so are the instructions....no English instructions included so it&#x27;s worthless unless I feel like getting them translated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. the color looks awful - the natural brown has a ton of orange in it</li>
            <li> This hair dye does not stay on as long as it used to. Maybe couple of years back ago they made it better quality. I remember I used to apply on my eyebrows and it would last a month with the color, while now it barely stays on for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Works great. Color is perfect</li>
            <li> love this stuff iv had it for years and still have a ton left, the color is perfect too.</li>
            <li> Cannot rate this item....  When I ordered I didn&#x27;t know that you also needed to order an activator, so this is useless to me without it.</li>
            <li> It is an incomplete product and unusable.  I paid just under $20 for it and can&#x27;t use it without buying another product to mix with it.  There was no mention of this and it should not be sold separately.  Complete scam.  In addition was shipped without any instructions in English and only realized what was missing by U-tube.</li>
            <li> This dye is far better than the Tintocil dye I previously used. It provides a darker color with less red irritation around the brow. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, usually in about a week and a half I have to touch it up again. It only takes 10 minutes to set though, so it&#x27;s very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product as always, I have used RefectoCil for years and years for myself and my customers when having my salon in Europe. Works great every time and this is a brand to trust.</li>
            <li> You cannot use this product without mixing with 10 to 20 drops of another one of their products.  Of course, they didn&#x27;t tell you this!  Also directions say not to use on eyebrows!  I&#x27;m looking forward to returning and getting my money back.  What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how simple the product worked and how it covered my gray.  My brows were getting thinner and thinner as I meticulously plucked out the gray hairs.  The color was perfect and I will never pluck out my gray hairs in my brows again!  I did drop a bit in my sink and will forever have a speck of brown in my sink, so I recommend being very careful there:(</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!! I Love it. I am using it and it&#x27;s a very good product. I really recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and every week I have to re-do them because the color fades quickly. I use the oxidant that is also from this company. I leave them on for about 15 minutes and they are soo dark to start out with but soon fade. Not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try dying my brows and lashes for the first time ever. I love it! The only thing I would suggest is also buying the papers for under your eyes. My bottom lashes are short so the round cotton pad cut in 2 didn&#x27;t let the dye get to them. My upper lashes and brows look amazing and I will buy this product forever.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use and comes out a great result. Just make sure you choose the correct color.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for thirty-something years (no kidding).  I am blonde, and I dye my lashes and brows to give my face more definition.  I recently started doing my mother-in-laws brows too.  She was drawing them in, and the effect was very fake.  She is delighted with the look, and doesn&#x27;t have to draw her brows on every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it in a plastic lid and use Chapstick to protect the skin around my brows and lashes. I apply the dye thickly and wait 5 minutes.  Then I wipe most of it away with a cotton ball and earbud, and wash my face with soap and water a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always have a old towel ready to blot your eyes as they may sting a bit.  You will probably stain the towel, so make sure it is old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is not go get it in your eyes, so don&#x27;t mix it runny.  If you do get it in your eyes, wash it off and start again.  I always fill the sink with warm water before I start the process, just in case I get it in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is best to do it at night before bed, then exfoliate the area the next morning.  It looks a little harsh the first day, but then it blends in.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!  Exactly what I was looking for.  It works great and is easy to apply.  I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I bought this item a little more than a year ago and I kept telling myself I needed to tint my brows since I had the stuff to do it.  Well, since I put the &#x27;Pro&#x27; in procrastination, it took me a year to finally use it and WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and used very little on my brows, after I mixed the ingredients and put the dye on I was a little nervous about the result, but I must say my apprehension was unfounded.  My brows were one color and the product came off with no problem or staining of my skin.  I have had my brows tinted in a salon, so I wasn&#x27;t worried about an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the tint on October 25 and it is still holding up.  Some of the white hairs have started to grow in so I&#x27;ll have to do a touch up soon, but the color on my brows has not faded at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those people who rated this low because they didn&#x27;t realize they needed the Oxidant, the only thing I can wonder is why didn&#x27;t you do research on this?  Giving a product a poor rating because you couldn&#x27;t use it or didn&#x27;t have all the items you needed to use it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me because the product WORKS when you actually do use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this little tube is going to last a long time and when it runs out, I&#x27;ll buy another.  This is definitely a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller...thanks!</li>
            <li> My clients feel that their lash and brow tints last longe when we use Reflectocil, there is simply no other product like it</li>
            <li> This is a really nice chocolate brown color. The color can last 3-4 weeks. I have used a lot of tints, This one is my favorite &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have used this before and when I was out I couldn&#x27;t find it at any of the beauty suppliers.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  I could of used the light brown since I am a blonde, but the medium still worked out.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0013ZGQNG RefectoCil Cream Hair Dye (NATURAL BROWN) .5oz]]I purchased this cream at a salon in Toronto to tint my eyebrows.  It came highly recommended by the lady working behind the counter.  I did the patch test on my skin and all was good.  I followed directions and within 10 mins after removing the color the skin in the area of my brows turned red, became swollen and looked as if they were burned.  The swelling went down after a few days and the redness went away leaving dry flaky skin.  It was like I had a really bad sun burn.  It was very embarrassing and I do not recommend this product.  With all said and done, I did look a little closer at the packaging to realize that it does indeed say not to use this product around your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for just a hint of brown. I use it with brows. Not quite dark enough for lashes unless your guest is extremely fair.</li>
            <li> I really like it, it does work well, it is bad that they don&#x27;t tell you from start that you need another product sort of a developer for this&lt;br /&gt;product to work, I needed to order this separately and it took longer.</li>
            <li> I was using messy tablets and they made a huge mess, no matter whether I wore gloves or not. It was hard to measure and lots of waste. This is great! I ordered the Refectocil to mix with it. It colors quickly, so wipe off and check! I wanted brown, so it is easy to get a good shade.</li>
            <li> used for yrs. better than paying for salon treatment.  I dye my lashes first then go in for extensions</li>
            <li> This color is different than the one we use for our hair. This doesn&#x27;t turn red so looks natural even in the sun and is heavy duty for those stubborn greys.</li>
            <li> RefectoCil Cream Hair Dye (NATURAL BROWN) is perfect to use.  It&#x27;s easy to use and let a natural look. I always buy it.</li>
            <li> Like the color- looks natural</li>
            <li> Amazing brow tint and lash tint  love the color and it lasts so long</li>
            <li> i really like this product because about 3 years ago i began to get Vitiligo.&lt;br /&gt;I have white spots all over my body and most of the pigmentation on my face is gone&lt;br /&gt;im very light skin, so this illness isn&#x27;t so apparent on me BUT! because i have little to no pigment on my face the the vitiligo turned most of my eye brow white.&lt;br /&gt;i started filling it in with a brow pencil, but i would panic if i broke a sweat, or walked out of the house without filling in my eyebrow. I was scared to dye my brow because i though doing so would&lt;br /&gt;leave big tinted dark patch on my skin, like when i&#x27;ve dyed my hair darker. or the color wouldn&#x27;t work and i would end up with mismatch brows. this was not the case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching a YouTube video on brow sculpting i noticed some one using RefectoCil Cream Hair Dye. I took a chance buying it and it worked out perfect! :D&lt;br /&gt;I dyed both eyebrows with the natural brown color. I did the wipe,check and re apply to see the progress. The amazing part was i didn&#x27;t end up with any color tinted skin!&lt;br /&gt;also it last, i wash my face 2-3 times a day and my brow looks the same no fading after a week :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what i used:&lt;br /&gt;RefectoCil Cream Hair Dye&lt;br /&gt;Refectocil Oxidant 3% 10 VOL&lt;br /&gt;Disposable Eyelash Mascara Brushes&lt;br /&gt;small mixing cup&lt;br /&gt;and face towel for wipe and check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Product really helped me, its silly but having two eye brows of the same color saves me time.&lt;br /&gt;I can just put on some sunscreen and go hiking without having to do my eyebrow, and without having people look at me funny&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product to anyone who has vitiligo and needs a little help with the white hair patches</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it comes up when searching for \\&quot;brow tint\\&quot;. I got the tube and it says right on it: \\&quot;This product must not be used for dyeing eyelashes or eyebrows. Doing so may cause blindness\\&quot;. Do not buy it for lashes or brows.</li>
            <li> The directions for use were not in English - I didn&#x27;t understand anything!  And obviously, it needed another product to complete it&#x27;s use, therefore it was not usable.</li>
            <li> A small amount of dye you mixed up with a second product.  I use it to touch up eyebrows.  It does not smell bad and works.</li>
