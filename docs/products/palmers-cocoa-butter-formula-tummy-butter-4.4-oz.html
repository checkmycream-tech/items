            <li>Wife used it throughout her pregnancy with excellent results and no stretch marks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, The surface of the &amp;#34;tummy butter&amp;#34; seems flawless</li>
            <li>Best if I use it three times a day.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is still a wonderful tummy butter and relieves the itching and stretching feeling on the tummy and breasts.</li>
            <li>If the tummy butter doesn&#x27;t work for you try the lotion, it&#x27;s great!</li>

            <li>and they are lighting quickly! :D</li>
            <li>I loved the way it smelled</li>
            <li>Recommended from a girl at work who loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good ladies.</li>
            <li>good product , worked well for us</li>
            <li>My husband loved the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Good</li>
            <li>It is the most recommended one, and I thought it must be for a reason, even though it is very popular to say that it is all about genetics and your body shape too...</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This body butter smells great and it goes on smooth without being greasy.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic it rubs on great</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and had a great smell.</li>
            <li>product does have a nice soothing smell though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>actually liked the smell and</li>
            <li>I liked the texture</li>
            <li>if not the butter kind of gets everywhere .</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any kind of reaction or rash associated with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it has alleviated the itching, smells great, and lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>one star more than the palmers massage oil, based on how it relieves the discomfort of my stretching, the feel of it and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: still love it!</li>
            <li>Most products will have some kind of side effect.</li>
            <li>My advice buy it bulk, I went through 1 jar a week :)</li>
            <li>I really love this tummy butter.</li>
            <li>, it is also one of the best products for making feet baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product and Iam planning on using it threw out my pregancy .</li>
            <li>Might need more of it.</li>
            <li>I got this cream, hoping to avoid getting any more.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, used it with my pregnancy with my son four years ago and using it for this one now</li>
            <li>I had wonderful results using Bio Oil my last pregnancy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I used it.</li>
            <li>I am 6.5 months now, and I have a belly from heaven :)</li>
            <li>and I love it, but I ran out and had some tummy butter</li>
            <li>Though lavender is known for it&#x27;s soothing power, many have allergic type reactions to lavender which include the itchy, rashy descriptions given by those whose skin did not react well to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I applied more Tummy Butter to counteract the stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>This product was fantastic!</li>
            <li>love it-</li>
            <li>Plus the smell is super amazing.</li>
            <li>you are prone to stretch marks, no amount of tummy butter or cream is going to keep them from showing up, those that were lucky to have good genetics and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks are damn lucky.</li>
            <li>The most this product will do is make your skin smooth or give you a rash.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a pregnant friend and she said it worked well!</li>
            <li>Used this lotion through my whole pregnancy, love it!</li>
            <li>Though I have only used this twice, It feels and smells amazing and makes my skin feel nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li>but it shipped fast and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Palmers makes great skin products and as most told us their other Palmer products worked fine</li>
            <li>The only advice I would give is make sure u wear a kind of fitted shirt to bed like a spaghetti strap or tank  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very rich, thick, creamy butter that rubs in easily and feels very nice.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m early in my pregnancy, with everything even kind of stinky making my puke</li>
            <li>I used this product while I was pregnant with my daughter.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to all my pregnant clients and always buy it for my pregnant friends as a congratulations gift.</li>
            <li>I was using organic coconut oil and organic jojoba oil on my belly and breasts as I am 17 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>arrived quick too.</li>
            <li>I have been using this tummy butter since the moment I knew I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Although I am still pregnant (6 Months)</li>
            <li>After applying bio oil in the morning after i wake up, I use this product on my fresh stretch marks on my tummy.</li>
            <li>And finally another layer at night (with bio oil) after an exfoliated warm shower.</li>
            <li>I found out when I was five weeks and bought this right after.</li>
            <li>The scent is a cocoa butter smell that at first I wouldn&#x27;t have called \\&quot;good enough to eat\\&quot;, but after using it a few times I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it was this at first</li>
            <li>It is greasy when you put it on at first.  </li>
            <li>Used during her first pregnancy and now she&#x27;s hooked on it.</li>
            <li>The first week of using this product my stretch marks are fading.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty allergy and rash prone, but this stuff didn&#x27;t affect me in the ways others did.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was the tummy butter</li>
            <li>24- hours later and the rash is most gone.  </li>
            <li>and it make ur tummy hot</li>
            <li>They are hereditary; I did everything right to avoid them: didn&#x27;t gain weight too fast, drank TONS of water, and used coconut and bio oil up to three times a day.</li>
            <li>and I still don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark :)</li>
            <li>but still, it&#x27;s one of those little comforts I would have liked.</li>
            <li>so I really hope it goes way soon.</li>
            <li>I do have to say it started working quite well, BUT about a week after use I got a very itchy rash.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say much for how well it works as I haven&#x27;t even started using it yet</li>
            <li>Thanks Palmers</li>
            <li>This product has made my stretch marks so much lighter and the linea nigra line that i had almost disappear.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I like this product, I feel very hydrated</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t hurt as much..</li>
            <li>One tub lasted my whole pregnancy</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone trying to avoid stetch marks!</li>
            <li>I used normal Palmers Cocoa Butter for my first two pregnancies, no problem.  </li>
            <li>Not only have I not gotten any more so far, but it has dramatically reduced the appearance of the marks I had from before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my belly feels soft and hydrated and my husband said the other day when we were commenting on it &amp;#34;it feels like it had its own layer of moisture&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I gained 50 pounds during my pregnancy, my belly looked huge but after my boy was born and I droped the weight and my stomach went back to normal</li>
            <li>The rash was mainly on my belly...</li>
            <li>Like many other reviews on this product, I too developed a rash after using for about a week.</li>
            <li>I have used 3 other top rated creams for pregnancy, and this one by far goes on the smoothest and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>As many other reviewers, I developed an itchy rash all over my stomach that just won&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I did get a lot of stretch marks in my ninth month, but this stuff really did soothe the itching and made my maternity pants more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Ive been using for about a week, and I already notice a difference in the stretch marks I have acquired so far, and see no more showing up, I&#x27;m 34 weeks pregnant and this stuff is amazing, based on other reviews</li>
            <li>My belly is only growing big now, and was scared that because it hasn&#x27;t been more gradual from the beginning, but I don&#x27;t have any marks, I don&#x27;t feel dry, itchy, stretching too much....</li>
            <li>these itchy, hot, red bumps that I could not stop feeling or thinking about.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin (which I normally don&#x27;t) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Used this product 4 years ago and got no stretch marks...ordering it again for this pregnancy and starting it earlier since most say I will show earlier.</li>
            <li>I used it with my first pregnancy and have continued to use it with my second pregnancy because it&#x27;s so creamy and soothing.  </li>
            <li>only problem is it makes your hands feel funny after applying it</li>
            <li>I am 38 weeks pregnant and bought the last week, figuring I&#x27;d try something new and thicker since my belly was big</li>
            <li>Worst is going to happen, is that you couldn&#x27;t avoid the marks, but you had great skin otherwise and did all you could to prevent the marks :)</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to get rid of my old stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li>My son is 3 years old now.</li>
            <li>Many women complained that the product tingle and itch, but that just means it is working.</li>
            <li>I really feel that it helps prevents my skin from further stretching.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>i was faithfully using it at least 3 times a day or more whenever i feel itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe those that are experiencing the itchy skin and rash have developed reactions from the lavender.  </li>
            <li>Since my skin is extra dry the product soaks into my skin pretty fast.</li>
            <li>because I seriously never have reactions to topical ointments or lotions that I buy, but my husband insisted I look into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going back to using pure olive oil.</li>
            <li>I am really suffering right now and the rash showed up only after 2 uses, that tells you how much this product is not good.</li>
            <li>Smells great, hard consistency so its harder to get it out of the little tub.</li>
            <li>It left me uncomfortable for days.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to using good ole coconut oil  and bio oil now.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The more I applied, the worse the rash got.  </li>
            <li>I started out using the cream, but once my belly started to stretch the stretch marks that had mostly healed from a sudden weight gain years ago just started to get worse.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s super hard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 6 months into my second pregnancy and have a few stretch marks from my first.</li>

            <li> I have been using this tummy butter since the moment I knew I was pregnant.</li>

            <li> It is greasy when you put it on at first.  </li>
            <li> Used during her first pregnancy and now she&#x27;s hooked on it.</li>

            <li> They are hereditary; I did everything right to avoid them: didn&#x27;t gain weight too fast, drank TONS of water, and used coconut and bio oil up to three times a day.</li>
            <li> and I still don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark :)</li>
            <li> but still, it&#x27;s one of those little comforts I would have liked.</li>
            <li> so I really hope it goes way soon.</li>
            <li> I do have to say it started working quite well, BUT about a week after use I got a very itchy rash.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say much for how well it works as I haven&#x27;t even started using it yet</li>
            <li> Thanks Palmers</li>
            <li> This product has made my stretch marks so much lighter and the linea nigra line that i had almost disappear.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like this product, I feel very hydrated</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t hurt as much..</li>
            <li> One tub lasted my whole pregnancy</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone trying to avoid stetch marks!</li>
            <li> I used normal Palmers Cocoa Butter for my first two pregnancies, no problem.  </li>
            <li> Not only have I not gotten any more so far, but it has dramatically reduced the appearance of the marks I had from before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my belly feels soft and hydrated and my husband said the other day when we were commenting on it &amp;#34;it feels like it had its own layer of moisture&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I gained 50 pounds during my pregnancy, my belly looked huge but after my boy was born and I droped the weight and my stomach went back to normal</li>
            <li> The rash was mainly on my belly...</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews on this product, I too developed a rash after using for about a week.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 other top rated creams for pregnancy, and this one by far goes on the smoothest and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> As many other reviewers, I developed an itchy rash all over my stomach that just won&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did get a lot of stretch marks in my ninth month, but this stuff really did soothe the itching and made my maternity pants more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Ive been using for about a week, and I already notice a difference in the stretch marks I have acquired so far, and see no more showing up, I&#x27;m 34 weeks pregnant and this stuff is amazing, based on other reviews</li>
            <li> My belly is only growing big now, and was scared that because it hasn&#x27;t been more gradual from the beginning, but I don&#x27;t have any marks, I don&#x27;t feel dry, itchy, stretching too much....</li>
            <li> these itchy, hot, red bumps that I could not stop feeling or thinking about.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin (which I normally don&#x27;t) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used this product 4 years ago and got no stretch marks...ordering it again for this pregnancy and starting it earlier since most say I will show earlier.</li>
            <li> I used it with my first pregnancy and have continued to use it with my second pregnancy because it&#x27;s so creamy and soothing.  </li>
            <li> only problem is it makes your hands feel funny after applying it</li>
            <li> I am 38 weeks pregnant and bought the last week, figuring I&#x27;d try something new and thicker since my belly was big</li>
            <li> Worst is going to happen, is that you couldn&#x27;t avoid the marks, but you had great skin otherwise and did all you could to prevent the marks :)</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get rid of my old stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li> My son is 3 years old now.</li>
            <li> Many women complained that the product tingle and itch, but that just means it is working.</li>
            <li> I really feel that it helps prevents my skin from further stretching.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> i was faithfully using it at least 3 times a day or more whenever i feel itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe those that are experiencing the itchy skin and rash have developed reactions from the lavender.  </li>
            <li> Since my skin is extra dry the product soaks into my skin pretty fast.</li>
            <li> because I seriously never have reactions to topical ointments or lotions that I buy, but my husband insisted I look into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going back to using pure olive oil.</li>
            <li> I am really suffering right now and the rash showed up only after 2 uses, that tells you how much this product is not good.</li>
            <li> Smells great, hard consistency so its harder to get it out of the little tub.</li>
            <li> It left me uncomfortable for days.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to using good ole coconut oil  and bio oil now.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The more I applied, the worse the rash got.  </li>
            <li> I started out using the cream, but once my belly started to stretch the stretch marks that had mostly healed from a sudden weight gain years ago just started to get worse.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s super hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6 months into my second pregnancy and have a few stretch marks from my first.</li>
            <li> Very thick and rich butter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally allergic to creams</li>
            <li> My skin had been extra dry during my winter pregnancy and this product keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day for the past two months and really have barely dented that little container</li>
            <li> The rash is taking a long time to heal, and makes the skin scabby.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to relieve my extremely itchy belly during my third trimester.  </li>
            <li> The 4.4 oz tub lasted that entire time with a little left over.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a day every day along with several other products in hopes of avoiding any unwanted stretch marks.</li>
            <li> After researching I found apple cider vinegar will help relieve the itch and dry out the rash.  </li>
            <li> I thought their &amp;#34;Massage Cream&amp;#34; for stretch marks was decent but extremely thick, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I still developed small stretch marks after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works on old stretch marks yet.</li>
            <li> and I did not get one single stretch mark!  </li>
            <li> It faded my stretch marks from a dark red to a pink after a week!</li>
            <li> Now I have little red bumps all over my belly</li>
            <li> but if you start getting little itchy bumps stop immediately because scratching will only make stretch marks work and this rash makes you want to scratch a LOT!</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks on my thighs not really that noticeable</li>
            <li> I used it every day after a shower, sometimes twice and didn&#x27;t have a single stretch mark, even after going 11 days over my due date!</li>
            <li> , my husband would put this on my tummy and any other places</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s alarming, palmers should check this product!</li>
            <li> Before using this product test it out on a small area of skin; which is suggested on the back of the product anyway.  </li>
            <li> I dont sleep at night due to itchiness.</li>
            <li> and therefore I thought the itching was due to beginning to get stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> This product gave me an irritating, red rash on my belly after only one day of use.  </li>
            <li> I have developed the most awful rash I have ever had in my life!</li>
            <li> I immediately washed it off and developed large red blotchy hives that insanely itched all over my torso and belly.  </li>
            <li> I use it before laying down for bed, and give it a few minutes to soak in, then put on my pajamas.</li>
            <li> If my stomach it&#x27;s feeling tight from growing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely uncomfortable to have a big stretched out itchy stomach.</li>
            <li> I saw a little 1.1oz container of the butter at babies</li>
            <li> It may be a little greasy/&amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but hey can&#x27;t hurt to stack the deck a little in my favor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it everyday 1-2 times a day.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve been awake in the morning for a few hours I reapply.</li>
            <li> I just need to remember to reapply when tummy has dried out.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for the rash to disappear.  </li>
            <li> your money and try just the plain Palmers lotion or Bio Oil.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to it because I got a red itchy rash on my stomach :(.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this cream made me feel that I had to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, but this product made me break out into a rash that itched like crazy.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, after 2 days of only using Bio Oil, I&#x27;m still waiting for these darn bumps to go away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is because of the butter or because of genetics</li>
            <li> I spoke with a rep at Palmers and she told me she hardly receives any complaints about this product.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to apply and it leaves my skin feeling waxy and everything sticks to me, including my maternity jeans and dog hair.</li>
            <li> This tummy butter gave me a very bad rash :&#x27;( my belly is covered with those rashes and as I am pregnant, there is absolutely nothing to do to stop that itchiness!!!</li>
            <li> On the third day of using this I developed a horrible rash all over my stomach.</li>
            <li> They should seriously do a recall or discontinue it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 days since I used it and the rash is slowly going away thankfully!</li>
            <li> This gave me such an itchy bad rash!</li>
            <li> After two days of use I developed a horrible rash in the areas I applied the tummy butter.</li>
            <li> so it was weird.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a bit weird to me</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t buy this product unless you want to be miserable!!</li>
            <li> then I develop this VERY IRRITATING RASH on my belly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and unfortunately this morning I woke up to a terrible rash all over my belly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> I STILL had stretch marks, but not as bad as I feel they could have been.</li>
            <li> It is so bad</li>
            <li> Stretch marks is ugly and I use to be ashamed of my body.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible and makes me sad.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable and Itchy!</li>
            <li> It itches so bad!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> My mom had them terribly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sleep and clothes are the worst.</li>
            <li> otherwise you will end up miserable</li>
            <li> It is truly horrible.  </li>
            <li> I had terrible stretch marks</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Do not get this!!! RASH!! I am 38 weeks pregnant and bought the last week, figuring I&#x27;d try something new and thicker since my belly was big and it&#x27;s label says it&#x27;s for stretch marks. Now I have little red bumps all over my belly and it itches!!!! I just stopped using it so I really hope it goes way soon. It&#x27;s extremely uncomfortable to have a big stretched out itchy stomach. This product is horrible and makes me sad. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy. It&#x27;s so bad I will never buy anything else from this brand. They should seriously do a recall or discontinue it. I&#x27;m definitely going back to using pure olive oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to relieve my extremely itchy belly during my third trimester.  As the name implies, it does feel like rubbing actual butter to my skin, leaving my belly feeling like there was an extra layer.  This did not seem to help with my itchy belly but I will continue using to see if it helps with stretch marks.  Overall, I prefer the regular Palmers cocoa butter lotion.  It&#x27;s easier to apply.</li>
            <li> This product gave me an irritating, red rash on my belly after only one day of use.  I realize this won&#x27;t happen for everyone, but by doing a Google (\\&quot;palmers tummy butter rash\\&quot;) you can see it&#x27;s happening to enough women.  I spoke with a rep at Palmers and she told me she hardly receives any complaints about this product.  If you receive a rash, please call to let them know!!  1.877.PALMERS and ask for Amy.</li>
            <li> Wife used it throughout her pregnancy with excellent results and no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> So I bought this product to reduce pre-existing stretch marks from weight gain/loss over the years. I do have to say it started working quite well, BUT about a week after use I got a very itchy rash. Buyer BEWARE.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews on this product, I too developed a rash after using for about a week. The rash was mainly on my belly...these itchy, hot, red bumps that I could not stop feeling or thinking about. It left me uncomfortable for days.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to using good ole coconut oil  and bio oil now.&lt;br /&gt;This product does have a nice soothing smell though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-post partum update 01/16/2015. I still developed small stretch marks after pregnancy. They are hereditary; I did everything right to avoid them: didn&#x27;t gain weight too fast, drank TONS of water, and used coconut and bio oil up to three times a day. I STILL had stretch marks, but not as bad as I feel they could have been. My mom had them terribly.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a couple weeks then I develop this VERY IRRITATING RASH on my belly.  I also use this product on my hips and butt (no rash there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually liked the smell and my existing stretch marks were improving.......oh well!</li>
            <li> I used this product while I was pregnant with my daughter.I used it every day after my shower and during the third trimester I used it every night as well.  I loved the way it smelled and I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch mark. I recommend it to all my pregnant clients and always buy it for my pregnant friends as a congratulations gift.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product. I have developed the most awful rash I have ever had in my life! Almost as itchy as poison ivy! The rash is literally everywhere I applied this product. It has been a week and the rash has not started to go away yet. Stopped using the product immediately! It is so bad I can&#x27;t sleep and clothes are the worst. I do not recommend!</li>
            <li> I got a rash within one week of using this product as well. I&#x27;m not generally allergic to creams so it was weird. The rash is taking a long time to heal, and makes the skin scabby. I regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> This body butter smells great and it goes on smooth without being greasy. It&#x27;s like a wax, but doesn&#x27;t make my clothes greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and unfortunately this morning I woke up to a terrible rash all over my belly. It itches so bad! The only change I have made recently is using this butter. I really wanted to love it. Just be cautious if you decide to use it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and gave me a rash. Plus it&#x27;s super hard</li>
            <li> I thought their &amp;#34;Massage Cream&amp;#34; for stretch marks was decent but extremely thick, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try. I find it hard to apply and it leaves my skin feeling waxy and everything sticks to me, including my maternity jeans and dog hair. Next time I&#x27;ll just stick to the massage cream instead.</li>
            <li> I also got a stomach rash from this product. Didn&#x27;t realize it was this at first but my nurse told me to stop using it and it went away. Recommended from a girl at work who loved it. I liked the texture but I wish I had read these reviews before I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very thick and rich butter</li>
            <li> I was using organic coconut oil and organic jojoba oil on my belly and breasts as I am 17 weeks pregnant. I wanted to try something that wasn&#x27;t as greasy; I should have read up on this product before buying!  Within 2 days of use I woke up in the middle of the night with a horrendous itch.  I immediately washed it off and developed large red blotchy hives that insanely itched all over my torso and belly.  I read that it is because I switched from something organic to something with synthetic ingredients.  If you have sensitive skin (which I normally don&#x27;t) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> FROM MY WIFE In spite of how greasy and sticky this cream was, I sticked to wearing it every morning and nite and my effort paid off . I gained 50 pounds during my pregnancy, my belly looked huge but after my boy was born and I droped the weight and my stomach went back to normal I was happy NOT to see any strech marks.My advice buy it bulk, I went through 1 jar a week :)</li>
            <li> Love the consistency, and smells delicious..... If my stomach it&#x27;s feeling tight from growing I spread this on and it relieves the tension</li>
            <li> Used this product 4 years ago and got no stretch marks...ordering it again for this pregnancy and starting it earlier since most say I will show earlier. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I really love this tummy butter. It is greasy when you put it on at first.  I used it with 2 pregnancies and did not get a stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I started out using the cream, but once my belly started to stretch the stretch marks that had mostly healed from a sudden weight gain years ago just started to get worse. I saw a little 1.1oz container of the butter at babies R us when I was walking through for $1 and decided to try it. I have been using it twice a day for the past two months and really have barely dented that little container but it has done NOTHING for the stretch marks. They are still there and still getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are prone to stretch marks, no amount of tummy butter or cream is going to keep them from showing up, those that were lucky to have good genetics and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks are damn lucky. The most this product will do is make your skin smooth or give you a rash.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Not only foes it help diminish the appearance of stretch marks, it is also one of the best products for making feet baby soft and smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great tummy butter. Smells great, hard consistency so its harder to get it out of the little tub. Would def buy again!</li>
            <li> I used this my entire pregnancy. I found out when I was five weeks and bought this right after. I used it everyday 1-2 times a day. Unfortunately I did get a lot of stretch marks in my ninth month, but this stuff really did soothe the itching and made my maternity pants more comfortable. So it wasn&#x27;t a total bummer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come sealed in anyway and that&#x27;s a bit weird to me and I can&#x27;t say much for how well it works as I haven&#x27;t even started using it yet but it shipped fast and smells AMAZING. I&#x27;m early in my pregnancy, with everything even kind of stinky making my puke I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell. It&#x27;s good ladies. A very warm smell like making cookies! I wished someone had left a review on its fragrance so I thought I&#x27;d be the one. ♥&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, The surface of the &amp;#34;tummy butter&amp;#34; seems flawless so I&#x27;m not too worried about its lack of seal but still, it&#x27;s one of those little comforts I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks on my thighs not really that noticeable but still there and this only when I put it on makes my skin look firmer and makes them not as noticeable I love it!</li>
            <li> Iam only 4 months now but my tummy has grown quite a bit, my husband would put this on my tummy and any other places I was worried about stretch marks at and it works great . I love this product and Iam planning on using it threw out my pregancy . The only advice I would give is make sure u wear a kind of fitted shirt to bed like a spaghetti strap or tank  if not the butter kind of gets everywhere . But I haven&#x27;t seen a stretch mark yet !</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. Used during her first pregnancy and now she&#x27;s hooked on it. Might need more of it.</li>
            <li> Ive been using for about a week, and I already notice a difference in the stretch marks I have acquired so far, and see no more showing up, I&#x27;m 34 weeks pregnant and this stuff is amazing, based on other reviews, I guess you get a rash or you don&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t and I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this cream made me feel that I had to. I&#x27;m 6 months into my second pregnancy and have a few stretch marks from my first. I got this cream, hoping to avoid getting any more. Not only have I not gotten any more so far, but it has dramatically reduced the appearance of the marks I had from before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get the rash that others spoke about and will definitely be recommending this.Thanks Palmers</li>
            <li> good product , worked well for us</li>
            <li> This product has made my stretch marks so much lighter and the linea nigra line that i had almost disappear. The streatch marks are lighter and smaller</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get rid of my old stretch marks on my stomach. My son is 3 years old now. Stretch marks is ugly and I use to be ashamed of my body. I have been using the palmer&#x27;s massage cream twice a day for 2 months and it did not work well enough for me. I also used Celtrixa that bottle cost $50 and I could not afford to keep buying it. Coco butter sticks did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Tummy Butter is working well for me. This product is greasy. I put a plastic bag on my stomach or use plastic wrap, leave on stomach for 30 minutes so the oil will not get on my clothes and sheets. The first week of using this product my stretch marks are fading. I also work out 3 times a week, that help get rid of my stretch marks. Many women complained that the product tingle and itch, but that just means it is working. Most products will have some kind of side effect.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, used it with my pregnancy with my son four years ago and using it for this one now and I still don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark :) arrived quick too.</li>
            <li> After applying bio oil in the morning after i wake up, I use this product on my fresh stretch marks on my tummy. Not sure if it works on old stretch marks yet. I also apply it once i start feeling itchy again (no bio oil). And finally another layer at night (with bio oil) after an exfoliated warm shower. It faded my stretch marks from a dark red to a pink after a week! Although i havent seen a difference with the marks on the side of my hips but thats my fault because i forget to apply it there sometimes. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty allergy and rash prone, but this stuff didn&#x27;t affect me in the ways others did. I love this stuff! Though I have only used this twice, It feels and smells amazing and makes my skin feel nice and hydrated. Definitely helps with the elasticity of my skin. I use it before laying down for bed, and give it a few minutes to soak in, then put on my pajamas. After I&#x27;ve been awake in the morning for a few hours I reapply. I like this stuff one star more than the palmers massage oil, based on how it relieves the discomfort of my stretching, the feel of it and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: still love it! Best if I use it three times a day. I really feel that it helps prevents my skin from further stretching. I just need to remember to reapply when tummy has dried out.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 other top rated creams for pregnancy, and this one by far goes on the smoothest and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling. It&#x27;s very easy to apply. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;m halfway through pregnancy so I don&#x27;t know if I will develop stretch marks later or not. I saw that some reviews said it gave them a rash....it gave my best friend a rash too, but it&#x27;s been fine for me. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks are hereditary. If your mother and grandmother had them, chances are you will too. That being said, this is still a wonderful tummy butter and relieves the itching and stretching feeling on the tummy and breasts. I used it with my first pregnancy and have continued to use it with my second pregnancy because it&#x27;s so creamy and soothing.  The smell is pleasant and comparable to cocoa butter. It&#x27;s a very rich, thick, creamy butter that rubs in easily and feels very nice. I use it after every shower at night.  It may be a little greasy/&amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; once on, but it absorbs by morning for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last week at Harmon&#x27;s. On the third day of using this I developed a horrible rash all over my stomach. It&#x27;s been 2 days since I used it and the rash is slowly going away thankfully! Please do not buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> i thought my marks were improving so i was faithfully using it at least 3 times a day or more whenever i feel itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the second day, i could not stop wanting to scratch my belly. i only realized it was a rash/allergic reaction when i actually checked out my belly. my skin did not go so well with it. i wish i read the reviews earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;half of the women who wrote reviews here seemed to have had allergic reactions to it. that&#x27;s alarming, palmers should check this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, but this product made me break out into a rash that itched like crazy. Im a SAHM, so I&#x27;m not wearing panel pants all day (probably only 1-2 times a week). At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was the tummy butter because I seriously never have reactions to topical ointments or lotions that I buy, but my husband insisted I look into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and try just the plain Palmers lotion or Bio Oil. I had wonderful results using Bio Oil my last pregnancy. Needless to say, after 2 days of only using Bio Oil, I&#x27;m still waiting for these darn bumps to go away!</li>
            <li> I used this with both of my pregnancies, I am 5&#x27;1 and 105 pounds and had a 9 pound and  an 8 pound baby and had NO stretch marks!  I&#x27;m not sure if it is because of the butter or because of genetics but I&#x27;m glad I used it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I feel very hydrated</li>
            <li> it seems to be working on my stretch marks.. they aren&#x27;t as purple and they don&#x27;t hurt as much.. only problem is it makes your hands feel funny after applying it</li>
            <li> Too oily for my taste, literally like rubbing butter on your belly. This product is not for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this tummy butter since the moment I knew I was pregnant. It is the most recommended one, and I thought it must be for a reason, even though it is very popular to say that it is all about genetics and your body shape too... But all we can do to help those factors is to take external care with some butter like this. I am 6.5 months now, and I have a belly from heaven :) I only use it at night, and some mornings now I am using what they call the massage lotion, which is lighter and like a moisturizing cream, that helps if the belly feels itchy or stretchy. My belly is only growing big now, and was scared that because it hasn&#x27;t been more gradual from the beginning, but I don&#x27;t have any marks, I don&#x27;t feel dry, itchy, stretching too much.... my belly feels soft and hydrated and my husband said the other day when we were commenting on it &amp;#34;it feels like it had its own layer of moisture&amp;#34;. I hope it works this well for all of you ladies!!! Worst is going to happen, is that you couldn&#x27;t avoid the marks, but you had great skin otherwise and did all you could to prevent the marks :)</li>
            <li> This gave me such an itchy bad rash! Just a warning to those who want to try this. You might not get it but if you start getting little itchy bumps stop immediately because scratching will only make stretch marks work and this rash makes you want to scratch a LOT!</li>
            <li> After two days of use I developed a horrible rash in the areas I applied the tummy butter. Very uncomfortable and Itchy!</li>
            <li> My wife has depended on this for both pregnancies and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Two thumbs up!  We definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Used this lotion through my whole pregnancy, love it! No stretch marks here!</li>
            <li> This product gave me a red, itchy rash all over my tummy where I applied.  It took a few days for the rash to disappear.  Before using this product test it out on a small area of skin; which is suggested on the back of the product anyway.  Also, it was greasy and I didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> This tummy butter gave me a very bad rash :&#x27;( my belly is covered with those rashes and as I am pregnant, there is absolutely nothing to do to stop that itchiness!!! I dont sleep at night due to itchiness. I am really suffering right now and the rash showed up only after 2 uses, that tells you how much this product is not good. Skip this product and go with something else otherwise you will end up miserable</li>
            <li> I used Palmers lotion for stretch marks and I love it, but I ran out and had some tummy butter so I tried that. Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to it because I got a red itchy rash on my stomach :(. If the tummy butter doesn&#x27;t work for you try the lotion, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> One tub lasted my whole pregnancy and I did not get one single stretch mark!  Highly recommended to anyone trying to avoid stetch marks!</li>
            <li> As many other reviewers, I developed an itchy rash all over my stomach that just won&#x27;t go away.  I stopped using it after I noticed the rash and it is taking forever to stop itching!!  It is truly horrible.  I also used the Palmers Massage Lotion for stretch marks and the Palmers Skin  Therapy Oil for months with no problem.  It appears the Tummy Butter has Lavender which is the only different ingredient from the others.  Definitely don&#x27;t buy this product unless you want to be miserable!!</li>
            <li> It is not the butter, it&#x27;s the lavender within the butter that is making you itch.  I believe those that are experiencing the itchy skin and rash have developed reactions from the lavender.  Though lavender is known for it&#x27;s soothing power, many have allergic type reactions to lavender which include the itchy, rashy descriptions given by those whose skin did not react well to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palmers makes great skin products and as most told us their other Palmer products worked fine, it was only when they switched to this one that problems were had - it&#x27;s the lavender ladies!!  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this from walmart and I&#x27;ve been using it for three days. I had terrible stretch marks and they are lighting quickly! :D</li>
            <li> I used normal Palmers Cocoa Butter for my first two pregnancies, no problem.  Bought Tummy Butter For this pregnancy at around 13 weeks. Started using it religiously around 16- weeks.  Somewhere around 20 weeks my belly started itching.  Never had stretch marks and therefore I thought the itching was due to beginning to get stretch marks.  I applied more Tummy Butter to counteract the stretch marks.  The more I applied, the worse the rash got.  I finally put two and two together (after reading these reviews) and yesterday stopped using the tummy butter.  24- hours later and the rash is most gone.  After researching I found apple cider vinegar will help relieve the itch and dry out the rash.  I have used it twice.  The Vinegar BURNS, but works. (I applied it to the rash while in the shower.)</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic! I used it every day after a shower, sometimes twice and didn&#x27;t have a single stretch mark, even after going 11 days over my due date! The 4.4 oz tub lasted that entire time with a little left over. The scent is a cocoa butter smell that at first I wouldn&#x27;t have called \\&quot;good enough to eat\\&quot;, but after using it a few times I really liked it. My husband loved the smell. I didn&#x27;t have any kind of reaction or rash associated with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Good and it make ur tummy hot</li>
            <li> Within 2 days my stretch marks on my butt are already starting to fade. Plus the smell is super amazing. This is one happy preggo lady.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it has alleviated the itching, smells great, and lasts. I put it on twice a day and find I am not getting marking  (which I do know is hereditary but hey can&#x27;t hurt to stack the deck a little in my favor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed folks DO get rashes from it, and it seems this is either a &amp;#34;works for you&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;oh hell no&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you do choose to get it, follow the instructions on the jar- test in a small area first. You don&#x27;t want to slather that all over yourself and then get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it- but read and follow the directions folks.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a day every day along with several other products in hopes of avoiding any unwanted stretch marks. Although I am still pregnant (6 Months) so I cant say that I wont get any, I do feel that you should be taking care of your skin and hydrating it and this product is great for that. The smell is fantastic it rubs on great and I have avoided the itchiness that&lt;br /&gt;I keep reading about in all my books</li>
            <li> Love this tummy butter!!! goes on smooth and had a great smell.My skin had been extra dry during my winter pregnancy and this product keeps me moisturized all day.Since my skin is extra dry the product soaks into my skin pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a pregnant friend and she said it worked well!</li>
