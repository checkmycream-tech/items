            <li>:) I love Amazon also!!!</li>
            <li>This product is good for an overnight cream to keep my skin looking and feeling good.</li>
            <li>Also, the Clinique Repairwear Night Cream is good.  </li>

            <li>Feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>Garnier is a good product</li>
            <li>It is a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>but at a good price since shipping adds to price.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>It goes on very light and isn&#x27;t greasy ( I couldn&#x27;t believe it! )</li>

            <li>Nice texture, feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>love this very nice and goes on well .</li>
            <li>Please just be sure you aren&#x27;t allergic before you buy this!</li>
            <li>I love everything that is from Garnier!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin dewy and luminous, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>The cream feels good to my face -- it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>really nice.  </li>
            <li>but it feels nice and firming.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it smells nice and does feel so good on my face.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice, waiting for results.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance and texture.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly see the results in 6 days.</li>
            <li>So I kept using it and also loving how it make my face with makeup glow.</li>
            <li>Honestly, when I wake up in the morning my skin is smoother than it was when I went to bed.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but this product is so great I feel compelled to let others know how much I love it.</li>
            <li>Very light and keeps my skin moist overnight.</li>
            <li>More like lotion than cream.</li>
            <li>:-)</li>
            <li>By ordering it on &amp;#34;Subcribe and Save&amp;#34; I am able to save on it as well.  </li>
            <li>IF I WILL BUY ANY MORE.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s safe to say I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>This preservative is also in most of the products they make now, so if you&#x27;re allergic, stay away from Garnier products.</li>
            <li>This IMO is better than Olay regenerist.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>as many of the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; creams do.</li>
            <li>and I bought this product as more of a preventative measure...</li>
            <li>I have been using Garnier Moisture Rescue, which I love.  </li>
            <li>If you google it, you will find top results with customers relating their allergic reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>Love this cream Will buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve love this lotion for my age group of over 60...</li>
            <li>:) But I would recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>It is softer, and way more moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li>Mind you, this was after I was able to put on a Clinique moisturizer at night and then just put makeup on it in the morning with no problem.</li>
            <li>I noticed it mostly under my eyes.</li>
            <li>So yeah, can you say LOVE?</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this cream and use it each night.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This might be better for those with drier skin.</li>
            <li>and I love their creams?</li>
            <li>Love my &amp;#34;Hope</li>
            <li>what more can I say.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite moisturizer I have ever tried</li>
            <li>My esthetician even noticed that my skin was more hydrated after using this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this works ok.</li>
            <li>it may work much better</li>
            <li>It really does improve the look of wrinkles, so much so that I use this before going out if I want to look my best (I don&#x27;t wear makeup).</li>
            <li>I have mature skin that is in great condition, I did tthink it should of worked better on moisturizing.</li>
            <li>So great for pricing, saves a trip to store, can&#x27;t get a better deal, order every other month when runs out, love this product, great fast service!!</li>
            <li>Before using this I never thought I needed eye creams or anti wrinkle creams for my eye area but after noticing an improvement and seeing now that it&#x27;s more smooth and awake-looking</li>
            <li>I have used the cream for sensitive and it was great.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with other Ultra-Lift products and am very happy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to travel with this size.</li>
            <li>Strong smell.</li>
            <li>It also has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is WAY too strong.  </li>
            <li>And although the fragrance didn&#x27;t bother me, it is somewhat strong and could be overpowering to some.</li>
            <li>There is a strong fragrance</li>
            <li>Has a really strong scent, I had to return it.</li>
            <li>It is not oily, rather it is an easy to apply light cream.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles yet</li>
            <li>They smell very clean without the strong perfumey odor that many body care products have, are made with many raw (so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients), and feel great on the skin.</li>
            <li>This night cream smells great and leaves my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>Since I began using this nightly, I have seen a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>Either too light for night time use or doesn&#x27;t stay on all night.</li>
            <li>I wish it were fragrance free.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve found my perfect product finally, and actually got it at my local grocery store :D</li>
            <li>I do like the way it feels and how it makes my face smooth..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use daily, but when I do, it works great.  </li>
            <li>Light and seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Was great to find this online, as I can&#x27;t always, at my local store.</li>
            <li>It does not reverse the aging signs but it keeps the skin well hydrated and feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting such great results.  </li>
            <li>Has a light sent that I like.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for that type, butnot too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34, and haven&#x27;t used many night creams, but I feel like this one works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have the words to describe this product, I love it so much!</li>
            <li>It stays on, and most importantly the scent is very neutral.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>Cream is cool and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Everyone responds differently I&#x27;m sure, but this works very well for me.</li>
            <li>do Love How it Makes your Skin soft !!!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and rubs right in.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the jar I noticed its strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>serves the purpose of increasing shelf life, and many people are HIGHLY allergic to it.</li>
            <li>Everything from drugstore ones like CeraVe to more high end like Mario Badescu and GlamGlow.</li>
            <li>The ones with retinol ALWAYS seem to make my skin feel drier and less young that before I started - but THIS one is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>Its a lighter cream than I expected, but that is good in that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sit on your face as you go to sleep</li>
            <li>I wouldnt know much about if it &amp;#34;gets rid&amp;#34; of wrinkles because I dont have any yet to get rid of, but I definately do enjoy the way it feels.</li>
            <li>Feel&#x27;s great on my skin an really does help firm skin an smooth wrinkles away.</li>
            <li>I bough it out of desperation, tried a sample for three days and could see it was gentle on my skin and started to make my skin smooth and glowy looking...already.</li>
            <li>It is the fault of my own physical condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly cheap, does what it says, and you can get it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and it does exactly what it claims - moisturizes, firms and ANTI AGES your skin.</li>
            <li>but as I said at the first of this review, I&#x27;m 60</li>
            <li>I love this product, and this is the second time I&#x27;ve gotten it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use it and my wrinkles are looking better daily.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how many different moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I will definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li>and I assume this means it has retinol, one of the best anti-aging ingredients in these types of lotions, in it because I have had a similar reaction to those in the past.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable!</li>
            <li>The first signs of aging in men appear in the eyes and lips.</li>
            <li>And for the price it costs next to nothing annually to keep your eyes looking healthy and feeling awake.</li>
            <li>Most likely will try another product when this is gone.</li>
            <li>It was pretty overpowering, but I went ahead and applied the cream.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well and my face did look firmer and lines were reduced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to apply and my mascara doesn&#x27;t blotch like other eye creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>not entirely sure that it reduces wrinkles... but its a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product helps with that immensely, and the results are noticeable very quickly.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes nicely, and provides some noticeable tightening.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little over fragranced and doesn&#x27;t offer the level of firming I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;Stll</li>
            <li>All that being said, I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>just want to save a potential nightmare if you are allergic, so just tread lightly.</li>
            <li>Much like all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>It goes on real tacky</li>
            <li>I was very unimpressed with the Aveeno Night Cream, and then I found this.  </li>
            <li>Every morning when I woke up I had very bloodshot eyes.  </li>
            <li>And, I haven&#x27;t used that much of it to give you a &amp;#34;tried-and-true&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really like that my skin absorbs it so well</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles so don&#x27;t buy it if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for awhile and really like it.</li>
            <li>I could really feel an see the difference.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>one of these lightens the spots very well.  </li>
            <li>I used this whole jar and saw no difference at all.</li>
            <li>Will keep buying it, feel clear and fresh after using.</li>
            <li>I felt an intense stinging sensation.  </li>
            <li>I ended up throwing the whole jar away.</li>
            <li>The Garnier Ultra Lift Anti Wrinkle Firming Night Cream works very well and has met the requirements I need.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I ordered it by mistake I really wanted garnier skin renew radiance moisture cream which I would like to buy</li>
            <li>I just picked it up because I am hoping to prevent aging as much as I can.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>the &#x27;new formula does smell a bit different but still not overly strong.  </li>
            <li>But started noticing that the skin between my eyebrows started becoming loose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, after I first started to notice wrinkles in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>(It smells a lot better than some of the other products I&#x27;ve used!)  </li>
            <li>It really does help, and makes me feel like a new me, firming my skin, minimizing my pores</li>
            <li>Recently I started using it every night and after the first three consistent nights I looked in the mirror and it looked like I had gotten botox or something.</li>
            <li>The main reason I chose this one over some of Garnier&#x27;s other anti-aging moisturizers is because it has their new natural pro-retinol formula that is supposed to work faster but be more gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>This has way too much perfume, I used it last night and right away it started burning.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this line.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>but as far as the skin between my eyebrows goes, it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Well so far I really like this cream</li>
            <li>This is the only cream I have used that is soothing, softens wrinkles and firms skin pretty much immediately.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my normal night cream (Clinique)</li>
            <li>But those products are right around $50 for the same amount of product you get here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and I can&#x27;t really notice a difference on the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Before I purchased it I had done lots of research for high and low brands and for some reason this one is the underdog that doesn&#x27;t get the much deserved credit it deserves!</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>Take my words with a grain of salt, I am still very young for using the product.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive but it loves this cream.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>keeps my skin looking young and those age lines invisible!</li>
            <li>There are likely other products out there that don&#x27;t burn or smell and do a better job.</li>
            <li>I do not feel that this product was any better than other skincare products that I&#x27;ve tried and cannot necessarily recommend it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is however completely none-irritating in any way!</li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t previously contain it until about the last year, so even if you&#x27;ve loved it (like I did) and are restocking, be careful when you use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i had a hard time Convincing myself that this is NOT working,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My whole face tingled, and felt younger immediately.</li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely, no heavy layer of slime that balls up if you rub it -</li>
            <li>It is very gritty and it makes your face very oily.</li>
            <li>No one ever says I look old and beat up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 72 years old and can&#x27;t do the things that I used to - and one of those things is to use just anything on my face and it will work.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and cream does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>However it makes my skin SO soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>As far as results go...it does what it says.  </li>
            <li>and this is not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Does NOT FIRM YOUR FACE,&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the morning the skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>and I feel this product was developed for women my age.</li>
            <li>This cream moisturizes nearly as well as my dermalogica medium weight cream (skin smoothing cream).</li>
            <li>ulta lift lift so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely give this one a shot because it feels very calming and soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and using this as a preventive - so far no wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is the first lotion I bought again when my jar ran out (and it takes a long time to use up)</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment much on ultimate results, but if you&#x27;re a poor grad student trying to prevent wrinkles like me, it&#x27;s worth the fourteen dollars for sure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long had passed, didn&#x27;t even notice until they disappeared, but I can tell you right now they are 100% gone, there is not a single wrinkle on my face.</li>
            <li>While it is cheaper than other similar products, it didn&#x27;t suit my skin type (mostly oily, some dry patches) and I felt greasy within an hour or two of applying this at night.</li>
            <li>Every single Garnier product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve purchased many different products from them, has worked extremely well.</li>
            <li>When I first got this I used it about once a week and never really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I will admit I really like the Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Dry Skin.  </li>
            <li>Am sure on younger less dry skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have deeply set wrinkles yet as I am only 28 and have an oily skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was very dry from using proactiv + and it just seemed like no other moisturizer I had tried really did the trick.</li>
            <li>not sure how much anti wrinkle it really is</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty darn greasy but it stings a little one out of every ten or so times I put it on</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> :) I love Amazon also!!!</li>
            <li> This product is good for an overnight cream to keep my skin looking and feeling good.</li>
            <li> Also, the Clinique Repairwear Night Cream is good.  </li>
            <li> Garnier makes a good product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I think it is a perfectly good product.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Garnier is a good product</li>
            <li> It is a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> but at a good price since shipping adds to price.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light and isn&#x27;t greasy ( I couldn&#x27;t believe it! )</li>
            <li> Very refreshing</li>
            <li> Good texture - absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> love this very nice and goes on well .</li>
            <li> Please just be sure you aren&#x27;t allergic before you buy this!</li>
            <li> I love everything that is from Garnier!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin dewy and luminous, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The cream feels good to my face -- it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> really nice.  </li>
            <li> but it feels nice and firming.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it smells nice and does feel so good on my face.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice, waiting for results.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and texture.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly see the results in 6 days.</li>
            <li> So I kept using it and also loving how it make my face with makeup glow.</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I wake up in the morning my skin is smoother than it was when I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but this product is so great I feel compelled to let others know how much I love it.</li>
            <li> Very light and keeps my skin moist overnight.</li>
            <li> More like lotion than cream.</li>
            <li> :-)</li>
            <li> By ordering it on &amp;#34;Subcribe and Save&amp;#34; I am able to save on it as well.  </li>
            <li> IF I WILL BUY ANY MORE.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s safe to say I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This preservative is also in most of the products they make now, so if you&#x27;re allergic, stay away from Garnier products.</li>
            <li> This IMO is better than Olay regenerist.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> as many of the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; creams do.</li>
            <li> and I bought this product as more of a preventative measure...</li>
            <li> I have been using Garnier Moisture Rescue, which I love.  </li>
            <li> If you google it, you will find top results with customers relating their allergic reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> Love this cream Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve love this lotion for my age group of over 60...</li>
            <li> :) But I would recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> It is softer, and way more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li> Mind you, this was after I was able to put on a Clinique moisturizer at night and then just put makeup on it in the morning with no problem.</li>
            <li> I noticed it mostly under my eyes.</li>
            <li> So yeah, can you say LOVE?</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cream and use it each night.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This might be better for those with drier skin.</li>
            <li> and I love their creams?</li>
            <li> Love my &amp;#34;Hope</li>
            <li> what more can I say.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite moisturizer I have ever tried</li>
            <li> My esthetician even noticed that my skin was more hydrated after using this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this works ok.</li>
            <li> it may work much better</li>
            <li> It really does improve the look of wrinkles, so much so that I use this before going out if I want to look my best (I don&#x27;t wear makeup).</li>
            <li> I have mature skin that is in great condition, I did tthink it should of worked better on moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So great for pricing, saves a trip to store, can&#x27;t get a better deal, order every other month when runs out, love this product, great fast service!!</li>
            <li> Before using this I never thought I needed eye creams or anti wrinkle creams for my eye area but after noticing an improvement and seeing now that it&#x27;s more smooth and awake-looking</li>
            <li> I have used the cream for sensitive and it was great.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with other Ultra-Lift products and am very happy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to travel with this size.</li>
            <li> Strong smell.</li>
            <li> It also has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is WAY too strong.  </li>
            <li> And although the fragrance didn&#x27;t bother me, it is somewhat strong and could be overpowering to some.</li>
            <li> There is a strong fragrance</li>
            <li> Has a really strong scent, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> It is not oily, rather it is an easy to apply light cream.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> They smell very clean without the strong perfumey odor that many body care products have, are made with many raw (so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients), and feel great on the skin.</li>
            <li> This night cream smells great and leaves my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> Since I began using this nightly, I have seen a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> Either too light for night time use or doesn&#x27;t stay on all night.</li>
            <li> I wish it were fragrance free.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve found my perfect product finally, and actually got it at my local grocery store :D</li>
            <li> I do like the way it feels and how it makes my face smooth..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use daily, but when I do, it works great.  </li>
            <li> Light and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Was great to find this online, as I can&#x27;t always, at my local store.</li>
            <li> It does not reverse the aging signs but it keeps the skin well hydrated and feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting such great results.  </li>
            <li> Has a light sent that I like.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for that type, butnot too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> But so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34, and haven&#x27;t used many night creams, but I feel like this one works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have the words to describe this product, I love it so much!</li>
            <li> It stays on, and most importantly the scent is very neutral.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this</li>
            <li> Cream is cool and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Everyone responds differently I&#x27;m sure, but this works very well for me.</li>
            <li> do Love How it Makes your Skin soft !!!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and rubs right in.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the jar I noticed its strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> serves the purpose of increasing shelf life, and many people are HIGHLY allergic to it.</li>
            <li> Everything from drugstore ones like CeraVe to more high end like Mario Badescu and GlamGlow.</li>
            <li> The ones with retinol ALWAYS seem to make my skin feel drier and less young that before I started - but THIS one is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Its a lighter cream than I expected, but that is good in that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sit on your face as you go to sleep</li>
            <li> I wouldnt know much about if it &amp;#34;gets rid&amp;#34; of wrinkles because I dont have any yet to get rid of, but I definately do enjoy the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Feel&#x27;s great on my skin an really does help firm skin an smooth wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> I bough it out of desperation, tried a sample for three days and could see it was gentle on my skin and started to make my skin smooth and glowy looking...already.</li>
            <li> It is the fault of my own physical condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly cheap, does what it says, and you can get it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and it does exactly what it claims - moisturizes, firms and ANTI AGES your skin.</li>
            <li> but as I said at the first of this review, I&#x27;m 60</li>
            <li> I love this product, and this is the second time I&#x27;ve gotten it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use it and my wrinkles are looking better daily.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell you how many different moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I will definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> and I assume this means it has retinol, one of the best anti-aging ingredients in these types of lotions, in it because I have had a similar reaction to those in the past.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable!</li>
            <li> The first signs of aging in men appear in the eyes and lips.</li>
            <li> And for the price it costs next to nothing annually to keep your eyes looking healthy and feeling awake.</li>
            <li> Most likely will try another product when this is gone.</li>
            <li> It was pretty overpowering, but I went ahead and applied the cream.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well and my face did look firmer and lines were reduced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easy to apply and my mascara doesn&#x27;t blotch like other eye creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> not entirely sure that it reduces wrinkles... but its a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product helps with that immensely, and the results are noticeable very quickly.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes nicely, and provides some noticeable tightening.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little over fragranced and doesn&#x27;t offer the level of firming I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;Stll</li>
            <li> All that being said, I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li> just want to save a potential nightmare if you are allergic, so just tread lightly.</li>
            <li> Much like all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> It goes on real tacky</li>
            <li> I was very unimpressed with the Aveeno Night Cream, and then I found this.  </li>
            <li> Every morning when I woke up I had very bloodshot eyes.  </li>
            <li> And, I haven&#x27;t used that much of it to give you a &amp;#34;tried-and-true&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like that my skin absorbs it so well</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles so don&#x27;t buy it if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for awhile and really like it.</li>
            <li> I could really feel an see the difference.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> one of these lightens the spots very well.  </li>
            <li> I used this whole jar and saw no difference at all.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying it, feel clear and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> I felt an intense stinging sensation.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing the whole jar away.</li>
            <li> The Garnier Ultra Lift Anti Wrinkle Firming Night Cream works very well and has met the requirements I need.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered it by mistake I really wanted garnier skin renew radiance moisture cream which I would like to buy</li>
            <li> I just picked it up because I am hoping to prevent aging as much as I can.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> the &#x27;new formula does smell a bit different but still not overly strong.  </li>
            <li> But started noticing that the skin between my eyebrows started becoming loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, after I first started to notice wrinkles in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> (It smells a lot better than some of the other products I&#x27;ve used!)  </li>
            <li> It really does help, and makes me feel like a new me, firming my skin, minimizing my pores</li>
            <li> Recently I started using it every night and after the first three consistent nights I looked in the mirror and it looked like I had gotten botox or something.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose this one over some of Garnier&#x27;s other anti-aging moisturizers is because it has their new natural pro-retinol formula that is supposed to work faster but be more gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> This has way too much perfume, I used it last night and right away it started burning.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this line.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> but as far as the skin between my eyebrows goes, it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Well so far I really like this cream</li>
            <li> This is the only cream I have used that is soothing, softens wrinkles and firms skin pretty much immediately.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my normal night cream (Clinique)</li>
            <li> But those products are right around $50 for the same amount of product you get here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and I can&#x27;t really notice a difference on the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased it I had done lots of research for high and low brands and for some reason this one is the underdog that doesn&#x27;t get the much deserved credit it deserves!</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> Take my words with a grain of salt, I am still very young for using the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive but it loves this cream.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin looking young and those age lines invisible!</li>
            <li> There are likely other products out there that don&#x27;t burn or smell and do a better job.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that this product was any better than other skincare products that I&#x27;ve tried and cannot necessarily recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is however completely none-irritating in any way!</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t previously contain it until about the last year, so even if you&#x27;ve loved it (like I did) and are restocking, be careful when you use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i had a hard time Convincing myself that this is NOT working,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My whole face tingled, and felt younger immediately.</li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely, no heavy layer of slime that balls up if you rub it -</li>
            <li> It is very gritty and it makes your face very oily.</li>
            <li> No one ever says I look old and beat up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 72 years old and can&#x27;t do the things that I used to - and one of those things is to use just anything on my face and it will work.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and cream does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> However it makes my skin SO soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> As far as results go...it does what it says.  </li>
            <li> and this is not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Does NOT FIRM YOUR FACE,&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the morning the skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> and I feel this product was developed for women my age.</li>
            <li> This cream moisturizes nearly as well as my dermalogica medium weight cream (skin smoothing cream).</li>
            <li> ulta lift lift so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely give this one a shot because it feels very calming and soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and using this as a preventive - so far no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is the first lotion I bought again when my jar ran out (and it takes a long time to use up)</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment much on ultimate results, but if you&#x27;re a poor grad student trying to prevent wrinkles like me, it&#x27;s worth the fourteen dollars for sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long had passed, didn&#x27;t even notice until they disappeared, but I can tell you right now they are 100% gone, there is not a single wrinkle on my face.</li>
            <li> While it is cheaper than other similar products, it didn&#x27;t suit my skin type (mostly oily, some dry patches) and I felt greasy within an hour or two of applying this at night.</li>
            <li> Every single Garnier product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve purchased many different products from them, has worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I used it about once a week and never really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I will admit I really like the Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Dry Skin.  </li>
            <li> Am sure on younger less dry skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have deeply set wrinkles yet as I am only 28 and have an oily skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry from using proactiv + and it just seemed like no other moisturizer I had tried really did the trick.</li>
            <li> not sure how much anti wrinkle it really is</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty darn greasy but it stings a little one out of every ten or so times I put it on</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a first for me!</li>
            <li> You will see less wrinkles and frown lines in about 2 weeks, leaves your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> I was a teen in the 60s and summers were spent outside in the Oklahoma sun.  </li>
            <li> This product contains that, and I just spent 3 months trying to figure out why my skin was drying out in big red splotches.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a couple of DAYS, so my opinion is limited.</li>
            <li> I have used several other products from different companies and did not see any difference at all.  </li>
            <li> Obviously I don&#x27;t have heavy wrinkles or sagging skin; I really just wanted a little moisture lift and boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5/4)</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a long while.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER SENSITIVE skin and every anti-wrinkle product I have ever tried irritation my skin like crazy and</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a night cream, but it&#x27;s been hard since I have very sensitive skin, and this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li> My skin went from crepe-y and dry to terrific and firm in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> I wake up with dry skin compared to other night cream.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not a whole lot to be done . . .</li>
            <li> Hmmm, still deciding, not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> However, so does a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> and I do use other products that they offer.  </li>
            <li> I like some of the other Garnier products.</li>
            <li> going to buy other products&lt;</li>
            <li> I washed it off and put on my other cream</li>
            <li> Only a very small amount of this cream brings moisture with no greasiness.</li>
            <li> Also, oddly, it bleached spots in my towel/washcloth wash</li>
            <li> I finally just got sick of shelling out so much money for a moisturizer that I started trying drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> It takes just a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a little residue when using a lot.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and hard water in my home.</li>
            <li> I had only been applying a VERY thin layer, which probably explains why it took so long to show the damage.</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews of the cream and, fortunately, I have not experienced any ill effects</li>
            <li> It makes my skin softer and smoother everyday I use it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, way too harsh.</li>
            <li> It has been a few months that I have been using this night cream.  </li>
            <li> was to harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> There were small red spots under my eyes, my skin under my eyes was even wrinklier because it was in poor shape from this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if cream eliminates wrinkles or not.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works in that area.</li>
            <li> I had been using this for the past couple months and it had a negative delayed reaction.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to try something a little less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin still in my late 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Not nice.</li>
            <li> If you are a tired student like I am, you also know about the bags under the eyes that results from late night studying.</li>
            <li> If I am up late and start to feel tired, I will put this on to keep my eyes from feeling droopy.</li>
            <li> On the plus side I never smoked which is about the worse thing a woman can do to her skin.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;ve had problems with retinol products irritating your skin</li>
            <li> but for the price you could do much worse.</li>
            <li> I even called in sick to work once because I thought I had pink eye.  </li>
            <li> Can Get SAME RESULTS FROM PONDS COLD CREME !!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to buy expensive creams.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the fragrance made me break out.</li>
            <li> I like this product--but I&#x27;m not so crazy about it that I would call it  a &#x27;</li>
            <li> and they were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ponds cold creme</li>
            <li> This cream might have helped if I could have gotten past the horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased very expensive (well over $100 per product) creams and serums</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t a bad product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed it did nothing except cause breakout</li>
            <li> I was expecting to see some improvement but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very rank odor.</li>
            <li> Bad side,&lt;br /&gt;Its GREASY !!!!!</li>
            <li> I have really awful allergies and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all except</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Light. Moisturizing. More like lotion than cream. Strong smell. Did not notice any firming. Either too light for night time use or doesn&#x27;t stay on all night. I wake up with dry skin compared to other night cream. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> not entirely sure that it reduces wrinkles... but its a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Upfront, I&#x27;m 60 so there&#x27;s not a whole lot to be done . . . what&#x27;s done is done!  :-) I was a teen in the 60s and summers were spent outside in the Oklahoma sun.  On the plus side I never smoked which is about the worse thing a woman can do to her skin. All that being said, I really like this cream.  I read the negative reviews of the cream and, fortunately, I have not experienced any ill effects and I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 months.  The cream feels good to my face -- it&#x27;s very light and I find the fragrance pleasing.  It&#x27;s all subjective, isn&#x27;t it?  I feel like I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my overall facial skin, but as I said at the first of this review, I&#x27;m 60 so what is done is done! Exercising and drinking lots of water also helps the face, plus one&#x27;s overall health.  I recommend that too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years, and it is the best I have tried for firming skin.  By ordering it on &amp;#34;Subcribe and Save&amp;#34; I am able to save on it as well.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for keeping your face hydrated. Even use it in the morning to help plump up the lines around the mouth and chin.</li>
            <li> This product is good for an overnight cream to keep my skin looking and feeling good. Keeps skin looking smoother.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USEING FOR A WHILE. I CAN;T SEE ANY CHANGE IN MY FACE.STILL HAVE LINES AND WRINKLES. I WILL STILL USED WHAT I HAVE AND DON;T KNOW IF I WILL BUY ANY MORE. BUT IT MIGHT WQRK FOR YOU.GIVE IT A TRY.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and this is the second time I&#x27;ve gotten it from Amazon. I&#x27;ve been looking for a night cream, but it&#x27;s been hard since I have very sensitive skin, and this product fits the bill. It really does help, and makes me feel like a new me, firming my skin, minimizing my pores, I think it&#x27;s safe to say I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Beware anyone who is allergic to methylisothiazolinone! This product contains that, and I just spent 3 months trying to figure out why my skin was drying out in big red splotches. My lips also became so swollen that it was embarrassing, and it was from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;methylisothiazolinone Is a preservative thatiy serves the purpose of increasing shelf life, and many people are HIGHLY allergic to it. Please just be sure you aren&#x27;t allergic before you buy this! It truly has been a nightmare for me. The product didn&#x27;t previously contain it until about the last year, so even if you&#x27;ve loved it (like I did) and are restocking, be careful when you use it. This preservative is also in most of the products they make now, so if you&#x27;re allergic, stay away from Garnier products. Alba skin care line is a great alternative that doesn&#x27;t have this in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to save a potential nightmare if you are allergic, so just tread lightly. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Great cream for wrinkles. I use it and my wrinkles are looking better daily.</li>
            <li> Much like all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. I don&#x27;t really have deeply set wrinkles yet as I am only 28 and have an oily skin. But started noticing that the skin between my eyebrows started becoming loose. So, I decided to try this product. It makes my skin softer and smoother everyday I use it but as far as the skin between my eyebrows goes, it didn&#x27;t do much. It also has a strong smell. I wish it were fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this product on my face sorry can,t see it done anything for the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 and have tried around a dozen low to mid priced wrinkle creams/ moisturizers. The ones with retinol ALWAYS seem to make my skin feel drier and less young that before I started - but THIS one is absolutely perfect. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so low priced. This IMO is better than Olay regenerist. From the moment I put it on my face, there was a difference - for me that is something that never happens despite their claims, and you end up wondering if it&#x27;s working. My whole face tingled, and felt younger immediately. LOVE this stuff. Absorbs nicely, no heavy layer of slime that balls up if you rub it - as many of the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; creams do. Can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff - I&#x27;ve found my perfect product finally, and actually got it at my local grocery store :D The price is right, and it does exactly what it claims - moisturizes, firms and ANTI AGES your skin. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Im 26 and I bought this product as more of a preventative measure...I do like the way it feels and how it makes my face smooth..Its almost as if my face is glowing instantly after I put it on!  I wouldnt know much about if it &amp;#34;gets rid&amp;#34; of wrinkles because I dont have any yet to get rid of, but I definately do enjoy the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Disappointed it did nothing except cause breakout</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I have only used this product for a couple of DAYS, so my opinion is limited. I will come back and edit this post as time goes along. Take my words with a grain of salt, I am still very young for using the product. I wanted something that would moisturize my skin without the grease and also get rid of the lines and wrinkles I get from a late-night college life. Obviously I don&#x27;t have heavy wrinkles or sagging skin; I really just wanted a little moisture lift and boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5/4) Well so far I really like this cream, it is relatively inexpensive for it&#x27;s quality. It goes on very light and isn&#x27;t greasy ( I couldn&#x27;t believe it! ) I already have complements on how even and wonderful my skin looks. I can&#x27;t wait to see what people say after the recommended 30 days... I guess I&#x27;ll let ya&#x27;ll know.</li>
            <li> Product is as describes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this I&#x27;m 40 and wanted something for wrinkle prevention.  I have been using Garnier Moisture Rescue, which I love.  Ultra Lift makes my skin so oily and I was breaking out. I haven&#x27;t had pimples since my teens. It goes on real tacky an did not absorb in to my skin, not even the next day.  I washed my face and it still felt oily. I have really dry skin. For what ever reason this stuff just doesn&#x27;t work on me.  I ended up giving it to my mom. Back to Garnier Moisture Rescue for me.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product at all. It is very gritty and it makes your face very oily. I would not buy or recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and I can&#x27;t tell you how many different moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.  I will admit I really like the Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Dry Skin.  Also, the Clinique Repairwear Night Cream is good.  But those products are right around $50 for the same amount of product you get here.  I finally just got sick of shelling out so much money for a moisturizer that I started trying drug store brands.  I was very unimpressed with the Aveeno Night Cream, and then I found this.  This product is really, really similar to the Clinique Repairwear at a fraction of the price.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m noticing any anti-wrinkle or firming from it, but it does a great job of moisturizing my skin.  I love this product and I will definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use daily, but when I do, it works great.  I assume it does.  No one ever says I look old and beat up.</li>
            <li> love this very nice and goes on well .</li>
            <li> This product causes allergic conjunctivitis. If you google it, you will find top results with customers relating their allergic reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> Love this cream Will buy again.</li>
            <li> really nice.  not sure how much anti wrinkle it really is but it feels nice and firming.</li>
            <li> Despite being labelled a &amp;#34;night cream,&amp;#34; I use this every day.  It&#x27;s light and easy to apply and my mascara doesn&#x27;t blotch like other eye creams I&#x27;ve tried. Garnier makes a good product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Smells nice. Using it as prevention of wrinkles</li>
            <li> Love this product, it smells nice and does feel so good on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve love this lotion for my age group of over 60...keeps my skin looking young and those age lines invisible!</li>
            <li> I like this product--but I&#x27;m not so crazy about it that I would call it  a &#x27;must have&#x27;...It moisturizes nicely, and provides some noticeable tightening.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little over fragranced and doesn&#x27;t offer the level of firming I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;Stll it wasn&#x27;t a bad product.</li>
            <li> I had been using this for the past couple months and it had a negative delayed reaction.  There were small red spots under my eyes, my skin under my eyes was even wrinklier because it was in poor shape from this stuff.  There was peeling under my eyes also.  Every morning when I woke up I had very bloodshot eyes.  I even called in sick to work once because I thought I had pink eye.  The fragrance is WAY too strong.  Don&#x27;t buy this, way too harsh.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, nothing like the day cream. Feels good on the face not greasy or oily and has a very nice smell</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cream. And, I haven&#x27;t used that much of it to give you a &amp;#34;tried-and-true&amp;#34; evaluation. But so far so good. But, it burns my eyes. However, so does a lot of other products. As I &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; I can no longer use some products. It is not the fault of the product. It is the fault of my own physical condition. I&#x27;m 72 years old and can&#x27;t do the things that I used to - and one of those things is to use just anything on my face and it will work. Those days are gone, along with my youth. :) But I would recommend this cream. I think it is a perfectly good product.</li>
            <li> Product began to burn my face around my mouth after using it for 3 months. I had only been applying a VERY thin layer, which probably explains why it took so long to show the damage. And although the fragrance didn&#x27;t bother me, it is somewhat strong and could be overpowering to some. There are likely other products out there that don&#x27;t burn or smell and do a better job.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 20&#x27;s, so no wrinkles (yet), but I had noticed some dryness in my t-zone and around my mouth. Since I began using this nightly, I have seen a huge improvement in my skin. It is softer, and way more moisturized. I love the feel of this cream. It is not oily, rather it is an easy to apply light cream. It stays on, and most importantly the scent is very neutral. Not perfumy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if cream eliminates wrinkles or not. Cream is cool and non-greasy. Very refreshing and it doesn&#x27;t dry out. I have sensitive skin and cream does not irritate my skin. Very pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> So great for pricing, saves a trip to store, can&#x27;t get a better deal, order every other month when runs out, love this product, great fast service!!</li>
            <li> One of the best anti-age products I&#x27;ve ever used!  Works wonders on my neck and chest where I thought there was no hope.  I use this in conjunction with other Ultra-Lift products and am very happy.  I&#x27;ve tried Murad, Lancôme, etc.  I&#x27;ve purchased very expensive (well over $100 per product) creams and serums and they were disappointing.  Everyone responds differently I&#x27;m sure, but this works very well for me.</li>
            <li> It has been a few months that I have been using this night cream.  This is a great buy because it works and the price is excellent..  My skin is very sensitive but it loves this cream.  It takes just a little bit.  I really like that my skin absorbs it so well and it makes my skin very soft. This is now my night time moisturizer of choice.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles so don&#x27;t buy it if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. However it makes my skin SO soft and hydrated so I keep using it.</li>
            <li> Every single Garnier product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve purchased many different products from them, has worked extremely well. They smell very clean without the strong perfumey odor that many body care products have, are made with many raw (so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients), and feel great on the skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for awhile and really like it.</li>
            <li> Great for the price but it makes me break out if I don&#x27;t wash it off in the morning. I was putting it on at night and then just putting my makeup on on top of it in the morning, but then suffered the most terrible acne I&#x27;d had since highschool. Mind you, this was after I was able to put on a Clinique moisturizer at night and then just put makeup on it in the morning with no problem. It is pretty darn greasy but it stings a little one out of every ten or so times I put it on and I assume this means it has retinol, one of the best anti-aging ingredients in these types of lotions, in it because I have had a similar reaction to those in the past. I&#x27;m only 25 and using this to prevent wrinkles so I can&#x27;t comment much on ultimate results, but if you&#x27;re a poor grad student trying to prevent wrinkles like me, it&#x27;s worth the fourteen dollars for sure.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I use it all the time. I&#x27;ve tried different creams, but always come back to this. Different creams work for different skin types/people!!</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin. Nice smell.  I think I would need to stay with the product to see the results I wanted, but did not re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a different type of dispenser. Garnier is a good product and I do use other products that they offer.  It is a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, still deciding, not what I expected.  It is a lite cream ,  Feels nice, waiting for results.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me, saw no difference at all. I was expecting to see some improvement but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> We will see how the product works.  I can&#x27;t rate it until a week from now.  I like some of the other Garnier products.</li>
            <li> I love everything that is from Garnier!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and texture.  I don&#x27;t know if it worked as intended because it made me break out so I quit using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a long while. It&#x27;s great. Very light and keeps my skin moist overnight.</li>
            <li> No adverse allergic reactions.  Skin is smoother and should continue to improve as time goes on. Easy to travel with this size.</li>
            <li> Light and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> This cream might have helped if I could have gotten past the horrible smell.  It was so offensive I threw it away.  It smelled like something in the formula had spoiled.  Very rank odor.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Very good quality.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I used it about once a week and never really noticed a difference. Recently I started using it every night and after the first three consistent nights I looked in the mirror and it looked like I had gotten botox or something. I noticed it mostly under my eyes. Before using this I never thought I needed eye creams or anti wrinkle creams for my eye area but after noticing an improvement and seeing now that it&#x27;s more smooth and awake-looking I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Feel&#x27;s great on my skin an really does help firm skin an smooth wrinkles away. Day 6 I could really feel an see the difference.  I have used Oil Of Olay  for years not anymore I am sold on Garnier Ultra-Lift Anti- Wrinkle Firming night Cream,feels like silk on my skin an I can honestly see the results in 6 days. I will be buying this from now on and the price is great! Fast shipping also. I am so happy I tried this!!! :) I love Amazon also!!! ONE HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34, and haven&#x27;t used many night creams, but I feel like this one works pretty well.  It does have a fragrance, but I&#x27;m actually quite fond of it. (It smells a lot better than some of the other products I&#x27;ve used!)  As far as results go...it does what it says.  I wake up to firmer, moisturized, younger looking skin.  It also seems to reduce the size of my pores which is an added bonus.  Overall, I would recommend it.  It&#x27;s fairly cheap, does what it says, and you can get it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I really like it. I have oily skin still in my late 50&#x27;s and this is not heavy or greasy.  I think it has helped stall the aging process of my skin.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that this product was any better than other skincare products that I&#x27;ve tried and cannot necessarily recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have the words to describe this product, I love it so much! And I tell all my friends about it! I have SUPER SENSITIVE skin and every anti-wrinkle product I have ever tried irritation my skin like crazy and the retinol stuff in them made my skin not only red but even peel off in layers! Pain and terror!! And products like Oil of Olay made me break out. This stuff is however completely none-irritating in any way! Nothing, no redness, no pain, no peeling! Seriously, this is a first for me! And on top of it it WORKS!! I bough it out of desperation, tried a sample for three days and could see it was gentle on my skin and started to make my skin smooth and glowy looking...already. So I bought the bottle and after only about a week of using it I could see those deep wrinkles smoothing and softening. Very noticeable! So I kept using it and also loving how it make my face with makeup glow. And after a while I remembered about the wrinkles that i used to have, looked in the mirror and realized that I didn&#x27;t have ANY of them anymore. I don&#x27;t know how long had passed, didn&#x27;t even notice until they disappeared, but I can tell you right now they are 100% gone, there is not a single wrinkle on my face. So yeah, can you say LOVE? For sure!!</li>
            <li> I must admit,&lt;br /&gt;Well,&lt;br /&gt;i had a hard time Convincing myself that this is NOT working,&lt;br /&gt;I do Love How it Makes your Skin soft !!! &amp;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad side,&lt;br /&gt;Its GREASY !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you toss &amp; turn at night like me,&lt;br /&gt;You get a bonus... You get to TASTE THIS TO !!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used  2 bottles of this,&lt;br /&gt;You Can Get SAME RESULTS FROM PONDS COLD CREME !!  REALLY !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;So after i finish up my LAST jar,&lt;br /&gt;Im going to buy other products&lt;br /&gt;Heck,&lt;br /&gt;Ponds cold creme you get SAME results as this !!&lt;br /&gt;It Does NOT FIRM YOUR FACE,&lt;br /&gt;Please Don&#x27;t Belive this Nonsence !!!!&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t Lie &amp; i Tell the Truth ,&lt;br /&gt;If You Want to Just use this as  To moisten your Skin?  heck Its Great for that !!!&lt;br /&gt;But  Its nothing to do with WRINKLES !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second pot.  I don&#x27;t like to buy expensive creams.  I don&#x27;t apply it every night because I don&#x27;t wear make-up, so just go to sleep as is.  Maybe 1 or 2 times a week, after washing my face I use it.  Honestly, when I wake up in the morning my skin is smoother than it was when I went to bed.  It goes on smoothly and rubs right in.  There is a strong fragrance so if you don&#x27;t like that sort of thing stay away.  I&#x27;m used to it, don&#x27;t mind it at all.  Also, I&#x27;m a freckle face and at 40 have a couple of sun spots.  I use the Aveeno 30spf face lotion during the day and this product at night....one of these lightens the spots very well.  I think it&#x27;s the garnier.</li>
            <li> Was great to find this online, as I can&#x27;t always, at my local store. This product does wonders for middle-aged skin. I use it every night, and people often think I&#x27;m 15 or 20 years younger than I am!</li>
            <li> The first signs of aging in men appear in the eyes and lips. This product is perfect for preserving your age in the eyes. If you are a tired student like I am, you also know about the bags under the eyes that results from late night studying. This product helps with that immensely, and the results are noticeable very quickly. One of the best parts about this cream is that its invigorating. If I am up late and start to feel tired, I will put this on to keep my eyes from feeling droopy. Perhaps its a placebo, but the tingling sensation probably isn&#x27;t. Sometimes I even put it on in the morning just to wake myself up. Barely any cream is needed so this thing will last a long time. Months. And for the price it costs next to nothing annually to keep your eyes looking healthy and feeling awake.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cream and use it each night.  I do see a difference- softer look</li>
            <li> I used this whole jar and saw no difference at all. It does moisturizer but I can find a thousand different moisturizers nothing to see here</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and tried it over several days before returning it. While it is cheaper than other similar products, it didn&#x27;t suit my skin type (mostly oily, some dry patches) and I felt greasy within an hour or two of applying this at night. I wanted to take a shower again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be better for those with drier skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and hard water in my home. I used this years ago and decided to use the last tablespoon of two left in the jar. Can I say amazing! My skin went from crepe-y and dry to terrific and firm in a matter of weeks. I have a deep crease between my brows, a frown line I guess, and this helped erase it.</li>
            <li> Good texture - absorbs nicely. Does seem to minimize some lines. Does not have an overpowering odor to it as some others do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Garnier products for a while now and I love their creams? I will continue using them .</li>
            <li> was to harsh for my skin. My skin is very sensitive. I have used the cream for sensitive and it was great.</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh.  In the morning the skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Great product for the cost.  It does not reverse the aging signs but it keeps the skin well hydrated and feeling smooth.  I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I took the 5 night challenge as stated on the box and found that my skin was firmer and felt lifted! I continued on for 2 weeks and the lines and wrinkles are reduced and I look younger! It even reduced the sagging skin on my neck! I was not expecting such great results.  I have used several other products from different companies and did not see any difference at all.  Needless to say I am loving this product.  BTW I am 65+ and I feel this product was developed for women my age. Thank you Amazon for selling this as a subscribe and save item.</li>
            <li> Has a really strong scent, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Only a very small amount of this cream brings moisture with no greasiness. And an additional perk is that it smells WONDERFUL! :)</li>
            <li> Nice texture, feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> Its a lighter cream than I expected, but that is good in that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sit on your face as you go to sleep</li>
            <li> like Garnier Non-greasy products! Will keep buying it, feel clear and fresh after using. although not about the effects yet..</li>
            <li> Love my &amp;#34;Hope I don&#x27;t  wrinkle night cream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 4 weeks and can&#x27;t say that I see a difference. Most likely will try another product when this is gone.</li>
            <li> I use this every night on my face.  Keeps my face hydrated.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but this product is so great I feel compelled to let others know how much I love it. This is the only cream I have used that is soothing, softens wrinkles and firms skin pretty much immediately. Before I purchased it I had done lots of research for high and low brands and for some reason this one is the underdog that doesn&#x27;t get the much deserved credit it deserves! Get it now!</li>
            <li> I had been using Lancome face creams. This feels lighter and has been doing a great job at keeping dryness away, giving my face a firmer look and feel, and keeping blemishes away.  At a fraction of the price, it&#x27;s won me over.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my normal night cream (Clinique) so I decided to try something a little less expensive.  When I first opened the jar I noticed its strong fragrance.  It was pretty overpowering, but I went ahead and applied the cream.  As soon as it touched my face I felt an intense stinging sensation.  Not nice. I try it three days in a row thinking that my skin would get used to it, but it stung every time I used it.  I ended up throwing the whole jar away.</li>
            <li> This cream moisturizes nearly as well as my dermalogica medium weight cream (skin smoothing cream). Leaves a little residue when using a lot. Has a light sent that I like. Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> The Garnier Ultra Lift Anti Wrinkle Firming Night Cream works very well and has met the requirements I need. Thanks</li>
            <li> no difference. continued use made lines softer but still visible. did not expect miracle. Ce la vie. what more can I say.</li>
            <li> This night cream smells great and leaves my skin super soft.  I have only been using for a month, but will continue to purchase.  I have combination skin and this doesn&#x27;t leave me oily or cause any breakouts. I have seen improvement in my skin.  I also use the Ultra-Lift Serum during the day.  Highly recommend this line.</li>
            <li> I ordered it by mistake I really wanted garnier skin renew radiance moisture cream which I would like to buy but at a good price since shipping adds to price.  ulta lift lift so far no results.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite moisturizer I have ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. Everything from drugstore ones like CeraVe to more high end like Mario Badescu and GlamGlow. My skin was very dry from using proactiv + and it just seemed like no other moisturizer I had tried really did the trick. My esthetician even noticed that my skin was more hydrated after using this product!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles yet so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works in that area. I just picked it up because I am hoping to prevent aging as much as I can. The main reason I chose this one over some of Garnier&#x27;s other anti-aging moisturizers is because it has their new natural pro-retinol formula that is supposed to work faster but be more gentle on your skin so if you&#x27;ve had problems with retinol products irritating your skin I&#x27;d definitely give this one a shot because it feels very calming and soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, after I first started to notice wrinkles in my early 20&#x27;s. It really does improve the look of wrinkles, so much so that I use this before going out if I want to look my best (I don&#x27;t wear makeup). It makes my skin dewy and luminous, I absolutely love it! I have sensitive, dry skin and it&#x27;s perfect for that type, butnot too heavy or greasy. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and I can&#x27;t really notice a difference on the fine lines around my eyes. Also, oddly, it bleached spots in my towel/washcloth wash I wiped my hands.</li>
            <li> Always used this type of Wrinkle night cream, will not make your eyes watery or itchy.  You will see less wrinkles and frown lines in about 2 weeks, leaves your skin very soft.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of moisturizers including a jar of $90 Chanel and this $12 jar is the best. I have really awful allergies and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all except the &#x27;new formula does smell a bit different but still not overly strong.  The texture is great and it melts into your skin. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and using this as a preventive - so far no wrinkles. It is the first lotion I bought again when my jar ran out (and it takes a long time to use up)</li>
            <li> this works ok. I have mature skin that is in great condition, I did tthink it should of worked better on moisturizing. but for the price you could do much worse. Am sure on younger less dry skin it may work much better</li>
            <li> This has way too much perfume, I used it last night and right away it started burning. I washed it off and put on my other cream but I already has blisters. Itchy blisters that I still have today.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the container was already open and some of the cream was used. Quality &#x3D; under required safety standards.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well and my face did look firmer and lines were reduced. Unfortunately, the fragrance made me break out. Will not repurchase.</li>
