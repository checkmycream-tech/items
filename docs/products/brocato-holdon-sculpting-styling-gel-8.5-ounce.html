            <li>Just right!</li>
            <li>good for short hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried different brands through the years but have always come back to Brocato&#x27;s because I find it is the best product!  </li>
            <li>Looked for a replacement for a Paul Mitchell product for many years and finally found it with Hold On - more</li>
            <li>My daughter has VERY curly hair, and this stuff works great at keeping it curled and not frizzy all day long.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair gel.  </li>
            <li>This gel is absolutely the best hair product for anyone with thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting and came quickly.</li>
            <li>Small dab after shower rub into hands and onto hair for great styling control.</li>

            <li>After I get out of shower I dry most the water out of hair</li>
            <li>then I use a quarter size n work in from the roots out makes the hair have texure especially if u have fine hair.......</li>

            <li>Not heavy or sticky!</li>
            <li>Yes, a 5 year old understands the importance of quality gel and always asks me to get her a new bottle when she runs out.</li>
            <li>Either the formula of the gel completely changed or i was sold a very old and expired product</li>
            <li>I am no longer have complete faith in the items I purchase from Amazon.  </li>

            <li> I mix it 50-50 with Brocato Saturation for just enough hold with no weighing down my thick fine hair</li>
            <li> so a bottle of this lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Can not live without this product.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past from my hairdresser and it is usually a clear gel.  </li>
            <li> Now I double read the label so I don&#x27;t pick up that other one!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so one bottle will last 3 months for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is about like all other  setting gels.</li>
            <li> As for the one bad review about the &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; bottle, I know once I picked up a different product from Brocoto, it was cloudy and definitely did not work not the same.  </li>
            <li> Even though the product feels a little sticky on your hands, it doesn&#x27;t cause stickiness in your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, but gives my brush something to hold on to when I&#x27;m drying and styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for quite awhile and my hairdresser was having trouble getting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for awhile, but it&#x27;s not easy to find..  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews hardly ever</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount--maybe the size of a dime--</li>
            <li> Have used for 25 years and was disappointed when could no longer buy product in my area.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d say this is about like all other  setting gels. I don&#x27;t dislike it  and it&#x27;s fine, but not outstanding like the cloud 9 blowout by same company.</li>
            <li> I have used this Brocado styling gel for years, and will search until I find it, ordering several bottles at a time,  I can give it a rating of 5+ Stars!</li>
            <li> I have used Brocato&#x27;s Gel for many years and love it!  I have tried different brands through the years but have always come back to Brocato&#x27;s because I find it is the best product!  I put it on my roots with damp hair and it will give your hair the fullness and style you want!</li>
            <li> My daughter has VERY curly hair, and this stuff works great at keeping it curled and not frizzy all day long. Also, it smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have used it for about twenty-five years or so. Holdon is the best sculpturing product out there. No matter what style I decide to give myself for the day..... it stays in shape.</li>
            <li> I have used for years - love it</li>
            <li> Again, great service and price...u keep this up and there shouldn&#x27;t b any reason u will not do well. Item was priced well and shipping was good.</li>
            <li> Can not live without this product.  After I get out of shower I dry most the water out of hair then I use a quarter size n work in from the roots out makes the hair have texure especially if u have fine hair.......</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is the product I have purchased in the past (many times).  The color was different and the label was slightly different, even though it was printed to look identical.  The gel builds up on my hair.  This is definitely a &amp;#34;re-created&amp;#34; product.  I am no longer have complete faith in the items I purchase from Amazon.  This is the second time this has occurred this year.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my curls behaving in the mid-Atlantic steamy hot summers (keeps the humidity away). Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product for great price. Wonderful seller.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  It holds hair style without any stickiness or extra weight.</li>
            <li> Excellent lightweight gel. Looked for a replacement for a Paul Mitchell product for many years and finally found it with Hold On - more liquid  than gel - works great on short hair. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past from my hairdresser and it is usually a clear gel.  This gel was more yellow in color and while it does the job okay I feel like the product might be old.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair gel.  My 5 yr old niece and I both have curly hair and find that this gel calms the curls and doesn&#x27;t make our hair crunchy. Yes, a 5 year old understands the importance of quality gel and always asks me to get her a new bottle when she runs out. A little goes a long way, so one bottle will last 3 months for me. Love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for awhile, but it&#x27;s not easy to find..  It&#x27;s good on course hair...lot&#x27;s of control.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH BROCATO HAIR GEL.  I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHERS IN THE PAST YEARS BUT BROCATO IS THE BEST.  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS.</li>
            <li> It does the jo better than any I have ever tried</li>
            <li> This gel is absolutely the best hair product for anyone with thick and curly hair. Depending on how you apply it you can generate a straight hair look or just control the curl. Buy this now!!!</li>
            <li> Love this hair gel!  Not heavy or sticky! Just right!</li>
            <li> Either the formula of the gel completely changed or i was sold a very old and expired product</li>
            <li> Have used for 25 years and was disappointed when could no longer buy product in my area. I mix it 50-50 with Brocato Saturation for just enough hold with no weighing down my thick fine hair</li>
            <li> Great.  Thanks for good service</li>
            <li> easy to apply, hold very well leaving hair soft and manageable.  I strongly suggest it to anybody. Try it out.  Great buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It meets my expections.  What more can I say.  I use it everytime my hair is washed.  Too many words to describe.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair gel exclusively since I was in my 20&#x27;s.  I am 52 now.  In former years, you couldn&#x27;t buy it online, because they only sold it at authorized salons.  I understand wanting to support the salons.  I cannot tell you how many damn miles I have driven to get my &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; Holdon hair gel.  Once or twice, I would run out and try something similar.  Nothing compares!  I almost don&#x27;t want to write this because I don&#x27;t want it to get so popular that they can&#x27;t keep up with production!  As for the one bad review about the &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; bottle, I know once I picked up a different product from Brocoto, it was cloudy and definitely did not work not the same.  I cursed myself!  Now I double read the label so I don&#x27;t pick up that other one!  I don&#x27;t write reviews hardly ever but I just want to give them major props.  Please don&#x27;t stop producing for another 50 years Brocato.  After that, I may not care!</li>
            <li> this is an awsome product if you have curley hair, enhances curl, gives definition and some firmness holds the curl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quite some time.  Was getting low so ordered this item.  Exactly what I was expecting and came quickly.</li>
            <li> I have also used this product for years and love how it works on my hair. It&#x27;s not too heavy, but gives my brush something to hold on to when I&#x27;m drying and styling my hair. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> The best styling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this product..good for short hair.</li>
            <li> Small dab after shower rub into hands and onto hair for great styling control.</li>
            <li> This helps hold the curve or curl I put in my hair with a curling iron.  I use a very small amount--maybe the size of a dime--so a bottle of this lasts a long time.  Even though the product feels a little sticky on your hands, it doesn&#x27;t cause stickiness in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 15 years. Sometimes I wander off path and try something else, but always come back to Holdon.</li>
            <li> This is the most convenient place to find this gel. Otherwise I would have to call every salon in town. Don&#x27;t have time for that. I can count on Amazon for everything. Hassle free transaction, product as described and promised, quick delivery. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Brocato products work well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many many years and find it works really well since I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for quite awhile and my hairdresser was having trouble getting it. It arrived right away in good packaging. it is the only product that does not weigh down my fine hair. Thank you, Brocato.</li>
