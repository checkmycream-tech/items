            <li>does a great job, is somewhat mild, but does a great job removing the grease and grime of the day.</li>

            <li>This is great for sensitive skin!</li>

            <li>Love it, started with the 1.7 oz size and will purchase full size.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle cleanser, this one is amazing.  </li>
            <li>nice fragrance and not irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using Seriously clean c cleanser and that stuff puts this to shame.</li>
            <li>My face is clean without being stripped of moisture.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and easy.</li>
            <li>this cleanser is very light weight and washes off all makeup very well.</li>
            <li>It really does remove all your makeup and it&#x27;s safe for your eyes.</li>
            <li>but with fine  suds so you can see exactly where you are cleansing.  </li>

            <li>But it does seem to clean my face well without drying it out or stripping natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I swiped on my [[ASIN:B00B5PDIK8 Fresh Rose Floral Toner 250ml/8.4oz]] afterward using a cotton round and didn&#x27;t notice a trace of makeup.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few and they don&#x27;t tend to smell great, with the exception of the Floral Toner which smells a little too old lady for my taste, but I imagine would smell better to most people than other Fresh products.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle yet very cleansing.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>(And quite honestly when I use something with added fragrance it usually smells overpowering and noxious to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked that it was easy to rinse off and afterwards my skin didn&#x27;t feel tight or dried out.  </li>
            <li>Smells like an herb salad, which i could live with if it worked.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really well suited for sensitive and dry skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt clean my face, breaks me out and nothing usually breaks me out....</li>
            <li>maybe a little pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li>My skin is generally dry, sensitive and acne prone</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle cleanser, this one is amazing.  It lathers beautifully and feels silky on the skin.  My skin is generally dry, sensitive and acne prone and I liked that it didn&#x27;t irritate it whatsoever.  When used with my [[ASIN:B005YB36RY Clarisonic Mia 2 Facial Sonic Cleansing System Limited Edition Bonus Gift Set, Pink]] it does a nice job of removing makeup and oil without over-drying the skin.  I swiped on my [[ASIN:B00B5PDIK8 Fresh Rose Floral Toner 250ml/8.4oz]] afterward using a cotton round and didn&#x27;t notice a trace of makeup.  liked that it was easy to rinse off and afterwards my skin didn&#x27;t feel tight or dried out.  There was no residue left behind.  My skin also didn&#x27;t look as red and flushed as it sometimes does after washing my face. Those who like a more perfumed facial cleanser may be disappointed at how this smells.  It has a slight almost herbal smell.  This seems to be a common experience for me with Fresh products.  I&#x27;ve tried a few and they don&#x27;t tend to smell great, with the exception of the Floral Toner which smells a little too old lady for my taste, but I imagine would smell better to most people than other Fresh products.  For me the slight scent of this product this wasn&#x27;t a big deal as I predominantly use unscented cleansers so I am used to something with little to no scent.  (And quite honestly when I use something with added fragrance it usually smells overpowering and noxious to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a really, really nice facial cleanser.  It&#x27;s really well suited for sensitive and dry skin like mine.  My only question is why I didn&#x27;t try it sooner.</li>
            <li> this cleanser is very light weight and washes off all makeup very well. nice fragrance and not irritating to the skin. maybe a little pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and Its my favorite. It is gentle yet very cleansing. I dont  use anything else.</li>
            <li> Really lovely smell,  creamy but with fine  suds so you can see exactly where you are cleansing.  I use it with my Clarkson.  Face is soft and sparkling clean feeling after rinsing.</li>
            <li> beyond my imagination</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and gently cleanses my skin leaving it feeling very fresh (no pun intended). However, this cleanser is only $38 at Sephora. No idea why it is so expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> smells like cucumbers with a  light floral note that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose. does a great job, is somewhat mild, but does a great job removing the grease and grime of the day.</li>

            <li> I love this cleanser. I have very sensitive skin and this product does wonders for my skin. I have used for years and will use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin! It doesn&#x27;t dry you out but gets all of your makeup off. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing like it. Been using this product for years and only wish I started using it sooner. It&#x27;s fresh and easy. Sudsy when starting with a small amount. Priceless for the price.</li>
            <li> good feeling and clean.</li>
