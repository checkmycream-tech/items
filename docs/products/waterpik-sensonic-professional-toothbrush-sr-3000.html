            <li>It eventually didn&#x27;t hold a good charge.  </li>
            <li>It feels slippery in my hand while I am brushing, and I find that kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>always good ; have had a couple and</li>

            <li>Was very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This model is improved in style, weight and effective brushing.</li>
            <li>An in-between speed would be nice.</li>
            <li>The compact head brush fits nicely into my mouth.</li>
            <li>excellent product, far superior to its competitor.</li>
            <li>So much more effective than my manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with their customer care and warranty coverage; make sure you register when you receive yours, and enjoy better dental health along with peace of mind.</li>
            <li>Outstanding toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush &amp; the size of the brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>My Waterpik is better.  </li>
            <li>I always get gold stars from my dentists for oral care :-)</li>
            <li>Before that I had a Teledyne Waterpik electric toothbrush that must have lasted 15 years or more.  </li>
            <li>sonic brush by years, love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Waterpik Sensonic toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good sonic toothbrush that appears to do a very nice job.</li>
            <li>It feels gentle and cleans my teeth VERY effectively.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Great brush - have been using it for a few months now and we are really happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Happy to get that full mouth clean feeling after brushing the full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my dentist and it does a good job of keeping my teeth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I have tried other toothbrushes and this is the best one.  </li>
            <li>The 2-minute timer makes it easy to time your brushing.</li>
            <li>I really feel that this brush cleans exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than a Sonicare and seems to clean just as well; just not as many speeds.</li>
            <li>The inter-dental  brush head I&#x27;m experimenting with as well as my teeth stain easily.</li>
            <li>Strong vibration and nicer charging stand (can face any direction).  </li>
            <li>Also, great ORAL health translates to great overall bodily health.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whereas in the past, brushing for two minutes seemed to take forever, with this device I find brushing to be so very delightful that I am sometimes tempted to immediately experience an encore performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>your teeth are STAYING clean by using this product.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t feel clean with them.  </li>
            <li>Two minute timer is a cool feature.</li>
            <li>Hope you love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>This is my first sonic toothbrush and so far it appears to do a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>The older version was better</li>
            <li>Got great results from my older model (1000 series), but it recently stopped holding a charge and often died out mid-brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient and easy to use, love the two speeds (low and high), and love the charging cradle</li>
            <li>This unit is so powerful</li>
            <li>The one oral b offers is a bit better to get in between teeth.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful, cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I feared it would take my enamel right off</li>
            <li>Really made my teeth and mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>had previous model before and liked -- this improved new model even better</li>
            <li>Better than prior Waterpik electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I liked the 30 sec notification and the 2 min automatic shutoff.</li>
            <li>The device shuts off at exactly 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Incidentally, the old brushes DO fit the newer model</li>
            <li>This is my first electronic, ultrasonic type toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth better than other leading brands.  </li>
            <li>I think the smaller one is better overall as you maneuver it better in certain spots.</li>
            <li>I will go back to my Bling Diamond toothbrush that we loved for several years, but I will also not order through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>my wife and I use the toothbrush and can easily get a week&#x27;s worth of use... probably closer to 1 minute long brushes twice a day</li>
            <li>Really cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth seem much cleaner with this one than the Oral B I had.  </li>
            <li>The newest is lithium powered and very aggressive.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I will stay with a toothbrush that is well made and worth the money-Waterpik Sensonic professional Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Some dentists will say &amp;#34;Poo, Poo&amp;#34; but using Sensonic you are unable to get that good clean feeling from a teeth cleaning from the dentist office . .</li>
            <li>Charging from the single bar takes about 10 hours or so, but I did run the brush for 9 straight days of twice a day brushing with 2 people and did not get a flashing light.  </li>
            <li>It seems to vibrate more in the handle than at the brush end compared with the previous model - Its not my imagination, we all use both depending on which is charged.</li>
            <li>Replaced an older model.</li>
            <li>I had a decent Sonicare for 12 years.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t brush in high speed.</li>
            <li>Its soft bristles massage the gums at the same time that they thoroughly clean one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It is easier to keep clean &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my new Waterpik Toothbrush for a couple of months now.  </li>
            <li>I had an email from them saying they were sending me a brand new toothbrush, which is this model.</li>
            <li>This review has taken me 3 months to complete!  </li>
            <li>this is my second one, the first one outlasted the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I fixed it myself.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge longer than my old one.  </li>
            <li>feel like I just had a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>so you know how much charge is left.  </li>
            <li>The SR-1000 would completely recharge in about 10 hours or so.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Waterpik toothbrush to replace an electric Oral B that died on me that was barely a year old.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned when I first read the instructions that a 24 hour charge was necessary if the battery indicator went all the way down to a flashing light.  </li>
            <li>Definitely see a difference in brushing with this one compared to your normal traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Other personal appliances operated just fine; however the previous Waterpik burned when attempted to connect to converter.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it--thought I had a bee in my mouth, but got over that after a few brushings.  </li>
            <li>Love how the replacement heads are so reasonable - we gave up our other electric toothbrush because the heads were so expensive.</li>

            <li> Love how the replacement heads are so reasonable - we gave up our other electric toothbrush because the heads were so expensive.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Sensonic functioned well for 3 weeks after purchase, then completely broke down.  </li>
            <li> But, it has all of the same features plus some extra features my more expensive dead one did not have.  </li>
            <li> It also stays charged for a long time...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a minus as I would prefer to buy from a local Walmart for something like that, but I knew this before I ordered this.</li>
            <li> With the long charge, it will get me across the country when I travel by car.</li>
            <li> I will not buy anything other than Water Pik in the future.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have spent the money a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep tartar off and teeth white without wearing down gums the way manual toothbrushes often do.</li>
            <li> Also, I paid less than half of what I dished out for the more expensive electric Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is extremely well, two weeks without charging.</li>
            <li> Works but has a odd vibration</li>
            <li> But I figured I&#x27;ve saved money by needing to see the hygienist less often.</li>

            <li> I should have gotten it years ago.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Sensonic functioned well for 3 weeks after purchase, then completely broke down.  The toothbrush is useless now, &amp; I just learned that I missed the return deadline.  I will go back to my Bling Diamond toothbrush that we loved for several years, but I will also not order through Amazon.  I realize it was my bad that I missed the return window, but who would ever think that a product like this would crap out after 3-4 weeks.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The BEST electric tooth brush on the market!  Like daily trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! The 2-minute timer makes it easy to time your brushing. My last dental checkup got rave reviews. Take care of yourself and buy this product!</li>
            <li> Works but has a odd vibration</li>
            <li> Mine lasted 1 week.  I fixed it myself.  It wouldn&#x27;t brush in high speed. If I have further issues I&#x27;ll go to WaterPik.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.  It&#x27;s just a hassle.</li>
            <li> The older version was better</li>
            <li> Outstanding toothbrush. Very powerful, cleans very well. Fell like dentist cleaning after done brushing. Battery life is extremely well, two weeks without charging. Two minute timer is a cool feature. Definitely see a difference in brushing with this one compared to your normal traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works well but battery life is questionable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new Waterpik Toothbrush for a couple of months now.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Really cleans my teeth.  Feels good on my gums. My dentist recommended it.  The quality is what you would expect from waterpik.</li>
            <li> Look, Ma, no plaque!  This is the third Waterpik brush I&#x27;ve purchased.  They clean my teeth better than other leading brands.  They do however wear out after about three years.  But I figured I&#x27;ve saved money by needing to see the hygienist less often.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with Water Pik. Got great results from my older model (1000 series), but it recently stopped holding a charge and often died out mid-brushing. I contacted them online with the model and serial number along with an explanation of my problem. This was on a Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the middle of the next business day I had an email from them saying they were sending me a brand new toothbrush, which is this model. And four days later it is here sitting on its charger! Very pleased with their customer care and warranty coverage; make sure you register when you receive yours, and enjoy better dental health along with peace of mind.</li>
            <li> I replaced a previous model which served wqell for years but lost ability to charge.  This model is improved in style, weight and effective brushing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik toothbrush to replace an electric Oral B that died on me that was barely a year old.  I love the brush &amp; the size of the brush.  My teeth seem much cleaner with this one than the Oral B I had.  It holds a charge longer than my old one.  It is easier to keep clean &amp; dry.  Also, I paid less than half of what I dished out for the more expensive electric Oral B.  But, it has all of the same features plus some extra features my more expensive dead one did not have.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older model. Great electronic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Great brush - have been using it for a few months now and we are really happy with it.  Love how the replacement heads are so reasonable - we gave up our other electric toothbrush because the heads were so expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It feels gentle and cleans my teeth VERY effectively. It also stays charged for a long time...like 3 weeks. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great seller.</li>
            <li> I had a decent Sonicare for 12 years.  It eventually didn&#x27;t hold a good charge.  My Waterpik is better.  Every time I use it my mouth/gums/teeth feel like I just had a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> Excellent unit.  Better than prior Waterpik electric toothbrushes.  Strong vibration and nicer charging stand (can face any direction).  I liked the 30 sec notification and the 2 min automatic shutoff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush. It was recommended to me by my dentist and it does a good job of keeping my teeth feeling fresh and clean. The battery stays charged for about a week, which is great. It also has a timer and 2 speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with the toothbrush is the grip. It feels slippery in my hand while I am brushing, and I find that kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using versions of this for years. The newest is lithium powered and very aggressive. They have been clinically shown to outperform Sonicare in plaque removal. I always get gold stars from my dentists for oral care :-)</li>
            <li> had previous model before and liked -- this improved new model even better</li>
            <li> Rather than merely brush up and down against one&#x27;s teeth and gums, this one hums against them, even at low speed. Its soft bristles massage the gums at the same time that they thoroughly clean one&#x27;s teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the way it briefly stops every 30 seconds to inform me that it is time to move on the next quadrant. The device shuts off at exactly 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another wonderful feature is that each of the two included brushes has a life expectancy of 3 months. OEM replacements, if purchased as a package of 3, can currently be had for a mere $7 and change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas in the past, brushing for two minutes seemed to take forever, with this device I find brushing to be so very delightful that I am sometimes tempted to immediately experience an encore performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, June 10, 2015: A few weeks ago, this unit (my wife&#x27;s) began to fail to hold a charge, i.e., less than 3 months from the Mar. 9 purchase date. But the unit that I purchased for myself months earlier is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m requesting a replacement for my wife&#x27;s unit under the 2-year warranty. I will update my experience with that at a later date. Because of the premature failure, I&#x27;ve reduced the stars from 5 to 3.</li>
            <li> I have tried other toothbrushes and this is the best one.  I wish I would have spent the money a long time ago.  I will not buy anything other than Water Pik in the future.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this brush! Helps keep tartar off and teeth white without wearing down gums the way manual toothbrushes often do. Considering that a dentist visit costs me $75, this is a great investmenent. Also, great ORAL health translates to great overall bodily health. (Remember to floss). You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this investment!</li>
            <li> This brush replaced an earlier Waterpik brush that was zapped whenever using a 220v to 110v converter in Italy.  Other personal appliances operated just fine; however the previous Waterpik burned when attempted to connect to converter. Incidentally, the old brushes DO fit the newer model</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had others, but this combo is excellent----Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic, ultrasonic type toothbrush.  Now that I&#x27;ve tried this, I will never go back to a manual toothbrush.  It&#x27;s convenient and easy to use, love the two speeds (low and high), and love the charging cradle it comes with.  So much more effective than my manual toothbrush.  I recommend this product to everyone.  A quality product.</li>
            <li> I really feel that this brush cleans exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> always good ; have had a couple and they are great / I would like to see a replaceable battery.</li>
            <li> Requested a SR-1000 for christmas present a number of years ago. Was very pleased with its performance. Really made my teeth and mouth feel clean. Alas, the base cracked after the plastic turned brittle due to age and then shorted out. So I had a well used handle with no way to recharge even though unit still held a good two week charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to go with the Waterpik again as replacement. Used it for the first time today. This unit is so powerful I feared it would take my enamel right off 😆. Happy to get that full mouth clean feeling after brushing the full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase if this base holds up. Only time will tell if that is the case.</li>
            <li> This review has taken me 3 months to complete!  Excellent product and would buy again!</li>
            <li> I adore this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using&lt;br /&gt;an electric, sonic style now for 2 yrs, and&lt;br /&gt;my dentist &amp; hygienist say my teeth are&lt;br /&gt;cleaner &amp; healthier than when I used a manual brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best tooth brush out there.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than a Sonicare and seems to clean just as well; just not as many speeds. An in-between speed would be nice.</li>
            <li> I bought a SR-1000 toothbrush in October 2007 and it lasted 5 years.  Before that I had a Teledyne Waterpik electric toothbrush that must have lasted 15 years or more.  This time around I decided to go with the SR-3000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SR-3000 is a very nice upgrade from the SR-1000.  The handle is slimmer and there is a charge indicator so you know how much charge is left.  Also, the charging base is much improved over the flimsy SR-1000 base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushing performance seems the same as the SR-1000 and it accepts the same brush heads.  Our teeth feel really clean.  I was a little concerned when I first read the instructions that a 24 hour charge was necessary if the battery indicator went all the way down to a flashing light.  The SR-1000 would completely recharge in about 10 hours or so.  The instructions also stated that the charge would provide 7 days of brushing twice a day for 2 minutes and that when one bar was left it was recommended to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality my wife and I use the toothbrush and can easily get a week&#x27;s worth of use... probably closer to 1 minute long brushes twice a day and my wife uses the low setting.  Charging from the single bar takes about 10 hours or so, but I did run the brush for 9 straight days of twice a day brushing with 2 people and did not get a flashing light.  The bush then recharged in about 14 hours and was used mid-way by both of us and put back in the base to finish charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the SR-3000 works great.  I use the regular brush head and my wife uses the compact one.  We are very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first sonic toothbrush and so far it appears to do a good job of cleaning my teeth. I&#x27;m still experimenting with the 3 brush heads that come with it. I think the smaller one is better overall as you maneuver it better in certain spots. Both brush heads are shaped to get in between teeth as you can feel that while you&#x27;re brushing. The inter-dental  brush head I&#x27;m experimenting with as well as my teeth stain easily. It appears to help, but it&#x27;s shape limits it a bit. The one oral b offers is a bit better to get in between teeth. Ordering brush heads will be a hassle as I can&#x27;t get them locally and only through Amazon or Waterpik. That&#x27;s a minus as I would prefer to buy from a local Walmart for something like that, but I knew this before I ordered this. Overall, a good sonic toothbrush that appears to do a very nice job. Teeth feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> The compact head brush fits nicely into my mouth. The pulse rate cleans my teeth. The charge holds an impressive length of time. I have not used, but will, the carrying case. With the long charge, it will get me across the country when I travel by car.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> excellent product, far superior to its competitor. this is my second one, the first one outlasted the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; sonic brush by years, love it.</li>
            <li> Somehow this model seems cheaper and not as substantial.  It seems to vibrate more in the handle than at the brush end compared with the previous model - Its not my imagination, we all use both depending on which is charged.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel like they do when you step out of the dentist&#x27;s chair after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;And the Dental Tech will remark how much less tartar you have compared to previous appointments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and Sensonic out performs them all.  Been using it for years.  Some dentists will say &amp;#34;Poo, Poo&amp;#34; but using Sensonic you are unable to get that good clean feeling from a teeth cleaning from the dentist office . . .meaning your teeth are STAYING clean by using this product.  The first time I tried it--thought I had a bee in my mouth, but got over that after a few brushings.  I will never go back to a regular tooth brush.  Just don&#x27;t feel clean with them.  Hope you love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I have been using the Waterpik Sensonic toothbrush for many years.  The replacement brush heads are expensive but they last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is a powerful toothbrush.  My teeth feel great after I brush them.  I recently tried another brand of sonic toothbrush but I returned that one because the brush heads fell apart in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson.  I will stay with a toothbrush that is well made and worth the money-Waterpik Sensonic professional Toothbrush.</li>
