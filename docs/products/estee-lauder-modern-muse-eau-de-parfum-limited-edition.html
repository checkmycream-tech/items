            <li>My painter who was driving me that day ( I had pneumonia) fell in love.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt one of the most lovely perfumes I have used.</li>
            <li>and I love it too.  </li>
            <li>I am still glad that I purchased it though.</li>
            <li>What can you say about a perfume, you love it or don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll smell so lovely....</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I think it is my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>Nice clean refreshing smell that goes well with my chemistry.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and use it MOSTLY for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I loved how it was delivered so fast</li>
            <li>The wife wanted this for Christmas and Amazon made it easy to purchase.</li>
            <li>Since I love Estee Lauder and have Beautiful, Pleasures, Sensuous Nude and Pleasures Bloom I just had to have their new scent Modern Muse.  </li>
            <li>From the very first time I smelled it to now I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Wife loves this and her friends(male and female) say it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Is light and feminine.</li>
            <li>but if I bought it at a department store I would have been eligible for a free gift.</li>
            <li>Light and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>just right :)</li>
            <li>Liked it so much I changed my perfume brand for the first time in many years.</li>
            <li>I would recommend going to macy&#x27;s and smelling it first to make sure you like it.</li>
            <li>Product was authentic and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Always smells rich, though.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and floral, but has a touch of a woodsy, almost musky heart.</li>
            <li>But I still love Modern Muse</li>
            <li>After using Modern Muse, now this is one of my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Sweet and haunting.</li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I have loved Estee Lauder colognes and perfumes for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I first had it as a sample, and loved it enough to purchase the full sized version.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this new fragrance and love it.  </li>
            <li>Experience the new fragrance that captures your style, your confidence, your creative spirit.</li>
            <li>You get so much for your money, it&#x27;s a huge container.</li>
            <li>Modern Muse is a much lighter and more floral scent.  </li>
            <li>A nice change from Estee Lauder Intuition, but will probably go back to Intuition</li>
            <li>I love perfumes and this one is extra special.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful scent that seems classic yet modern - not too floral, not too dark,</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and this is my second time purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for Christmas ;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this parfum, however it seems that the scent does not last once it is sprayed on.</li>
            <li>and I have tons of bottles of different perfumes because I love perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it does not last at all.</li>
            <li>its smell funny didn&#x27;t smell like the way suppoded too</li>
            <li>This fragrance makes me feel mature, but it is not too rich to wear during the daytime.</li>
            <li>It has a light, slightly flowery, but very clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now becoming my signature scent, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>This, Modern Muse, is a newer scent.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The top of the perfume was empty.</li>
            <li>I even got a compliment one day when I was wearing the Modern Muse.  </li>
            <li>thanks no problem</li>
            <li>Its original - that was essential for me.</li>
            <li>This Modern Muse is a gentle scent and may be worn by young as their first lady scent or for us mature ladies.</li>
            <li>Apparently so do many of my male and female clients do as well.</li>
            <li>Estee Lauder has managed to create another classic.  </li>
            <li>It has an elegant and refined quality, without being high strung or up tight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty fragrance!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is authentic because it can not last as long as the one I bought in the shop.</li>
            <li>The smooth floral and slightly spicy fragrance adds an essential feminine touch for my days at the office and smells equally delicious with that little black dress for a night at the club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Chic New Vision of Femininity&lt;br</li>
            <li>I smelled this in a magazine and really liked the powdery, subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>Try it you may be surprised by the attention!</li>
            <li>I would recomend this for older ladies who just want to feel fresh after a shower and a few short sweet squirts.</li>
            <li>I love the smell although it doesn&#x27;t stay on me personally as long as other perfumes.</li>
            <li>I love it, the price is a little higher on Amazon compared to you buying in the department store because the department store have gift sets and you get the lotion too for 15 dollars less.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The carefully constructed blending of two distinctively different yet equally dynamic accords provides an intriguing,</li>
            <li>This has a very pretty and delicate smell but after a while it begins to get that &amp;#34;old</li>

            <li> I love it, the price is a little higher on Amazon compared to you buying in the department store because the department store have gift sets and you get the lotion too for 15 dollars less.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have loved Estee Lauder colognes and perfumes for a long time.  This, Modern Muse, is a newer scent.  It is soft and fresh smelling.  It sits quietly and does not over power the wearer or announce your arrival before you are actually in the room!  I have received many compliments about it and questions about what &#x27;are you wearing?&#x27;  I truly do love it!</li>
            <li> Gosh... This is so sexy and musky and chillax! I can just lie back and  smell it all day long</li>
            <li> Got a sample in a magazine and had to have it.  Have not felt this way about a fragrance since I was a teenager!  Lots of compliments especially from my husband!</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine and really liked the powdery, subtle scent.  Great price at Amazon and was shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and this is my second time purchasing it. I don&#x27;t think it lasts very long though.</li>
            <li> Wife always considered this brand as &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34;. Not any more! She gets compliments everywhere she goes.</li>
            <li> Found it in a sample from a magazine the wife had..definitely a good choice and wont be beaten price</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! I get so many compliments.  One of my favorites!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good everyone talks about the good smell when I wear it. I love it, the price is a little higher on Amazon compared to you buying in the department store because the department store have gift sets and you get the lotion too for 15 dollars less. But I still love Modern Muse it&#x27;s one of my favorite go to perfume.</li>
            <li> I love perfumes and this one is extra special.  I love the scent and use it MOSTLY for special occasions.  Once in a while, when I am in my sweats, I spoil myself by spraying it all over me.  It&#x27;s an awesome  experience.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, it&#x27;s unique and beautiful</li>
            <li> A gift for our daughter, she loves it! Her patients compliment the scent as not too strong &amp; it stays with her all day! She&#x27;s pleased!</li>
            <li> The wife wanted this for Christmas and Amazon made it easy to purchase. The price was competitive as well. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The best perfume I ever had!</li>
            <li> My Wife Loved It. Good Price</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent that seems classic yet modern - not too floral, not too dark, just right :)</li>
            <li> i gave you 1 star because you just left the product out of the building which is a big issue in my neighborhood</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this new fragrance and love it.  It has a light, slightly flowery, but very clean fragrance.  I have been stopped twice by two women and asked what I was wearing.  They loved it too!!!  I cannot review how long it lasts, as I usually apply it in the afternoon and it seems to last long into the night.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this and her friends(male and female) say it smells great.  Asking where they can get it.</li>
            <li> I just HAD to get this perfume after I sampled it in a department store and it stayed on my jacket for DAYS, and I&#x27;m not kidding! I love love love the way it smells but I was very happy that it stayed on my clothes so well! Perfect for lots of ages! I can&#x27;t wait for Christmas ;)</li>
            <li> looking for an exquisite divine fragrance .. I found this fragrance and become fascinated once .. buy it and I&#x27;m super happy</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this ðŸ’¯ ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> After using Modern Muse, now this is one of my favorite perfume.The smell is so perfect light and stay for the longer time.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Estee Lauder perfumes but often thought they were \\&quot;just too strong.\\&quot;  Modern Muse is a much lighter and more floral scent.  Liked it so much I changed my perfume brand for the first time in many years.</li>
            <li> as I expect, very good</li>
            <li> Perfume is very personal but I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Price was great shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Nice clean refreshing smell that goes well with my chemistry. Others find it pleasantly refreshing. I would recomend this for older ladies who just want to feel fresh after a shower and a few short sweet squirts.</li>
            <li> oh yes Estee Lauder are one of my favorite parfumes.thank you thats the only brand i use. thank you again</li>
            <li> When I tried it at the Belks counter just for the heck of it, I fell in love. My painter who was driving me that day ( I had pneumonia) fell in love. When everytime I go out, men and women alike compliment you on your scent and ask the name, well it speaks volumes ladies ;)</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! It is not the usual flowery smell.</li>
            <li> I loved how it was delivered so fast and it was just what I wanted thank you you !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome buy! You get so much for your money, it&#x27;s a huge container. I would recommend going to macy&#x27;s and smelling it first to make sure you like it. I already knew this smelled great from a sample so I purchased it online</li>
            <li> Wonderful light fragrence.  Office or day use :o)</li>
            <li> The top of the perfume was empty.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife. She loves it and I got it for less than I would have paid at the mall so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. My husband gave to me last Christmas and everybody around me ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. Is light and feminine.</li>
            <li> Amazing Muze Just Like Me!!!</li>
            <li> Product was authentic and exactly as described. It was well packaged and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Apparently so do many of my male and female clients do as well. I&#x27;m a Cosmetologist and have close contact and I delight in the compliments. This Modern Muse is a gentle scent and may be worn by young as their first lady scent or for us mature ladies. I wear it day and night. Try it you may be surprised by the attention!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I was looking for a replacement to my Ralph Lauren Style that was discontinued and this one is very similar.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty fragrance!</li>
            <li> OMG FAST SHIPPING BEST PRODUCT!! WILL ALWAYS BUY FROM THIS SELLER! FAVORITE PERFUME! BEST VALUE!</li>
            <li> I purchased Estee Lauder Muse perfume after sniffing samples in Vogue and Marie Claire magazines.  The smooth floral and slightly spicy fragrance adds an essential feminine touch for my days at the office and smells equally delicious with that little black dress for a night at the club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to re-touch it during the day, but that&#x27;s probably my individual skin absorption.  It wears down from floral to slightly spicy (think it might have sandalwood in it?) by noon.  Always smells rich, though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is authentic because it can not last as long as the one I bought in the shop.</li>
            <li> This has a very pretty and delicate smell but after a while it begins to get that &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Very large bottle, great every day scent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume.As usually best pricing with Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> Sweet and haunting. SUCH an improvement in Estee Lauder&#x27;s line. To me, all of their recent fragrances have been very generic and drugstore-ish. This is the best and most &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; smelling one since Cinnabar. I get a honeysuckle/tuber rose/jasmine odor which is just beautiful. Wish it lingered longer but really no complaints. Keep it in inventory, Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt one of the most lovely perfumes I have used. It has an elegant and refined quality, without being high strung or up tight. It smells clean and floral, but has a touch of a woodsy, almost musky heart. This fragrance makes me feel mature, but it is not too rich to wear during the daytime. I first had it as a sample, and loved it enough to purchase the full sized version. It&#x27;s now becoming my signature scent, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is truly amazing... I receive compliments everywhere I go , it&#x27;s a hit..</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume it smells great and it last all day and night untill you shower alot of compliments on this,I will be purchasing this again!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Since I love Estee Lauder and have Beautiful, Pleasures, Sensuous Nude and Pleasures Bloom I just had to have their new scent Modern Muse.  From the very first time I smelled it to now I just love it.  It is a very shy, quiet floral with a strong woodsy undertone.  My husband loves it on me and I love it too.  Estee Lauder has managed to create another classic.  What do you expect from them?  For the young and young at heart you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> Experience the new fragrance that captures your style, your confidence, your creative spirit. An alluring contrast of sparkling florals and sleek, sensual woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Chic New Vision of Femininity&lt;br /&gt;The carefully constructed blending of two distinctively different yet equally dynamic accords provides an intriguing,</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this parfum, however it seems that the scent does not last once it is sprayed on. I have yet to receive a compliment on it. I am still glad that I purchased it though. The Amazon price was less than the dept store would have charged but if I bought it at a department store I would have been eligible for a free gift.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift and she loves it!</li>
            <li> What can you say about a perfume, you love it or don&#x27;t buy it.  I bought it!</li>
            <li> very fine product arrived as ordered on time with no issues</li>
            <li> Light and long-lasting. Very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Smells great bought this for my wife!!</li>
            <li> Its original - that was essential for me.</li>
            <li> A nice change from Estee Lauder Intuition, but will probably go back to Intuition</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume!! It&#x27;s just exceptional in every way! The scent is feminine, fresh &amp; alluring, the staying power is perfect, the bottle is cute, not too mention all of the compliments I receive while wearing it!!! You&#x27;ll smell so lovely....</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I think it is my favorite perfume and I have tons of bottles of different perfumes because I love perfume.  Modern Muse smells the best out of all of my perfumes.  I even got a compliment one day when I was wearing the Modern Muse.  I would highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I love the smell although it doesn&#x27;t stay on me personally as long as other perfumes. It has a clean fresh scent.</li>
