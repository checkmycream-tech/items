            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>Maybe Mango would be a better smell but was trying to replace the awesome product which is not longer on the market Hemp Hand Protector by Vitamoist as it had an awesome hydrating, calming effect on irritated skin.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that the strength of the fragrance diminishes rapidly with time.  </li>
            <li>Great as an over-all moisturizer, especially useful for applying to just-shaved legs.</li>

            <li>This is and amazing product 5 stars  for Hemp Body Butter</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING body lotion.  </li>
            <li>Like many body butters, this one contains both cocoa and shea butters (which is all Fair Trade).  </li>
            <li>I love you, Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the earthy smell from the hand soap</li>
            <li>Many people don&#x27;t mind the scent of these hemp creams, but some do.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Not quite earthy or herbal, but more synthetic and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li>I love the soothing effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the thickness of the hand protector.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema all over her body, and we have tried many lotions and creams.</li>
            <li>and I love what it does for my hands.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve known better being a hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>The best remedy for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is the best thing for somebody with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, not too pricy.</li>
            <li>It also has Babassu oil, which I can&#x27;t claim to know much about, but is supposed to be a good, light, non-pore-clogging moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Lo and behold -- Amazon had it via Prime and for $1 more than the super sale price The Body Shop website was selling it.</li>
            <li>Granted he is also taking fish oil tablets daily, but I believe this cream has contributed greatly to the healing of his psoriasis.</li>
            <li>LIGHT FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>It is probably one of the better body butters out there for real skin therapy and improvement, going on creamily and soaking in to leave non-greasy, satisfied skin in its wake.</li>
            <li>like the original smell of the product, but cause I&#x27;m a smell&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on dry skin.</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li>Also has a really cool scent.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and this actually soaks into your skin instead of sitting on top.</li>
            <li>Super buttery for the driest of skins.</li>
            <li>Really good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>this was givin as a christmas present to a friend who has never tried it but has braged about it being nice</li>
            <li>I love its natural smell.  </li>
            <li>extra soft and great to put all over the body.</li>
            <li>It would be best for those with dry skin, since oily or normal skin types would probably find it to be too much unless used very infrequently.  </li>
            <li>Hydrating and loved the hemp oil content BUT was looking for a light fresh scent and instead my nose caught a scent of old oil not fresh n light.</li>
            <li>The new product is decidedly cheaper, being what appears to be a waxy hydrogenated cream, a light lime color, and the smell was replaced with a migraine-inducing florid fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very unisex fragrance regardless, and if you normally use cologne or perfume it would cover the smell of the Body Butter easily.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the one using the product, you&#x27;ll still be able to smell it on yourself, but it&#x27;s not overpowering for someone sitting next to you.  </li>
            <li>My husband swears by The Body Shop&#x27;s line of hemp products to help keep his super super super dry skin under control.  </li>
            <li>I love the light butter and use it everyday for moisturizer on my face.  </li>
            <li>This has been one of my favorite products for a long time</li>
            <li>Interesting scent, strange feel to it.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer noted, the hemp seed oil is really good for helping skin repair itself (either for disease-based problems like psoriasis or environmentally caused damage, like from dry air) and absorb moisture more effectively thanks to its incredibly high concentration of fatty acids.    </li>
            <li>This is a large container for the .  </li>
            <li>that still smelled fine (just running low.)</li>
            <li>The hemp seed oil in this product is what really sets it apart.  </li>
            <li>Next time will try using the Body Shop Mango or the Hempz lotion which is available on line or at Wallmart.</li>
            <li>I could find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I use this and straight coconut oil in rotation.</li>
            <li>Just go straight to the source.</li>
            <li>Very reach.</li>
            <li>this so far is the only good topical treatment,</li>
            <li>Last Christmas my wife got me a refill, which was absolutely nothing like the original product.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and does a great job on keeping your skin, face moisturized.</li>
            <li>Yeah, sensitive skin + pretty much</li>
            <li>With shipping, though, it turned out to be kind of pointless unless I bought lots of containers.</li>
            <li>some cheap watered down lotion.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to commit to multiple containers</li>
            <li>I had done allot of research on natural remedies after months of dermatology appointments and prescribed creams</li>
            <li>side note - i&#x27;m 63 yrs old.</li>
            <li>After various Googling adventures, I noticed a lot of people mentioning this particular body butter</li>
            <li>This Hemp Body Butter isn&#x27;t always part of his daily routine, but particularly during the winter months it often is.  </li>
            <li>Smells a little funky earthy but not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try another product for my super dry parched skin now that I live in a desert climate that contained hemp and other nourishing oils and butters.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry skin and base for homemade wrinkle cream/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>only apply this twice a day, though (once in the morning and once before bed), because any more than that and my sensitive skin gets angry.</li>

            <li> It is not gone, but has lightened and his skin is far less dry and scabby.</li>
            <li> And it lingers on my skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is not the same product whatsoever, not even remotely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d been fighting dry and itchy skin for a while.</li>
            <li> I imagine they were dry, too, because of all the hand washing</li>
            <li> This Hemp Body Butter spreads evenly and is therapeutic for dry, chapped elbows and hands.</li>
            <li> I like its unusual, subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try mixing in some pleasing essential oil to fix the fragrance, as it&#x27;s not worth the money to just return it.</li>
            <li> Use it after you&#x27;ve toweled dry from a shower and your skin is still slightly damp so it&#x27;ll spread easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried tons of other products to help my hands but none of them worked.</li>
            <li> Only body butter I&#x27;ve used for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> It was a shea butter product of dark sage color that smelled earthy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the desire of buying other brands, The Body Shop, you blow my mind!</li>
            <li> once you get past the not great scent the bottom line is my skin stays moist and soft all day and some.  </li>
            <li> It has a slightly medicinal, slightly green or earthy smell.  </li>
            <li> hard working man with rough hands..</li>
            <li> When I started using it, it was as if something had been missing and</li>
            <li> it is very thick and creamy, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Tthe product itself is as described, but the fragrance is very odd.</li>
            <li> (I use a small whisk&lt;br</li>
            <li> anything &#x3D; sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick, uber-moisturizer that can help your skin \\&quot;help</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, you will be very disappointed if you&#x27;ve ever had it prior to the last year.</li>
            <li> did no good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, which is sort of grassy and herbal but does sometimes have that yeasty smell of stale beer.  </li>
            <li> Not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Very subtle earthy smell.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son has horrible psoriasis all over his body.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both agree that it smells like stale beer.</li>
            <li> Helps my psoriasis not to itch as bad.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells a little funky earthy but not a bad smell. Helps my psoriasis not to itch as bad. Feels great!</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot. Like, a lot a lot. When I&#x27;m not washing my hands, I&#x27;m using some sort of anti-bacterial wipe or gel. All that was taking a toll on my hands and I&#x27;d been fighting dry and itchy skin for a while. I&#x27;d tried tons of other products to help my hands but none of them worked. After various Googling adventures, I noticed a lot of people mentioning this particular body butter so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had planned to go to my local Body Shop, but when I checked online they were having a 50% off sale that day and it included this body butter. What luck! With shipping, though, it turned out to be kind of pointless unless I bought lots of containers. I wasn&#x27;t ready to commit to multiple containers so I thought I&#x27;d give Amazon a shot before heading out to the mall. Lo and behold -- Amazon had it via Prime and for $1 more than the super sale price The Body Shop website was selling it. And even cheaper if I signed up for the subscription service! So I ordered it and it arrived the next day. I love you, Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has this drastically improved the issues I was having with my hands, it&#x27;s also worked wonders on my cuticles. I imagine they were dry, too, because of all the hand washing I was doing but now they look great, like I just had a manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only apply this twice a day, though (once in the morning and once before bed), because any more than that and my sensitive skin gets angry. Yeah, sensitive skin + pretty much anything &#x3D; sucks. I&#x27;ve even recommended my husband start using this too because he works with his hands 10 hours a day and they take a beating. I know this will help soften his man-hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and one that I will use for life. Starting now.</li>
            <li> I love the earthy smell from the hand soap so I assumed the body butter would smell the same....it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son has horrible psoriasis all over his body. I had done allot of research on natural remedies after months of dermatology appointments and prescribed creams did no good. I heard of allot of people using hemp creams and oils and decided to give it a try. It has been almost a month and my sons psoriasis looks great. It is not gone, but has lightened and his skin is far less dry and scabby. Granted he is also taking fish oil tablets daily, but I believe this cream has contributed greatly to the healing of his psoriasis. The texture is great..it is very thick and creamy, so a little goes a long way. The only thing I would change is the smell. My husband and I both agree that it smells like stale beer. LOL I can&#x27;t argue with the progress so I will continue to use it even tho my son smells like a brewery! LOL</li>
            <li> This is and amazing product 5 stars  for Hemp Body Butter</li>
            <li> Its all my dad uses..hard working man with rough hands.. he is happy!</li>
            <li> Works great on dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by The Body Shop&#x27;s line of hemp products to help keep his super super super dry skin under control.  This Hemp Body Butter isn&#x27;t always part of his daily routine, but particularly during the winter months it often is.  Like many body butters, this one contains both cocoa and shea butters (which is all Fair Trade).  It also has Babassu oil, which I can&#x27;t claim to know much about, but is supposed to be a good, light, non-pore-clogging moisturizer.  The hemp seed oil in this product is what really sets it apart.  Like another reviewer noted, the hemp seed oil is really good for helping skin repair itself (either for disease-based problems like psoriasis or environmentally caused damage, like from dry air) and absorb moisture more effectively thanks to its incredibly high concentration of fatty acids.    The only drawback about this product is a subjective one: its scent.  Many people don&#x27;t mind the scent of these hemp creams, but some do.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, which is sort of grassy and herbal but does sometimes have that yeasty smell of stale beer.  The good thing is that the strength of the fragrance diminishes rapidly with time.  If you&#x27;re the one using the product, you&#x27;ll still be able to smell it on yourself, but it&#x27;s not overpowering for someone sitting next to you.  It&#x27;s a very unisex fragrance regardless, and if you normally use cologne or perfume it would cover the smell of the Body Butter easily.    Overall, I do recommend this product.  It&#x27;s a thick, uber-moisturizer that can help your skin \\&quot;help itself\\&quot; if you use it regularly.  It would be best for those with dry skin, since oily or normal skin types would probably find it to be too much unless used very infrequently.  It is probably one of the better body butters out there for real skin therapy and improvement, going on creamily and soaking in to leave non-greasy, satisfied skin in its wake.</li>
            <li> This Hemp Body Butter spreads evenly and is therapeutic for dry, chapped elbows and hands. I like its unusual, subtle scent.  Great as an over-all moisturizer, especially useful for applying to just-shaved legs.</li>
            <li> Hydrating and loved the hemp oil content BUT was looking for a light fresh scent and instead my nose caught a scent of old oil not fresh n light. Next time will try using the Body Shop Mango or the Hempz lotion which is available on line or at Wallmart. Maybe Mango would be a better smell but was trying to replace the awesome product which is not longer on the market Hemp Hand Protector by Vitamoist as it had an awesome hydrating, calming effect on irritated skin.

            <li> Love this stuff! Great transaction.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time  , bought it for a friend says it works wonders</li>
            <li> This is a large container for the .  Excellent for dry skin and base for homemade wrinkle cream/moisturizer. Love the smell and this actually soaks into your skin instead of sitting on top.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, not too pricy. I feel good after using it. I don&#x27;t have the desire of buying other brands, The Body Shop, you blow my mind!</li>
            <li> It leaves my wife&#x27;s skin nice and silky lol. She just had an 8 lb baby and it&#x27;s already making a difference in her stretch marks. Also has a really cool scent.</li>
            <li> this was givin as a christmas present to a friend who has never tried it but has braged about it being nice</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. LIGHT FRAGRANCE. GREAT FOR DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> the hemp body butter is no joke. it helps heal burns, itching, scares, stretch marks. i&#x27;m only saying these things because i have witnessed this for myself. it smell good and itnt some cheap watered down lotion. i would recommend this to anyone with skin issues or problems!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try another product for my super dry parched skin now that I live in a desert climate that contained hemp and other nourishing oils and butters. Body Shop Body Butters always deliver with these products.Tthe product itself is as described, but the fragrance is very odd. Not quite earthy or herbal, but more synthetic and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smelling. And it lingers on my skin for a long time. Not pleasant. I&#x27;m going to try mixing in some pleasing essential oil to fix the fragrance, as it&#x27;s not worth the money to just return it.</li>
            <li> I got this last Christmas.  It was a set that came in a tin.  When I started using it, it was as if something had been missing and this cream now provided it.  I love its natural smell.  I love the soothing effect on my skin.  I love the thickness of the hand protector.  I love the light butter and use it everyday for moisturizer on my face.  As soon as I can, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING body lotion.  Absorbs into skin rapidly and&lt;br /&gt;it is soothing if you have itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like the original smell of the product, but cause I&#x27;m a smell&lt;br /&gt;freak, I mix lavender essential oil into it (I use a small whisk&lt;br /&gt;and literally whisk in the lavender oil).  It leaves the body&lt;br /&gt;butter extra soft and great to put all over the body.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I get flare ups from eczema on my arms &amp; this so far is the only good topical treatment,</li>
            <li> Super buttery for the driest of skins. Stores charge $20 for this so I thought this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Loved it! This has been one of my favorite products for a long time and I&#x27;m do happy I could find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Really good for dry skin. My daughter has eczema all over her body, and we have tried many lotions and creams. I use this and straight coconut oil in rotation.</li>
            <li> i am a product junkie always looking for my next fix.  i stopped looking after I found this product.  once you get past the not great scent the bottom line is my skin stays moist and soft all day and some.  side note - i&#x27;m 63 yrs old.</li>
            <li> The best remedy for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Only body butter I&#x27;ve used for the past 4 years. A little goes a long way and does a great job on keeping your skin, face moisturized. Use it after you&#x27;ve toweled dry from a shower and your skin is still slightly damp so it&#x27;ll spread easier. Smells good too. Very subtle earthy smell.</li>
            <li> Have used this for some years now.Great product.</li>
            <li> This product used to be awesome. It was a shea butter product of dark sage color that smelled earthy. I used to use it for shaving. Last Christmas my wife got me a refill, which was absolutely nothing like the original product. The new product is decidedly cheaper, being what appears to be a waxy hydrogenated cream, a light lime color, and the smell was replaced with a migraine-inducing florid fragrance. This is not the same product whatsoever, not even remotely. Don&#x27;t buy this, you will be very disappointed if you&#x27;ve ever had it prior to the last year.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> Hemp lotion I would recommand to anyone. It stays on longer and works when your always washing your hands. It is a bit oily but not overly.</li>
            <li> Interesting scent, strange feel to it. Not their best product.</li>
            <li> This does have a fragrance and I don&#x27;t like any on my body, so I use this on my legs and it has made my legs feel softer</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands.  The Hemp body butter and Hand protector are the only products that helps with the redness, flaking and itching.  It has a slightly medicinal, slightly green or earthy smell.  Some may not like the scent, I don&#x27;t mind it and I love what it does for my hands.</li>
            <li> Rotten/rancid product. Just go straight to the source. I should&#x27;ve known better being a hairdresser. Obviously diverted product. I have the same product in a tube instead of tub that I bought well over a year ago that still smelled fine (just running low.) This \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; product obviously sat on a shelf for quite some time.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best thing for somebody with extremely dry skin. Very reach. Changes texture of yours skin in just one application. Just love it.</li>
