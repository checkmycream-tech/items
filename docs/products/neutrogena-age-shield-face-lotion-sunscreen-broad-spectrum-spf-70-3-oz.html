            <li>awesome product~</li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes an excellent sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just wonderful!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Good buy on a great product!</li>
            <li>My birthday is this weekend &amp;  while treating myself at the cosmetics store, a representative told me how I had great skin &amp; asked what I use.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>is great.</li>
            <li>Even though my foundation has a SPF 15, I was told it was wise to put sunscreen every day under my make-up by my doctor.</li>
            <li>IT HAS TO BE GOOD.</li>
            <li>She really loved it, and I like my wife not looking like Mick Dundee.</li>
            <li>My skin has no flaws and very smooth that I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen feels wonderful and soothing after facial treatments when good protection from the sun is a must.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>do I know that this sunblock could be better?</li>
            <li>I have to spend a lot of time making sure this sunscreen applied evenly.</li>

            <li>It seemed more runny than when I could find it months ago on the store shelf.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this did not happen to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is more economical than the sunscreen here.</li>
            <li>I hope it is really doing the job and will continue to use Neutrogena unless I come across an even better product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really sunburn, even without sunscreen, but I&#x27;m glad it also blocks the more insidious UVA rays that are responsible for skin damage over the years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If applied to neck make sure not to wear anything with collar or high neckline or your clothes will get sunscreen on them instantly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Because Neutrogena has actually made a newer and better version of it!</li>
            <li>it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$, just try to find it on sale.  </li>
            <li>I am so freaked out &amp; in pain right now</li>
            <li>I live in CA that has too strong sunshines.</li>
            <li>In my early 30s , so I figured a good sunblock would&#x27;t hurt &amp; now I totally regret it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It definitely did not encourage me to apply a whole teaspoonful of it -- the recommended effective dose of sunblock by dermatologists -- on my face.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I GET THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON</li>
            <li>The FDA is considering limiting spf&#x27;s higher than 50.</li>
            <li>A good safety for everyday.  </li>
            <li>:) i even spent 5hrs walking in the hot sun in washington d.c.</li>
            <li>It was great to protect sun even though its box was broken.     </li>
            <li>AND SHE REALLY LIKES IT.</li>
            <li>I have very oily and acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>Just to be sure, though, I applied it to my arms first for a few days before I ventured to put it on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of days, but I notice how soft and smooth it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>thanks for shipping early.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used any new product except this one &amp; my normally smooth skin is rough, inflamed, itchy &amp; I look like freddy kruger in the face.</li>
            <li>The new version is SPF 90, and claims to be not sticky, not thick and not oily.</li>
            <li>So my recommendation is: buy the new version.</li>
            <li>I live in sunny Florida and it does what is meant to do, keep the sun off my face.</li>
            <li>i have a VERY sensitive face from acne problems, so i needed to find a sunblock that didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li>Its a little bit greasy feeling, even it being oil free.</li>
            <li>than that no wrinkles so far ...</li>
            <li>It worth every penny, price compared to other sunscreen</li>
            <li>It was the only thing different I had been using and it started the day after I first applied it.</li>
            <li>High SPF is absolutely necessary to protect your skin.</li>
            <li>When I told her dove bar soap &amp; a generic brand moisterizer with spf 15, she pushed new products on me including this one.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, no allergic reaction as I have had to other products.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and I don&#x27;t have to be afraid of all the sun we get here in California.</li>

            <li> I have a very sensitive skin so this did not really work for me.</li>
            <li> Within a day of using this product I noticed some red blotches on my skin and some dry spots on my face.</li>
            <li> and I am still dealing with sever dry skin and blotching, despite using my regular face cream each day and night.</li>
            <li> Within hours of using this product my entire face was covered with a rash tiny little white bumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sunblock is not sticky but it made my face look oily long after the application.</li>
            <li> A source states that unless the cream goes on white, it is not really protecting you.</li>
            <li> Works for me use all year long!</li>
            <li> Maybe if your skin is on the dry side, or if you&#x27;re not going to apply make-up after sunblock, or if you&#x27;re going for a swim, or just staying at home, then this would be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> (Then again, my skin is a bit dry.)  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that terrible grittiness that cheap sunscreens have either, so it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It seems like I need less foundation and have a little soft glow.  </li>
            <li> It really is not greasy and so protects face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too white and makes my already pale skin  look even paler.</li>
            <li> It may seem to take a little extra care to use it properly, but the alternative (not using and getting melanoma) is not appealing.</li>
            <li> add it with a small amount a regular face lotion - problem solved&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pretty if it gets on eyebrows either.</li>
            <li> Reading some of the other reviews, maybe I am having a reaction to the helioplex.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days of using this product to realize it was causing my skin to dry, flake, and break out into splotches.</li>
            <li> down</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t use a moisturizer with this because my skin will feel a little waxy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and noticed it has a slight smell to it, but figured if it did its job</li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit and it spreads well</li>
            <li> Unlike other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one doesn&#x27;t make me break out or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slightly heavy product when applied under makeup, but what sunscreen isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I understand sunblock is to wear it everyday, for a city block protection and sunscreen</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to rub in -</li>
            <li> in the tube, it&#x27;s expensive for daily use, which is what is recommended.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reasons for 4 rather than 5 stars are that it can be a little difficult to rub in all the way.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not wise to use</li>
            <li> It is itchy, dry &amp; terribly painful.</li>
            <li> warning: This crap made my face break out into a rash.  </li>
            <li> I prefer now the BB cream which also works as a make up base.</li>
            <li> sunscreen is one of the worst in Neutrogena line.</li>

            <li> hello. thanks for shipping early. It was great to protect sun even though its box was broken.     I live in CA that has too strong sunshines. so I must use this but I don&#x27;t want my skin to be damaged by sun.     It is essential item for me</li>
            <li> Within hours of using this product my entire face was covered with a rash tiny little white bumps. It is itchy, dry &amp; terribly painful. My birthday is this weekend &amp;  while treating myself at the cosmetics store, a representative told me how I had great skin &amp; asked what I use. When I told her dove bar soap &amp; a generic brand moisterizer with spf 15, she pushed new products on me including this one. In my early 30s , so I figured a good sunblock would&#x27;t hurt &amp; now I totally regret it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used any new product except this one &amp; my normally smooth skin is rough, inflamed, itchy &amp; I look like freddy kruger in the face. I am so freaked out &amp; in pain right now, I think I will be taking all the products back. Too scared to try anything else &amp; there will be no birthday pictures.</li>
            <li> i have a VERY sensitive face from acne problems, so i needed to find a sunblock that didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout. THIS was it! :) i even spent 5hrs walking in the hot sun in washington d.c. one day, and i reapplied this about every 40mins, and by the end of the day, you wouldn&#x27;t know that i had been in the sun :) awesome product~</li>
            <li> This sunblock states on its packaging that it contains helioplex, which can cause allergic reactions in some people. Fortunately, this did not happen to me. Just to be sure, though, I applied it to my arms first for a few days before I ventured to put it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunblock is not sticky but it made my face look oily long after the application. It definitely did not encourage me to apply a whole teaspoonful of it -- the recommended effective dose of sunblock by dermatologists -- on my face. Maybe if your skin is on the dry side, or if you&#x27;re not going to apply make-up after sunblock, or if you&#x27;re going for a swim, or just staying at home, then this would be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I know that this sunblock could be better? Because Neutrogena has actually made a newer and better version of it! The new version is SPF 90, and claims to be not sticky, not thick and not oily. So my recommendation is: buy the new version.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to rub in - in turn you get that pasty look.&lt;br /&gt;I add it with a small amount a regular face lotion - problem solved&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that no wrinkles so far ... lol and i plan to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes an excellent sunscreen.  I stumbled upon this at my dermatologists office.  This sunscreen feels wonderful and soothing after facial treatments when good protection from the sun is a must.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  High SPF is absolutely necessary to protect your skin.</li>
            <li> I have to spend a lot of time making sure this sunscreen applied evenly.It&#x27;s too white and makes my already pale skin  look even paler.I it gets into my hairline and creates appearance of gray roots.It&#x27;s not pretty if it gets on eyebrows either.If applied to neck make sure not to wear anything with collar or high neckline or your clothes will get sunscreen on them instantly.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is one of the worst in Neutrogena line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year. I live in sunny Florida and it does what is meant to do, keep the sun off my face. It is very gentle, no allergic reaction as I have had to other products.</li>
            <li> I decided as I neared 40 to be extra vigilent in taking care of my skin. Even though my foundation has a SPF 15, I was told it was wise to put sunscreen every day under my make-up by my doctor. I bought this product and noticed it has a slight smell to it, but figured if it did its job it was worth it. Within a day of using this product I noticed some red blotches on my skin and some dry spots on my face. It took me a few days of using this product to realize it was causing my skin to dry, flake, and break out into splotches. It was the only thing different I had been using and it started the day after I first applied it. Reading some of the other reviews, maybe I am having a reaction to the helioplex. I haven&#x27;t used it for a couple of days and I am still dealing with sever dry skin and blotching, despite using my regular face cream each day and night. If you use this product I recommend testing a small amount on your arm first to see what your reaction will be.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I GET THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON BUT I ALWAYS BUY IT FOR MY MOM AND SHE REALLY LIKES IT. EVERY TIME IT FINISHES I ALWAYS GET IT FOR HER SO I GUESS IT HAS TO BE GOOD. I HAVE BEEN BUYING IT FOR HER FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW</li>
            <li> A good safety for everyday.  My skin has no flaws and very smooth that I am very satisfied.  I would buy it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It is oily and can make a white residue, but blotting it on rather than smearing it on seems to help with the residue issue. After putting it on, I wait a while and then apply a mineral powder, thus reducing shine. (Then again, my skin is a bit dry.)  It may seem to take a little extra care to use it properly, but the alternative (not using and getting melanoma) is not appealing. A source states that unless the cream goes on white, it is not really protecting you. I hope it is really doing the job and will continue to use Neutrogena unless I come across an even better product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a package of two. It worth every penny, price compared to other sunscreen is great. Size is big enough to use every day for probably a year or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this under my makeup every day for about 2 years. I can&#x27;t live without it! It&#x27;s perfect. All you need is a little bit and it spreads well, it&#x27;s not too thick. I don&#x27;t notice any smell. It&#x27;s just wonderful! I buy it at Woodman&#x27;s for $8.</li>
            <li> It really is not greasy and so protects face.  Worth the $$, just try to find it on sale.  Living in Florida always have to have some level of sunscreen on my face.  This is what we use during summer and go with 30 in winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer no stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, the name Neutorgena stands for a quality product. Not this time. I bought this product before I read EWG&#x27;s Sun Safety information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Age Shield face tion SPF70 has 6% Oxybenzone which is an endocrine disrupting chemical and it&#x27;s not wise to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com has partnered with EWG to help customers pick safe products. Go here before you buy something that may not be sun safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scroll down and you&#x27;ll see Amazon.com..click and it takes you to a page with safe products. The website has a page which gives all the info on the most safe sun products to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The FDA is considering limiting spf&#x27;s higher than 50.</li>
            <li> I have very oily and acne-prone skin so when I started to worry about the sun and premature aging, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. Unlike other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one doesn&#x27;t make me break out or feel greasy. It doesn&#x27;t have that terrible grittiness that cheap sunscreens have either, so it goes on smooth. I wash my face, put it on and apply my makeup over it. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t use a moisturizer with this because my skin will feel a little waxy. It&#x27;s a slightly heavy product when applied under makeup, but what sunscreen isn&#x27;t? Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and I don&#x27;t have to be afraid of all the sun we get here in California. And it doesn&#x27;t have that tell-tale sunscreen odor. Yay!</li>
            <li> It seemed more runny than when I could find it months ago on the store shelf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of days, but I notice how soft and smooth it makes my skin feel.  It seems like I need less foundation and have a little soft glow.  I don&#x27;t really sunburn, even without sunscreen, but I&#x27;m glad it also blocks the more insidious UVA rays that are responsible for skin damage over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons for 4 rather than 5 stars are that it can be a little difficult to rub in all the way.  Also, with only 3 oz. in the tube, it&#x27;s expensive for daily use, which is what is recommended.</li>
            <li> warning: This crap made my face break out into a rash.  110 SPF instead of 70, but same brand.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife for a trip to Arizona in the summer. She did NOT turn into a leather handbag so I&#x27;m guessing that means this worked. She really loved it, and I like my wife not looking like Mick Dundee.</li>
            <li> Its a little bit greasy feeling, even it being oil free. I have a very sensitive skin so this did not really work for me. I am still giving four stars because it does its job, and my mom is using now and she loves it!  I prefer now the BB cream which also works as a make up base.</li>
            <li> I use this sunblock under my face makup and like the smoothness and the protection from the sun.  Even use it in the winter.</li>
            <li> quite oily for a tropical country like the Philippines since it&#x27;s 365 days humid in here, not quite recommended too</li>
            <li> Works for me use all year long!</li>
            <li> I ordered the sunblock cream and I got the Sunscreen one.  I think it should be a different product.  I understand sunblock is to wear it everyday, for a city block protection and sunscreen is to use it to be under the sun, like to be at the beach, pool, playing any outdoor sport, or just walk under the sun.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen, it doesn´t sting my eyes and seems to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;This is more economical than the sunscreen here.</li>
            <li> Good buy on a great product!</li>
