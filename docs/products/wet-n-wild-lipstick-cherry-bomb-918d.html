            <li>, it was pleasant to *not</li>

            <li>But I really love this color!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>This lipstick is absolutely gorgeous, and the it applies very smooth with a matté finish.</li>
            <li>Very nice color, &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I am an olive toned salvadorean and this color looks amazing with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>but it goes on so smoothly and looks great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I own both of these and use them often since my Mac sin ran out.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;d be a nice color for a fancy evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good lipstick it came to me to be more matte, which I think was the purpose.</li>
            <li>it has a nice matted look .</li>
            <li>This probably can look good with most any skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Now I know where to go for trendy lipstick.</li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>Has a nice matte color without drying out my lips.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for people who are darker or have a warm skin tone.</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t suit me as well as I had hoped, but it is gorgeous nonetheless :)</li>
            <li>THE COLOR IS AWESOME, AND FOR A DRUGSTORE LIO BALM IS HIGH QUAlity</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy for the cheap price &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Very sexy, creates a wonderful contrast with my already deep brown skin.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shade for anyone liking rich wine shades.</li>
            <li>great product it has a great color without having to apply multiple times and stains</li>
            <li>Over all pretty happy with this.</li>
            <li>So happy with my purchased.the color is exactly what I was hoping for,similar color to diva from Mac.if</li>
            <li>I love love love the color.</li>
            <li>I like the matted finish, will buy more colors.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick</li>
            <li>i love darker lipsticks</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this color .</li>
            <li>I will be buying more from Chimayo until she runs out .</li>
            <li>My favorite fall lipstick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Mac&#x27;s mattes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more affordable than mac as well.</li>
            <li>but it could have been better</li>
            <li>but this colour is fantastic and I wear it all the time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this color...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>For the most part that doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed wearing this on and off throughout the fall.</li>
            <li>Love this color and how it feels when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute though</li>
            <li>Please make sure you wear a lip balm or dab some argan oil on your lips before applying, if not you will be peeling your lips all day.</li>
            <li>I would surely recommend this for women of all skin tones.</li>
            <li>also you have to use some kind of Chapstick so the lipstick spreads smoothly .</li>
            <li>I love wearing this</li>
            <li>It does look a wee bit better when I blot my lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this color , one of my favs now.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how fabulous it is!</li>
            <li>But I had to fix it because I really love the color &amp;#34;Cherry Bomb&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>the more u apply the darker the colour is.</li>
            <li>I just love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth when I apply it to my lips.</li>
            <li>&amp; I recommend it :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m already searching for more colors from this brand.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and it is very rich</li>
            <li>Loved everything about it, except for the fact that the lipstick broke the first day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and the color is rich and long-lasting!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very true to color.</li>
            <li>Odering more and the Shipping was very fast as well!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m brown skinned and it is perfect for a dark sexy color.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d wear it nearly every day if I didn&#x27;t like kissing my boyfriend so much lol</li>
            <li>The product shipped super fast and came in great condition.</li>
            <li>Oh wow what a magical color!!</li>
            <li>And it wears well, does not come off easily.</li>
            <li>my complexion is medium,some sun damage, foundation is honey beige, skin tans easily.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful color for fall/winter.</li>
            <li>Darkest red beautiful matte.</li>
            <li>Heads down loved it !!!!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Quite happy with it, especially for the $3 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It comes on my lips somewhat light.</li>
            <li>others say they experienced and it still lasted several hours.</li>
            <li>Cheap as hell&lt;</li>
            <li>The color is amazing and it&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I recommend you to get it because it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li>so I went into good old amazon and found it .</li>
            <li>great color to have if you love dark matte lipsticks,</li>
            <li>My new favorite lipstick!</li>
            <li>I love the color very much</li>
            <li>If say this lipstick is more of a lip-stain but still a really pretty color</li>
            <li>First time trying this brand of lipstick, I love the colour.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the exact same color as the burgundy I loved</li>
            <li>it also looks really beautiful on dark skin.</li>
            <li>Love this shade so much</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it so much she just gave it to me.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as dark, but equally beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice for a vampy look, and the formula is amazing, just expect the colour to be very dark.</li>
            <li>I always buy \\&quot; wet n wild matte \\&quot; its the best lipstick i&#x27;ve come</li>
            <li>Smooth, pleasant smell, pretty easy to put on (I need a little help from a lip pencil, but I&#x27;m a chimp when it comes to lipstick).&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probobly my new favorite lip product</li>
            <li>so pretty!</li>
            <li>This is such a cute lipstick!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped for!</li>
            <li>Good color, very dry though.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few online makeup purchases I&#x27;m actually very pleased with!</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick , a little drying but the color is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned; blue eyes, red head, etc.</li>
            <li>Amazing lasting results, and well packaged.</li>
            <li>the color is a nice red with some brown</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for it, wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>Thought is was going to be a nice, deep burgundy based on the pictures.</li>
            <li>This product came fast, the color is beautiful and it feels like velvet against my lips, its pretty dark once applied</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right balance or color and darkness</li>
            <li>Again, lipsticks are not for everyone and you have to find the right shade for your skin tone.</li>
            <li>If you want to make it more red after applying it, apply a bright red lipstick and mix to add a more red tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dark wine red color, which is PERFECT for fall</li>
            <li>I appricated that it came very early and was easy to do.</li>
            <li>Love the color, smooth application, lasts most of the day with only occasional need for touch up.</li>
            <li>My only fear was that it might not be a suitable color anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smooth, beautiful dark red, and works well at &amp;#34;full strength&amp;#34; or as a lipstain.</li>
            <li>If you are fair skinned, it may appear to dark.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a gorgeous, sensual color but not too dark or &#x27;gothic&#x27;, and others seemed to like it on me too.</li>
            <li>Its not as dark as I was hoping for it to be but this color will look good on just about any skin tone.</li>
            <li>Love the color (lighter than expected), love the wear (lasts long!) , love the price.</li>
            <li>I felt that even moisturizing my lips wasn&#x27;t helping and because the formula is so dry it is not an easy or smooth application.</li>
            <li>and it last longer than most lipsticks I&#x27;ve had before don&#x27;t have to worry about re-applying it after drinking something ect.</li>
            <li>Asides from that it is pretty permanent, a make up wipe will remove all of it.</li>
            <li>will need lip balm first</li>
            <li>It was pretty close.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay with this shade of red.</li>
            <li>I just advance it enough to use it each time. :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s exact</li>
            <li>glad I decided to buy this instead of spending $15.00 on basically the same color from Mac.</li>
            <li>It is more of a deep ruby or maroon.</li>
            <li>I looked around online a lot to find a good, affordable color to start out with and based off the swatches I saw on others (though none as pale as me) I decided to give this a go.</li>
            <li>Really good color not that long lasting up to 2 hours but other than that it&#x27;s a really good lipstick</li>
            <li>color is a really pretty black cherry color, kind of plumb-ish.  </li>
            <li>Love the color and it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li>Very sophisticated and sexy but casual, and dressy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love this lipstick when applying it , its very smooth and stays on for a few hours so its pretty swell lipstick overall for the price</li>
            <li>I applied wet n wild on top lip and the Rimmell on bottom and color was identical as well!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but it looked very like it to me.</li>
            <li>VERY.</li>
            <li>but it is also very drying.  </li>
            <li>but once you put it on it stays on so beware of how much you apply.</li>
            <li>It glides on well and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>My absolute fav.....</li>
            <li>Not use to buying lip stick and never really wear it, but i love this color...</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more Wet N Wild lipsticks for sure..</li>
            <li>Looks just like Diva by Mac except much cheaper</li>
            <li>I find that I have to apply a wee bit of gloss to cover my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>Way more purple than expected.</li>
            <li>Stays on very well though.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve worn this nonstop since its (EARLY!!!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of difficult to get a clean mine because it comes flat instead of at a tapered angle like most lipsticks.</li>
            <li>, maybe other colors are, but cherry bomb is a bit creamy (and i love it)</li>
            <li>It glides on very easy and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I would venture to say this color is more black cherry than just cherry bomb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend extra money on a better lipstick of a similar color.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very dark which is OK</li>
            <li>favorite fall time lip color, very dark burgundy color</li>
            <li>The tube is really cheap plastic so be careful not to crack/break it.</li>
            <li>Really nice lipstick, sort of a dark red if you layer it on.</li>
            <li>so you only need to dab it on not smear it on like you may usually put on lipstick, but because it is rich and also long lasting, it is great, if you like a darker lipstick.</li>
            <li>This lipstick lasts super long too.</li>
            <li>Brand new and no problems at all.</li>
            <li>The color is much more red than I expected.</li>
            <li>Those with extremely fair skin may look a little goth and/or dead with this intense color.</li>
            <li>I recommend putting a clear chapstick on over this lipstick to moisten your lips!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- Opaque and vivid color</li>
            <li>SO SMOOTH AND LONG LASTING COLOR!</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was that the lipstick was packaged better and had the classic pointy shape instead of round.</li>
            <li>certainly can last up to 4 hour with food and drinks!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this product and yes it is a little trying, definitely on the darker side but works well with a gloss applied on top.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be a nice deep red, which it is if you apply it sparingly, but if you apply too much it becomes a very dark almost blackened red.</li>
            <li>The only non-norm is that I already have very pigmented lips</li>
            <li>I never was one to wear lip liner, but I feel like this could be an exception because the feathering bugged me so much that I&#x27;ve actually held out on wearing this.</li>
            <li>needs lip liner and it comes off if you eat something, but its so cheap, i dont mind reapplying it every few hours</li>
            <li>Its a darker red but very matte.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;ll last 4 hours after I apply it, it still works very well.</li>
            <li>Especially since it has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Deep, dry, dark rose color.</li>
            <li>A little dry, but bold color that stays pretty well.</li>
            <li>so i usually highlight it with a light coat of lip gloss.</li>
            <li>but it is not dark as diva</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very dry which makes it hard to apply, however the pigment is amazing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, but if you aren&#x27;t looking for something dark than this is not right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Wet n wild is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>but I could not live without it really .</li>
            <li>a little creamier Rimmell has a lipstick in color &amp;#34;Bordeaux&amp;#34; that is the exact same color as well but much creamier and has a shine to it.</li>
            <li>With a little balm on my lips first, this lipstick stays on!</li>
            <li>A dark, bold red.</li>
            <li>It tends to dry the lips a little bit, but that is an easy fix if you have any lip moisturiser around.</li>
            <li>(the only clue that this could be my old fave).</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t gunky or slippery at all, and it has no bitter taste.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lipstick line though, so if this shade is too dark for you, you should definitely check out some other colours in the line!</li>
            <li>Those who claim it&#x27;s too chalky or dry obviously don&#x27;t have much experience with the matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li>But I had been in the mood for a long time to try something new</li>
            <li>I bought this as a dupe for M.A.C.&#x27;s Dive Lipstick and it is pretty close if not exactly the same!</li>
            <li>Wet N Wild really surprised me!</li>
            <li>Love this color, it is a little red but is dark.  </li>
            <li>but unfortunately I find that this smudges very easily and by the end of the day</li>
            <li>I plan on buying from Wet N Wild again!!</li>
            <li>Not vampy dark but a deep and pretty red.</li>
            <li>The colour is very pigmented and definitely stays on for a long while, I only had to apply it once during a really long event I recently had.</li>
            <li>Favourite color from Wet n wild megalast!</li>
            <li>If you dab just a little on and spread it thin you can get a nice shade of red</li>

            <li> but anyway I like it very beautiful and sexy color</li>
            <li> Perfect! :-)</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise it still complements my skin.</li>
            <li> , it was pleasant to *not</li>
            <li> but it was a pleasant color, lighter than when fully applied and would be gone by the time I woke up.</li>
            <li> this color looks gorgeous on me.</li>
            <li> Really good color,</li>
            <li> The color is perfect with my light brown complexion.  </li>
            <li> i would have like this if was alittle longer wear.. but its good</li>
            <li> If you want a vampy color, this would be a good choice.</li>

            <li> Love the color!</li>
            <li> I love the color payout of this lipstick!</li>
            <li> But I really love this color!</li>
            <li> Love this color!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is absolutely gorgeous, and the it applies very smooth with a matté finish.</li>
            <li> Very nice color, &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I am an olive toned salvadorean and this color looks amazing with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> but it goes on so smoothly and looks great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I own both of these and use them often since my Mac sin ran out.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;d be a nice color for a fancy evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good lipstick it came to me to be more matte, which I think was the purpose.</li>
            <li> it has a nice matted look .</li>
            <li> This probably can look good with most any skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Now I know where to go for trendy lipstick.</li>
            <li> Nice color</li>
            <li> Has a nice matte color without drying out my lips.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for people who are darker or have a warm skin tone.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t suit me as well as I had hoped, but it is gorgeous nonetheless :)</li>
            <li> THE COLOR IS AWESOME, AND FOR A DRUGSTORE LIO BALM IS HIGH QUAlity</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy for the cheap price &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Very sexy, creates a wonderful contrast with my already deep brown skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shade for anyone liking rich wine shades.</li>
            <li> great product it has a great color without having to apply multiple times and stains</li>
            <li> Over all pretty happy with this.</li>
            <li> So happy with my purchased.the color is exactly what I was hoping for,similar color to diva from Mac.if</li>
            <li> I love love love the color.</li>
            <li> I like the matted finish, will buy more colors.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick</li>
            <li> i love darker lipsticks</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this color .</li>
            <li> I will be buying more from Chimayo until she runs out .</li>
            <li> My favorite fall lipstick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Mac&#x27;s mattes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more affordable than mac as well.</li>
            <li> but it could have been better</li>
            <li> but this colour is fantastic and I wear it all the time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this color...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> For the most part that doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed wearing this on and off throughout the fall.</li>
            <li> Love this color and how it feels when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute though</li>
            <li> Please make sure you wear a lip balm or dab some argan oil on your lips before applying, if not you will be peeling your lips all day.</li>
            <li> I would surely recommend this for women of all skin tones.</li>
            <li> also you have to use some kind of Chapstick so the lipstick spreads smoothly .</li>
            <li> I love wearing this</li>
            <li> It does look a wee bit better when I blot my lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this color , one of my favs now.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how fabulous it is!</li>
            <li> But I had to fix it because I really love the color &amp;#34;Cherry Bomb&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> the more u apply the darker the colour is.</li>
            <li> I just love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth when I apply it to my lips.</li>
            <li> &amp; I recommend it :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m already searching for more colors from this brand.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and it is very rich</li>
            <li> Loved everything about it, except for the fact that the lipstick broke the first day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and the color is rich and long-lasting!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very true to color.</li>
            <li> Odering more and the Shipping was very fast as well!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brown skinned and it is perfect for a dark sexy color.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d wear it nearly every day if I didn&#x27;t like kissing my boyfriend so much lol</li>
            <li> The product shipped super fast and came in great condition.</li>
            <li> Oh wow what a magical color!!</li>
            <li> And it wears well, does not come off easily.</li>
            <li> my complexion is medium,some sun damage, foundation is honey beige, skin tans easily.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful color for fall/winter.</li>
            <li> Darkest red beautiful matte.</li>
            <li> Heads down loved it !!!!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Quite happy with it, especially for the $3 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It comes on my lips somewhat light.</li>
            <li> others say they experienced and it still lasted several hours.</li>
            <li> Cheap as hell&lt;</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and it&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I recommend you to get it because it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li> so I went into good old amazon and found it .</li>
            <li> great color to have if you love dark matte lipsticks,</li>
            <li> My new favorite lipstick!</li>
            <li> I love the color very much</li>
            <li> If say this lipstick is more of a lip-stain but still a really pretty color</li>
            <li> First time trying this brand of lipstick, I love the colour.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the exact same color as the burgundy I loved</li>
            <li> it also looks really beautiful on dark skin.</li>
            <li> Love this shade so much</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it so much she just gave it to me.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as dark, but equally beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice for a vampy look, and the formula is amazing, just expect the colour to be very dark.</li>
            <li> I always buy \\&quot; wet n wild matte \\&quot; its the best lipstick i&#x27;ve come</li>
            <li> Smooth, pleasant smell, pretty easy to put on (I need a little help from a lip pencil, but I&#x27;m a chimp when it comes to lipstick).&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probobly my new favorite lip product</li>
            <li> so pretty!</li>
            <li> This is such a cute lipstick!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for!</li>
            <li> Good color, very dry though.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few online makeup purchases I&#x27;m actually very pleased with!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick , a little drying but the color is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned; blue eyes, red head, etc.</li>
            <li> Amazing lasting results, and well packaged.</li>
            <li> the color is a nice red with some brown</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it, wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> Thought is was going to be a nice, deep burgundy based on the pictures.</li>
            <li> This product came fast, the color is beautiful and it feels like velvet against my lips, its pretty dark once applied</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right balance or color and darkness</li>
            <li> Again, lipsticks are not for everyone and you have to find the right shade for your skin tone.</li>
            <li> If you want to make it more red after applying it, apply a bright red lipstick and mix to add a more red tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark wine red color, which is PERFECT for fall</li>
            <li> I appricated that it came very early and was easy to do.</li>
            <li> Love the color, smooth application, lasts most of the day with only occasional need for touch up.</li>
            <li> My only fear was that it might not be a suitable color anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth, beautiful dark red, and works well at &amp;#34;full strength&amp;#34; or as a lipstain.</li>
            <li> If you are fair skinned, it may appear to dark.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a gorgeous, sensual color but not too dark or &#x27;gothic&#x27;, and others seemed to like it on me too.</li>
            <li> Its not as dark as I was hoping for it to be but this color will look good on just about any skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love the color (lighter than expected), love the wear (lasts long!) , love the price.</li>
            <li> I felt that even moisturizing my lips wasn&#x27;t helping and because the formula is so dry it is not an easy or smooth application.</li>
            <li> and it last longer than most lipsticks I&#x27;ve had before don&#x27;t have to worry about re-applying it after drinking something ect.</li>
            <li> Asides from that it is pretty permanent, a make up wipe will remove all of it.</li>
            <li> will need lip balm first</li>
            <li> It was pretty close.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay with this shade of red.</li>
            <li> I just advance it enough to use it each time. :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s exact</li>
            <li> glad I decided to buy this instead of spending $15.00 on basically the same color from Mac.</li>
            <li> It is more of a deep ruby or maroon.</li>
            <li> I looked around online a lot to find a good, affordable color to start out with and based off the swatches I saw on others (though none as pale as me) I decided to give this a go.</li>
            <li> Really good color not that long lasting up to 2 hours but other than that it&#x27;s a really good lipstick</li>
            <li> color is a really pretty black cherry color, kind of plumb-ish.  </li>
            <li> Love the color and it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> Very sophisticated and sexy but casual, and dressy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love this lipstick when applying it , its very smooth and stays on for a few hours so its pretty swell lipstick overall for the price</li>
            <li> I applied wet n wild on top lip and the Rimmell on bottom and color was identical as well!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but it looked very like it to me.</li>
            <li> VERY.</li>
            <li> but it is also very drying.  </li>
            <li> but once you put it on it stays on so beware of how much you apply.</li>
            <li> It glides on well and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> My absolute fav.....</li>
            <li> Not use to buying lip stick and never really wear it, but i love this color...</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more Wet N Wild lipsticks for sure..</li>
            <li> Looks just like Diva by Mac except much cheaper</li>
            <li> I find that I have to apply a wee bit of gloss to cover my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Way more purple than expected.</li>
            <li> Stays on very well though.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve worn this nonstop since its (EARLY!!!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of difficult to get a clean mine because it comes flat instead of at a tapered angle like most lipsticks.</li>
            <li> , maybe other colors are, but cherry bomb is a bit creamy (and i love it)</li>
            <li> It glides on very easy and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I would venture to say this color is more black cherry than just cherry bomb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend extra money on a better lipstick of a similar color.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very dark which is OK</li>
            <li> favorite fall time lip color, very dark burgundy color</li>
            <li> The tube is really cheap plastic so be careful not to crack/break it.</li>
            <li> Really nice lipstick, sort of a dark red if you layer it on.</li>
            <li> so you only need to dab it on not smear it on like you may usually put on lipstick, but because it is rich and also long lasting, it is great, if you like a darker lipstick.</li>
            <li> This lipstick lasts super long too.</li>
            <li> Brand new and no problems at all.</li>
            <li> The color is much more red than I expected.</li>
            <li> Those with extremely fair skin may look a little goth and/or dead with this intense color.</li>
            <li> I recommend putting a clear chapstick on over this lipstick to moisten your lips!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- Opaque and vivid color</li>
            <li> SO SMOOTH AND LONG LASTING COLOR!</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was that the lipstick was packaged better and had the classic pointy shape instead of round.</li>
            <li> certainly can last up to 4 hour with food and drinks!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and yes it is a little trying, definitely on the darker side but works well with a gloss applied on top.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be a nice deep red, which it is if you apply it sparingly, but if you apply too much it becomes a very dark almost blackened red.</li>
            <li> The only non-norm is that I already have very pigmented lips</li>
            <li> I never was one to wear lip liner, but I feel like this could be an exception because the feathering bugged me so much that I&#x27;ve actually held out on wearing this.</li>
            <li> needs lip liner and it comes off if you eat something, but its so cheap, i dont mind reapplying it every few hours</li>
            <li> Its a darker red but very matte.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;ll last 4 hours after I apply it, it still works very well.</li>
            <li> Especially since it has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Deep, dry, dark rose color.</li>
            <li> A little dry, but bold color that stays pretty well.</li>
            <li> so i usually highlight it with a light coat of lip gloss.</li>
            <li> but it is not dark as diva</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very dry which makes it hard to apply, however the pigment is amazing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, but if you aren&#x27;t looking for something dark than this is not right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Wet n wild is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> but I could not live without it really .</li>
            <li> a little creamier Rimmell has a lipstick in color &amp;#34;Bordeaux&amp;#34; that is the exact same color as well but much creamier and has a shine to it.</li>
            <li> With a little balm on my lips first, this lipstick stays on!</li>
            <li> A dark, bold red.</li>
            <li> It tends to dry the lips a little bit, but that is an easy fix if you have any lip moisturiser around.</li>
            <li> (the only clue that this could be my old fave).</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t gunky or slippery at all, and it has no bitter taste.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick line though, so if this shade is too dark for you, you should definitely check out some other colours in the line!</li>
            <li> Those who claim it&#x27;s too chalky or dry obviously don&#x27;t have much experience with the matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li> But I had been in the mood for a long time to try something new</li>
            <li> I bought this as a dupe for M.A.C.&#x27;s Dive Lipstick and it is pretty close if not exactly the same!</li>
            <li> Wet N Wild really surprised me!</li>
            <li> Love this color, it is a little red but is dark.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I find that this smudges very easily and by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I plan on buying from Wet N Wild again!!</li>
            <li> Not vampy dark but a deep and pretty red.</li>
            <li> The colour is very pigmented and definitely stays on for a long while, I only had to apply it once during a really long event I recently had.</li>
            <li> Favourite color from Wet n wild megalast!</li>
            <li> If you dab just a little on and spread it thin you can get a nice shade of red</li>
            <li> Lasts pretty long and yes, put a little chap-stick on underneath!</li>
            <li> It is a magenta pink that is dark dark purple-like when it goes on full strength.</li>
            <li> It was very very sticky and hard to rub on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was scared because of the reviews saying that wet n wild lipsticks extremely dry your lips:</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Expensive on Amazon -- I bought this for under $3 at my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;- Drying, but easily fixable with some lip balm underneath or after application.</li>
            <li> It was as expected, the only problem is that the lipstick cover is too big for the lipstick...</li>
            <li> It stays on long</li>
            <li> have white skin with pink cheeks, dark blue eyes and pinky lips.</li>
            <li> Way too dry.</li>
            <li> Matte lipstick can run dry</li>
            <li> dry, does not glide on</li>
            <li> This color was lighter than it appeared and was really dry on your lips.</li>
            <li> It appears to be a dark red color.</li>
            <li> If applied multy times its a dark red sort of .</li>
            <li> dark and mysterious!</li>
            <li> the color I wanted a dark red matte lipstick!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a dark cool(blueish) red.</li>
            <li> The lipstick came loose from the bottom of the tube...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m disappointed and will not purchase this brand in the future plus it not long lasting as the ad claims the only positive thing I can say is it goes on matte somewhat.</li>
            <li> that to me is sort of like apple or maybe brick red and the black tone in it</li>
            <li> lipstick!this is my third lipstick of wet n wild!it&#x27;s like dark wine</li>
            <li> The color is stunning--it&#x27;s definitely a dupe for Black Cherry.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful though because anything in the wrong shade will completely wash me out, or look much too dark.</li>
            <li> It can be mixed with other lipsticks to tone it down</li>
            <li> Especially for dark skin tones !</li>
            <li> Very dark cherry red color.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a very dark red matte lipstick this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be very dark red as Mac dive dupe</li>
            <li> the color was not what i expected.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing purple or pink or orange about this lipstick.</li>
            <li> You will get lipstick on the sides of the cap no matter how carefully you remove it&lt;</li>
            <li> Now she has to carefully use it.</li>
            <li> It holds the same quality as a MAC&#x27; lipstick product with a much less- inexpensive price!</li>
            <li> It looks almost black when you put it on but with slight red tint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap brand that works just like the expensive ones!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to discern the exact shade when buying online.  </li>
            <li> usually have problems with make-up or other similar types of items giving me rashes, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this.</li>
            <li> this is for you.can&#x27;t wait for my other colors to arrive</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of them and have other colors</li>
            <li> I have to reapply it like every hour and too dark</li>
            <li> DARK.</li>
            <li> It is not as dark as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be soo dark</li>
            <li> you luv dark reds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really dark</li>
            <li> I love this as a base color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Extremely flattering on my dark skin!</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying a lip liner the same shade as this lipstick because lining my lips with just the lipstick can be a little hard.</li>
            <li> so typically I don&#x27;t even wear lipsticks, glosses, tints, etc.</li>
            <li> A lot like Mac  but for half the cost.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I mix it with a black color to get a camped out look.</li>
            <li> I seriously think this color changes on different people when I wear it</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed!</li>
            <li> but I found that I had a bit of a hard time keeping this off my teeth, something that I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with before, than any other I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with a little brown and closer to burgundy or wine.</li>
            <li> It is a matte lipstick and can be a little drying</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t come off with every little bump or nudge and when my hair would get whipped around by the wind</li>
            <li> * see little pink/red stripes all over my face.</li>
            <li> It did stain my lips a little bit even after take off</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a little darker</li>
            <li> But I will say to others that it is probably a little darker on the lips than it looks in the tube.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying, but a little bit of balm applied under it</li>
            <li> Use a lip balm under the lip stick because it is a little drym</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Can be dabbed for a less dramatic dark red effect</li>
            <li> but goes on a little blotchy.</li>
            <li> Very dark Burgundy reddish color.</li>
            <li> can be warn everyday, anywhere.</li>
            <li> After a few hours of wear, it settles into my lip lines and has a tendency to wear off in uneven patches.</li>
            <li> I wear this like everyday now</li>
            <li> After a half hour I needed to reapply!</li>
            <li> A little hard to apply.</li>
            <li> thick .. not comfortable .. very dark and matte in not a good way</li>
            <li> I thinks it is a little dramatic</li>
            <li> A bit on the dark side, nothing wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it looks black!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very common color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s game over.</li>
            <li> It was broken.</li>
            <li> Package is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Weird...</li>
            <li> so ill stick with it.. &amp;</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to remove, I have to use a scrublet and cleanser to remove it</li>
            <li> But nothing wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
            <li> so I would suggest putting a base underneath like chap stick, Carmex, or Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Then I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for years and never found another color that matched but boring</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Heads down loved it !!!!</li>
            <li> I love love love the color. Very sophisticated and sexy but casual, and dressy.&lt;br /&gt;This can be warn everyday, anywhere.</li>
            <li> thick .. not comfortable .. very dark and matte in not a good way</li>
            <li> Love the color, smooth application, lasts most of the day with only occasional need for touch up.</li>
            <li> It clumped a bit on application. The color is much more red than I expected. I was looking for something with a little brown and closer to burgundy or wine.</li>
            <li> Way too dry. I felt that even moisturizing my lips wasn&#x27;t helping and because the formula is so dry it is not an easy or smooth application.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is awesome. It&#x27;s a great dupe for Mac Rebel.</li>
            <li> Really good color not that long lasting up to 2 hours but other than that it&#x27;s a really good lipstick</li>
            <li> THe color is soo deep, glamorous! best color for winter!&lt;br /&gt;i was scared because of the reviews saying that wet n wild lipsticks extremely dry your lips: well, i wouldnt say so, maybe other colors are, but cherry bomb is a bit creamy (and i love it) that doesnt make your lips feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;my friends have remarked that the color stays perfectly even after drinking or eating.</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time. This is such a beautiful color for fall/winter. I&#x27;m African-American and this color looks gorgeous on me. It&#x27;s moisturizing and the color is rich and long-lasting!</li>
            <li> Love this color, it is a little red but is dark.  I am tan so I can wear it. And it wears well, does not come off easily. I like the matted finish, will buy more colors.</li>
            <li> It was as expected, the only problem is that the lipstick cover is too big for the lipstick... Weird... So I can&#x27;t travel with it or it&#x27;s game over. It&#x27;s a beautiful color though, I&#x27;d buy it again bc of the price.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick i love darker lipsticks so it was perfect it also looks really beautiful on dark skin.</li>
            <li> If say this lipstick is more of a lip-stain but still a really pretty color and it last longer than most lipsticks I&#x27;ve had before don&#x27;t have to worry about re-applying it after drinking something ect. So that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> Love it. I always buy \\&quot; wet n wild matte \\&quot; its the best lipstick i&#x27;ve come acrosse so ill stick with it.. &amp; ladiesssss amazon is way cheaper</li>
            <li> Really nice lipstick, sort of a dark red if you layer it on. Compliments my skin well.</li>
            <li> Really good color, but it&#x27;s not moisturizing at all. I recommend putting a clear chapstick on over this lipstick to moisten your lips!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color for fall and winter. I am an olive toned salvadorean and this color looks amazing with my skin tone. Great dupe for MAC &amp;#34;sin&amp;#34; don&#x27;t spend your money on a brand name this color is identical! It is a matte lipstick and can be a little drying just put some Chapstick on before or after and you&#x27;ll be fine. If you want something a little creamier Rimmell has a lipstick in color &amp;#34;Bordeaux&amp;#34; that is the exact same color as well but much creamier and has a shine to it. I applied wet n wild on top lip and the Rimmell on bottom and color was identical as well! I own both of these and use them often since my Mac sin ran out. So glad I don&#x27;t have to keep wasting $20 on my fav lip color!</li>
            <li> This lipstick discontinued in the stores so I went into good old amazon and found it . I love this color . I took a chance to find it here but I could not live without it really . I read the reviews . These girls don&#x27;t know how to use this lipstick . I  wear it like Jean Harlow I do the 1920&#x27;s lip with this . It&#x27;s the best ! I will be buying more from Chimayo until she runs out . With my next check as a matter of fact ! I&#x27;m so glad I found it ! Love this shade so much</li>
            <li> After a half hour I needed to reapply! The color is spot on but the quality equals the price.</li>
            <li> Smooth, pleasant smell, pretty easy to put on (I need a little help from a lip pencil, but I&#x27;m a chimp when it comes to lipstick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a really pretty black cherry color, kind of plumb-ish.  I thinks it is a little dramatic but that&#x27;s what I go for.  I think it&#x27;d be a nice color for a fancy evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent matte color!</li>
            <li> My favorite fall lipstick</li>
            <li> I love this as a base color.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d use it alone but it&#x27;s very dark which is OK, it&#x27;s supposed to be. But I&#x27;m not daring enough to use it that dark.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I love it. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LIPSTICK! It&#x27;s beautiful. It&#x27;s matte but it goes on so smoothly and looks great. I definitely recommend purchasing this product. I like it better than Mac&#x27;s mattes. and it&#x27;s more affordable than mac as well. I attached a photo to this review. It&#x27;s very true to color. Matte lipstick can run dry so I would suggest putting a base underneath like chap stick, Carmex, or Vaseline.</li>
            <li> This is a good lipstick it came to me to be more matte, which I think was the purpose. I appricated that it came very early and was easy to do. The color was great for a darker toned woman</li>
            <li> It is a very nice brand I liked it but it could have been better the color was not what i expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color!!!</li>
            <li> SO SMOOTH AND LONG LASTING COLOR! I use this along with NYX transylvania. It&#x27;s a must have for $5</li>
            <li> I expected it to be very dark red as Mac dive dupe but it is not dark as diva but anyway I like it very beautiful and sexy color</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick! Bought it for a show I was performing in because I didn&#x27;t want to drop big bucks on a lipstick if I would never wear it again... but this colour is fantastic and I wear it all the time! I plan on buying from Wet N Wild again!!</li>
            <li> I love the color very much but unfortunately I find that this smudges very easily and by the end of the day it&#x27;s all over my lips. It is also difficult to remove, I have to use a scrublet and cleanser to remove it</li>
            <li> Great condition. Love the color! Thanks</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and yes it is a little trying, definitely on the darker side but works well with a gloss applied on top.</li>
            <li> Cherry Bomb is the bomb!!!! I&#x27;m in love with this color... Its rich pigment is so sexy!!!! If you are fair skinned, it may appear to dark. I&#x27;m brown skinned and it is perfect for a dark sexy color. I line my lips with the Vamp color and put Cherry Bomb in the middle and blend for an Ombre&#x27; effect!!!!! Wonderful!! Odering more and the Shipping was very fast as well!!</li>
            <li> It was very very sticky and hard to rub on. I have to reapply it like every hour and too dark it looks black!!! It doesn&#x27;t come off very good either</li>
            <li> I love it. The color is perfect with my light brown complexion.  It appears to be a dark red color.It glides on very easy and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap brand that works just like the expensive ones! its GREAT! it has a nice matted look .</li>
            <li> This lipstick is great for any occasion ! It holds the same quality as a MAC&#x27; lipstick product with a much less- inexpensive price!</li>
            <li> You only need to reapply if you drink through a straw or wipe your mouth with a table cloth. Asides from that it is pretty permanent, a make up wipe will remove all of it.</li>
            <li> This product came fast, the color is beautiful and it feels like velvet against my lips, its pretty dark once applied so i usually highlight it with a light coat of lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I wore this very same lipstick in this color when I was 19 but back then it was called &amp;#34;burgundy wine&amp;#34; or something like that. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for years and never found another color that matched but boring mauve.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the exact same color as the burgundy I loved but it looked very like it to me. My only fear was that it might not be a suitable color anymore. I was hoping someone would mention their skin tone and age in the reviews. I took a chance buying based on someone said it is blood red (the only clue that this could be my old fave). my complexion is medium,some sun damage, foundation is honey beige, skin tans easily. To my pleasant surprise it still complements my skin. This probably can look good with most any skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;You will need lip balm first so it glides on otherwise it&#x27;s a pain to put on. It will be a blackish red if you swipe it across your entire lip but there&#x27;s a way it&#x27;s adjustable. If you dab just a little on and spread it thin you can get a nice shade of red that to me is sort of like apple or maybe brick red and the black tone in it seems to vanish. There&#x27;s nothing purple or pink or orange about this lipstick.</li>
            <li> A bit on the dark side, nothing wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda on the Chola brown side. But nothing wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful color online but the color I received today was a totally different color; it&#x27;s not red on my lips at all so I&#x27;m disappointed and will not purchase this brand in the future plus it not long lasting as the ad claims the only positive thing I can say is it goes on matte somewhat.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to discern the exact shade when buying online.  It was pretty close.</li>
            <li> i would have like this if was alittle longer wear.. but its good</li>
            <li> Love the color (lighter than expected), love the wear (lasts long!) , love the price. Now I know where to go for trendy lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few online makeup purchases I&#x27;m actually very pleased with! Very nice color, &amp; easy to apply. Those who claim it&#x27;s too chalky or dry obviously don&#x27;t have much experience with the matte lipsticks. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> A little dry, but bold color that stays pretty well.</li>
            <li> the color is a nice red with some brown undertones.&lt;br /&gt;pretty dry, does not glide on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;i put on a deep plum lip liner before, a coat of chapstick and then&lt;br /&gt;this, makes it easier and it looks way deeper</li>
            <li> I was torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars.. in the end I chose 4 because I am REALLY really happy with this color, it did not disappoint. I&#x27;m very fair skinned; blue eyes, red head, etc. The only non-norm is that I already have very pigmented lips so typically I don&#x27;t even wear lipsticks, glosses, tints, etc. But I had been in the mood for a long time to try something new and I decided something plum, or wine-y was what I wanted. I have to be careful though because anything in the wrong shade will completely wash me out, or look much too dark. I looked around online a lot to find a good, affordable color to start out with and based off the swatches I saw on others (though none as pale as me) I decided to give this a go. The texture of the lipstick is.. not waxy perse, but it did stick a bit to my lips with every application. For the most part that doesn&#x27;t bother me but I found that I had a bit of a hard time keeping this off my teeth, something that I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with before, than any other I&#x27;ve tried before. This also feathered quite a bit at the edge of my lips. I never was one to wear lip liner, but I feel like this could be an exception because the feathering bugged me so much that I&#x27;ve actually held out on wearing this. But the color I&#x27;m extremely happy with. It&#x27;s just the right balance or color and darkness and I enjoyed wearing this on and off throughout the fall. I found it to be a gorgeous, sensual color but not too dark or &#x27;gothic&#x27;, and others seemed to like it on me too. It also didn&#x27;t come off with every little bump or nudge and when my hair would get whipped around by the wind, it was pleasant to *not* see little pink/red stripes all over my face. It did stain my lips a little bit even after take off but it was a pleasant color, lighter than when fully applied and would be gone by the time I woke up. I had no problems with it staining the skin around my lips, because it didn&#x27;t. Over all pretty happy with this. But I definitely thinkI&#x27;ll be getting a liner for it in the future.</li>
            <li> Nice color but I wish it was a little darker</li>
            <li> Love this color and how it feels when I wear it.</li>
            <li> so pretty! Everyone is complimenting me on the color. needs lip liner and it comes off if you eat something, but its so cheap, i dont mind reapplying it every few hours</li>
            <li> favorite fall time lip color, very dark burgundy color</li>
            <li> A dark, bold red. Very sexy, creates a wonderful contrast with my already deep brown skin. Kinda vampy, but wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as creamy as I was expecting. It&#x27;s kind of difficult to get a clean mine because it comes flat instead of at a tapered angle like most lipsticks.</li>
            <li> A little hard to apply. If you want a vampy color, this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a dupe for M.A.C.&#x27;s Dive Lipstick and it is pretty close if not exactly the same! Very dark cherry red color. VERY. DARK. I absolutely love it, but if you aren&#x27;t looking for something dark than this is not right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only had to apply this once before going to a club and it lasted all night. Quite happy with it, especially for the $3 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have problems with make-up or other similar types of items giving me rashes, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick!this is my third lipstick of wet n wild!it&#x27;s like dark wine tone!just what i&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Very dark Burgundy reddish color. Just YouTube how it looks before purchase. It&#x27;s cute though</li>
            <li> Im AA and this color turn heads.  Its a darker red but very matte. It stays on long but it is also very drying.  Please make sure you wear a lip balm or dab some argan oil on your lips before applying, if not you will be peeling your lips all day. You have been warned.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a very dark red matte lipstick this is the one to get. I would venture to say this color is more black cherry than just cherry bomb. It can be mixed with other lipsticks to tone it down but once you put it on it stays on so beware of how much you apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark wine red color, which is PERFECT for fall it goes on matte like all lipsticks in this collection. I would surely recommend this for women of all skin tones.</li>
            <li> THE COLOR IS AWESOME, AND FOR A DRUGSTORE LIO BALM IS HIGH QUAlity</li>
            <li> This color was lighter than it appeared and was really dry on your lips. Didn&#x27;t care for it, wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> Hello daddy hello mom chchcherry bomb i love this lipstick when applying it , its very smooth and stays on for a few hours so its pretty swell lipstick overall for the price</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve worn this nonstop since its (EARLY!!!) arrival</li>
            <li> the texture of it isn&#x27;t so great. it&#x27;s very dry which makes it hard to apply, however the pigment is amazing.</li>
            <li> If applied multy times its a dark red sort of . It&#x27;s very beautiful ! also you have to use some kind of Chapstick so the lipstick spreads smoothly .</li>
            <li> I love wearing this it&#x27;s probobly my new favorite lip product</li>
            <li> With a little balm on my lips first, this lipstick stays on! The staying power is just awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;I have white skin with pink cheeks, dark blue eyes and pinky lips. That being said this lipstick makes me look like a goth-wanna-be! It is a magenta pink that is dark dark purple-like when it goes on full strength. It does look a wee bit better when I blot my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for a red-brown. My search continues...</li>
            <li> It looks almost black when you put it on but with slight red tint. It glides on well and is very pigmented. If you want to make it more red after applying it, apply a bright red lipstick and mix to add a more red tone.</li>
            <li> This lipstick can defiantly compete with mac. Love this lipstick!!</li>
            <li> My absolute fav..... when I opened and tried this on I  immediately bought another. Darkest red beautiful matte. But it!</li>
            <li> Not use to buying lip stick and never really wear it, but i love this color...</li>
            <li> My friend wore this lipstick and I compliment her on it, she let me put some on and I fell in love with it so much she just gave it to me.  So I knew what to expect.  But I will say to others that it is probably a little darker on the lips than it looks in the tube. and it is very rich so you only need to dab it on not smear it on like you may usually put on lipstick, but because it is rich and also long lasting, it is great, if you like a darker lipstick.</li>
            <li> First time trying this brand of lipstick, I love the colour. And I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this color , one of my favs now. I just add a brown lip stain or lip liner underneath to get it to go perfect with my complexion. I am a caramel colored African American woman. Got a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, this was bought for someone else, not myself. It&#x27;s a good shade for anyone liking rich wine shades.Wet n wild is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Wet N Wild really surprised me! This lipstick is absolutely gorgeous, and the it applies very smooth with a matté finish. A lot like Mac  but for half the cost. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is excellent. Although I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;ll last 4 hours after I apply it, it still works very well. It isn&#x27;t gunky or slippery at all, and it has no bitter taste. The color is great as well. I will definitely be buying more Wet N Wild lipsticks for sure..Especially since it has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love the color and it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> This color is my all time fave. I was expecting it to be darker but I&#x27;m okay with this shade of red. Sometimes I mix it with a black color to get a camped out look. This lipstick lasts super long too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the color; It was exactly what I wanted and it added the perfect touch to my makeup. I would recommend buying a lip liner the same shade as this lipstick because lining my lips with just the lipstick can be a little hard. If you&#x27;re looking for a darker shade of red and a lipstick that lasts, this one will suffice.</li>
            <li> Looks just like Diva by Mac except much cheaper</li>
            <li> I love the color payout of this lipstick! It&#x27;s a smooth, beautiful dark red, and works well at &amp;#34;full strength&amp;#34; or as a lipstain. It is a little drying, but a little bit of balm applied under it fixes that, or gloss over if you&#x27;d prefer.</li>
            <li> Great lipstick! Especially for dark skin tones !</li>
            <li> Oh my stars! This is such a cute lipstick! Extremely flattering on my dark skin! Lasts pretty long and yes, put a little chap-stick on underneath! I get loads of compliments while wearing and I&#x27;d wear it nearly every day if I didn&#x27;t like kissing my boyfriend so much lol</li>
            <li> It is not as dark as i thought it would be. It comes on my lips somewhat light. Again, lipsticks are not for everyone and you have to find the right shade for your skin tone. However, this one is not mine.</li>
            <li> Loved everything about it, except for the fact that the lipstick broke the first day. The lipstick came loose from the bottom of the tube...but I still use it. That&#x27;s how fabulous it is! I just advance it enough to use it each time. :-) Deep, dry, dark rose color. Perfect! :-)</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it five stars. But when I received my lipstick. It was broken. But I had to fix it because I really love the color &amp;#34;Cherry Bomb&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Oh wow what a magical color!! perfect plum color!! dark and mysterious! Favourite color from Wet n wild megalast! certainly can last up to 4 hour with food and drinks! perfect!!</li>
            <li> LOOOOOVVVVEEE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s exact the color I wanted a dark red matte lipstick!</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick as a dupe to MAC&#x27;s &amp;#34;Diva&amp;#34; red and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as dark, but equally beautiful. Has a nice matte color without drying out my lips. The only thing I wish was that the lipstick was packaged better and had the classic pointy shape instead of round. The tube is really cheap plastic so be careful not to crack/break it. But I really love this color! Not vampy dark but a deep and pretty red. Definitely a good buy for the cheap price &amp;#60;3 glad I decided to buy this instead of spending $15.00 on basically the same color from Mac.</li>
            <li> Almost streaky, especially towards the middle of my lips. I find that I have to apply a wee bit of gloss to cover my whole mouth. (I used a Nyx butter gloss in a similar color.) The benefit is that I had no problem with the dryness others say they experienced and it still lasted several hours.</li>
            <li> One of my favorit close. Use a lip balm under the lip stick because it is a little drym</li>
            <li> EDIT: After wearing this lipstick on several occasions, I have to downgrade my review. After a few hours of wear, it settles into my lip lines and has a tendency to wear off in uneven patches. I&#x27;d rather spend extra money on a better lipstick of a similar color. This is a very common color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dark cool(blueish) red. I would recommend this for people who are darker or have a warm skin tone. Those with extremely fair skin may look a little goth and/or dead with this intense color. Unless of course you&#x27;re going for that look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good staying power&lt;br /&gt;- Opaque and vivid color&lt;br /&gt;- Can be dabbed for a less dramatic dark red effect&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap as hell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Package is a little annoying. You will get lipstick on the sides of the cap no matter how carefully you remove it&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive on Amazon -- I bought this for under $3 at my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;- Drying, but easily fixable with some lip balm underneath or after application.</li>
            <li> great product it has a great color without having to apply multiple times and stains so you do not have to keep reapplying the only reason I gave it a four is I didn&#x27;t expect it to be soo dark</li>
            <li> So happy with my purchased.the color is exactly what I was hoping for,similar color to diva from Mac.if you luv dark reds this is for you.can&#x27;t wait for my other colors to arrive won&#x27;t replace my Mac but gotta luv the price....</li>
            <li> Good color, very dry though.</li>
            <li> I wear this like everyday now lol</li>
            <li> great color to have if you love dark matte lipsticks,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick. Its not as dark as I was hoping for it to be but this color will look good on just about any skin tone.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for! The color is amazing and it&#x27;s very pigmented. Love love love!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick , a little drying but the color is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great colour but goes on a little blotchy.</li>
            <li> Just the color I was looking for! It is more of a deep ruby or maroon. Looks great on my cardboard colored skin tone. I would say its the perfect mix of the color that Kim Kardashian wore at the Met Gala 2013 and the color Beyoncé wore at the Met Gala 2014. The bottom sticker says C918D. The cover is transparent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. The color is stunning--it&#x27;s definitely a dupe for Black Cherry. Gorgeous!!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be a nice deep red, which it is if you apply it sparingly, but if you apply too much it becomes a very dark almost blackened red. It&#x27;s really nice for a vampy look, and the formula is amazing, just expect the colour to be very dark. I absolutely love this lipstick line though, so if this shade is too dark for you, you should definitely check out some other colours in the line!</li>
            <li> My new favorite lipstick! Amazing lasting results, and well packaged. Brand new and no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Great color  and product for the price.</li>
            <li> Luv this colour lipstick..... it&#x27;s beautiful.... the more u apply the darker the colour is.</li>
            <li> I just love this lipstick. It&#x27;s really dark and it&#x27;s the color I&#x27;ve looking for in the stores, but I couldn&#x27;t find it. Until I found it here. I recommend you to get it because it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li> Love the color. Nice and smooth when I apply it to my lips.</li>
            <li> The product shipped super fast and came in great condition. The color doesn&#x27;t suit me as well as I had hoped, but it is gorgeous nonetheless :)</li>
            <li> Thought is was going to be a nice, deep burgundy based on the pictures. Not so, turns out. Way more purple than expected. Kind of disappointed! Stays on very well though.</li>
            <li> Love this color! It&#x27;s burgundy and matte. Great for its price.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife she loved the color but when she opened the tube the entire lipstick feel out. Now she has to carefully use it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVED this lipstick. The colour is very pigmented and definitely stays on for a long while, I only had to apply it once during a really long event I recently had. It tends to dry the lips a little bit, but that is an easy fix if you have any lip moisturiser around. I got great reviews from my friends all night. It was a good buy &amp; I recommend it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already searching for more colors from this brand.</li>
            <li> I seriously think this color changes on different people when I wear it it&#x27;s almost purple looking my friend used it and it looked like a burnt red either way it a beautiful lipstick I love it I bought 2 of them and have other colors</li>
