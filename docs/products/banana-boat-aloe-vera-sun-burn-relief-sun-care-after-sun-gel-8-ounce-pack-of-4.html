            <li> I was running low on my current bottle of Aloe, so I picked up this one and it came with 4 so I can save them or give them to friends and family all for a good price!</li>
            <li> the summer  i ues it go to the beach&lt;br /&gt;very good&lt;br /&gt;There are cool feeling&lt;br /&gt;i love it very much</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> Natural real aloe works in relieving sun burns. This Banana Boat aloe gel also works for me. It is really soothing and I also like the fragrance. This is also convenient as it is not easy to carry a real actual aloe leaf where you travel. However, there are some preservatives in this BB aloe gel that some people are allergic to (some in my family), so for those folks the benefit of aloe may not surpass the negatives of the included preservatives (read label). All in all, I think for most folks this is a great almost instant option for sunburn relief. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I am getting married in Mexico, so I bought these for my bridesmaids as part of their gift.  Great value and perfect travel size (so long as you are checking a bag.)  Happy with my purchase and I am sure we will definitely need aloe after a couple days down there!</li>
            <li> Its cool, non grease, very healthly, my sons love it, my husband too! I think was a very wise to buy it</li>
            <li> Banana Boat is the best aloe out there, but hard to find, except for Amazon. I swear they must carry everything!  So always look at Amazon first!    William T. Travers Jr.</li>
            <li> The main stores in Austin have stopped carrying this in favor of just having&lt;br /&gt;their own version of aloe vera relief gel on their shelves, so I now have to&lt;br /&gt;order it online.  Theirs all have a perfume additive that bothers my husband&lt;br /&gt;a lot.  This product provides excellent relief from sunburn and other skin&lt;br /&gt;irritations without perfume.</li>
            <li> The price was great.  I could not find this in any local store for less. This item also has a great shelf life.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to take on a cruise..  Didn&#x27;t get burned, so did not use it, but it was a great size for my luggage.  I have used this brand before and found it to be very satisfactory in relieving burns and soothing skin.</li>
            <li> this stuff works and leaves no sticky residue. a must for post run and sun workouts. used it for a couple years</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Banana Boat Aloe Vera After Sun now since 2 years and it feels just great on the skin after being in the sun for a while. Perfect for a refreshing in the later afternoon. It cools nicely and the smell is pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> Found some @1/3 the price with 4 times the product and it was a brand I trusted that contained no dye.</li>
            <li> I heard about it form my friends but haven&#x27;t tried it. Anyway sun burn relief gel is always in need when summer comes. I got 4 pack with a good price! Love it!</li>
            <li> Very good product, the price is very cheap, always stick with it, it was very good。Hope activities, many，A lot of efforts</li>
            <li> Arrive quickly was hard to find in stores, but you had it. Would definetly order through again when need more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing deal!  Its so much cheaper than sold in local stores.</li>
            <li> Trusted and true. Aloe Vera is best applied immediately and then regularly after a sunburn is recognized.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this product, I never felt worry about sun tan. This is an amazing product protects skin from various hazards. I&#x27;m using this even after shaving. It soothes my skin and reduce the damage to skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter had some and I&#x27;d spent way too long in the sun.  Tried some, liked it - kept my skin from peeling like crazy -so I bought a bunch.  (Note to self - use sunscreen.)</li>
            <li> This aloe product is great to relieve burn after fishing on the water all day.  I almost bath in it.  No burn the next day.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> I immediately returned this item after reading the ingredient list on the bottle. It contains unnecessary coloring ingredient yellow 5. Highly disappointed. I guess I should have known better considering the product is unnaturally bright green in color.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, good price, worth it! Use this every time you are in the sun and it helps to moisturize your skin. Could do lotion but this really works! Also great with sun-burn! Used twice a day day of burn and for two days afterward. Combined lotion and aloe day three and by day 4 or 5 burn was gone, no peeling, no pain, nothing! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> We love this product.  Nth whole family used it while we were in the Bahamas!</li>
            <li> We always use this for a refreshing skin care product.  Never greasy, just so natural.&lt;br /&gt;Great before putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful with some sunburn, but takes quite a while to heal, must not be the old formula and is very little aloe in the mix.  However, it smells nice, works for some other things, just not burns.</li>
            <li> Cool jelly gel texture. It&#x27;s nice to use after spending a day outdoor in summer. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I use aloe to heal cracked skin and close pores prior to going to bed, so when I was running out of my previous bottle I needed to find a new brand. My previous was an obscure brand, but the aloe contained an alcohol that gives a cooling sensation similar to menthol. I found Banana Boat and for the price, you get a lot of Aloe; but, it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol in it and the fragrance it is infused with smells like Banana Boat sunscreen. I actually really like the smell, but it&#x27;s a matter of preference. Even without the alcohol, it is a decent Aloe especially for the price.</li>
