            <li>Love this product with Detox Soak Bath Salts for my Fibromyalgia</li>
            <li>I love this scent</li>
            <li>but it smells more like mint gum.</li>
            <li>OKAY</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and very relaxing.</li>
            <li>lovely relaxing smell, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on you, or your tub.</li>
            <li>Smells great for a special occasion in the hot tub</li>
            <li>They turn your spa into a more relaxing menthol oil cool feeling.</li>
            <li>Was suprised at how little you need, gives a nice feel to the water, smells great,</li>
            <li>it was buy one get one free</li>
            <li>They love the smell of this, even thought it is strong at first and brings tears to my eyes.</li>
            <li>Both of my grandchildren thought this product was cool.</li>
            <li>BUT FOR THE MONEY I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED SOMETHING WITH A MORE EFFECTIVE AROMA AND STRONGER FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DID NOTHING AND WORE OFF VERY QUICKLY</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t seem to get the same intensity with this product although it does have a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>Now granted the warm bath helped some; but the aromatherapy bath salts improved my overall discomfort over just a regular warm bath.  </li>
            <li>It shipped super fast and when I received it in the mail I had a surprise!</li>
            <li>Smells good, but other than that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this might be good in smaller vessels, but I was extremely Dissapointed in it for my hot tub.  </li>
            <li>I can still smell it every time I take my cover off my hot tub.</li>
            <li>First of all the aroma of eucalyptus mint was so relaxing and</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I use this product almost every time I use my hot tub.</li>
            <li>Wife enjoyed using it several times in the hot tub, didn&#x27;t appear to cause any problems with the system.</li>
            <li>My mom loves this item so much!</li>
            <li>They go in cranky and come out calm and ready for bed.  </li>
            <li>Better than last one which really didn&#x27;t have scent.  </li>
            <li>but I generally put in a cap full and</li>
            <li>This product really relax me after a stressful day at work.</li>
            <li>The Relax product lasts much longer than Spazazz</li>
            <li>Consequently you do not need to use as much per soak.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it contained actual essential oils of eucalyptus and mint, when in reality it&#x27;s oil free.</li>
            <li>and it does as promised, relaxes you and help clear the sinuses at the same time!</li>
            <li>added a lot and still barely notice</li>
            <li>Nice but useless for hottub use</li>
            <li>Only enough in the container to scent three times, and each time lasted less than a full day.  </li>

            <li> it works well for sore tired muscles to help relax after hard day at work</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased this item as it was rock solid when received and required taking your life in your hands by vigorously stabbing the material with an ice pick until it would pour.</li>

            <li> i like it! the best quality, i&#x27;m really satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Love this product with Detox Soak Bath Salts for my Fibromyalgia</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people said the scent didn&#x27;t last long but I generally put in a cap full and I can still smell it every time I take my cover off my hot tub. I love this scent</li>
            <li> Not a real strong aroma....added a lot and still barely notice&lt;br /&gt;will keep trying others</li>
            <li> I love this product especially now when coming in from the cold after clearing the snow. The scent relaxes the mind and the salts sooth the body, soaking away muscle fatigue.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Great for relaxing in the hot tub.</li>
            <li> I use the same quantity of crystals each time I add to the spa regardless of the blend I&#x27;m using and I don&#x27;t seem to get the same intensity with this product although it does have a nice smell to it. I prefer others but there is nothing wrong with this one and I will continue to order it and keep it as one of my selections on the shelf. David... Anchorage, Alaska</li>
            <li> Relieves muscle aches as stated. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it ... if you use enough to notice its&#x27; presence, it&#x27;s gone in no time!</li>
            <li> Nice but useless for hottub use</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased this item as it was rock solid when received and required taking your life in your hands by vigorously stabbing the material with an ice pick until it would pour.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it contained actual essential oils of eucalyptus and mint, when in reality it&#x27;s oil free. Smells good, but other than that I didnt find any therapeutic properties.</li>
            <li> This product really relax me after a stressful day at work. The fragrant last all though the bath!</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Better than last one which really didn&#x27;t have scent.  This does and it lasts for quite a while</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and as described-Thanks!</li>
            <li> The Relax product lasts much longer than Spazazz but it smells more like mint gum. I like the stronger smell of the eucalyptus with the Spazazz so I&#x27;ll mix them and see what that creates. Hopefully a longer lasting eucalyptus smell.</li>
            <li> Was suprised at how little you need, gives a nice feel to the water, smells great, that about it.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these because I have osteoarthritis in my knees and ankles.  I tried this over the week-end and it was great.  First of all the aroma of eucalyptus mint was so relaxing and second the discomfort I was feeling in my knees and ankles improved.  Now granted the warm bath helped some; but the aromatherapy bath salts improved my overall discomfort over just a regular warm bath.  I would recommend this product.  I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this might be good in smaller vessels, but I was extremely Dissapointed in it for my hot tub.  Only enough in the container to scent three times, and each time lasted less than a full day.  Just not worth the cost for the use.</li>
            <li> What can I Say?????  Smells wonderful and feels wonderful!  Great purchase and it does as promised, relaxes you and help clear the sinuses at the same time!</li>
            <li> Awesome Smell!!!! shipped as stated.  Just wish the scent lasted longer.</li>
            <li> These aromatherapy bath salts came as described. They turn your spa into a more relaxing menthol oil cool feeling. It also came with a sample of another bath salt to try. I use this product almost every time I use my hot tub. All you do is put a couple cap fulls and sprinkle them in and then your spa because even smoother.</li>
            <li> ITS OKAY BUT FOR THE MONEY I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED SOMETHING WITH A MORE EFFECTIVE AROMA AND STRONGER FRAGRANCE. IT REALLY DID NOTHING AND WORE OFF VERY QUICKLY</li>
            <li> Wife enjoyed using it several times in the hot tub, didn&#x27;t appear to cause any problems with the system.</li>
            <li> If you like a stronger salt that truly has some aromatherapy....such as the mint (kind of like menthol). This is great after a massage.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for the Hot tub!!!!  it works well for sore tired muscles to help relax after hard day at work</li>
            <li> Strong wonderful scent which lasts for a good soak! Consequently you do not need to use as much per soak.</li>

            <li> Smells great and have been looking for something I can use in my bathroom jucuzzi.  I&#x27;ll buy again as soon as needed.</li>
            <li> lovely relaxing smell, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on you, or your tub. You do have to use quite a bit though to get the aroma to come through in a bath.</li>
            <li> I got this item as a gift for my mom and she loved it!! It shipped super fast and when I received it in the mail I had a surprise! it was buy one get one free and I didn&#x27;t even know it! My mom loves this item so much! definitely a must get for moms everywhere!</li>
            <li> Feels so great, I thinks it works</li>
            <li> I use this in my children&#x27;s bath all the time.  They love the smell of this, even thought it is strong at first and brings tears to my eyes. They go in cranky and come out calm and ready for bed.  Must have....</li>
