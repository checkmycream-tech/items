            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Now I just make my own.</li>
            <li>For best results, use with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Love this product and use it often.  </li>
            <li>There is no way anyone would be able to apply this product to their face and be able to stand the smell.  </li>
            <li>i love how it met my expectations on my hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing makes your skin feel better, or manages your hair better.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care any more.</li>
            <li>Like most lee priducts this one does its job.</li>
            <li>my hair was amazingly soft and the growth was great.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my dried hands and it works great!</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Much better than &amp;#34;One Shot&amp;#34; and much quicker that</li>
            <li>Great buy works extremely well</li>
            <li>3-4 oz of this and one bottle of &amp;#34;HEET&amp;#34; (red bottle) made a really nice case lube.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s very viscous and somewhat sticky but it certainly does the job: moisturize and smooth.</li>
            <li>Product was as described and priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li>but i am willing to try it again.</li>
            <li>I decided to try pure lanolin which is a lot more rich than I expected.</li>
            <li>after taking my braids out i saw some positive results.</li>
            <li>It does have an interesting smell, kind of earthy but weird.</li>
            <li>I love lanolin by H&amp;B Oils Center!</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit gives full coverage, and you can apply it right over your regular lip color.</li>
            <li>It lasts longer on your lips than normal gloss does.</li>
            <li>Not hard to mask though.  </li>
            <li>have long African American hair which is textured but somewhat fine.</li>
            <li>and it us very sticky not sure it made much difference on my hair,  </li>
            <li>I then mixed this with another all natural product which made it a little more liquid like and less sticky/greasy.</li>
            <li>I initially applied this direct to my hair and found it a little too much.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because the viscosity is what I was looking for but unfortunately will not be able to use this product due to its odor.  </li>
            <li> Purchased a different brand previously and find that this version of the oil is less viscous and mixes well with the body lotion and creams used.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long thick and textured.  </li>
            <li> I poured a little bit into a small bottle and carry it with me.</li>
            <li> Just a little too thick but would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a terrible, strong smell.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this as an additive to beard oil which I will not be using because the smell is AWFUL!!</li>
            <li> It is also very thick and hard to spread on your body.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked when I tried to put this on my hands because it smells like petroleum or car  lube.  </li>
            <li> Terrible smell!</li>
            <li> Perhaps a bad batch?!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it! It is a multipurpose product just as the seller described. I bought it for my dried hands and it works great! I will purchase it again once I run out!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Vickie</li>
            <li> Thicker than I would use but I add almond oil and use regularly.  Good price good product.</li>
            <li> For best results, use with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great buy works extremely well</li>
            <li> Product was as described and priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it often.  Just a little too thick but would recommend this to anyone. Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell! Smells like burnt plastic. I originally bought this as an additive to beard oil which I will not be using because the smell is AWFUL!! There is no way anyone would be able to apply this product to their face and be able to stand the smell.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars because the viscosity is what I was looking for but unfortunately will not be able to use this product due to its odor.  Perhaps a bad batch?!!! I&#x27;m hoping so because everyone else is giving this product good reviews.</li>
            <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I tried to put this on my hands because it smells like petroleum or car  lube.  It&#x27;s really a terrible, strong smell. It is also very thick and hard to spread on your body.  I guess I will try to mix it into a cream and see how that works.</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough to decide. I did use it once and it us very sticky not sure it made much difference on my hair,  but i am willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> I love lanolin by H&amp;B Oils Center! It is an excellent way to keep your lips moist. Just a tiny bit gives full coverage, and you can apply it right over your regular lip color. It lasts longer on your lips than normal gloss does.</li>
            <li> Bought for case lube. 3-4 oz of this and one bottle of &amp;#34;HEET&amp;#34; (red bottle) made a really nice case lube.  Much better than &amp;#34;One Shot&amp;#34; and much quicker that a lube pad or rubbing on with your fingers.  I&#x27;m guessing 8 oz. may be enough for several/many years.</li>
            <li> i love how it met my expectations on my hair. i used it once on my hair and it stayed on for 2 weeks. after taking my braids out i saw some positive results. my hair was amazingly soft and the growth was great.</li>
            <li> I started buying a product that was basically lanolin and deionized water. The product made my hair feel great.  I decided to try pure lanolin which is a lot more rich than I expected. I initially applied this direct to my hair and found it a little too much.  I then mixed this with another all natural product which made it a little more liquid like and less sticky/greasy. It does have an interesting smell, kind of earthy but weird. Not hard to mask though.  I will be ordering this for my family members as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long African American hair which is textured but somewhat fine. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long thick and textured.  Works well in both of our hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing makes your skin feel better, or manages your hair better. I don&#x27;t know why all the skin care and all the hair oil products quit  putting Lanolin in thier products and I don&#x27;t care any more. Now I just make my own.</li>
            <li> Like most lee priducts this one does its job.</li>
            <li> Works well, as promised.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s very viscous and somewhat sticky but it certainly does the job: moisturize and smooth. Perfect for to keep lips glossy and smooth. I poured a little bit into a small bottle and carry it with me.</li>
            <li> I use this product in a 1/ 12 ratio with alcohol to make a case lubricant for reforming my rifle cases.</li>
            <li> Great product, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Use this product as an additive to body creams and lotion during the winter months,  It is excellent.  Purchased a different brand previously and find that this version of the oil is less viscous and mixes well with the body lotion and creams used.</li>
            <li> good for my husbands reloading equip</li>
