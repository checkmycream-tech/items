            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face scrub.</li>
            <li>For the money I was expecting better.  </li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;m sure I can find something better.</li>
            <li>Love to use it in the morning just before I shave.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of  face wash, but this is the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin and this product is very suitable for my skin!</li>
            <li>It leaves skin clean and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>The blade seems to glide more easily on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and sooth after use!</li>
            <li>This smells good and works really well.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone who wants a good exfoliant.</li>
            <li>minimum scent, fine particles.</li>
            <li>it makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Super refreshing and ultra clean.</li>
            <li>Even the rest of my face feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It will give you a clean feeling, a clean face feeling.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else comes close to making my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>so I keep buying it for him :) I highly recommend it,</li>
            <li>and it does have a somewhat minty fresh feel when washed.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to make your face feel really clean.</li>
            <li>it works somehow, but consider it is price, it is below the expectation, not as good as it advertises, not worth the money</li>
            <li>more thing great is this is actually quite economic choice as just a little of this</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>bought my first tube November of 2012.</li>
            <li>I love the gritty feel of this</li>
            <li>I most likely wont purchase again.</li>
            <li>Love this face wash because it has tiny beads that almost feels like a exfoliating wash.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its better than cheaper brands out there, but as long as he likes it and asks for it, I&#x27;ll get it for him.</li>
            <li>I have used Lacombe, Clinique, Clarins and La prarie and can say as far as men&#x27;s face wasjh(with a mild exfoliant)</li>
            <li>all this lab series stuff does the trick no doubt, but the prices are pretty high for what ya get.</li>
            <li>This product makes me feel good even with the hard water.</li>
            <li>It looks, feel cleaner at much lower price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really what I want.</li>
            <li>fast service , thank you</li>
            <li>Love it as expected been using for years</li>
            <li>He really likes this</li>
            <li>it is very goodï¼Œbut</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular face wash for some time now</li>
            <li>Totally worth the extra money for this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So the price is not bad when you work it out over how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>this time.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with other facial wash, this is very smooth and micro beads inside</li>
            <li>Also very soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok face wash but is no better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li>you are a dry-skin person, this one might be a little too strong for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>The stuff is a bit expensive but it definitely keeps my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;ve been using it my face has been clear and younger looking (its a scrub really)</li>
            <li>Works well with soft water too.</li>
            <li>A bit more expensive than I think worth it.</li>
            <li>Price is also much lower than some of the upper end brands I mentioned above.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That is why I have ordered several of them using the convenience and the low prices of Amazon and its warranty of maintaining high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have hard water: You may want to use a moisturizer afterwards, because this stuff is pretty much a degreaser.</li>
            <li>other thing I really like about this</li>
            <li>After the first use in the afternoon on Friday, when my wife saw me a few hours later at home, she made the comment, \\&quot;Your face looks cleaner and brighter today.\\&quot;  </li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, but still cleans.</li>
            <li> Also lasts a long time, because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Never use soap or other expensive brands as facial cleansing crea/foam.&lt;br /&gt;Until now, I was using one of the most expensive brands available(mens.ladies) in the marketand paying such a hig price for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it just works for my face plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and haven&#x27;t once had a problem with breakouts or anything due to this cleanser.</li>
            <li> It has a little grit (crushed apricot seeds) to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> you have soft water (where soap is difficult to wash off): You might want to only use a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it at least once daily in the shower.</li>
            <li> started using this LAB facial face wash and on the 1st application, I noticed the difference and feeling it leaves behind on your face.</li>
            <li> I used to use this item a few years ago, and I bought two of them</li>
            <li> You need VERY little of this stuff when you use it.</li>
            <li> He does not have serious acne but likes this product for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I moved from NY to LA and the water our here is hard.</li>
            <li> It does this without leaving your skin with a tight or uncomfortable feeling after it&#x27;s been washed.  </li>
            <li> I find it is just ok,not bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff works great! Better than the over-advertised brands. Although I have some advice to anyone that buys this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have soft water (where soap is difficult to wash off): You might want to only use a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hard water: You may want to use a moisturizer afterwards, because this stuff is pretty much a degreaser.</li>
            <li> I received this on Friday and have used it 5 times since.  I absolutely love this product. After the first use in the afternoon on Friday, when my wife saw me a few hours later at home, she made the comment, \\&quot;Your face looks cleaner and brighter today.\\&quot;  No, she didn&#x27;t know I got this product at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really like about this is you literally have to use a teeny weeny amount.  If you&#x27;ve used regular face washes like Nivea or the likes, in comparison, just like 1/5 the amount or so and boy does it foam up.  I think I&#x27;m going to stick to this always.</li>
            <li> This smells good and works really well. I moved from NY to LA and the water our here is hard. This product makes me feel good even with the hard water. Would recommend it to anyone who wants a good exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great for washing your face.  It will give you a clean feeling, a clean face feeling.  It does this without leaving your skin with a tight or uncomfortable feeling after it&#x27;s been washed.  Thank you, Lab Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought from Amazon, on-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My purchases from Amazon have all been good products.</li>
            <li> Never use soap or other expensive brands as facial cleansing crea/foam.&lt;br /&gt;Until now, I was using one of the most expensive brands available(mens.ladies) in the marketand paying such a hig price for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this LAB facial face wash and on the 1st application, I noticed the difference and feeling it leaves behind on your face. It looks, feel cleaner at much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;That is why I have ordered several of them using the convenience and the low prices of Amazon and its warranty of maintaining high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Both LAB &amp; Amazon.com[[ASIN:B000H83Q4W Aramis Lab Series for Men Multi-Action Face Wash 100ml/3.4oz]]</li>
            <li> I used to use this item a few years ago, and I bought two of them this time.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with other facial wash, this is very smooth and micro beads inside it makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really what I want.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years now and love it.  It leaves skin clean and smells nice.  Also lasts a long time, because a little goes a long way.  One tube lasts several months.  So the price is not bad when you work it out over how long it lasts.  I also use the lab series \\&quot;invigorating face scrub\\&quot; about two times a week.  It has a little grit (crushed apricot seeds) to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face scrub. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, but still cleans.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this face wash, I&#x27;m not a fan.  I don&#x27;t think its better than cheaper brands out there, but as long as he likes it and asks for it, I&#x27;ll get it for him.</li>
            <li> For the money I was expecting better.  It&#x27;s an ok face wash but is no better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> Super refreshing and ultra clean. Nice cleanser indeed.&lt;br /&gt;Good for oil or neutral skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a dry-skin person, this one might be a little too strong for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing great is this is actually quite economic choice as just a little of this would be enough for each wash</li>
            <li> I been using this for like 2-3 years works really good for I guess gotta find what works for you.</li>
            <li> my husband loves aramis lab face wash. fast service , thank you</li>
            <li> Totally worth the extra money for this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first tube November of 2012. I&#x27;m just now running out and it&#x27;s May of 2014! I use it at least once daily in the shower. If i happen to take a second shower that day I&#x27;ll use it again. You need VERY little of this stuff when you use it. I have oily skin and haven&#x27;t once had a problem with breakouts or anything due to this cleanser. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial cleaners over the years and not only does this one work fantastically, it&#x27;s a superb value.</li>
            <li> I have used Lacombe, Clinique, Clarins and La prarie and can say as far as men&#x27;s face wasjh(with a mild exfoliant) this is the best at any price I&#x27;ve ever used. Price is also much lower than some of the upper end brands I mentioned above. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else and it last for MONTHS.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 1 year , and I think that is the best face wash ever~!</li>
            <li> I love the gritty feel of this and it works well to remove oils and clogged pores. The stuff is a bit expensive but it definitely keeps my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Good concept but leaves a waxy residue on the face which I just don&#x27;t like. For the price I&#x27;m sure I can find something better.</li>
            <li> it works somehow, but consider it is price, it is below the expectation, not as good as it advertises, not worth the money</li>
            <li> Love it as expected been using for years</li>
            <li> Good wash--face feels clean after using. A bit more expensive than I think worth it. I most likely wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and this product is very suitable for my skin! My skin feels clean and sooth after use!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash because it has tiny beads that almost feels like a exfoliating wash.  Also very soft.  My wife and I both use it.</li>
            <li> Best facewash I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> bought this here because it was cheaper than going to sephora. the face wash is good, has micro beads to scrub my face and it does have a somewhat minty fresh feel when washed. would buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, Im 30 and since I&#x27;ve been using it my face has been clear and younger looking (its a scrub really)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! The product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> all this lab series stuff does the trick no doubt, but the prices are pretty high for what ya get. minimum scent, fine particles. definitely get the face cleaner than regular soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular face wash for some time now and it is a really good face wash. It not only cleans your face but it exfoliates as well which is a plus. You are buying the exfoliate and wash in one. I gave it 5 stars because I have had no problem using this face wash over the years and it just works for my face plain and simple.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to make your face feel really clean. Love to use it in the morning just before I shave. The blade seems to glide more easily on my face. Even the rest of my face feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> His favorite face wash! He really likes this so I keep buying it for him :) I highly recommend it,</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of  face wash, but this is the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for... Years... Nothing else comes close to making my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for years. I just wish it was cheaper. It cleans excellently. Works well with soft water too.</li>
