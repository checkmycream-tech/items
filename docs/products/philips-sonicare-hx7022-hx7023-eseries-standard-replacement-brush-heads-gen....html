    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I thank the wonderful reviewers who gave instructions on how to replace these things onto my 7022 brush head.  </li>
            <li>For the cost of this purchase (including shipping), this was an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li>it is the best</li>
            <li>Awesome deal!  </li>
            <li>As best I can tell, the mechanism is friction.</li>
            <li>Until they wake up, this is the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a great alternative!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality of this product is very good.  </li>
            <li>Not I have to throw away perfectly good stuff just like cell phone chargers and accessories, Ugh!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be a great saving if I could somehow use the brushes.</li>
            <li>..works great</li>
            <li>These are a great deal.  </li>
            <li>For the price, still a great buy compared to Philips brand.  </li>
            <li>These seem to be a great alternative to the pricey Sonicare head units -- if you can get one installed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great brush heads.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the ones made by Phillips.</li>
            <li>I received 4 brush heads, and they looked good, but they are in no way</li>
            <li>works great and cost effective</li>
            <li>These are just as good as the brand name</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very happy Amazon is offering these economical replacement heads.</li>
            <li>These things are amazing.</li>
            <li>say all this because these brushes come with no directions or diagrams or clues of any kind as to how to install them.</li>
            <li>Took a bit of pulling to get the original one off, but the replacements fit perfect</li>
            <li>At that price I might aswell have just bought the OEM replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy having a great smile!</li>
            <li>THis works perfect, just got to use pliers to remove the old brush head</li>
            <li>Sonicaire brush seems to be a perfect pitch device and sings at exactly 440Hz, Middle A to Musicians, perfect for tuning things : )</li>
            <li>Perfect for my smile and got it quickly.</li>
            <li>Good price for these items, I checked other sites and Amazon had the best price of all of them that I searched.</li>
            <li>there are MANY others on Amazon (and in box stores) to choose from</li>
            <li>I bought these toothbrush heads trying to save money and they didn&#x27;t even fit the toothbrush that was advertised!</li>
            <li>, you would think what most of us in fact need to replace.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>These are just okay.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be 100% sure that it&#x27;s working as the toothbrush was designed because the profile is different.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure yours is the &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; series.</li>
            <li>better plaque removal versus a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I would urge users who had issues with the installation, to try it one more time.</li>
            <li>buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical when ordering but pleased when I tried them.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it off with some pliers and did not need to boil it in water to do so.</li>
            <li>I was able to jam this one on .</li>
            <li>The savings on brushes are significant!</li>
            <li>Product appears to perform better than the original brush head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was finally able to remove my original brush head, but bent the bar in the process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to remove the original heads from my brushes using two pairs of pliers.</li>
            <li>This is easily done by sticking the magnets to something metal like a tool or an iron knife to keep your hand away from the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Installation is easy with pliers, but there are some problems with the heads themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is easily done by sticking the magnets to something metal like a tool or an iron knife to keep your hand away from the boiling water.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, replacing the heads becomes quite easy</li>
            <li>and I find the bristles to be fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes work fine and of course are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I feel like a huge chump.</li>
            <li>These are great, and simple to install.</li>
            <li>The potential savings were so great that I decided to give them a try</li>
            <li>the listing had said HX6013 and the description had said something to the tune of, &amp;#34;Can be made to fit atop the HX7022 replacement head with tools and effort,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This replacement brush head fit on the bar, but the pulsation was off because the brush head did not sit</li>
            <li>When my official Philips E-series head ran out, I pulled the brush off and replaced it with one of these, in hopes it would be a cheap replacement.  </li>
            <li>As someone else has suggested here, sticking the old brush in boiling water seems like a good approach.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to brush again!!!</li>
            <li>However, I am no5t inclined to boil my original nor do I have brute force to pull these babies apart.  </li>
            <li>It takes some effort to remove the original brush head, but it can be done.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Well worth the effort!</li>
            <li>Need pliers to remove original brush head???</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have any problems removing the original brush heads from my worn out Sonicare heads.  </li>
            <li>Green being his favorite color also doesn&#x27;t hurt :) Good stocking stuffers when Christmas comes out.</li>
            <li>I took a chance in this to save money and after using some tools to pry off the original head (I couldn&#x27;t do it with my hands alone)</li>
            <li>These generic replacements look nearly identical, and function perfectly.</li>
            <li>He has an issue with bristles always being too hard and hurting his gums, but he says these are perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, you must understand that these are not the full Sonic replacement units that just screw onto the handle.</li>
            <li>but at this price it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>would encourage every user out there to consider this product, not only for its agreeable price, but because they are a soundly efficient, ecological and cost effective alternative to an otherwise pricey and wasteful option.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works with no problems and at a fraction of the cost of the full heads from Sonic.</li>
            <li>The replacement brush fit just right.</li>
            <li>The price is very good, but I&#x27;m just not sure that having to worry about the head coming off all the time justifies the savings.  </li>
            <li>The new brush slips on easily and holds securely.</li>
            <li>The bristles are robust, perhaps even more than the ones peddled by the original manufacturer, and it essentially replicates the performance of the original at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There was no way I could remove the top section of the Eseries brush from my old brush to replace with one of these.</li>
            <li>We throw far too many things away these days.</li>
            <li>Immerse the head to the bottom of the brush unit right where the colored ring is.</li>
            <li>It will slip right off after it is softened.</li>
            <li>contacted the company &amp; they &#x27;promised&#x27; to send right product</li>
            <li>Immerse the head to the bottom of the brush unit right where the colored ring is.</li>
            <li>It will slip right off after it is softened.</li>
            <li>The brush head comes right off.</li>
            <li>Before you order this, first be sure you can remove the old brush end.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true that taking the old head off the first time isn&#x27;t easy</li>
            <li>Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy all this was to accomplish.</li>
            <li>far as installing and removing them, is easy if you heat the end with a blow dryer for about 10-20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Remove the threaded nut portion first.</li>
            <li>Anybody who couldn&#x27;t figure this out is pretty dense if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That picture is exactly what you get-&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, they don&#x27;t fit the old brush cover well.  </li>
            <li>Make certain that the bristles are pointing in the right direction in relation to the power button.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these as the quality and price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i was able to remove only the brush portion and replace with this</li>
            <li>First, I could not remove mine with pliers</li>
            <li>Remove the threaded nut portion first.</li>
            <li>; I would have given this a higher rating.</li>
            <li>First, the E-series head isn&#x27;t meant to be disassembled in the way required to make this replacement work.</li>
            <li>It does require a bit of strength, and perhaps a pair of pliers the first time...</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this sensible solution!</li>
            <li>at first I did not think I could , then with BRUTE force and channel locks</li>
            <li>But I tried to pull out the brush head from the assembly and found it is not difficult if two persons are engaged.  </li>
            <li>It would have gotten four star, but my only criticism is that when you put the original plastic toothbrush cover over it while traveling, sometimes it pushes the brush through the original head attachment.</li>
            <li>It was stuck pretty good but following the advice of placing it in boiling water for several seconds made it come right off.  </li>
            <li>I am a fairly strong man who&#x27;s opened many recalcitrant pickle jar lids without a problem, but the brush top would not come off no matter how I twisted and turned and pulled, even with 2 large pliers.</li>
            <li>this is it , it is exactly like the real ones</li>
            <li>Look at ebay first before paying this much.</li>
            <li>easy pulled old brush off ,put new one on .done ..</li>
            <li>The new one slides right on without any heating or anything&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new one slides right on without any heating or anything.</li>
            <li>Great product: works as wells as the name-brand Phillips full-head rip-off, much cheaper -- and no problem to attach.</li>
            <li>been buying whole heads for years .now</li>
            <li>with that said I won&#x60;t be buying the whole head again .</li>
            <li>u don&#x27;t really need to replace.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses Sonicare and he always requests I buy him these ones.</li>
            <li>In the end, I tossed the remaining three heads and bought some real Philips E-series heads.</li>
            <li>I spent an hour or more trying to figure out the mechanism that holds the brush to the head.</li>
            <li>The head comes off much easier once you have removed it once.</li>
            <li>but SO much cheaper.</li>
            <li>We love our Sonicare toothbrushes, but when they die and need to be replaced your old charger isn&#x27;t compatible and neither are your extra toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>For some reason the shape of the bristles is more exaggerated on these replacements, but I think I kind of like that.</li>
            <li>Most brush head replacements cost twice as much because you are paying for brush tips and other parts of the tooth brush</li>
            <li>Since I had already successfully removed the original head from the base attaching this one was easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, these aren&#x27;t the same profile as the original heads that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the brush seems the same as the original.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is slightly different than the original, maybe a tad softer but not objectionable to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These seem to be a little stiffer bristles than the original Sonicare brushes, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>Do note that you are only getting what is shown in the picture, not the full brush head.</li>
            <li>stated in another review, to remove the old head, I just immersed the head in hot water and it slipped off no problem.</li>
            <li>So maybe do this ONCE then get a whole new head</li>
            <li>TOP half of the head, the brush, which is</li>
            <li>I didnt thjnk i could use this on my older e series version...</li>
            <li>The old brush head slips right off with no brute force required if you soak the old head in boiling water for one minute.</li>
            <li>I made sure the head was on correctly and was tight.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Brush action same as the original</li>
            <li>Sure there is a little bit of effort involved, but nothing my mum couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li>totally worth the extra step of having to remove the head from midway point of the assembly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to replace and longer lasting bristles than generic ones found at Wally.</li>
            <li>the new one comes off without a problem.</li>
            <li>I am using a travel cover for the new head with no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new brushes go off and on easier.</li>
            <li>bristles feel like they&#x27;re about the same stiffness as the original bristles and they have similar coloring.  </li>
            <li>Wow, that&#x27;s a home run!</li>
            <li>Seriously, these are worth the jack, unless of course you enjoy the dentist. .</li>
            <li>In addition, the bristles of these replacement heads didn&#x27;t feel as stiff as the original, which implies to me that they&#x27;re not cleaning away as much plaque.    </li>
            <li>If I have to I will buy a couple of new full heads when my current one fails but for now I am loving the lower cost replacement.</li>
            <li>No idea if they will last as long, but even if they only last a quarter as long it will still be a great deal.</li>
            <li>And since you are only replacing the top part it is less wasteful.</li>
            <li>ONLY REPLACE THE TOP HALF and $ave More!&lt;br /&gt;Ordering for Christmas?</li>
            <li>In this case, I&#x27;m willing to pay more to ensure my teeth are being brushed properly, and to save myself the annoyance of ripping these heads apart every few months.</li>
            <li>use the blade of a knife or screw driver to lift the old head out ut of the boiling water by the magnet end.</li>
            <li>I used needle nose pliers to pop the old heads off without issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The second time should be much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then went as far as attempting to widen the hole with a drill but no luck.</li>
            <li>Good quality so far, works just like the ridiculously expensive Philips refills.</li>
            <li>Please, let me clarify how to do this so that even the most... slow of individuals can understand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will squish the soft part down, but that&#x27;s fine since the new head is a tiny bit shorter than the original.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So press hard down when your putting on the new head so that you know the connection is good and it wont fall off when you using it.</li>
            <li>I straightened it, stuck the new head on there, and brushed as normal.</li>
            <li>It took several long minutes with pliers to finally rip the old head free, and in doing</li>
            <li>I first tried a generic replacement head from Walmart ($17+ for two) and took it back.</li>
            <li>However, since the seller is selling both this generic HX6013 and the generic HX7022, the seller is aware of the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The premise of this product is very simple: you detach your old brush head, and insert the new one.</li>
            <li>The new one goes on easily and may seem a little loose</li>
            <li>The first person holds the center metal piece with a pair of pliers.  </li>
            <li>I could probably superglue the new head on the rod, but then I&#x27;d run into the same problem in three months when I had to disassemble it to replace the head again.    </li>
            <li>The biggest unknown is how much force to use when removing the old brush and shaft from the existing unit.</li>
            <li>no other models listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>This has happened to the first two, so will throw out the other two.  </li>
            <li>You simply pull the actual head part off the old brush and push one of these new ones on.</li>
            <li>I did it barehanded, but I&#x27;m not afraid of a little heat.</li>
            <li>Some have had success with a little work</li>
            <li>thing that kind of got me is that I thought the section below the green ring was hard, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, take the head off of your Sonicare... following so far?</li>
            <li>Current reviews are instructing me to use brute force to remove the old brush head from the assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swindled.</li>
            <li>I opened the package to remove a brush head to replace the old one, so I am stuck with an item I cannot use, since only unopened packages can be returned.</li>
            <li>Also, I got the 4 pack as advertised so apparently that problem has been corrected.</li>
            <li>(I actually do it bare handed.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>different shape, bristles do not cleans as well, must use vice grip to get old brush off&lt;br /&gt;works</li>
            <li>the new head is not exactly the same as the old one</li>
            <li>You must already have at least one full replacement unit with a worn out brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rarely have I seen something so humble perform so well!</li>
            <li>So, I was kind of confused due to the 5 star posts explaining how they got the head off the post.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I thank the wonderful reviewers who gave instructions on how to replace these things onto my 7022 brush head.  </li>
            <li> For the cost of this purchase (including shipping), this was an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> it is the best</li>
            <li> Awesome deal!  </li>
            <li> As best I can tell, the mechanism is friction.</li>
            <li> Until they wake up, this is the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a great alternative!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality of this product is very good.  </li>
            <li> Not I have to throw away perfectly good stuff just like cell phone chargers and accessories, Ugh!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be a great saving if I could somehow use the brushes.</li>
            <li> ..works great</li>
            <li> These are a great deal.  </li>
            <li> For the price, still a great buy compared to Philips brand.  </li>
            <li> These seem to be a great alternative to the pricey Sonicare head units -- if you can get one installed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great brush heads.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the ones made by Phillips.</li>

            <li> Took a bit of pulling to get the original one off, but the replacements fit perfect</li>
            <li> At that price I might aswell have just bought the OEM replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy having a great smile!</li>
            <li> THis works perfect, just got to use pliers to remove the old brush head</li>
            <li> Sonicaire brush seems to be a perfect pitch device and sings at exactly 440Hz, Middle A to Musicians, perfect for tuning things : )</li>
            <li> Perfect for my smile and got it quickly.</li>
            <li> Good price for these items, I checked other sites and Amazon had the best price of all of them that I searched.</li>
            <li> there are MANY others on Amazon (and in box stores) to choose from</li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrush heads trying to save money and they didn&#x27;t even fit the toothbrush that was advertised!</li>
            <li> , you would think what most of us in fact need to replace.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> These are just okay.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be 100% sure that it&#x27;s working as the toothbrush was designed because the profile is different.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure yours is the &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; series.</li>
            <li> better plaque removal versus a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I would urge users who had issues with the installation, to try it one more time.</li>
            <li> buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical when ordering but pleased when I tried them.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it off with some pliers and did not need to boil it in water to do so.</li>
            <li> I was able to jam this one on .</li>
            <li> The savings on brushes are significant!</li>
            <li> Product appears to perform better than the original brush head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was finally able to remove my original brush head, but bent the bar in the process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to remove the original heads from my brushes using two pairs of pliers.</li>
            <li> This is easily done by sticking the magnets to something metal like a tool or an iron knife to keep your hand away from the boiling water.</li>
            <li> Installation is easy with pliers, but there are some problems with the heads themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is easily done by sticking the magnets to something metal like a tool or an iron knife to keep your hand away from the boiling water.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, replacing the heads becomes quite easy</li>
            <li> and I find the bristles to be fine.</li>
            <li> The brushes work fine and of course are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I feel like a huge chump.</li>
            <li> These are great, and simple to install.</li>
            <li> The potential savings were so great that I decided to give them a try</li>
            <li> the listing had said HX6013 and the description had said something to the tune of, &amp;#34;Can be made to fit atop the HX7022 replacement head with tools and effort,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This replacement brush head fit on the bar, but the pulsation was off because the brush head did not sit</li>
            <li> When my official Philips E-series head ran out, I pulled the brush off and replaced it with one of these, in hopes it would be a cheap replacement.  </li>
            <li> As someone else has suggested here, sticking the old brush in boiling water seems like a good approach.</li>
            <li> and you are ready to brush again!!!</li>
            <li> However, I am no5t inclined to boil my original nor do I have brute force to pull these babies apart.  </li>
            <li> It takes some effort to remove the original brush head, but it can be done.</li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Well worth the effort!</li>
            <li> Need pliers to remove original brush head???</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any problems removing the original brush heads from my worn out Sonicare heads.  </li>
            <li> Green being his favorite color also doesn&#x27;t hurt :) Good stocking stuffers when Christmas comes out.</li>
            <li> I took a chance in this to save money and after using some tools to pry off the original head (I couldn&#x27;t do it with my hands alone)</li>
            <li> These generic replacements look nearly identical, and function perfectly.</li>
            <li> He has an issue with bristles always being too hard and hurting his gums, but he says these are perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, you must understand that these are not the full Sonic replacement units that just screw onto the handle.</li>
            <li> but at this price it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> would encourage every user out there to consider this product, not only for its agreeable price, but because they are a soundly efficient, ecological and cost effective alternative to an otherwise pricey and wasteful option.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works with no problems and at a fraction of the cost of the full heads from Sonic.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush fit just right.</li>
            <li> The price is very good, but I&#x27;m just not sure that having to worry about the head coming off all the time justifies the savings.  </li>
            <li> The new brush slips on easily and holds securely.</li>
            <li> The bristles are robust, perhaps even more than the ones peddled by the original manufacturer, and it essentially replicates the performance of the original at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There was no way I could remove the top section of the Eseries brush from my old brush to replace with one of these.</li>
            <li> We throw far too many things away these days.</li>
            <li> Immerse the head to the bottom of the brush unit right where the colored ring is.</li>
            <li> It will slip right off after it is softened.</li>
            <li> contacted the company &amp; they &#x27;promised&#x27; to send right product</li>
            <li> Immerse the head to the bottom of the brush unit right where the colored ring is.</li>
            <li> It will slip right off after it is softened.</li>
            <li> The brush head comes right off.</li>
            <li> Before you order this, first be sure you can remove the old brush end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true that taking the old head off the first time isn&#x27;t easy</li>
            <li> Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy all this was to accomplish.</li>
            <li> far as installing and removing them, is easy if you heat the end with a blow dryer for about 10-20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Remove the threaded nut portion first.</li>
            <li> Anybody who couldn&#x27;t figure this out is pretty dense if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That picture is exactly what you get-&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, they don&#x27;t fit the old brush cover well.  </li>
            <li> Make certain that the bristles are pointing in the right direction in relation to the power button.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these as the quality and price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i was able to remove only the brush portion and replace with this</li>
            <li> First, I could not remove mine with pliers</li>
            <li> Remove the threaded nut portion first.</li>
            <li> ; I would have given this a higher rating.</li>
            <li> First, the E-series head isn&#x27;t meant to be disassembled in the way required to make this replacement work.</li>
            <li> It does require a bit of strength, and perhaps a pair of pliers the first time...</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this sensible solution!</li>
            <li> at first I did not think I could , then with BRUTE force and channel locks</li>
            <li> But I tried to pull out the brush head from the assembly and found it is not difficult if two persons are engaged.  </li>
            <li> It would have gotten four star, but my only criticism is that when you put the original plastic toothbrush cover over it while traveling, sometimes it pushes the brush through the original head attachment.</li>
            <li> It was stuck pretty good but following the advice of placing it in boiling water for several seconds made it come right off.  </li>
            <li> I am a fairly strong man who&#x27;s opened many recalcitrant pickle jar lids without a problem, but the brush top would not come off no matter how I twisted and turned and pulled, even with 2 large pliers.</li>
            <li> this is it , it is exactly like the real ones</li>
            <li> Look at ebay first before paying this much.</li>
            <li> easy pulled old brush off ,put new one on .done ..</li>
            <li> The new one slides right on without any heating or anything&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new one slides right on without any heating or anything.</li>
            <li> Great product: works as wells as the name-brand Phillips full-head rip-off, much cheaper -- and no problem to attach.</li>
            <li> been buying whole heads for years .now</li>
            <li> with that said I won&#x60;t be buying the whole head again .</li>
            <li> u don&#x27;t really need to replace.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses Sonicare and he always requests I buy him these ones.</li>
            <li> In the end, I tossed the remaining three heads and bought some real Philips E-series heads.</li>
            <li> I spent an hour or more trying to figure out the mechanism that holds the brush to the head.</li>
            <li> The head comes off much easier once you have removed it once.</li>
            <li> but SO much cheaper.</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare toothbrushes, but when they die and need to be replaced your old charger isn&#x27;t compatible and neither are your extra toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> For some reason the shape of the bristles is more exaggerated on these replacements, but I think I kind of like that.</li>
            <li> Most brush head replacements cost twice as much because you are paying for brush tips and other parts of the tooth brush</li>
            <li> Since I had already successfully removed the original head from the base attaching this one was easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, these aren&#x27;t the same profile as the original heads that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of the brush seems the same as the original.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is slightly different than the original, maybe a tad softer but not objectionable to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These seem to be a little stiffer bristles than the original Sonicare brushes, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> Do note that you are only getting what is shown in the picture, not the full brush head.</li>
            <li> stated in another review, to remove the old head, I just immersed the head in hot water and it slipped off no problem.</li>
            <li> So maybe do this ONCE then get a whole new head</li>
            <li> TOP half of the head, the brush, which is</li>
            <li> I didnt thjnk i could use this on my older e series version...</li>
            <li> The old brush head slips right off with no brute force required if you soak the old head in boiling water for one minute.</li>
            <li> I made sure the head was on correctly and was tight.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Brush action same as the original</li>
            <li> Sure there is a little bit of effort involved, but nothing my mum couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> totally worth the extra step of having to remove the head from midway point of the assembly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to replace and longer lasting bristles than generic ones found at Wally.</li>
            <li> the new one comes off without a problem.</li>
            <li> I am using a travel cover for the new head with no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new brushes go off and on easier.</li>
            <li> bristles feel like they&#x27;re about the same stiffness as the original bristles and they have similar coloring.  </li>
            <li> Wow, that&#x27;s a home run!</li>
            <li> Seriously, these are worth the jack, unless of course you enjoy the dentist. .</li>
            <li> In addition, the bristles of these replacement heads didn&#x27;t feel as stiff as the original, which implies to me that they&#x27;re not cleaning away as much plaque.    </li>
            <li> If I have to I will buy a couple of new full heads when my current one fails but for now I am loving the lower cost replacement.</li>
            <li> No idea if they will last as long, but even if they only last a quarter as long it will still be a great deal.</li>
            <li> And since you are only replacing the top part it is less wasteful.</li>
            <li> ONLY REPLACE THE TOP HALF and $ave More!&lt;br /&gt;Ordering for Christmas?</li>
            <li> In this case, I&#x27;m willing to pay more to ensure my teeth are being brushed properly, and to save myself the annoyance of ripping these heads apart every few months.</li>
            <li> use the blade of a knife or screw driver to lift the old head out ut of the boiling water by the magnet end.</li>
            <li> I used needle nose pliers to pop the old heads off without issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The second time should be much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then went as far as attempting to widen the hole with a drill but no luck.</li>
            <li> Good quality so far, works just like the ridiculously expensive Philips refills.</li>
            <li> Please, let me clarify how to do this so that even the most... slow of individuals can understand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will squish the soft part down, but that&#x27;s fine since the new head is a tiny bit shorter than the original.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So press hard down when your putting on the new head so that you know the connection is good and it wont fall off when you using it.</li>
            <li> I straightened it, stuck the new head on there, and brushed as normal.</li>
            <li> It took several long minutes with pliers to finally rip the old head free, and in doing</li>
            <li> I first tried a generic replacement head from Walmart ($17+ for two) and took it back.</li>
            <li> However, since the seller is selling both this generic HX6013 and the generic HX7022, the seller is aware of the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The premise of this product is very simple: you detach your old brush head, and insert the new one.</li>
            <li> The new one goes on easily and may seem a little loose</li>
            <li> The first person holds the center metal piece with a pair of pliers.  </li>
            <li> I could probably superglue the new head on the rod, but then I&#x27;d run into the same problem in three months when I had to disassemble it to replace the head again.    </li>
            <li> The biggest unknown is how much force to use when removing the old brush and shaft from the existing unit.</li>
            <li> no other models listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> This has happened to the first two, so will throw out the other two.  </li>
            <li> You simply pull the actual head part off the old brush and push one of these new ones on.</li>
            <li> I did it barehanded, but I&#x27;m not afraid of a little heat.</li>
            <li> Some have had success with a little work</li>
            <li> thing that kind of got me is that I thought the section below the green ring was hard, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, take the head off of your Sonicare... following so far?</li>
            <li> Current reviews are instructing me to use brute force to remove the old brush head from the assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swindled.</li>
            <li> I opened the package to remove a brush head to replace the old one, so I am stuck with an item I cannot use, since only unopened packages can be returned.</li>
            <li> Also, I got the 4 pack as advertised so apparently that problem has been corrected.</li>
            <li> (I actually do it bare handed.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> different shape, bristles do not cleans as well, must use vice grip to get old brush off&lt;br /&gt;works</li>
            <li> the new head is not exactly the same as the old one</li>
            <li> You must already have at least one full replacement unit with a worn out brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rarely have I seen something so humble perform so well!</li>
            <li> So, I was kind of confused due to the 5 star posts explaining how they got the head off the post.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad; it&#x27;s not good, it&#x27;s just different.</li>
            <li> So apparently I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li> a pan of water deep enough to immerse the old head while holding it brush end down and attachment end up out of the water.</li>
            <li> So I boiled a pan of water deep enough to immerse the old head while holding it brush end down and attachment end up out of the water.</li>
            <li> Because the reviews said it was hard to get the old brush off, I tested before ordering the new ones.</li>
            <li> a monkey could probably do it faster than a human.</li>
            <li> a little so had to force the new head on.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t come down as far as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> Third, boil some water, high enough to try and just get the end of the connection of the head wet which is usually a green ring in my case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, push the new brush down on the metal stick, being careful to position the bristles on the same side as the on-off</li>
            <li> I noticed that, after a few brushings, the vibration caused the new head to begin working its way off the metal rod.</li>
            <li> These generic for HX6013 brush heads are similar to the upper half of the HX7022, and the process of breaking off the brush part of the replacement head was not intended by, and is not supported by, Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> you do not want to replace the entire brush head because you find it too costly, get one of Philips Sonicare&#x27;s other electric toothbrushes that actually do take</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t work, you can use a wire cutter or something to cut through the plastic maybe a half inch back and try to pull off the big piece that&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> only negative is that the old head cover is a little too small for the new head and if you press it on the whole thing will come off when you try to remove the cover.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate - the genuine Eseries heads are quite over-priced, but I have yet to find a satisfactory replacement...</li>
            <li> These should not be purchased, this was a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not completely turned away either.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for these brushes for a long time.</li>
            <li> was a bit skeptical about this product, but was pleasantly surprised to discover that it works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Since the Sonicare works on small vibrations, the heads not only continuously worked their way off, but when they were properly in place they vibrated on the bar and, therefore, did not vibrate fully in the actual head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (which i suspect is the reason behind many of the negative reviews)</li>
            <li> I received two generic brush heads in plain white boxes, even though the listing is for a 4 pack.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how other reviewers have had such hard times removing the old Sonicare heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These four brushes cost less than ten dollars.</li>
            <li> Fourth, once it&#x27;s boiling, place the head brush side down into the water, keeping only the end of the green ring saturated and finding a way to not burn your hands in the meanwhile.</li>
            <li> every other renew?&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise: The brushes seem well-made and resilient and led me to think about simply drilling out the shaft of a small had toothbrush next time....</li>
            <li> Overall, if you want to do a little work you can save a lot of money over the life of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It physically goes on over the bristles and it works, but when you pull it off, the head comes off with it because the fit at the base isn&#x27;t providing enough force.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a lot harder to replace than the Phillips.  </li>
            <li> We have enough waste in our landfills already.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re careful using a pair of diagonal cutters you can slowly cut away the old head until it comes off.  </li>
            <li> I guess it works but not exactly how I expected, and yes the old head is very hard to get off initially.</li>
            <li> You push back the rubber gasket, grab the flat metal stick with pliers and pull really hard on the plastic brush.</li>
            <li> Fifth, place the replacement head on the metal rod the way the other one was and your done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> will be looking for refund of difference due to deception &amp; mistake made of details of item, your ad stated $2.99 per 4 pack($0.75 / Item), when i was charged $2.99 per brush , so please refund me the difference which is $40.53,&lt;br /&gt;truly pissed &amp; not happy,&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They arrived on time, and as stated in other reviews there were no instructions.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had not thrown away all of my other bases through the years.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the head off with pliers however the long metal bar that attaches the head to the base does not fit into the replacement head.</li>
            <li> First, it is idiotic for Philips to make you replace the entire head and not just the brushes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the $.</li>
            <li> At $2.50 per unit, it&#x27;s about half the price of the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; head.</li>
            <li> I suspect the un replaced magnets in the lowoer half of the head</li>
            <li> it took me less than 1 minute .very</li>
            <li> so I bent the metal rod slightly.    </li>
            <li> but this is bound to affect reliability and performance and does leave an ikky mess</li>
            <li> Now you can see that the metal stick has bumps to help hold it tightly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, can&#x27;t separate brush so these are useless- completely!!</li>
            <li> I reasoned that I had little or nothing to lose</li>
            <li> Yes, it does take a little effort and strength that some may not possess.  </li>
            <li> Then pull off the little piece.</li>
            <li> Not worth the bargain price!</li>
            <li> used vice grips to  yank the old brush portion off the above-mentioned base with its serrated retaining shaft, so I got a new</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using a pair of pliers, I gripped the shaft of the worn brush and firmly pulled it off of the ribbed metal rod on which it is mounted.</li>
            <li> You have to use a few wrenches to pull them off, and even then, you run the risk of bending the bar that holds them</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It seems a waste that Sonic didn&#x27;t plan for something like this from the get go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the actual base will last as I assume that eventually it will wear down, but I am sure you can get 6-12 months from the base at least maybe longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say, take it out and immediately grip the base of the brush head (right above the green ring and pry the sucker off.</li>
            <li> less brushing pwer&lt;br /&gt;Also!</li>
            <li> The original Sonicare brush heads are not designed to come off their base.</li>
            <li> First, push down the brush head while holding the dome-like cover to disengage the two and expose the three vertical metal pieces at the base.  </li>
            <li> Using my hand I forced the replacement brush shaft onto the metal rod with firm, even pressure.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I know how.</li>
            <li> -- they did not - -sent same wrong product</li>
            <li> Go green and buy these babies!</li>
            <li> I usually check the reviews when making purchases online</li>
            <li> Since getting the Sonicare E series for my son and I, our tooth problems, cavities, plaque and other issues have been decreased by 90%.</li>
            <li> I seriously hope there is less negative reviews.</li>
            <li> as passable, but will get the real deal next time and spend the outrageous amount of money</li>
            <li> Mine had failed, so now water easily gets into the base of the head (NOT into the electronic mind you)</li>
            <li> to people that says its hard to change</li>
            <li> but I did have to pull hard.</li>
            <li> Then, after taking it off you will see how the sucker works.</li>
            <li> I was leery of these replacement brushes because of the negative comments regarding installation difficulties.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem to all release at the same time in your mouth and that is a gagging unpleasant experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously that&#x27;s all it takes.  </li>
            <li> I cannot simply take off the head of my Sonic toothbrush, I need the base as well to screw on and off.</li>
            <li> After unnecessarily removing screws I read the reviews to see if anyone else had issues.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had no luck, and am so annoyed I&#x27;ve given up.</li>
            <li> Terrible, no instructions on how to remove the old head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others have commented on how difficult it was for them to remove the existing brush from the &amp;#34;shoulder&amp;#34; and then install the replacement brush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t end up working out.    </li>
            <li> This is an electrical device, and it could pose dangerous in the name of saving</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> Without the use of some power tools, these are impossible to install.</li>
            <li> (does that make me a bad parent?)</li>
            <li> there is a rubber sealing gasket between the brush shaft and the screw in base-</li>
            <li> /&gt; inside the screw portion of the base over time.</li>
            <li> The base has a metal rod that sticks up into the brush part, and appears to be glued in place.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are just that however Phillips did not design their heads to be removed from its base which twists to its rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I opted to see if I could get the existing head off the base before ordering these.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I feel like an idiot for not buying these from the start.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying the insane price for replacement Sonicare brushes for almost a decade.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good quality so far, works just like the ridiculously expensive Philips refills. Mine came as the entire head, not just the brush, BONUS!</li>
            <li> These are great, and simple to install. Sure there is a little bit of effort involved, but nothing my mum couldn&#x27;t handle. You don&#x27;t need pliers. You don&#x27;t need power tools. You just have to employ this cunning strategy: push to go on, pull to come off, never EVER twist - it does not screw on or off. (which i suspect is the reason behind many of the negative reviews)</li>
            <li> Perfect for my smile and got it quickly.</li>
            <li> I am irritated.  I thank the wonderful reviewers who gave instructions on how to replace these things onto my 7022 brush head.  However, I am no5t inclined to boil my original nor do I have brute force to pull these babies apart.  I think these are mislabeled.  As a matter of fact, my package states it is compatible with HX7004...no other models listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself time &amp; frustration.  Dont buy these .... there are MANY others on Amazon (and in box stores) to choose from</li>
            <li> For the cost of this purchase (including shipping), this was an excellent purchase. Product appears to perform better than the original brush head. It takes some effort to remove the original brush head, but it can be done. Many thanks!</li>
            <li> this is it , it is exactly like the real ones no reason to throw out money buy this one instead it is the best ,it makes me feel all tingly inside</li>
            <li> THis works perfect, just got to use pliers to remove the old brush head and you are ready to brush again!!! Do it twice a day by the way, 2 minutes runs!</li>
            <li> i followed john&#x27;s suggestion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;boiled a pan of water deep enough to immerse the old head while holding it brush end down and attachment end up out of the water. Remove the threaded nut portion first. This is easily done by sticking the magnets to something metal like a tool or an iron knife to keep your hand away from the boiling water. Immerse the head to the bottom of the brush unit right where the colored ring is. Leave it there for a couple minutes, checking for softness by pushing the brush part against the pan until it is softened. Then take it out and immediately pull it off the metal spike with a pair of pliers. It will slip right off after it is softened. The new one slides right on without any heating or anything&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when it&#x27;s time to replace the head the new one comes off without a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrush heads trying to save money and they didn&#x27;t even fit the toothbrush that was advertised! Seller did accept return, so I&#x27;m giving him credit for that. These should not be purchased, this was a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> So, I was kind of confused due to the 5 star posts explaining how they got the head off the post. Please, let me clarify how to do this so that even the most... slow of individuals can understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, take the head off of your Sonicare... following so far? Second, take the locking ring (the flimsy piece of plastic that you turn once you slide it the head into your Sonicare) off by sliding it upward and off of the solid piece of the head. Third, boil some water, high enough to try and just get the end of the connection of the head wet which is usually a green ring in my case. Fourth, once it&#x27;s boiling, place the head brush side down into the water, keeping only the end of the green ring saturated and finding a way to not burn your hands in the meanwhile. I did it barehanded, but I&#x27;m not afraid of a little heat. After about 30 seconds I&#x27;d say, take it out and immediately grip the base of the brush head (right above the green ring and pry the sucker off. It took barely any force and I&#x27;ve probably been using this head too long. Then, after taking it off you will see how the sucker works. It&#x27;s only a metal rod that connects to the brush head. It&#x27;s so simple a monkey could probably do it faster than a human. Fifth, place the replacement head on the metal rod the way the other one was and your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that kind of got me is that I thought the section below the green ring was hard, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s soft. So press hard down when your putting on the new head so that you know the connection is good and it wont fall off when you using it. It will squish the soft part down, but that&#x27;s fine since the new head is a tiny bit shorter than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end... I seriously hope there is less negative reviews. Anybody who couldn&#x27;t figure this out is pretty dense if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the price, I paid 7.49 shipped and now it&#x27;s 12.99 from a different seller. Look at ebay first before paying this much. At that price I might aswell have just bought the OEM replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy having a great smile!</li>
            <li> At $2.50 per unit, it&#x27;s about half the price of the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; head. That picture is exactly what you get-&lt;br /&gt;The TOP half of the head, the brush, which is, you would think what most of us in fact need to replace.&lt;br /&gt;But read on.&lt;br /&gt;The costlier units INCLUDE the screw-in portion and the magnets taht cause the rapid cleaning oscillation.&lt;br /&gt;I used vice grips to  yank the old brush portion off the above-mentioned base with its serrated retaining shaft, so I got a new brush-&lt;br /&gt;But I suspect the un replaced magnets in the lowoer half of the head could  weaken with time &#x3D; less brushing pwer&lt;br /&gt;Also! there is a rubber sealing gasket between the brush shaft and the screw in base- Mine had failed, so now water easily gets into the base of the head (NOT into the electronic mind you) but this is bound to affect reliability and performance and does leave an ikky mess&lt;br /&gt; inside the screw portion of the base over time. So maybe do this ONCE then get a whole new head every other renew?&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise: The brushes seem well-made and resilient and led me to think about simply drilling out the shaft of a small had toothbrush next time....&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally:&lt;br /&gt;My Sonicaire brush seems to be a perfect pitch device and sings at exactly 440Hz, Middle A to Musicians, perfect for tuning things : )&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare toothbrushes, but when they die and need to be replaced your old charger isn&#x27;t compatible and neither are your extra toothbrushes. Why?! Not I have to throw away perfectly good stuff just like cell phone chargers and accessories, Ugh!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the ones made by Phillips.</li>
            <li> These are just okay.  Installation is easy with pliers, but there are some problems with the heads themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, they don&#x27;t fit the old brush cover well.  It physically goes on over the bristles and it works, but when you pull it off, the head comes off with it because the fit at the base isn&#x27;t providing enough force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, these aren&#x27;t the same profile as the original heads that came with the toothbrush.  They&#x27;re a bit... different.  That&#x27;s the only way I know how to put it.  It&#x27;s not bad; it&#x27;s not good, it&#x27;s just different. I can&#x27;t be 100% sure that it&#x27;s working as the toothbrush was designed because the profile is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles feel like they&#x27;re about the same stiffness as the original bristles and they have similar coloring.  Time will tell if they fade like the originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, will I buy them again?  It&#x27;s a definite maybe.  I&#x27;m not impressed but I&#x27;m not completely turned away either.  The price is very good, but I&#x27;m just not sure that having to worry about the head coming off all the time justifies the savings.  YMMV, of course.</li>
            <li> I was leery of these replacement brushes because of the negative comments regarding installation difficulties. The potential savings were so great that I decided to give them a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you must understand that these are not the full Sonic replacement units that just screw onto the handle. These are only the brushes and shafts. You must already have at least one full replacement unit with a worn out brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have commented on how difficult it was for them to remove the existing brush from the &amp;#34;shoulder&amp;#34; and then install the replacement brush. The biggest unknown is how much force to use when removing the old brush and shaft from the existing unit. I reasoned that I had little or nothing to lose so I forged ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a pair of pliers, I gripped the shaft of the worn brush and firmly pulled it off of the ribbed metal rod on which it is mounted. (I left the unit attached to the handle during the entire process.) Using my hand I forced the replacement brush shaft onto the metal rod with firm, even pressure. Make certain that the bristles are pointing in the right direction in relation to the power button. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy all this was to accomplish. The savings on brushes are significant! Well worth the effort!</li>
            <li> Works but... the new head is not exactly the same as the old one and it doesn&#x27;t come down as far as I would like it to. It would be easier to put a photo on here but I&#x27;m not sure I know how. I guess it works but not exactly how I expected, and yes the old head is very hard to get off initially.</li>
            <li> The old brush head slips right off with no brute force required if you soak the old head in boiling water for one minute. The new brush slips on easily and holds securely. use the blade of a knife or screw driver to lift the old head out ut of the boiling water by the magnet end.</li>
            <li> hi I bought these for sonicare bush .I never knew these were for sale been buying whole heads for years .now to people that says its hard to change .well it took me less than 1 minute .very easy pulled old brush off ,put new one on .done ..with that said I won&#x60;t be buying the whole head again .</li>
            <li> Great product: works as wells as the name-brand Phillips full-head rip-off, much cheaper -- and no problem to attach.</li>
            <li> Basically, I got 15 brush heads for 20, they should last my roommate and I awhile.  Most brush head replacements cost twice as much because you are paying for brush tips and other parts of the tooth brush u don&#x27;t really need to replace.  Sim</li>
            <li> Need pliers to remove original brush head??? Don&#x27;t waste your money, can&#x27;t separate brush so these are useless- completely!! I wish I could leave no stars!</li>
            <li> the bristles all come out after just 3-4 weeks of use.  This has happened to the first two, so will throw out the other two.  The bristles seem to all release at the same time in your mouth and that is a gagging unpleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as installing and removing them, is easy if you heat the end with a blow dryer for about 10-20 seconds.  If you heat the end it doesn&#x27;t heat the bristle side, so that didn&#x27;t cause the releasing problem.</li>
            <li> Terrible, no instructions on how to remove the old head. Current reviews are instructing me to use brute force to remove the old brush head from the assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swindled.</li>
            <li> No problems installing the replacement brushes and they function like the originals.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problems removing the original brush heads from my worn out Sonicare heads.  I used needle nose pliers to pop the old heads off without issue.  Yes, it does take a little effort and strength that some may not possess.  I don&#x27;t understand how other reviewers have had such hard times removing the old Sonicare heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of this product is very good.  These seem to be a little stiffer bristles than the original Sonicare brushes, but not bad.  The price versus the Sonicare branded brush heads seals the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these as the quality and price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> Good price for these items, I checked other sites and Amazon had the best price of all of them that I searched.</li>
            <li> Not the product I believed I ordered.  These were tips only---not the screw on mechanized brush required for my Eseries unit.</li>
            <li> I bought these brush heads for my son and he loves them. The whole family uses Sonicare and he always requests I buy him these ones. He has an issue with bristles always being too hard and hurting his gums, but he says these are perfect. Green being his favorite color also doesn&#x27;t hurt :) Good stocking stuffers when Christmas comes out. (does that make me a bad parent?)</li>
            <li> this product was NOT as advertised. Says it is replacement for E series toothbrush-- it is not!  contacted the company &amp; they &#x27;promised&#x27; to send right product -- they did not - -sent same wrong product second time. Now, just trying to money refunded. been trying to &#x27;fix&#x27; this for three weeks.</li>
            <li> There was no way I could remove the top section of the Eseries brush from my old brush to replace with one of these. I am a fairly strong man who&#x27;s opened many recalcitrant pickle jar lids without a problem, but the brush top would not come off no matter how I twisted and turned and pulled, even with 2 large pliers. I received 4 brush heads, and they looked good, but they are in no way&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;standard replacement&amp;#34; heads. I opened the package to remove a brush head to replace the old one, so I am stuck with an item I cannot use, since only unopened packages can be returned. Before you order this, first be sure you can remove the old brush end.&lt;br /&gt;It would be a great saving if I could somehow use the brushes. As a prior reviewer noted, there are no instructions included.</li>
            <li> I didnt thjnk i could use this on my older e series version...but i was able to remove only the brush portion and replace with this ..works great..saved me lots of money!!!</li>
            <li> Vibrates when using.  I made sure the head was on correctly and was tight.  I would not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Installed and work well. Took a bit of pulling to get the original one off, but the replacements fit perfect</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the big deal?  Grab a pair of pliers and pull the head off.  Seriously that&#x27;s all it takes.  No problem!  Awesome deal!  If you can tie your shoes you can install these heads.</li>
            <li> I first tried a generic replacement head from Walmart ($17+ for two) and took it back. It rattled and did not brush the way the Phillips heads did. Decided to try these. First, I could not remove mine with pliers and I am a retired mechanic. So I boiled a pan of water deep enough to immerse the old head while holding it brush end down and attachment end up out of the water. Remove the threaded nut portion first. This is easily done by sticking the magnets to something metal like a tool or an iron knife to keep your hand away from the boiling water. Immerse the head to the bottom of the brush unit right where the colored ring is. Leave it there for a couple minutes, checking for softness by pushing the brush part against the pan until it is softened. Then take it out and immediately pull it off the metal spike with a pair of pliers. It will slip right off after it is softened. The new one slides right on without any heating or anything. Brush action same as the original and I find the bristles to be fine. I am very happy Amazon is offering these economical replacement heads. Be sure yours is the &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; series.</li>
            <li> I took a chance in this to save money and after using some tools to pry off the original head (I couldn&#x27;t do it with my hands alone) it finally came off but I bent the metal post a little so had to force the new head on.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE NOT REPLACEMENT HEADS  (generic or otherwise) for Philips Sonicare Eseries/E Series toothbrushes, including HX7022. These are generic replacement heads for HX6013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HX7022 generic replacement head, which is also being sold by this seller, has two parts to it that are not meant to be separated. These generic for HX6013 brush heads are similar to the upper half of the HX7022, and the process of breaking off the brush part of the replacement head was not intended by, and is not supported by, Philips Sonicare. The HX6013 is not meant for Eseries toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware. One person reported, after taking the upper part of the replacement brush head off and replacing it with one of these brush heads, that the brush head came off in his mouth while he was brushing. This is an electrical device, and it could pose dangerous in the name of saving money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not want to replace the entire brush head because you find it too costly, get one of Philips Sonicare&#x27;s other electric toothbrushes that actually do take the HX6013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the listing had said HX6013 and the description had said something to the tune of, &amp;#34;Can be made to fit atop the HX7022 replacement head with tools and effort,&amp;#34; I would have given this a higher rating. However, since the seller is selling both this generic HX6013 and the generic HX7022, the seller is aware of the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you will actually receive is photographed at this link by an Amazon third-party seller:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Replacement-Sonicare-Toothbrush-Heads/dp/B00DJY3HLS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_8?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1406358307&amp;sr&#x3D;8-8&amp;keywords&#x3D;HX6013</li>
            <li> I will NEVER go back to a standard brush again. Since getting the Sonicare E series for my son and I, our tooth problems, cavities, plaque and other issues have been decreased by 90%. Seriously, these are worth the jack, unless of course you enjoy the dentist. .</li>
            <li> a lot harder to replace than the Phillips.  no instructions included. but at this price it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying the insane price for replacement Sonicare brushes for almost a decade. So much money wasted. I feel like a huge chump. These things are amazing. Do note that you are only getting what is shown in the picture, not the full brush head. You simply pull the actual head part off the old brush and push one of these new ones on. I had to use some pliers, but they came off easily enough with that. For some reason the shape of the bristles is more exaggerated on these replacements, but I think I kind of like that. No idea if they will last as long, but even if they only last a quarter as long it will still be a great deal. And since you are only replacing the top part it is less wasteful. Go green and buy these babies! Also, I got the 4 pack as advertised so apparently that problem has been corrected.</li>
            <li> These are a great deal.  You have to know how to replace them, but they are a steal at this price.</li>
            <li> will be looking for refund of difference due to deception &amp; mistake made of details of item, your ad stated $2.99 per 4 pack($0.75 / Item), when i was charged $2.99 per brush , so please refund me the difference which is $40.53,&lt;br /&gt;truly pissed &amp; not happy,&lt;br /&gt;tony velez&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Sonicare HX7022/ HX7023 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads (GENERIC), 4 Pack&lt;br /&gt;by PAZ Generix&lt;br /&gt;2 customer reviews&lt;br /&gt;Price: $2.99 ($0.75 / Item)&lt;br /&gt;Note: $4.50 shipping when purchased from ProDeals100.

            <li> I received two generic brush heads in plain white boxes, even though the listing is for a 4 pack.  For the price, still a great buy compared to Philips brand.  These generic replacements look nearly identical, and function perfectly.</li>
            <li> works great and cost effective</li>
            <li> Without the use of some power tools, these are impossible to install. The original Sonicare brush heads are not designed to come off their base. You have to use a few wrenches to pull them off, and even then, you run the risk of bending the bar that holds them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was finally able to remove my original brush head, but bent the bar in the process. This replacement brush head fit on the bar, but the pulsation was off because the brush head did not sit properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useless. Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I cannot simply take off the head of my Sonic toothbrush, I need the base as well to screw on and off. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> When my official Philips E-series head ran out, I pulled the brush off and replaced it with one of these, in hopes it would be a cheap replacement.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t end up working out.    First, the E-series head isn&#x27;t meant to be disassembled in the way required to make this replacement work. The base has a metal rod that sticks up into the brush part, and appears to be glued in place. It took several long minutes with pliers to finally rip the old head free, and in doing so I bent the metal rod slightly.    I straightened it, stuck the new head on there, and brushed as normal. I noticed that, after a few brushings, the vibration caused the new head to begin working its way off the metal rod. Meaning, the vibrations were not being properly transmitted from the motor to my teeth. I could probably superglue the new head on the rod, but then I&#x27;d run into the same problem in three months when I had to disassemble it to replace the head again.    In addition, the bristles of these replacement heads didn&#x27;t feel as stiff as the original, which implies to me that they&#x27;re not cleaning away as much plaque.    In the end, I tossed the remaining three heads and bought some real Philips E-series heads. In this case, I&#x27;m willing to pay more to ensure my teeth are being brushed properly, and to save myself the annoyance of ripping these heads apart every few months.</li>
            <li> These seem to be a great alternative to the pricey Sonicare head units -- if you can get one installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation trick is: brute force. I spent an hour or more trying to figure out the mechanism that holds the brush to the head. As best I can tell, the mechanism is friction. You push back the rubber gasket, grab the flat metal stick with pliers and pull really hard on the plastic brush. If that doesn&#x27;t work, you can use a wire cutter or something to cut through the plastic maybe a half inch back and try to pull off the big piece that&#x27;s left. Then pull off the little piece. Now you can see that the metal stick has bumps to help hold it tightly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, push the new brush down on the metal stick, being careful to position the bristles on the same side as the on-off button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time should be much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say all this because these brushes come with no directions or diagrams or clues of any kind as to how to install them.</li>
            <li> The premise of this product is very simple: you detach your old brush head, and insert the new one. It does require a bit of strength, and perhaps a pair of pliers the first time... but once you get the hang of it, replacing the heads becomes quite easy (I actually do it bare handed.)&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical about this product, but was pleasantly surprised to discover that it works exactly as advertised. Rarely have I seen something so humble perform so well! The bristles are robust, perhaps even more than the ones peddled by the original manufacturer, and it essentially replicates the performance of the original at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage every user out there to consider this product, not only for its agreeable price, but because they are a soundly efficient, ecological and cost effective alternative to an otherwise pricey and wasteful option.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I would urge users who had issues with the installation, to try it one more time. It does get easier when you know how!</li>
            <li> different shape, bristles do not cleans as well, must use vice grip to get old brush off&lt;br /&gt;works as passable, but will get the real deal next time and spend the outrageous amount of money</li>
            <li> Terrible! I broke my toothbrush attempting to attach these. Not worth the bargain price!</li>
            <li> Buying these heads is way cheaper than the brush assemblies from Phillips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that taking the old head off the first time isn&#x27;t easy but if you&#x27;re careful using a pair of diagonal cutters you can slowly cut away the old head until it comes off.  The new one goes on easily and may seem a little loose but I&#x27;ve been using it a week and it is staying in place.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the old head cover is a little too small for the new head and if you press it on the whole thing will come off when you try to remove the cover.  I am using a travel cover for the new head with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brush seems the same as the original.  Overall, if you want to do a little work you can save a lot of money over the life of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> These refills were not compatible with my &#x27;e&#x27; series toothbrush. Beware of your specific model because all &#x27;e&#x27; aren&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> I usually check the reviews when making purchases online and boy do I wish I read this one. However I thought with such a basic product there was no need to read reviews. WRONG! The replacement heads are just that however Phillips did not design their heads to be removed from its base which twists to its rechargeable battery. After unnecessarily removing screws I read the reviews to see if anyone else had issues. So apparently I&#x27;m not the only one. Some have had success with a little work but I&#x27;ve had no luck, and am so annoyed I&#x27;ve given up. I was able to get the head off with pliers however the long metal bar that attaches the head to the base does not fit into the replacement head. I then went as far as attempting to widen the hole with a drill but no luck. So unless you plan on gambling with whether you can use this product it&#x27;s not worth the $.</li>
            <li> Because the reviews said it was hard to get the old brush off, I tested before ordering the new ones. With pliers it did come off but I did have to pull hard. As someone else has suggested here, sticking the old brush in boiling water seems like a good approach. The new brushes go off and on easier. The brushes work fine and of course are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace and longer lasting bristles than generic ones found at Wally. I was sceptical when ordering but pleased when I tried them.</li>
            <li> First, it is idiotic for Philips to make you replace the entire head and not just the brushes. We have enough waste in our landfills already. Until they wake up, this is the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in another review, to remove the old head, I just immersed the head in hot water and it slipped off no problem. The replacement brush fit just right. Thanks for offering this sensible solution!</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews. I opted to see if I could get the existing head off the base before ordering these. I was able to get it off with some pliers and did not need to boil it in water to do so. I went ahead and ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on time, and as stated in other reviews there were no instructions. Since I had already successfully removed the original head from the base attaching this one was easy. The head comes off much easier once you have removed it once. The brush head is slightly different than the original, maybe a tad softer but not objectionable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works with no problems and at a fraction of the cost of the full heads from Sonic. If you hang on to all of your used bases that you may still have on hand these should work well. I don&#x27;t know how long the actual base will last as I assume that eventually it will wear down, but I am sure you can get 6-12 months from the base at least maybe longer. I just wish I had not thrown away all of my other bases through the years. If I have to I will buy a couple of new full heads when my current one fails but for now I am loving the lower cost replacement. It seems a waste that Sonic didn&#x27;t plan for something like this from the get go. We throw far too many things away these days.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these brushes for a long time. They save me a lot of money. Two replacement brushes from Phillps cost about 24.00 or so dollars . These four brushes cost less than ten dollars. That&#x27;s a savings of 38.00. Wow, that&#x27;s a home run!</li>
            <li> I ordered two packages of these brush heads, and only received one. After e-mailing the seller, I received a second set about a week later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to remove the original heads from my brushes using two pairs of pliers. However, the replacement brush heads would not properly grip on the remaining metal bar. Since the Sonicare works on small vibrations, the heads not only continuously worked their way off, but when they were properly in place they vibrated on the bar and, therefore, did not vibrate fully in the actual head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate - the genuine Eseries heads are quite over-priced, but I have yet to find a satisfactory replacement...</li>
            <li> Great brush heads. No problems swapping them out.</li>
            <li> I had to wrestle the head off the existing brush attachment . at first I did not think I could , then with BRUTE force and channel locks I was able to jam this one on . there are no instructions ....  all in all I wished I got the recommended head from Costco.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I feel like an idiot for not buying these from the start.  1/4 the price of official heads...totally worth the extra step of having to remove the head from midway point of the assembly.  It was stuck pretty good but following the advice of placing it in boiling water for several seconds made it come right off.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have not received the product yet. But I tried to pull out the brush head from the assembly and found it is not difficult if two persons are engaged.  First, push down the brush head while holding the dome-like cover to disengage the two and expose the three vertical metal pieces at the base.  The first person holds the center metal piece with a pair of pliers.  The second person holds the brush head with another pair of pliers.  Then the two pull the assembly toward opposite directions.  The brush head comes right off.</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the brand name but SO much cheaper. I will definitely be buying these again! It would have gotten four star, but my only criticism is that when you put the original plastic toothbrush cover over it while traveling, sometimes it pushes the brush through the original head attachment. Otherwise, a great alternative!</li>
            <li> They are not the correct size for Sonicare E-series. Unusable. Do not Buy!!!!</li>
