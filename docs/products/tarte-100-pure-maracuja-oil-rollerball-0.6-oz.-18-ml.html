            <li>The oil goes on smoothly and feels great too.</li>
            <li>and I liked everything about it...</li>
            <li>Good product, I hope they never change the formula, and if they ever do I hope it becomes better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good oil, but doesn&#x27;t absorb well, but I love all of tarte&#x27;s products and will probably buy it again, but don&#x27;t expect immediate or short term results, as your skin takes time to see any results with any product, but came quickly and was a good price, a tad cheaper than Sephora!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love Tarte&#x27;s Maracuja oil.  </li>
            <li>I tried twisting the top off, but that&#x27;s not happening.</li>
            <li>and I expect more from Tarte.</li>
            <li>I like this product and also like having it in an easy to travel with applicator.</li>
            <li>I love this oil for around the eye area, it really does hydrate the skin, soaks in nicely, I recommend this product to all ages and skin types.  </li>
            <li>The maracuja and argan oils out there are fantastic and won&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about this rollerball.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>Blends in quickly and no smell either which is an added plus with oils.</li>
            <li>The only thing I love more is having it in a convenient rollerball that I can stash in my makeup bag, my car, my purse wherever....</li>
            <li>I now use the Tarte maracuja oil as a facial oil and love it!  </li>
            <li>Feels very light on skin and makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li>how it felt, how well it absorbed, and how it smelled.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Nice to put on in the middle of the day</li>
            <li>I had this product before in a different container where it worked so much better.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, my face pretty much does not like oil added to it for any reason, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Also my forehead that has always felt oily on the surface but dry underneath is baby smooth!  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely keep buying the oil, but not this version.</li>
            <li>so I tried the maracuja oil instead and decided that it sinks in much better than the argan oil.  </li>
            <li>thanks to tarte owner, inventor and designer.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would appreciate it enough to spend the money on this, but I really like having it in my purse with no mess.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>love the rollerball because as I said they are convenient but you also don&#x27;t waste any product because you apply it directly to where you need it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely changed my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a dark spot that wouldn&#x27;t go away even with light treatment at a hundred dollars a pop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoothing, hydrating, and makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>It will probably never go away completely, but it&#x27;s manageable now</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a oil field some days, and dry other or in patches, I was even flaky in some areas, On top of it I was breaking out like a teenage boy not just during my period but all the time, no acne products were working or continuing to work...</li>
            <li>I also liked that the rollerball only put on a tiny bit of the oil rather than globbing it on thick.  </li>
            <li>I went to washing my face with a very mild soap and using this maracuja oil at least 2x</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, barely any oil comes out of this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry about it though, because it&#x27;s otherwise a nice oil, and it seems like it would be quite luxurious for those with non-oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried several types of oil on my face, even &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; oils that are supposed to help fight acne...and the ONLY oil my face will tolerate without breaking out, so far, is tea tree oil for its antibacterial properties.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes is rather dry and this product keeps it soft and shinny</li>

            <li> I have 40 year old oily skin and in the summer I don&#x27;t need any moisturizer at all (just my acne meds) and in the winter I need just a little bit of moisturizer to prevent peeling on my nose and eyebrows and chin.  </li>
            <li> Many people with oily skin are afraid to use oils, but they shouldn&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> It used to get really dry and with this stuff</li>
            <li> my skin never feels dry!</li>

            <li> I was really excited about a roller ball applicator of this, but unfortunately, this one smelled different than my larger bottle, and it was a little hard to get the rollerball to start.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However...as usual, my skin rebels against any outside oil.  </li>
            <li> It makes dark spots less dark and does not cause breaking up as advertised.</li>
            <li> My skin is even, its not overly moist dry, its brighter and no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I had been using Josie Maran argan oil as a facial moisturizer, but felt a little thick on my face</li>
            <li> My pores are even less visible.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of $20</li>
            <li> You gotta use this everyday because if you don&#x27;t you wont see the results.</li>
            <li> more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this oil because my girlfriend recommended it. Feels very light on skin and makes my face feel soft. I have replaced my night cream with this oil.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  Never thought I would be putting oil on my oily face, but it does seem to be doing the job.  Impressed</li>
            <li> I borrowed this from a friend but ended up giving it back.  I have 40 year old oily skin and in the summer I don&#x27;t need any moisturizer at all (just my acne meds) and in the winter I need just a little bit of moisturizer to prevent peeling on my nose and eyebrows and chin.  I tried this and I liked everything about it...how it felt, how well it absorbed, and how it smelled.  I also liked that the rollerball only put on a tiny bit of the oil rather than globbing it on thick.  However...as usual, my skin rebels against any outside oil.  I have tried several types of oil on my face, even &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; oils that are supposed to help fight acne...and the ONLY oil my face will tolerate without breaking out, so far, is tea tree oil for its antibacterial properties.  Otherwise, my face pretty much does not like oil added to it for any reason, and this is no exception.  I&#x27;m sorry about it though, because it&#x27;s otherwise a nice oil, and it seems like it would be quite luxurious for those with non-oily skin.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is rather dry and this product keeps it soft and shinny - I already bought two more to have in my purse and gym bag!  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like this product and also like having it in an easy to travel with applicator. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would appreciate it enough to spend the money on this, but I really like having it in my purse with no mess.</li>
            <li> I love Tarte&#x27;s Maracuja oil.  It&#x27;s smoothing, hydrating, and makes my skin feel so soft.  It&#x27;s also very light and not greasy.  Many people with oily skin are afraid to use oils, but they shouldn&#x27;t be.  The maracuja and argan oils out there are fantastic and won&#x27;t clog pores.  I was really excited about a roller ball applicator of this, but unfortunately, this one smelled different than my larger bottle, and it was a little hard to get the rollerball to start.  When I&#x27;m using this on my face, I don&#x27;t want to have to tug to get the rollerball to start.  I will absolutely keep buying the oil, but not this version.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about this rollerball.  I had been using Josie Maran argan oil as a facial moisturizer, but felt a little thick on my face so I tried the maracuja oil instead and decided that it sinks in much better than the argan oil.  I now use the Tarte maracuja oil as a facial oil and love it!  Love it so much I wanted something portable too, so when I saw this I had to have it in addition to the larger bottle..  this I can throw in my purse especially not when the weather is colder..</li>
            <li> massaging while moisturizing the skin, everything is great. thanks to tarte owner, inventor and designer. wonderful packaging but i personally prefer less of it to help environment</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, barely any oil comes out of this.  I tried twisting the top off, but that&#x27;s not happening. It was a waste of $20 and I expect more from Tarte.</li>
            <li> I woke up looking younger, and my skin felt smoother.  I have used this for about 6 months and have not had one breakout. Who doesn&#x27;t want that?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my pots smaller my skin look brighter! It&#x27;s completely changed my skin! It used to get really dry and with this stuff my skin never feels dry!</li>
            <li> It does work. It makes dark spots less dark and does not cause breaking up as advertised. You gotta use this everyday because if you don&#x27;t you wont see the results. My acne has lessen and that makes me happy. Good product, I hope they never change the formula, and if they ever do I hope it becomes better.</li>
            <li> Tarte has a winner with this. Although costly it can be used whenever necessary as the roller ball can target small areas rather than your whole face. The oil goes on smoothly and feels great too. Blends in quickly and no smell either which is an added plus with oils. Highly recommend this product. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 59 and have tried everything. NOTHING including Argon Oil (tried that too) compares to this. I&#x27;ve had a dark spot that wouldn&#x27;t go away even with light treatment at a hundred dollars a pop. After using this for a month the dark spot has lightened considerably. It will probably never go away completely, but it&#x27;s manageable now and I&#x27;m happy about that.  Also my forehead that has always felt oily on the surface but dry underneath is baby smooth!  People, including my dermatologist, have commented how beautiful my skin is. The roll on is great because I carry it with me to roll underneath my eyes and around my mouth to soften the lines.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this oil for around the eye area, it really does hydrate the skin, soaks in nicely, I recommend this product to all ages and skin types.  I have noticed a big difference in the way my skin looks around the eye area, softer, smoother.  Get your hands on this people!!</li>
            <li> I had this product before in a different container where it worked so much better. I actually stopped using it all together because the roller ball just doesn&#x27;t work I feel like I have no control over the product.</li>
            <li> Nice to put on in the middle of the day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good oil, but doesn&#x27;t absorb well, but I love all of tarte&#x27;s products and will probably buy it again, but don&#x27;t expect immediate or short term results, as your skin takes time to see any results with any product, but came quickly and was a good price, a tad cheaper than Sephora!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Tarte&#x27;s Maracuja oil then you are missing out BIG TIME!!! I love it!!! The only thing I love more is having it in a convenient rollerball that I can stash in my makeup bag, my car, my purse wherever....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does everything is says it will &amp; more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical. I had oily skin in my teens, combo skin in my 20&#x27;s and well ALL HELL BROKE LOSE in my 30&#x27;s which is when a friend suggested I try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a oil field some days, and dry other or in patches, I was even flaky in some areas, On top of it I was breaking out like a teenage boy not just during my period but all the time, no acne products were working or continuing to work... in fact it was making my skin feel worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.... I STOPPED IT ALL!!!! I went to washing my face with a very mild soap and using this maracuja oil at least 2x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week my skin was making a MASSIVE turn around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a month, I had the best skin of my life....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using soap, water, and this maracuja oil not for probably 9 months and the results have lasted. My skin is even, its not overly moist dry, its brighter and no more breakouts. My pores are even less visible. ITS FABULOUS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the rollerball because as I said they are convenient but you also don&#x27;t waste any product because you apply it directly to where you need it.</li>
