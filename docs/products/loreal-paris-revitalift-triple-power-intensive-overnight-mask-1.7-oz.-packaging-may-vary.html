            <li>Here&#x27;s my criteria for why I love it and bought it:&lt;br /&gt;Smell: okay, this does not, in my opinion, have the best smell.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product .</li>
            <li>Honestly, my face hasn&#x27;t felt this good in quite a while.  </li>

            <li>It has a very light, clean scent, which I find very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The difference in the texture of my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing</li>
            <li>in fact, Lancome products are so overwhelmingly scented that I just can&#x27;t wear them, even though they are good products.</li>
            <li>It is a soapy/fresh kind of smell</li>
            <li>Very nice - goes on smooth and</li>
            <li>It is like it is made with very cheap ingredients or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have found excellent products at such a good price.</li>
            <li>Waited two weeks and kept using it at night and now can tell for sure it works.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, but wish it were fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I love the L&#x27;Oreal products.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that about many skin care products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Most face products claim a difference in 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>On top of it all my skin is smother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it helped my skin look any better either.</li>
            <li>Or More?</li>
            <li>My skin looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>really haven&#x27;t noticed any remarkable changes as of yet..</li>
            <li>It goes on like silk, it has an absolutely lovely light scent from the botanical ingredients.</li>
            <li>Acts much like a mask - good on the neck and decolettage.</li>
            <li>These L&#x27;Oreal products do not have nearly as strong a scent as Lancome.</li>
            <li>The texture goes on very smoothly, absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>More of a nice, natural glow.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>But it goes on smoothly and feels like silk.  </li>
            <li>My face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum</li>
            <li>This is important to me, because I don&#x27;t like to mix scents; with the exception of my hair, everything else I use, including deodorants and bath wash, are unscented.  </li>
            <li>However, if I could give it 10 stars, I most certainly would!</li>
            <li>And the scent is very strong and very perfumy.</li>
            <li>is beyond me; it&#x27;s a rich cream, but not greasy by any means.  </li>
            <li>(Please be aware that many combination products contain retinol with AHA or hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich cream, but NOT a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has become soft and the pores are greatly reduced, making the look of my skin much firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li>However, if I could give it 10 stars, I most certainly would!the Triple Power Night Mask, I will update this review.  </li>
            <li>The extra chemicals aren&#x27;t good for your face anyway.</li>
            <li>In fact, I love the results so much, I have begun &amp;#34;cheating&amp;#34; and dabbing some on my crow&#x27;s feet and neck/jawline area in the morning, too.  </li>
            <li>A friend, who is a plastic surgeon in California, sent me a cream last year to try, which I really loved, however it is price prohibitive for me to replace.  </li>
            <li>My nightly routine is to cleanse, using a good facial cleanser (I use Olay Pro X cleanser) in the shower, followed by a retinol serum, then moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I sure if you find some residue, or stickiness, you&#x27;re using way too much.  </li>
            <li>Now I will begin to experiment with the full line.</li>
            <li>im expecting something better than this but its no different from cheap and non familiar brands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised to see this many &amp;#34;positives&amp;#34; here.</li>
            <li>This is such a smooth cream, and I feel it is doing a good job on 75 year old skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer to know precisely what goes on my face; it takes a whole 3 minutes longer at night to do these steps separately.  </li>
            <li>Have lots of sun damage and the Mask has smoothed out the rough spots and left my skin feeling wonderful</li>
            <li>My wrinkles soften and skin soft firm and glowing, I am impressed</li>
            <li>This is a nice extra moisturizing night cream,.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a few days, but every morning I wake up more in love!  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>After the very first night, my crow&#x27;s feet were nearly INVISIBLE and the skin on my neck looked smooth and not crepey at all.  </li>
            <li>Nice for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The scent was pretty strong &amp; can cause breakouts if have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The Efects aré evident.</li>
            <li>Love this product - I actually use it for a day cream!</li>
            <li>This product actually made my skin look better.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well without any harshness.</li>
            <li>When I first use it each time it is a stronger scent</li>
            <li>First:  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy and is nice for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The texture is a bit odd in the jar, kind of plastic-y.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened it, it was kind of dried out too</li>
            <li>i tried to use this on three different nights, the odor is really strong</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it a mask, nor does it &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightly scented, clean and not overwhelming</li>
            <li>stated in other reviews, the jar is very pretty and the cream does have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>and nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference really, doubt I&#x27;d get it again.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stand perfumed face cream.</li>
            <li>I am using Dr Jart&#x27;s overnight face mask even though it costs twice as much.</li>
            <li>and I have not noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin as much as in how it feels.</li>
            <li>Very greasy too.  </li>
            <li>however, I was VERY dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Fast and correct.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my skin still feels smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference overnight.</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smooth enough but also curdles up on my skin once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>(so much that I keep feeling it while writing this review).&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff, I&#x27;m telling everyone I know!</li>
            <li>My face only feels this good after a professional facial.</li>
            <li>This is a rich cream (although not overly so), so I doubt I would use this as a day cream, especially since it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF.  </li>
            <li>After 7 days, there was significant visual improvement.</li>
            <li>I simply like to smell clean.  </li>
            <li>Only used it for about a week but skin if very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and feels balanced for the first time since using the product that my friend sent to me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried virtually every high priced serums, creams, etc.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cream.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about the improvement, I decided to see if I could treat my facial scars and other significant skin blemishes.</li>
            <li>give me a  few more weeks.</li>
            <li>My normally oily t-zone is not oily.  </li>
            <li>It was surprising when I found that the sample was a game changer for me in just one use.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something new and chose this with the serum and eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for several months and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>am 50 (will be 51 in May), fine lines around eyes and some droopiness at the jawline, but no &#x27;major&#x27; or deep wrinkles (yet!).  </li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes were less, the under eye area not as noticeable, and my skin appeared smoother and firmer.  </li>
            <li>As winter begins early this year, I know that the humidity will drop to single digits quickly in the WV mountains.  </li>
            <li>However- don&#x27;t wear it during the daytime if you go outside because it does not contain sunscreen, and the active ingredients make your skin more sensitive to sunlight (as I found out when my face blotched in the sun).</li>
            <li>To be totally honest, this is the only thing I do not love about this product.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately for my own fault I have not been consistent in using this.</li>
            <li>Within five minutes, my skin looked firm, my fine lines were gone and my skin glowed.  </li>
            <li>I used a large pearl-sized amount for my entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 yrs old Asian and every year the texture of my skin gets more uneven, less smooth.  </li>
            <li>So far nothing is happening.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft in the morning</li>
            <li>My mother (age 59) just started using it and loves the way it feels so far.</li>
            <li>Even my sensitive skin does not react to it.  </li>
            <li>After applying the product..it would become cakey and I would literally touch or rub my face softly and the product would come off in my hands..</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even have to put on my old trusty Porefessional Primer either.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive, so lots of products do cause irritation or breakouts.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>But so far, no adverse affects from this product.  </li>
            <li>AHA or hyaluronic acid will deactivate retinol completely.)  </li>
            <li>After one night of using this product, my skin was fully hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>When I wake up, my skin feels slightly irritated and more dry and not as supple as I would expect.</li>
            <li>I have 2 small dry patches from the retinol; I dabbed an extra tiny bit on these patches, and I honestly can&#x27;t feel the patches anymore!</li>
            <li>I received a small sample in most recent issue of In Style.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old, blonde, and live at the beach.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh and relaxed even when I sleep less then 5 hours.</li>
            <li>It is thick but absorbs very quickly and does not give you a greasy look.</li>
            <li>This night lotion has a heavy smell, but it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked that I could get something so great at CVS.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit much for me but might be fine for the average person.&lt;br /&gt;Texture: thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin that I just can&#x27;t hydrate enough no matter how much water I drink.</li>
            <li>is very thick and rich...seems like most other high quality creams to me.</li>
            <li>This product feels a little tacky when first applied...</li>
            <li>I keep trying to find a good balance of moisturizer, plumping, de-sagging - and it&#x27;s nearly impossible.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a nice extra moisturizing night cream,.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days, but every morning I wake up more in love!  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> After the very first night, my crow&#x27;s feet were nearly INVISIBLE and the skin on my neck looked smooth and not crepey at all.  </li>
            <li> Nice for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The scent was pretty strong &amp; can cause breakouts if have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The Efects aré evident.</li>
            <li> Love this product - I actually use it for a day cream!</li>
            <li> This product actually made my skin look better.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well without any harshness.</li>
            <li> When I first use it each time it is a stronger scent</li>
            <li> First:  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy and is nice for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The texture is a bit odd in the jar, kind of plastic-y.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened it, it was kind of dried out too</li>
            <li> i tried to use this on three different nights, the odor is really strong</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it a mask, nor does it &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightly scented, clean and not overwhelming</li>
            <li> stated in other reviews, the jar is very pretty and the cream does have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> and nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference really, doubt I&#x27;d get it again.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t stand perfumed face cream.</li>
            <li> I am using Dr Jart&#x27;s overnight face mask even though it costs twice as much.</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin as much as in how it feels.</li>
            <li> Very greasy too.  </li>
            <li> however, I was VERY dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Fast and correct.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my skin still feels smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference overnight.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smooth enough but also curdles up on my skin once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> (so much that I keep feeling it while writing this review).&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff, I&#x27;m telling everyone I know!</li>
            <li> My face only feels this good after a professional facial.</li>
            <li> This is a rich cream (although not overly so), so I doubt I would use this as a day cream, especially since it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF.  </li>
            <li> After 7 days, there was significant visual improvement.</li>
            <li> I simply like to smell clean.  </li>
            <li> Only used it for about a week but skin if very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and feels balanced for the first time since using the product that my friend sent to me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried virtually every high priced serums, creams, etc.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about the improvement, I decided to see if I could treat my facial scars and other significant skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> give me a  few more weeks.</li>
            <li> My normally oily t-zone is not oily.  </li>
            <li> It was surprising when I found that the sample was a game changer for me in just one use.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something new and chose this with the serum and eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for several months and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> am 50 (will be 51 in May), fine lines around eyes and some droopiness at the jawline, but no &#x27;major&#x27; or deep wrinkles (yet!).  </li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes were less, the under eye area not as noticeable, and my skin appeared smoother and firmer.  </li>
            <li> As winter begins early this year, I know that the humidity will drop to single digits quickly in the WV mountains.  </li>
            <li> However- don&#x27;t wear it during the daytime if you go outside because it does not contain sunscreen, and the active ingredients make your skin more sensitive to sunlight (as I found out when my face blotched in the sun).</li>
            <li> To be totally honest, this is the only thing I do not love about this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for my own fault I have not been consistent in using this.</li>
            <li> Within five minutes, my skin looked firm, my fine lines were gone and my skin glowed.  </li>
            <li> I used a large pearl-sized amount for my entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 yrs old Asian and every year the texture of my skin gets more uneven, less smooth.  </li>
            <li> So far nothing is happening.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft in the morning</li>
            <li> My mother (age 59) just started using it and loves the way it feels so far.</li>
            <li> Even my sensitive skin does not react to it.  </li>
            <li> After applying the product..it would become cakey and I would literally touch or rub my face softly and the product would come off in my hands..</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even have to put on my old trusty Porefessional Primer either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive, so lots of products do cause irritation or breakouts.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> But so far, no adverse affects from this product.  </li>
            <li> AHA or hyaluronic acid will deactivate retinol completely.)  </li>
            <li> After one night of using this product, my skin was fully hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> When I wake up, my skin feels slightly irritated and more dry and not as supple as I would expect.</li>
            <li> I have 2 small dry patches from the retinol; I dabbed an extra tiny bit on these patches, and I honestly can&#x27;t feel the patches anymore!</li>
            <li> I received a small sample in most recent issue of In Style.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old, blonde, and live at the beach.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh and relaxed even when I sleep less then 5 hours.</li>
            <li> It is thick but absorbs very quickly and does not give you a greasy look.</li>
            <li> This night lotion has a heavy smell, but it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that I could get something so great at CVS.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit much for me but might be fine for the average person.&lt;br /&gt;Texture: thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that I just can&#x27;t hydrate enough no matter how much water I drink.</li>
            <li> is very thick and rich...seems like most other high quality creams to me.</li>
            <li> This product feels a little tacky when first applied...</li>
            <li> I keep trying to find a good balance of moisturizer, plumping, de-sagging - and it&#x27;s nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles or damage but my skin is very dry and dull due to the medications I have to take.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> So beyond skeptical of a cheap face cream, I slept with it on only half of my face to really assess whether or not it worked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the first time a couple of hours ago; I NEVER review a product without using it for at least a month or more&lt;</li>
            <li> Both the cleanser and the night cream is thick and rich so you only need a little less than a dime size amount.</li>
            <li> It is the fraction of the cost of other facial creams and works just as well.  </li>
            <li> I am using this with a 0.5mm derma roller and several other RevitaLift products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just enough that, if I smell my hands, I can smell the scent, but it&#x27;s not strong enough that it overwhelms me.  </li>
            <li> The amazing thing is that you see a crazy difference in just one night!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily, sensitive, and troubled skin; I&#x27;ve found as I hit my mid 50&#x27;s, that my skin is combination, with the oily t-zone and areas of dryness; however, I STILL breakout like a teenager if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li> Although I have always been careful with my skin, wearing sunscreen, hats, etc.,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, this product is a total waste of money and I will NEVER make the mistake of purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using this..</li>
            <li> so I will not show as a verified purchaser), and I used it every night until the jar was empty.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely smoother and softer after a few weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product on Facebook and since I was using Dermalogica and getting no positive results, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but overnight is a little too long to have it on my face</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have problems with moisturizers leaving my skin feeling tight after 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up I looked different than on a usual morning.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed, otherwise it can seem greasy.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m also extremely picky.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other creams and didn&#x27;t believe that any product could undo damage that I already had.</li>
            <li> I use other Revitalift products almost daily but am very disappointed in this latest one.</li>
            <li> The 2 small dry patches, caused by the retinol serum, are gone</li>
            <li> In the morning after using this product, you have a youthful glow, wrinkles and lines much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I would say that anyone who gave it anything but 5 stars did not do the half face test.  </li>
            <li> Because the texture is so thick a little goes a long way too.  </li>
            <li> I usually shy away from scented products on my face, since it&#x27;s very sensitive, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with this scent at all.  </li>
            <li> but when it&#x27;s on my face, it feels a little overpowering.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several other very expensive facial products (you know all the promises advertised on TV by entertainers ...</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and firm.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks I see a noticeable difference in my jawline, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> Noticed results after a few days.</li>
            <li> This turns into little balls of cream and comes off my face even after an hour or so of not touching it after applying.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to determine whether or not any face product unless you test it on only half your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and does dry into a mask</li>
            <li> I usually like L&#x27;Oreal products...</li>
            <li> and I usually use non-scented face products.  </li>
            <li> so heavier moisturizers are usually a no-no for me.  </li>
            <li> It smells like cold cream from back in the day.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy can also sometimes translate to sits on skin and feels and/or look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be too thick for me.</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, but does not &#x27;sit&#x27; on your face.</li>
            <li> Tonight, after using my retinol product, I used a VERY SMALL AMOUNT of the night mask.  </li>
            <li> I even use it when cold temps cause dry inside air.</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable too!!  </li>
            <li> im not happy..</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found over the years that even oily skin needs moisturizing after cleansing; the secret is to find a product that balances the moisture; otherwise your oily skin will over produce.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of things- expensive dept. store items, holistic all-organic oils, etc.</li>
            <li> I looked at the daytime version of this, but sadly, it also does not include sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperately seeking a replacement.  </li>
            <li> and none compare to this one with the exception of Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Acid which is very expensive.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Good face cream for the price. I boutght three of it. The Efects aré evident.</li>
            <li> Love this product - I actually use it for a day cream!</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t look 17 but I think I&#x27;m getting there!  Just kidding.  I do think it helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old, blonde, and live at the beach. Although I have always been careful with my skin, wearing sunscreen, hats, etc., so while I don&#x27;t have a lot of deep lines, the inevitable coarsening of my skin has occured. I have tried a lot of things- expensive dept. store items, holistic all-organic oils, etc. and nothing has really worked. Until I tried this. The difference in the texture of my skin is amazing. It has become soft and the pores are greatly reduced, making the look of my skin much firmer and smoother. It is thick but absorbs very quickly and does not give you a greasy look. More of a nice, natural glow. However- don&#x27;t wear it during the daytime if you go outside because it does not contain sunscreen, and the active ingredients make your skin more sensitive to sunlight (as I found out when my face blotched in the sun). I looked at the daytime version of this, but sadly, it also does not include sunscreen. So I am trying it with the revitalift anti-wrinkle + firming cream that has an SPF 18. Just got it yesterday so will see how they work together. But as a night cream- you simply cannot beat this product if you want your skin to look firmer and with an improved texture. As for the scent- I wish it were unscented. I think L&#x27;Oreal is owned by Lancome, and I have the very same issue with them- in fact, Lancome products are so overwhelmingly scented that I just can&#x27;t wear them, even though they are good products. These L&#x27;Oreal products do not have nearly as strong a scent as Lancome.</li>
            <li> This night lotion has a heavy smell, but it dissipates quickly.  It also has a jello-ish quality when you are trying to get it out of the jar, it bounces back a bit.  The good part is that it isnt too greasy or oily.  It does hydrate your face overnight, but no miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference really, doubt I&#x27;d get it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for several months and like it very much.  It is very creamy and is nice for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh and relaxed even when I sleep less then 5 hours. It is a miracle.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I didn&#x27;t see any results, and therefore moving on to something else. It may work for you.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something new and chose this with the serum and eye cream. I put it on as soon as I got home that afternoon and again before bed. When I woke up I looked different than on a usual morning. The fine lines around my eyes were less, the under eye area not as noticeable, and my skin appeared smoother and firmer.  In one night? I&#x27;m impressed. I also bought the day moisturizer and used it over the serum. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m as happy with that. Hours later and it&#x27;s pilling on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t stand perfumed face cream. Why do manufacturers think women want stinky creams? The extra chemicals aren&#x27;t good for your face anyway. It smells like cold cream from back in the day. It also beaded up on me, there were all kinds of strings and balls on my face. No, I won&#x27;t buy it again. I am using Dr Jart&#x27;s overnight face mask even though it costs twice as much. It goes on like silk, it has an absolutely lovely light scent from the botanical ingredients.</li>
            <li> Did not see any difference</li>
            <li> Have lots of sun damage and the Mask has smoothed out the rough spots and left my skin feeling wonderful</li>
            <li> I use L&#x27;Oreal products every day. I find this moisturizer the best .</li>
            <li> Do I need to wash my face the next morning? So far nothing is happening. Waited two weeks and kept using it at night and now can tell for sure it works. My wrinkles soften and skin soft firm and glowing, I am impressed</li>
            <li> Acts much like a mask - good on the neck and decolettage. Rolls off like a mask when used on face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and I have not noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin as much as in how it feels. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles or damage but my skin is very dry and dull due to the medications I have to take. My skin feels soft in the morning and I am noticing it stays that way longer into the day. I will probably continue to use it.  My mother (age 59) just started using it and loves the way it feels so far.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  It works overnight while you sleep.  Even my sensitive skin does not react to it.  The texture is a bit odd in the jar, kind of plastic-y.  But it goes on smoothly and feels like silk.  Only a small amount is needed, otherwise it can seem greasy.  Noticeable results in just a night or two.</li>
            <li> This turns into little balls of cream and comes off my face even after an hour or so of not touching it after applying.  Very greasy too.  It&#x27;s not for me.....</li>
            <li> im not happy..im expecting something better than this but its no different from cheap and non familiar brands</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and makes my skin feel marvelous.</li>
            <li> I usually like L&#x27;Oreal products...however, I was VERY dissatisfied with this product. I don&#x27;t understand why every time that I used this product..it would start to peel on my skin..I have never experienced this before. It is like it is made with very cheap ingredients or something. After applying the product..it would become cakey and I would literally touch or rub my face softly and the product would come off in my hands..talk about weird!!!&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this product is a total waste of money and I will NEVER make the mistake of purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and firm. I am very pleased with this product . I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Fast and correct.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over a couple months and my face is irritated, so I will not be using it again</li>
            <li> Getting to the end of the jar and saw no improvement. When I first opened it, it was kind of dried out too but thought maybe that was how it was suppose to be.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but wish it were fragrance free.  The scent was pretty strong &amp; can cause breakouts if have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love the L&#x27;Oreal products.  But this one left me with bags under my eyes, redness and it looked like I hadn&#x27;t slept in days.  Be careful when using this..it is not for me and I ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> This product actually made my skin look better.  I can&#x27;t say that about many skin care products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well without any harshness.</li>
            <li> This is such a smooth cream, and I feel it is doing a good job on 75 year old skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice extra moisturizing night cream,. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it a mask, nor does it &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;. Nice for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I received a small sample in most recent issue of In Style.  I am a product junkie.  That being said, I&#x27;m also extremely picky.  I don&#x27;t like anything too greasy, smelly or doesn&#x27;t deliver on its promise.  It was surprising when I found that the sample was a game changer for me in just one use.  Here&#x27;s my criteria for why I love it and bought it:&lt;br /&gt;Smell: okay, this does not, in my opinion, have the best smell.  It is a soapy/fresh kind of smell but when it&#x27;s on my face, it feels a little overpowering.  To be totally honest, this is the only thing I do not love about this product.  I decided not to give it four instead of five stars because everyone has different tolerance for smells.  I have a particularly sensitive olfactory center and I usually use non-scented face products.  The smell is a bit much for me but might be fine for the average person.&lt;br /&gt;Texture: thick and creamy.  This can be a mixed bag when it comes to facial products.  Thick and creamy can also sometimes translate to sits on skin and feels and/or look greasy.  The texture goes on very smoothly, absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin looking greasy.  I have extremely dry skin and have problems with moisturizers leaving my skin feeling tight after 30 minutes.  Not this one.  The next morning, my skin still feels smooth and moisturized.  Because the texture is so thick a little goes a long way too.  I used a large pearl-sized amount for my entire face and neck.  I like not having to slather on a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Product Promise: firmer skin, retoned skin, lessens wrinkles (awesome skin basically).  Yes and yes.  This is what actually convinced me to purchase the product.  Within five minutes, my skin looked firm, my fine lines were gone and my skin glowed.  I actually loved the way my skin looked and I didn&#x27;t even have to put on my old trusty Porefessional Primer either.  This was all after one use!  I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: this product is pretty awesome.  Even with the meh smell, I&#x27;m still going to use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent face cream.  It is the fraction of the cost of other facial creams and works just as well.  Try it!</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks I see a noticeable difference in my jawline, neck and chest. I am using this with a 0.5mm derma roller and several other RevitaLift products. I am very happy with the effectiveness of this product line.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference overnight. Unfortunately for my own fault I have not been consistent in using this. But when I need it I use it and the results are almost immediate.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Very nice - goes on smooth and my skin is definitely mor silky. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing</li>
            <li> So far I love it. Only used it for about a week but skin if very soft and smooth. I only use Loreal products</li>
            <li> Great product!  I even use it when cold temps cause dry inside air.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase. Love the product. Noticed results after a few days.</li>
            <li> I like this cream...is very thick and rich...seems like most other high quality creams to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suppose to be moisturizing and fill out contours and I&#x27;m just not seeing it. The cream goes on smooth enough but also curdles up on my skin once it&#x27;s on. When I wake up, my skin feels slightly irritated and more dry and not as supple as I would expect. I&#x27;m very surprised to see this many &amp;#34;positives&amp;#34; here. I use other Revitalift products almost daily but am very disappointed in this latest one. I keep trying to find a good balance of moisturizer, plumping, de-sagging - and it&#x27;s nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> I got a sample in a magazine which is the only reason I tried it.  I have tried virtually every high priced serums, creams, etc. and none compare to this one with the exception of Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Acid which is very expensive.  So beyond skeptical of a cheap face cream, I slept with it on only half of my face to really assess whether or not it worked.  The difference is night and day.  I am 49 yrs old Asian and every year the texture of my skin gets more uneven, less smooth.  In the morning after using this product, you have a youthful glow, wrinkles and lines much less noticeable.  I would say that anyone who gave it anything but 5 stars did not do the half face test.  It is difficult to determine whether or not any face product unless you test it on only half your face.  The amazing thing is that you see a crazy difference in just one night!  Most face products claim a difference in 8 weeks.  The price is unbelievable too!!  I even got this for my 70+ mother and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and I already have a glow to my complexion. Plus the frown lines that were deepening around the sides of my mouth appear fuller. On top of it all my skin is smother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in other reviews, the jar is very pretty and the cream does have a strong fragrance. I was concerned about the reviews that attacked the scent because I do not even wear cologne let alone have a &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34; facial cream but I did not find the scent overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several other very expensive facial products (you know all the promises advertised on TV by entertainers ... I won&#x27;t say the names but I&#x27;ve used them all) and none of them stand up to theis product. Both the cleanser and the night cream is thick and rich so you only need a little less than a dime size amount. Means it&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> I started using this on my boyfriends face.  It made such a difference even he noticed. all within 2-4 weeks or 1/2 the jar!!!!  When I first use it each time it is a stronger scent but it goes away.  I highly recommend this product.  Dont&#x27; know why they call it a mask though.</li>
            <li> I still have to wait. I received all the cremes &amp; serum the same time. which was only a week ago.&lt;br /&gt;So give me a  few more weeks. Jo Hayden</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than an expensive moisturizer. I bought a jar (from Walmart so I will not show as a verified purchaser), and I used it every night until the jar was empty. I see zero difference. It is a good moisturizer but that&#x27;s all it is. And the scent is very strong and very perfumy.</li>
            <li> I swear by the triple power mask at night and the moisturizer for daytime!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had a coupon. I found it to be too thick for me. I also didn&#x27;t like the smell. I didn&#x27;t think it helped my skin look any better either. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream.  It&#x27;s very thick and does dry into a mask but overnight is a little too long to have it on my face so I use it on Sunday mornings only.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in my face but it hasn&#x27;t done any harm either.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out! I&#x27;m sensitive, so lots of products do cause irritation or breakouts. I love the way my skin feels when I get up every morning!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the texture and lines in my face after 1 week. Will definitely purchase again. Use nightly.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine (was it Oprah? Or More? I don&#x27;t recall-), and they raved about it, so I tried it.  WOW.  After the very first night, my crow&#x27;s feet were nearly INVISIBLE and the skin on my neck looked smooth and not crepey at all.  I have only been using it for a few days, but every morning I wake up more in love!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 50 (will be 51 in May), fine lines around eyes and some droopiness at the jawline, but no &#x27;major&#x27; or deep wrinkles (yet!).  But I have a history of breakouts so heavier moisturizers are usually a no-no for me.  But so far, no adverse affects from this product.  In fact, I love the results so much, I have begun &amp;#34;cheating&amp;#34; and dabbing some on my crow&#x27;s feet and neck/jawline area in the morning, too.  But today I went and &#x27;splurged&#x27; on the day/night cream, so I will begin using that during the daytime instead.  If I continue to be impressed, I will invest in the eye cream, the serum and the SPF day lotion as well.  I&#x27;m so excited to have found excellent products at such a good price. YAY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER written a review after one use, but this night cream deserves a break from tradition.  I&#x27;ve always had oily, sensitive, and troubled skin; I&#x27;ve found as I hit my mid 50&#x27;s, that my skin is combination, with the oily t-zone and areas of dryness; however, I STILL breakout like a teenager if I&#x27;m not careful.  As winter begins early this year, I know that the humidity will drop to single digits quickly in the WV mountains.  A friend, who is a plastic surgeon in California, sent me a cream last year to try, which I really loved, however it is price prohibitive for me to replace.  I&#x27;ve been desperately seeking a replacement.  I think I&#x27;ve found it with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Revitalift triple Power Night Mask.  I&#x27;ve just returned from the local drug store with the cream in hand (I did not purchase it from amazon).  First:  The name is off-putting for someone like me, who has oily skin.  The name &amp;#34;Night Mask&amp;#34;, sounds like it&#x27;s something from the movie, &amp;#34;Mommie Dearest&amp;#34;, which depicted Joan Crawford with a white mask all over her face.  It&#x27;s NOT greasy at all, and why they call it a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; is beyond me; it&#x27;s a rich cream, but not greasy by any means.  My nightly routine is to cleanse, using a good facial cleanser (I use Olay Pro X cleanser) in the shower, followed by a retinol serum, then moisturizer.  As a biochemist, I NEVER use combination products (such as a moisturizer with retinol).  I prefer to know precisely what goes on my face; it takes a whole 3 minutes longer at night to do these steps separately.  (Please be aware that many combination products contain retinol with AHA or hyaluronic acid.  DO NOT use a  product containing a combination of ingredients.  AHA or hyaluronic acid will deactivate retinol completely.)  Tonight, after using my retinol product, I used a VERY SMALL AMOUNT of the night mask.  It penetrated immediately, with NO residue.  I have 2 small dry patches from the retinol; I dabbed an extra tiny bit on these patches, and I honestly can&#x27;t feel the patches anymore! My skin is soft and feels balanced for the first time since using the product that my friend sent to me.  My normally oily t-zone is not oily.  I&#x27;ve found over the years that even oily skin needs moisturizing after cleansing; the secret is to find a product that balances the moisture; otherwise your oily skin will over produce.  I sure if you find some residue, or stickiness, you&#x27;re using way too much.  My face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum (well, almost!).  Honestly, my face hasn&#x27;t felt this good in quite a while.  This is a rich cream (although not overly so), so I doubt I would use this as a day cream, especially since it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF.  However, it&#x27;s not formulated to be a day cream.  It has a very light, clean scent, which I find very pleasant.  I usually shy away from scented products on my face, since it&#x27;s very sensitive, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with this scent at all.  It&#x27;s just enough that, if I smell my hands, I can smell the scent, but it&#x27;s not strong enough that it overwhelms me.  This is important to me, because I don&#x27;t like to mix scents; with the exception of my hair, everything else I use, including deodorants and bath wash, are unscented.  I simply like to smell clean.  So to sum it up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s a rich cream, but NOT a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It penetrates immediately, leaving no residue; it is NOT GREASY.  If you feel a residue, you&#x27;ve used way too much.&lt;br /&gt;3.  My troubled, sensitive, combination skin feels balanced and smooth (so much that I keep feeling it while writing this review).&lt;br /&gt;4.  This is a NIGHT cream, not a day cream; there is NO SPF&lt;br /&gt;5.  It&#x27;s very lightly scented, clean and not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;6.  I&#x27;ve used it for the first time a couple of hours ago; I NEVER review a product without using it for at least a month or more&lt;br /&gt;7.  My oily t-zone does not feel oily&lt;br /&gt;8.  The 2 small dry patches, caused by the retinol serum, are gone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I continue to usethe Triple Power Night Mask, I will update this review.  However, if I could give it 10 stars, I most certainly would!the Triple Power Night Mask, I will update this review.  However, if I could give it 10 stars, I most certainly would!</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, but does not &#x27;sit&#x27; on your face. I use this every morning under foundation. I also use Argon organic oil around and under my eyes and between these two products I have skin that looks 15 years younger than my age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like a deep moisturizer , no firming effect at all!</li>
            <li> This product feels a little tacky when first applied...I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks,&lt;br /&gt;and really haven&#x27;t noticed any remarkable changes as of yet..</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely smoother and softer after a few weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> i tried to use this on three different nights, the odor is really strong and i got a migraine each time.  will toss it, rather have wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help prevent further signs of aging, not to treat current signs of aging. I have tried other creams and didn&#x27;t believe that any product could undo damage that I already had. Boy was I wrong. I started using this product every night. In only 3 days my face looked and felt smoother. After 7 days, there was significant visual improvement. I actually had co-workers ask me what makeup I was using. I was so excited about the improvement, I decided to see if I could treat my facial scars and other significant skin blemishes. I did some research and bought a derma roller. I used this cream after the derma roller treatment and the scar on my chin is no longer visible and my acne scars are all but gone. I can not express how happy I am to have found this product.</li>
            <li> Spouse thought it was great</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product on Facebook and since I was using Dermalogica and getting no positive results, I decided to give it a try. I have very dry skin that I just can&#x27;t hydrate enough no matter how much water I drink. After one night of using this product, my skin was fully hydrated and soft. I&#x27;m shocked that I could get something so great at CVS. Now I will begin to experiment with the full line. My face only feels this good after a professional facial. It does have a perfumey smell to it that I don&#x27;t mind but could see how that would bother others. A little goes a long way and it absorbs fast. I highly recommend this stuff, I&#x27;m telling everyone I know!</li>
            <li> My skin looks fabulous!</li>
