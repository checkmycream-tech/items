            <li>Great price, great quality.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a great set of makeup brushes everywhere and considered buying another set of Sigma brushes, but when I discovered Bdellium Tools</li>
            <li>A very nice brush to have</li>
            <li>This slanted contour brush is perfect for contouring your cheeks with bronzer:)</li>
            <li>i am really glad that i purchased this product i am very happy</li>
            <li>I mostly use the eye brushes, since that is what I&#x27;m trying to perfect.  </li>
            <li>After I returned my Bdellium brushes I bought a Sigma set and they are SO awesome that I immediately ordered more and some as gifts for my friends.  </li>
            <li>Really good indeed.</li>
            <li>and this does do a good job.  </li>
            <li>they are good for a beginner.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really good quality.</li>
            <li>Since I had loved the brushes before they started falling apart, I threw away all of the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I think they both do a good job.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my spuse and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I saw a good amount of reviews on these bushes.  </li>
            <li>Some brushes good some not.</li>
            <li>It is very dense and perfect for all over coverage of foundation, nice for applying blushes and bronzers too!</li>
            <li>This brush is also great for eyeliner, but I do prefer Bdellium&#x27;s because it&#x27;s tip is more pointy.  </li>
            <li>Im very glad I chose the Bdellium Maestro brushes.  </li>
            <li>i know that i have gone on youtube many times just to see what people would recommend and which brushes were good even though alot of people mention Mac as the best brushes i did not want to spend that amount of money on them right now...</li>
            <li>The quality on these brushes are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This foundation brush also did quite nicely so I will have to give this a point as well.</li>
            <li>Bdellium #964: This is a blusher brush which is so nice for applying blush and even powders.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a nice addition to the Bdellium set</li>
            <li>: This is sigma&#x27;s medium angled shadowing brush, also another nice asset for the set.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice addition.</li>
            <li>Instead, I made my own \\&quot;set\\&quot; by ordering the brushes I wanted.  </li>
            <li>all these reviews are comparing these brushes to Sigma saying they are as good or better.</li>
            <li>Ok, sigmas first real win with my comparison.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that it was more dense than sigmas:)  VS.  </li>
            <li>I already washed them and still no shedding, i love these brushes and i do think they would be a great gift for any one especially if that person loves makeup because these are great</li>
            <li>this was an ok buy...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose these.  </li>
            <li>i love these brushes and do recommend them to anyone whether your a begginer, or a makeup artist</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>Bdellium #710: The eye liner brush in this kit is fabulous!</li>
            <li>To me this works better than the angled liner.</li>
            <li>Plus the Bdellium set&#x27;s roll up case can hold more brushes than sigma&#x27;s case with another row of brush slots included:)  </li>
            <li>Best \\&quot;Overall FEEL\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash it before use ( i used olive oil and bath and body works foaming anti bacterial soap to wash my brushes)</li>
            <li>No shedding and a lovely application everytime.</li>
            <li>Many of the brushes I used were outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not part of this set but a must have to apply foundation much better than the one in the set itself.</li>
            <li>At most 2 to 3 from maybe 3 brushes.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m sort of glad I washed them.  </li>
            <li>Now that I gotten a better feel for it</li>
            <li>i love them.</li>
            <li>Amazon gladly obliged.  </li>
            <li>What frustrates me more is that I was torn between ordering these Bdellium brushes and ordering Sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I decided to purchase these.  </li>
            <li>it holds more brushes so if you add more to your collection you will have space for them.  </li>
            <li>The finishing/blending brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>So I experienced the most fraying out of all the sigma brushes with this particular brush..</li>
            <li>I love the brushes, they&#x27;re very soft and great for blending product.</li>
            <li>I think these brushes are pretty good brushes.</li>
            <li>I like to use my wet foundation and dab it all over my face and it did a great job!   </li>
            <li>So there are always differences between set&#x27;s and their brushes, however I still really enjoy what Bdellium included in their set:)</li>
            <li>They feel so soft and are very nicely made.</li>
            <li>I will be contacting Amazon customer service about this issue, but the rest of you be warned, the brushes don&#x27;t hold up and you may not receive a full refund!</li>
            <li>The price is excellent compared to other options out there.</li>
            <li>I would compare them to sigma and mac brushes because the quality is amazing, they are nice and sturdy plus sooo soft.</li>
            <li>As for the brushes themselves, the overall look of the brushes is quite beautiful.</li>
            <li>Handles are a comfortable size and length as well.</li>
            <li>but scared they were going to be cheap and shed and stuff</li>
            <li>There are 3 in both of these sets that are different but all serve great purposes.    </li>
            <li>Overall these are great</li>
            <li>The quality is that of what you would expect from cheap brands like ELF or Ulta.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for carrying such great items!</li>
            <li>The new one was much better and does a pretty good job of blending too.</li>
            <li>I would say such a great investment and the price is not bad at all for the quality you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li>the handle is nice and long enought to hold comfortably and the brush roll is pretty good.</li>
            <li>so impressed.when i got my order in i was so excited</li>
            <li>and you cant go wrong with brushes, you never have too many! :D  </li>
            <li>vs Sigma : 5-4    Bdellium #763: This small angle brush is perfect for applying makeup to the eyes!</li>
            <li>: Bdellium Wins here too!  </li>
            <li>I originally wanted the sigma set until I saw some videos on youtube about bdellium tools.  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job and is slightly smaller than the sigma version, which I feel gives me more precision.  </li>
            <li>Even my old makeup now goes on better!</li>
            <li>: This brush is soft as well, however I experienced a lot of fraying with this particular brush.  </li>
            <li>This one was tapered a bit more rounded than the bdellium but really made no difference in application.  </li>
            <li>No bad smells at all in the packaging or the brushes.  </li>
            <li>The bdellium brush is a bit wider than sigmas, but is not a bad thing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and the eye brushes are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I also love the case which has extra pockets for even more brushes.</li>
            <li>Both brush sets are very sturdy and have good brush ferrules and soft bristles over all, but I do prefer the Bdellium set over the sigma for the price and quality.</li>
            <li>They are light enough to be easy-to-use, but feel \\&quot;expensive.\\&quot; The handle has a nice, glossy finish and sport the company name and brush number.</li>
            <li>LOVE the roll up bag, it looks rich and offers room to grow.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes feel soft and pliable but some (specially the brushes for eye shadow application) are too bushy.</li>
            <li>I wish I had just ordered the Sigma ones in the first place!  </li>
            <li>I guess because they are kind of new, but the few that I saw were very good reviews Including from MUAs that frequent the makeup shows.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this brushes were wonderful and also very soft and packaged so nicely i was excited and nervous waiting for this shipment but when it arrived which was alot earlier than i expected i was very surprised.</li>
            <li>It is useful to know what brushes your using when you aren&#x27;t a pro makeup artist.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and love how it applies makeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always nice to have a smaller brush to conceal with</li>
            <li>The antibacterial aspect is nice as well, especially if you plan to use these on clients.</li>
            <li>LOVE my Maestro Series brushes so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this brush set for about a month, and so far I love all the brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Very soft, nice long handles, love the pouch they are in.  </li>
            <li>I finally have a full set of quality brushes and really love them.</li>
            <li>they claimed to be cruelty free and high quality.</li>
            <li>Sigmas small angle also works great for applying eye shadows and liners.  </li>
            <li>It is good for contouring nose, but not useful for contouring cheeks or applying blush.</li>
            <li>I gave them a thorough wash with MAC brush cleaner as soon as I got them, and that took care of any light smell from the packaging and initial fallout, which was verrrry light.</li>
            <li>people I&#x27;ve spoken to aren&#x27;t happy with Amazon fulfillment Sigma brushes, but if you buy them from the manufacturer website (they&#x27;re more expensive)</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s an ok starting brush kit for anyone.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before this purchase, it&#x27;s my first quality brush set.  </li>
            <li>No fur hair dropping,they are soft and precise.</li>
            <li>Okay, now we have some different looking/functioning brushes within each set.</li>
            <li>you will see a lot of color come out of the brush when you wash it for the first time, I dont know what it is</li>
            <li>Well i have to say this was my first brush set purchase</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more bdellium tools brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as the reviews say they are.</li>
            <li>kit has the basic brushes in there, after a while you will find your favorites and want to order more of them \\&quot;a la carte\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the set for the price and plan to add some single BD brushes to the set.</li>
            <li>Even though Sigma may have better advertising and marketing, I personally believe Bdellium has a better product for the same price if not a little cheaper for some brushes.</li>
            <li>From one brush though their were some kind of staining because the water turn slightly pinkish.  </li>
            <li>For example sigma&#x27;s says: Large Powder F-30 whereas Bdellium&#x27;s just has the number.</li>
            <li>: The foundation brush for this set is super soft and applies foundation very evenly.</li>
            <li>Even though both brushes do about the same job, sigmas IS a little more dense making application of shadow easier and holds pigment better.  </li>
            <li>The stipple brush is my favourite in the whole set</li>
            <li>The set is very practical and allow you to travel with the brushes.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say i like them too much</li>
            <li>I wish I would have known about these brushes before I paid so much money for the MAC brushes I bought years ago.</li>
            <li>This set allowed me to get one of everything I needed most, minus a kabuki which I ordered separately.</li>
            <li>Being &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; is not enough, most synthetic brushes are soft...</li>
            <li>Overall not bad for my first set.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>This pencil brush is nice for applying eyeshadow in small areas.</li>
            <li>The brushes are sooo soft and so pretty.  </li>
            <li>My first time buying professional makeup brush set.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that the brush hairs smell a bit odd (from the antibacterial aspect, perhaps?), but it is not horrible.  </li>
            <li>They are VERY soft which makes it so much easier when it comes to blending eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are soft and very functional.   </li>
            <li>Ok so here is a LONG IN DEPTH side by side comparison of the brushes that have the same function...    </li>
            <li>Bdellium #772: This is the small shader brush perfect for applying small bits of eyeshadow!  </li>
            <li>But I can live with that.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a couple of months, I have noticed that the black brush roll does pick up makeup stains easily.   </li>
            <li>Sigma actually replaced this brush and two others for me out of my whole set since there was so much fraying.  </li>
            <li>I bought them as a gift for my sister and I wanted to check them out to make sure they met my minimal quality standard -</li>
            <li>They are all very soft and don&#x27;t shed in your face.  </li>
            <li>They are all very soft, sturdy, and well made.  </li>
            <li>However this was the only ferrule I saw an issue with out of the whole set, just for clarification!  </li>
            <li>suggest looking into the other brushes available to complete your kit.</li>
            <li>It is slightly smallerthan the sigma brush, however I find this to be a plus when contouring since you don&#x27;t want a huge line when defining a jaw line, etc.  </li>
            <li>After they were dried they went back to their shape very easily and were just as soft.  </li>
            <li>This large shadow brush does pretty good at blending, but I feel is less dense and wider than sigmas which makes application a little more difficult.</li>
            <li>and they pretty much work exactly the same except you spending way less on this one</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, a couple were a little stiff when I first got them but were fine after the first wash.  </li>
            <li>As a professional make-up artist, these are no where near professional quality.</li>
            <li>Coastal Scents has an affordable set, but I wanted the stippling brush, and who needs an eyebrow brush when you can use an old cleaned mascara brush.  </li>
            <li>and they all are soft and dense</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and dense.  </li>
            <li>At least in my book:)    </li>
            <li>They are natural, and soft, and I do recommend them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re unbelievably soft; I had no idea synthetic bristles could be this silky feeling.</li>
            <li>These ARE professional makeup</li>
            <li>They are soft, and work well.  </li>
            <li>BD have other great colors like yellow and apple green, but I wanted the classic black with the nickel farrels.  </li>
            <li>They did not bleed and there was minimal sheding during the first wash (1 or 2 hairs) on 2 of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>I really like the thin eyeliner brush, and the big powder brush is great for applying very little powder.</li>
            <li>I was slightly let down because of fraying hairs, but the Bdellium set was soft and not frayed at all:)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I do occasionally find stray fibers on my face from the brushes shedding but it is not excessive.</li>
            <li>I found a few other favorite brushes by going on their website.</li>
            <li>However, I prefer sponge application generally.   </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any further brush shedding so far, and they apply my makeup like a dream.</li>
            <li>Sigmas pencil brush is a little more tapered at the end, making application in tight areas easier.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting a complete brush set for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all the reviews on YouTube for various brush sets, and comparing them to other similar products</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes, minimal shedding only on the stippling brush.</li>
            <li>i was a little nervous because i did not know to much about brushes.</li>

            <li> This slanted contour brush is perfect for contouring your cheeks with bronzer:)</li>
            <li> i am really glad that i purchased this product i am very happy</li>
            <li> I mostly use the eye brushes, since that is what I&#x27;m trying to perfect.  </li>
            <li> After I returned my Bdellium brushes I bought a Sigma set and they are SO awesome that I immediately ordered more and some as gifts for my friends.  </li>
            <li> Really good indeed.</li>
            <li> and this does do a good job.  </li>
            <li> they are good for a beginner.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really good quality.</li>
            <li> Since I had loved the brushes before they started falling apart, I threw away all of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I think they both do a good job.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my spuse and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I saw a good amount of reviews on these bushes.  </li>
            <li> Some brushes good some not.</li>
            <li> It is very dense and perfect for all over coverage of foundation, nice for applying blushes and bronzers too!</li>
            <li> This brush is also great for eyeliner, but I do prefer Bdellium&#x27;s because it&#x27;s tip is more pointy.  </li>
            <li> Im very glad I chose the Bdellium Maestro brushes.  </li>
            <li> i know that i have gone on youtube many times just to see what people would recommend and which brushes were good even though alot of people mention Mac as the best brushes i did not want to spend that amount of money on them right now...</li>
            <li> The quality on these brushes are amazing.  </li>
            <li> This foundation brush also did quite nicely so I will have to give this a point as well.</li>
            <li> Bdellium #964: This is a blusher brush which is so nice for applying blush and even powders.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a nice addition to the Bdellium set</li>
            <li> : This is sigma&#x27;s medium angled shadowing brush, also another nice asset for the set.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice addition.</li>
            <li> Instead, I made my own \\&quot;set\\&quot; by ordering the brushes I wanted.  </li>
            <li> all these reviews are comparing these brushes to Sigma saying they are as good or better.</li>
            <li> Ok, sigmas first real win with my comparison.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that it was more dense than sigmas:)  VS.  </li>
            <li> I already washed them and still no shedding, i love these brushes and i do think they would be a great gift for any one especially if that person loves makeup because these are great</li>
            <li> this was an ok buy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose these.  </li>
            <li> i love these brushes and do recommend them to anyone whether your a begginer, or a makeup artist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> Bdellium #710: The eye liner brush in this kit is fabulous!</li>
            <li> To me this works better than the angled liner.</li>
            <li> Plus the Bdellium set&#x27;s roll up case can hold more brushes than sigma&#x27;s case with another row of brush slots included:)  </li>
            <li> Best \\&quot;Overall FEEL\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash it before use ( i used olive oil and bath and body works foaming anti bacterial soap to wash my brushes)</li>
            <li> No shedding and a lovely application everytime.</li>
            <li> Many of the brushes I used were outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not part of this set but a must have to apply foundation much better than the one in the set itself.</li>
            <li> At most 2 to 3 from maybe 3 brushes.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sort of glad I washed them.  </li>
            <li> Now that I gotten a better feel for it</li>
            <li> i love them.</li>
            <li> Amazon gladly obliged.  </li>
            <li> What frustrates me more is that I was torn between ordering these Bdellium brushes and ordering Sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I decided to purchase these.  </li>
            <li> it holds more brushes so if you add more to your collection you will have space for them.  </li>
            <li> The finishing/blending brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> So I experienced the most fraying out of all the sigma brushes with this particular brush..</li>
            <li> I love the brushes, they&#x27;re very soft and great for blending product.</li>
            <li> I think these brushes are pretty good brushes.</li>
            <li> I like to use my wet foundation and dab it all over my face and it did a great job!   </li>
            <li> So there are always differences between set&#x27;s and their brushes, however I still really enjoy what Bdellium included in their set:)</li>
            <li> They feel so soft and are very nicely made.</li>
            <li> I will be contacting Amazon customer service about this issue, but the rest of you be warned, the brushes don&#x27;t hold up and you may not receive a full refund!</li>
            <li> The price is excellent compared to other options out there.</li>
            <li> I would compare them to sigma and mac brushes because the quality is amazing, they are nice and sturdy plus sooo soft.</li>
            <li> As for the brushes themselves, the overall look of the brushes is quite beautiful.</li>
            <li> Handles are a comfortable size and length as well.</li>
            <li> but scared they were going to be cheap and shed and stuff</li>
            <li> There are 3 in both of these sets that are different but all serve great purposes.    </li>
            <li> Overall these are great</li>
            <li> The quality is that of what you would expect from cheap brands like ELF or Ulta.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon for carrying such great items!</li>
            <li> The new one was much better and does a pretty good job of blending too.</li>
            <li> I would say such a great investment and the price is not bad at all for the quality you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li> the handle is nice and long enought to hold comfortably and the brush roll is pretty good.</li>
            <li> so impressed.when i got my order in i was so excited</li>
            <li> and you cant go wrong with brushes, you never have too many! :D  </li>
            <li> vs Sigma : 5-4    Bdellium #763: This small angle brush is perfect for applying makeup to the eyes!</li>
            <li> : Bdellium Wins here too!  </li>
            <li> I originally wanted the sigma set until I saw some videos on youtube about bdellium tools.  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job and is slightly smaller than the sigma version, which I feel gives me more precision.  </li>
            <li> Even my old makeup now goes on better!</li>
            <li> : This brush is soft as well, however I experienced a lot of fraying with this particular brush.  </li>
            <li> This one was tapered a bit more rounded than the bdellium but really made no difference in application.  </li>
            <li> No bad smells at all in the packaging or the brushes.  </li>
            <li> The bdellium brush is a bit wider than sigmas, but is not a bad thing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and the eye brushes are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I also love the case which has extra pockets for even more brushes.</li>
            <li> Both brush sets are very sturdy and have good brush ferrules and soft bristles over all, but I do prefer the Bdellium set over the sigma for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> They are light enough to be easy-to-use, but feel \\&quot;expensive.\\&quot; The handle has a nice, glossy finish and sport the company name and brush number.</li>
            <li> LOVE the roll up bag, it looks rich and offers room to grow.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes feel soft and pliable but some (specially the brushes for eye shadow application) are too bushy.</li>
            <li> I wish I had just ordered the Sigma ones in the first place!  </li>
            <li> I guess because they are kind of new, but the few that I saw were very good reviews Including from MUAs that frequent the makeup shows.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this brushes were wonderful and also very soft and packaged so nicely i was excited and nervous waiting for this shipment but when it arrived which was alot earlier than i expected i was very surprised.</li>
            <li> It is useful to know what brushes your using when you aren&#x27;t a pro makeup artist.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and love how it applies makeup.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always nice to have a smaller brush to conceal with</li>
            <li> The antibacterial aspect is nice as well, especially if you plan to use these on clients.</li>
            <li> LOVE my Maestro Series brushes so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush set for about a month, and so far I love all the brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Very soft, nice long handles, love the pouch they are in.  </li>
            <li> I finally have a full set of quality brushes and really love them.</li>
            <li> they claimed to be cruelty free and high quality.</li>
            <li> Sigmas small angle also works great for applying eye shadows and liners.  </li>
            <li> It is good for contouring nose, but not useful for contouring cheeks or applying blush.</li>
            <li> I gave them a thorough wash with MAC brush cleaner as soon as I got them, and that took care of any light smell from the packaging and initial fallout, which was verrrry light.</li>
            <li> people I&#x27;ve spoken to aren&#x27;t happy with Amazon fulfillment Sigma brushes, but if you buy them from the manufacturer website (they&#x27;re more expensive)</li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s an ok starting brush kit for anyone.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before this purchase, it&#x27;s my first quality brush set.  </li>
            <li> No fur hair dropping,they are soft and precise.</li>
            <li> Okay, now we have some different looking/functioning brushes within each set.</li>
            <li> you will see a lot of color come out of the brush when you wash it for the first time, I dont know what it is</li>
            <li> Well i have to say this was my first brush set purchase</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more bdellium tools brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as the reviews say they are.</li>
            <li> kit has the basic brushes in there, after a while you will find your favorites and want to order more of them \\&quot;a la carte\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the set for the price and plan to add some single BD brushes to the set.</li>
            <li> Even though Sigma may have better advertising and marketing, I personally believe Bdellium has a better product for the same price if not a little cheaper for some brushes.</li>
            <li> From one brush though their were some kind of staining because the water turn slightly pinkish.  </li>
            <li> For example sigma&#x27;s says: Large Powder F-30 whereas Bdellium&#x27;s just has the number.</li>
            <li> : The foundation brush for this set is super soft and applies foundation very evenly.</li>
            <li> Even though both brushes do about the same job, sigmas IS a little more dense making application of shadow easier and holds pigment better.  </li>
            <li> The stipple brush is my favourite in the whole set</li>
            <li> The set is very practical and allow you to travel with the brushes.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say i like them too much</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known about these brushes before I paid so much money for the MAC brushes I bought years ago.</li>
            <li> This set allowed me to get one of everything I needed most, minus a kabuki which I ordered separately.</li>
            <li> Being &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; is not enough, most synthetic brushes are soft...</li>
            <li> Overall not bad for my first set.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> This pencil brush is nice for applying eyeshadow in small areas.</li>
            <li> The brushes are sooo soft and so pretty.  </li>
            <li> My first time buying professional makeup brush set.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the brush hairs smell a bit odd (from the antibacterial aspect, perhaps?), but it is not horrible.  </li>
            <li> They are VERY soft which makes it so much easier when it comes to blending eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are soft and very functional.   </li>
            <li> Ok so here is a LONG IN DEPTH side by side comparison of the brushes that have the same function...    </li>
            <li> Bdellium #772: This is the small shader brush perfect for applying small bits of eyeshadow!  </li>
            <li> But I can live with that.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of months, I have noticed that the black brush roll does pick up makeup stains easily.   </li>
            <li> Sigma actually replaced this brush and two others for me out of my whole set since there was so much fraying.  </li>
            <li> I bought them as a gift for my sister and I wanted to check them out to make sure they met my minimal quality standard -</li>
            <li> They are all very soft and don&#x27;t shed in your face.  </li>
            <li> They are all very soft, sturdy, and well made.  </li>
            <li> However this was the only ferrule I saw an issue with out of the whole set, just for clarification!  </li>
            <li> suggest looking into the other brushes available to complete your kit.</li>
            <li> It is slightly smallerthan the sigma brush, however I find this to be a plus when contouring since you don&#x27;t want a huge line when defining a jaw line, etc.  </li>
            <li> After they were dried they went back to their shape very easily and were just as soft.  </li>
            <li> This large shadow brush does pretty good at blending, but I feel is less dense and wider than sigmas which makes application a little more difficult.</li>
            <li> and they pretty much work exactly the same except you spending way less on this one</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, a couple were a little stiff when I first got them but were fine after the first wash.  </li>
            <li> As a professional make-up artist, these are no where near professional quality.</li>
            <li> Coastal Scents has an affordable set, but I wanted the stippling brush, and who needs an eyebrow brush when you can use an old cleaned mascara brush.  </li>
            <li> and they all are soft and dense</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and dense.  </li>
            <li> At least in my book:)    </li>
            <li> They are natural, and soft, and I do recommend them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re unbelievably soft; I had no idea synthetic bristles could be this silky feeling.</li>
            <li> These ARE professional makeup</li>
            <li> They are soft, and work well.  </li>
            <li> BD have other great colors like yellow and apple green, but I wanted the classic black with the nickel farrels.  </li>
            <li> They did not bleed and there was minimal sheding during the first wash (1 or 2 hairs) on 2 of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> I really like the thin eyeliner brush, and the big powder brush is great for applying very little powder.</li>
            <li> I was slightly let down because of fraying hairs, but the Bdellium set was soft and not frayed at all:)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I do occasionally find stray fibers on my face from the brushes shedding but it is not excessive.</li>
            <li> I found a few other favorite brushes by going on their website.</li>
            <li> However, I prefer sponge application generally.   </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any further brush shedding so far, and they apply my makeup like a dream.</li>
            <li> Sigmas pencil brush is a little more tapered at the end, making application in tight areas easier.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a complete brush set for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to all the reviews on YouTube for various brush sets, and comparing them to other similar products</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes, minimal shedding only on the stippling brush.</li>
            <li> i was a little nervous because i did not know to much about brushes.</li>
            <li> So, this one is also soft, but I was let down with fraying and not enough density in the white bristles area.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this line Bdellium Tools as the MAC brushes are more expensive and the difference in quality is hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and there was absolutely no fraying and only a little shedding.</li>
            <li> Not an excuse to not wash them, but</li>
            <li> i been looking for a long time for brushes and i did not have an idea which ones to get</li>
            <li> These brushes come pre-packaged individually with a black, well-constructed brush roll with 20 brush inserts.</li>
            <li> Some additional comments:   I do not particularly like 948 (liquid foundation brush).</li>
            <li> There are about two eye brushes that are maybe slightly on the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; size especially for my eye size or my taste, so</li>
            <li> Some brushes bristles were warping so bad that they no longer functional (you can&#x27;t apply precise concealer with a concealer brush that has bristles that are curling and bending at the ends!)  </li>
            <li> There was minimal hair loss.  </li>
            <li> The handles are long enough to store them in poly pellets but not so long that I feel ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Perhaps Bdellium should have chosen one liner over the other in trade for another type of brush?  </li>
            <li> while they do do the job, I think I&#x27;ll look into other premium eye brushes to substitute for these two.  </li>
            <li> * match other pieces to my favorites out of the Bdellium.</li>
            <li> However, I just received my refund and there was a \\&quot;partial refund deduction\\&quot; on all of my brushes of 20%!  </li>
            <li> The shedding is very minimal.   </li>
            <li> Also the ferrule seemed to rock a little, meaning it may come loose someday.</li>
            <li> BUT I would  not recommend for professional make up artists because some of the brushes are not great for a thorough and even application.</li>
            <li> Bdellium&#x27;s handle&#x27;s are a bit shorter, lighter weight and have a shiny gloss to the black handle where as sigmas is matte.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I washed the brushes because I didn&#x27;t like the slight odor they had.  </li>
            <li> They shed very little, not much at all.</li>
            <li> The dark fluffy brushes shed a little bit and has this reddish color every time I wash them.</li>
            <li> This is sigma&#x27;s eye shadowing brush which is thick, dense and wide.</li>
            <li> If Bdellium was missing anything out of their set I&#x27;d say this is it.</li>
            <li> I shopped alot at sephora and bought a few of their brushes</li>
            <li> What a waste....</li>
            <li> not sure if it was the lighter colored hair they used,</li>
            <li> 942 (contour brush) is relatively small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to control the amount of product they pick up because of the amount of bristles.</li>
            <li> I suppose, but even still for the price I&#x27;d at least recommend Sephora brand brushes.</li>
            <li> but I have never heard a complaint.</li>
            <li> I mean your getting 12 brushes</li>
            <li> Plus I was just tired of affiliates trying to sell me sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li> I would have returned the brushes regardless, but I was not informed by Amazon or Senyx that I would have had to pay 20% to waste my time trying out crappy no-name brushes from a random e-tailer!  </li>
            <li> Sigmas version had horrible fraying on this brush as well, but they took care of me by sending out a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very confused...</li>
            <li> and I was so sorely disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this was an ok buy... I am content with the quality and I think that&#x27;s an ok starting brush kit for anyone. BUT I would  not recommend for professional make up artists because some of the brushes are not great for a thorough and even application. Most of the brushes feel soft and pliable but some (specially the brushes for eye shadow application) are too bushy. It&#x27;s hard to control the amount of product they pick up because of the amount of bristles. Overall.. I am content but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before this purchase, it&#x27;s my first quality brush set.  Thanks to all the reviews on YouTube for various brush sets, and comparing them to other similar products I&#x27;m glad I chose these.  BDellium has the perfect combination of quality brushes at a good price.  Coastal Scents has an affordable set, but I wanted the stippling brush, and who needs an eyebrow brush when you can use an old cleaned mascara brush.  I also didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on the comparable Sigma brushes.      Very soft brushes, minimal shedding only on the stippling brush. Handles are a comfortable size and length as well. No bad smells at all in the packaging or the brushes.  I also love the case which has extra pockets for even more brushes.</li>
            <li> Im so impressed.when i got my order in i was so excited but scared they were going to be cheap and shed and stuff but they are great! I would compare them to sigma and mac brushes because the quality is amazing, they are nice and sturdy plus sooo soft. i love these brushes and do recommend them to anyone whether your a begginer, or a makeup artist this stuff if great. I mean your getting 12 brushes and they all are soft and dense, you get everything form eye brushes to face brushes and the work great! the handle is nice and long enought to hold comfortably and the brush roll is pretty good. I&#x27;ve had better. I already washed them and still no shedding, i love these brushes and i do think they would be a great gift for any one especially if that person loves makeup because these are great and you cant go wrong with brushes, you never have too many! :D  you do get what your paying for and i recommend this product to any one. The stipple brush is my favourite in the whole set I also have the 188 from mac and they pretty much work exactly the same except you spending way less on this one, you can even buy it indiviadually for just 12 dollars!</li>
            <li> This brush set is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had! No fur hair dropping,they are soft and precise. The set is very practical and allow you to travel with the brushes. Really good indeed.</li>
            <li> I recently received my Bdellium 12 piece maestro brush set and was amazed by the quality! I asked the company (bdellium) if I could do a side by side comparison of Bdellium&#x27;s brush kit vs. Sigma&#x27;s kit and so they sent me out the maestro set to put it to the test. And let me say, this brush set is AWESOME! When I had bought my Sigma set for around the same price of $99 I was slightly let down because of fraying hairs, but the Bdellium set was soft and not frayed at all:) Even though Sigma may have better advertising and marketing, I personally believe Bdellium has a better product for the same price if not a little cheaper for some brushes. Bdellium&#x27;s handle&#x27;s are a bit shorter, lighter weight and have a shiny gloss to the black handle where as sigmas is matte. The only con I see about the handles with bdellium is that the brushes function is not labeled on the side like it is on sigmas. For example sigma&#x27;s says: Large Powder F-30 whereas Bdellium&#x27;s just has the number. It is useful to know what brushes your using when you aren&#x27;t a pro makeup artist.  Ok so here is a LONG IN DEPTH side by side comparison of the brushes that have the same function...    Bdellium #980: This brush is so soft and there was absolutely no fraying and only a little shedding. Perfect powder brush!  VS.  Sigma F30: This brush is soft as well, however I experienced a lot of fraying with this particular brush.  *Bd vs Sigma score: 1-0    Bdellium #955: This finishing brush is the brush that has the white stippling ends! It is very dense and perfect for all over coverage of foundation, nice for applying blushes and bronzers too! I loved the fact that it was more dense than sigmas:)  VS.  Sigma F50: So, this one is also soft, but I was let down with fraying and not enough density in the white bristles area.    *Bd vs Sigma score: 2-0    Bdellium #942: This slanted contour brush is perfect for contouring your cheeks with bronzer:) It is soft and love how it applies makeup.  It is slightly smallerthan the sigma brush, however I find this to be a plus when contouring since you don&#x27;t want a huge line when defining a jaw line, etc.  VS.  Sigma F40: So I experienced the most fraying out of all the sigma brushes with this particular brush..not sure if it was the lighter colored hair they used, but I wasn&#x27;t too happy. Sigma actually replaced this brush and two others for me out of my whole set since there was so much fraying.  *Bd vs Sigma score: 3-0      Bdellium #948: The foundation brush for this set is super soft and applies foundation very evenly. I like to use my wet foundation and dab it all over my face and it did a great job!   VS.  Sigma F60: This foundation brush also did quite nicely so I will have to give this a point as well. This one was tapered a bit more rounded than the bdellium but really made no difference in application.  *Bd vs Sigma score:4-1    Bdellium #785: This is the tapered blending brush which I used for blending my eyeshadow. It does a nice job and is slightly smaller than the sigma version, which I feel gives me more precision.  VS.  Sigma E40: Sigmas version had horrible fraying on this brush as well, but they took care of me by sending out a new one. The new one was much better and does a pretty good job of blending too. They can both have a point on this style brush!  *Bd vs Sigma score: 5-2    Bdellium #778: This large shadow brush does pretty good at blending, but I feel is less dense and wider than sigmas which makes application a little more difficult. Also the ferrule seemed to rock a little, meaning it may come loose someday. However this was the only ferrule I saw an issue with out of the whole set, just for clarification!  VS.  Sigma E60: Ok, sigmas first real win with my comparison. Even though both brushes do about the same job, sigmas IS a little more dense making application of shadow easier and holds pigment better.  *Bd vs Sigma score: 5-3    Bdellium #780: This pencil brush is nice for applying eyeshadow in small areas. The bristles are soft and dense.  VS.  Sigma E30: Sigmas pencil brush is a little more tapered at the end, making application in tight areas easier. Another win for Sigma.  *Bd. vs Sigma : 5-4    Bdellium #763: This small angle brush is perfect for applying makeup to the eyes! The bdellium brush is a bit wider than sigmas, but is not a bad thing in my opinion.  VS.  Sigma E65: Sigmas small angle also works great for applying eye shadows and liners.  I  recommend both.  *Bd. vs Sigma: 5-5 Uh-oh tied...    Bdellium #710: The eye liner brush in this kit is fabulous! It&#x27;s precision and density makes for perfect eyeliner every time!  VS.  Sigma E05: This brush is also great for eyeliner, but I do prefer Bdellium&#x27;s because it&#x27;s tip is more pointy.  *Bd. vs Sigma: 6-5  ******************************************  Okay, now we have some different looking/functioning brushes within each set. There are 3 in both of these sets that are different but all serve great purposes.    I&#x27;ll start with Bdellium&#x27;s:  Bdellium #964: This is a blusher brush which is so nice for applying blush and even powders. I think it&#x27;s a nice addition to the Bdellium set and I think Sigma should have included something like this because the big powder brush in each set is just sometimes too big.  Bdellium #772: This is the small shader brush perfect for applying small bits of eyeshadow!  Bdellium #540: The precision eyeliner is one of my favorites! To me this works better than the angled liner. Perhaps Bdellium should have chosen one liner over the other in trade for another type of brush?  Bd. vs Sigma score:7-5    Then there&#x27;s Sigma&#x27;s:  Sigma E55: This is sigma&#x27;s eye shadowing brush which is thick, dense and wide. A very nice brush to have and I sort of wish Bdellium had included in their set.  Sigma E70: This is sigma&#x27;s medium angled shadowing brush, also another nice asset for the set.  Sigma F70: And lastly Sigma&#x27;s Concealer brush! If Bdellium was missing anything out of their set I&#x27;d say this is it. It&#x27;s always nice to have a smaller brush to conceal with and this does do a good job.  Bd. vs. Sigma score:7-6  ***********************************************************************************************************************************    *Plus the Bdellium set&#x27;s roll up case can hold more brushes than sigma&#x27;s case with another row of brush slots included:)  Bd. vs. Sigma score: 8-6    *Best \\&quot;Overall FEEL\\&quot;: Bdellium Wins here too!  Bd. vs. Sigma score: 9-6      AND Bdellium wins by 3 POINTS!!!!!!!  At least in my book:)    So there are always differences between set&#x27;s and their brushes, however I still really enjoy what Bdellium included in their set:) Both brush sets are very sturdy and have good brush ferrules and soft bristles over all, but I do prefer the Bdellium set over the sigma for the price and quality. I say GO BDELLIUM if you are thinking about buying brushes and are torn between the two companies!!!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a complete brush set for a long time.  I originally wanted the sigma set until I saw some videos on youtube about bdellium tools.  There weren&#x27;t alot of videos I guess because they are kind of new, but the few that I saw were very good reviews Including from MUAs that frequent the makeup shows.  Plus I was just tired of affiliates trying to sell me sigma brushes.  I kept seeing their videos on youtube but I wanted something different.  I am so happy I found these.  BD have other great colors like yellow and apple green, but I wanted the classic black with the nickel farrels.  The brushes are soft, a couple were a little stiff when I first got them but were fine after the first wash.  I am happy with the size of the brushes and they look great.  They did not bleed and there was minimal sheding during the first wash (1 or 2 hairs) on 2 of the brushes.  Overall, I am happy with the set for the price and plan to add some single BD brushes to the set.</li>
            <li> This brush set is really awesome.  They are all very soft and don&#x27;t shed in your face.  Make sure to wash it before use ( i used olive oil and bath and body works foaming anti bacterial soap to wash my brushes) you will see a lot of color come out of the brush when you wash it for the first time, I dont know what it is but it doesn&#x27;t affect the brush at all.  I would say such a great investment and the price is not bad at all for the quality you&#x27;re getting.  Thanks amazon for carrying such great items!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I finally have a full set of quality brushes and really love them. Even my old makeup now goes on better! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product and have been using it for about two months now. I love the brushes, they&#x27;re very soft and great for blending product. They shed very little, not much at all. I really like the thin eyeliner brush, and the big powder brush is great for applying very little powder. The antibacterial aspect is nice as well, especially if you plan to use these on clients. It keeps them cleaner. Not an excuse to not wash them, but it&#x27;s a nice addition. They are natural, and soft, and I do recommend them.</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome!  The brushes are sooo soft and so pretty.  No shedding and a lovely application everytime.</li>
            <li> they are good for a beginner.</li>
            <li> These brushes come pre-packaged individually with a black, well-constructed brush roll with 20 brush inserts. After using this product for a couple of months, I have noticed that the black brush roll does pick up makeup stains easily.   As for the brushes themselves, the overall look of the brushes is quite beautiful. They are light enough to be easy-to-use, but feel \\&quot;expensive.\\&quot; The handle has a nice, glossy finish and sport the company name and brush number. I have noticed that the brush hairs smell a bit odd (from the antibacterial aspect, perhaps?), but it is not horrible.  I have noticed some shedding on the larger brushes (e.g. 980) as well as the white brushes (e.g. 942 &amp; 780). The shedding is very minimal.   The brushes keep their shape quite well even after washing. They are soft and very functional.   Some additional comments:   I do not particularly like 948 (liquid foundation brush). It leaves application streaky. However, I prefer sponge application generally.   942 (contour brush) is relatively small. It is good for contouring nose, but not useful for contouring cheeks or applying blush.</li>
            <li> Well i have to say this was my first brush set purchase i was a little nervous because i did not know to much about brushes. I shopped alot at sephora and bought a few of their brushes i can&#x27;t say i like them too much i been looking for a long time for brushes and i did not have an idea which ones to get i know that i have gone on youtube many times just to see what people would recommend and which brushes were good even though alot of people mention Mac as the best brushes i did not want to spend that amount of money on them right now... I have to say that this brushes were wonderful and also very soft and packaged so nicely i was excited and nervous waiting for this shipment but when it arrived which was alot earlier than i expected i was very surprised. This are great brushes and the brush roll is great i am really glad that i purchased this product i am very happy and i would definetly buy this again.</li>
            <li> LOVE my Maestro Series brushes so far. I&#x27;ve owned this brush set for about a month, and so far I love all the brushes I&#x27;ve used. They&#x27;re unbelievably soft; I had no idea synthetic bristles could be this silky feeling. I gave them a thorough wash with MAC brush cleaner as soon as I got them, and that took care of any light smell from the packaging and initial fallout, which was verrrry light. Haven&#x27;t had any further brush shedding so far, and they apply my makeup like a dream.</li>
            <li> My first time buying professional makeup brush set.  I researched extensively before deciding on this set.  So far I like it very much.  Is it perfect?  No.  Even to my beginner eyes I can tell that there are some things they could have perhaps done somewhat different, however, that would again be a personal preference.  Many of the brushes I used were outstanding.  They are all very soft, sturdy, and well made.  The only one I had problem with was one I bought as an add on to the set -- the kabuki brush.  It&#x27;s not part of this set but a must have to apply foundation much better than the one in the set itself. Anyway, I washed the brushes because I didn&#x27;t like the slight odor they had.  They survived it unscathed.  There was minimal hair loss.  At most 2 to 3 from maybe 3 brushes.  Nothing big deal.  From one brush though their were some kind of staining because the water turn slightly pinkish.  So I&#x27;m sort of glad I washed them.  After they were dried they went back to their shape very easily and were just as soft.  I mostly use the eye brushes, since that is what I&#x27;m trying to perfect.  There are about two eye brushes that are maybe slightly on the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; size especially for my eye size or my taste, so while they do do the job, I think I&#x27;ll look into other premium eye brushes to substitute for these two.  Overall not bad for my first set.  Now that I gotten a better feel for it, I think I have the confidence to mix * match other pieces to my favorites out of the Bdellium.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really good quality. They feel so soft and are very nicely made. I bought these brushes 2 months ago and waited to use them a while to give a review. They dont shed any hairs. after lots of research on you tube i bought this set as there are 5 face brushes in this kit rather than sigma brushes kit. i love them. dont hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this set because it didn&#x27;t have the brushes in it that I needed.  Instead, I made my own \\&quot;set\\&quot; by ordering the brushes I wanted.  I used these brushes for 3 weeks before I started to notice that they were not keeping their shape.  Also, lots of hairs were falling out of some.  Some brushes bristles were warping so bad that they no longer functional (you can&#x27;t apply precise concealer with a concealer brush that has bristles that are curling and bending at the ends!)  So, I contacted Amazon to return these brushes based on the fact that they were falling apart after 3 weeks.  Amazon gladly obliged.  Since I had loved the brushes before they started falling apart, I threw away all of the packaging.  Amazon told me that I could still return them without the packaging.  However, I just received my refund and there was a \\&quot;partial refund deduction\\&quot; on all of my brushes of 20%!  I would have returned the brushes regardless, but I was not informed by Amazon or Senyx that I would have had to pay 20% to waste my time trying out crappy no-name brushes from a random e-tailer!  What frustrates me more is that I was torn between ordering these Bdellium brushes and ordering Sigma brushes.  After I returned my Bdellium brushes I bought a Sigma set and they are SO awesome that I immediately ordered more and some as gifts for my friends.  I wish I had just ordered the Sigma ones in the first place!  I will be contacting Amazon customer service about this issue, but the rest of you be warned, the brushes don&#x27;t hold up and you may not receive a full refund!</li>
            <li> I think these brushes are pretty good brushes. They are VERY soft which makes it so much easier when it comes to blending eyeshadows. I wish I would have known about these brushes before I paid so much money for the MAC brushes I bought years ago. I think they both do a good job. However, for the price, I will now be purchasing brushes from Bdellium Tools from now on.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my spuse and she loved it.Thank you</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  The quality on these brushes are amazing.  I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding as of yet.  I am so glad that I decided to purchase these.  These brushes are super soft and the eye brushes are amazing.  The brush case is great it holds more brushes so if you add more to your collection you will have space for them.  Overall these are great and i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  I will be ordering more bdellium tools brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> This set allowed me to get one of everything I needed most, minus a kabuki which I ordered separately. The handles are long enough to store them in poly pellets but not so long that I feel ridiculous. They transfer product well and don&#x27;t eat it all up. The finishing/blending brush is my favorite. Unfortunately I do occasionally find stray fibers on my face from the brushes shedding but it is not excessive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very confused... all these reviews are comparing these brushes to Sigma saying they are as good or better. As a professional make-up artist, these are no where near professional quality. I bought them as a gift for my sister and I wanted to check them out to make sure they met my minimal quality standard - and I was so sorely disappointed. The quality is that of what you would expect from cheap brands like ELF or Ulta. Being &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; is not enough, most synthetic brushes are soft... but quality is in the density and quality/durability of the synthetic bristles, and how the bristles are bound. If you&#x27;re doing this for basic at home make up application, it&#x27;s okay I suppose, but even still for the price I&#x27;d at least recommend Sephora brand brushes. If you&#x27;re considering this over Sigma brushes, here&#x27;s what I know... people I&#x27;ve spoken to aren&#x27;t happy with Amazon fulfillment Sigma brushes, but if you buy them from the manufacturer website (they&#x27;re more expensive) but I have never heard a complaint. Maybe Sigma gives their lesser quality brushes to Amazon? I wouldn&#x27;t know but these are no Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st brush set and I absolutely love them. They apply eyeshadow n liquid/ powder products great .</li>
            <li> I saw a good amount of reviews on these bushes.  I have been wanting to get some professinal brushes for awhile.  Im very glad I chose the Bdellium Maestro brushes.  They are very nice!  They are exactly as the reviews say they are. Very soft, nice long handles, love the pouch they are in.  These ARE professional makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone wanting great brushes...these are it!</li>
            <li> Great price, great quality. I highly recommend this line Bdellium Tools as the MAC brushes are more expensive and the difference in quality is hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;This kit has the basic brushes in there, after a while you will find your favorites and want to order more of them \\&quot;a la carte\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest looking into the other brushes available to complete your kit. I found a few other favorite brushes by going on their website. LOVE the roll up bag, it looks rich and offers room to grow. A great buy!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a great set of makeup brushes everywhere and considered buying another set of Sigma brushes, but when I discovered Bdellium Tools.......I had to try them. they claimed to be cruelty free and high quality. Let me tell you, THEY SHED LIKE YOU CAN&#x27;T EVEN IMAGINE!!!! I got rid of them as soon as I got them. What a waste....</li>
            <li> Some brushes good some not. The dark fluffy brushes shed a little bit and has this reddish color every time I wash them. But I can live with that.</li>
            <li> This is a very good set of brushes.  They are soft, and work well.  These were recommended to us by make up artistry department at the local college.  The price is excellent compared to other options out there.</li>
