            <li>Nice set for the price</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes did is good for doing my face mesk</li>
            <li>I use this to make my clay face mask and found each tool has its own use.</li>
            <li>it comes in handy being that I do a lot of mask.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the brush (it doesn&#x27;t mesh too well with mud) but the measuring spoons, bowl and spatula are perfect!</li>
            <li>I often like to mix up my own DIY face masks</li>
            <li>A must have if you mix your own.</li>
            <li>The brush handle is not glued together, does not stay attached and comes apart very easily.</li>
            <li>I dont need much clay in one application so its all good!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and liked it:)</li>
            <li>It was very cheaply made and glue was smeared on the piece that holds the bristles.</li>
            <li>I love this mask set.</li>
            <li>Really better than using a cup or bowl from the kitchen.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have big hopes for this considering the price, but it is awesome!</li>
            <li>Its cheap but effective.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s quite adorable though.</li>
            <li>The bowl is bendable and I love that.</li>
            <li>But it appeared to be actually the perfect size.</li>
            <li>After all, you don&#x27;t need a salad bowl for applying your face mask :)</li>
            <li>The brush is just okay</li>
            <li>love the color.  </li>
            <li>Love price and product</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure you can just re-glue it if it falls off</li>
            <li>but I was satisfied with this kit.</li>
            <li>Cute but haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li>but I do love this set</li>
            <li>My favorite color</li>
            <li>I love this for mixing face masks.</li>
            <li>I use it for clay face masks and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Cleanup was very easy, just used a baby wipe to clean up remaining residue.</li>
            <li>The bowl is the perfect size for mixing a single mask!</li>
            <li>They were smallest than I expected but worked perfect for mixing my mask.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to use and I love the fact that the bowl is just the right size for mixing and all sorts of cosmetic things.</li>
            <li>And the brush is great quality which really surprised me--and it cleaned up easily with no stain.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for mixing facial masks, the materials worked great to get the right consistency and the brush was exactly the right size and make to apply the clay mask I use.</li>
            <li>It seems to get scratched up easily with the blending stick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong, yet somewhat pliable plastic, has a silicon-like brush, measuring spoons and a spatula.</li>
            <li>Nice product,  good tools for homemade facial masks.</li>
            <li>I used the spatula like tool to apply the mask but everything else work fine, my brush didn&#x27;t fall apart either.</li>
            <li>The small scoop is good for making spot batches for a breakout or insect bites, the medium scoop is great for making face masks, and the large scoop is perfect for making wrap or multiple masks.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect little &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; set for mixing together my Aztec mud facials.</li>
            <li>This little kit is great!</li>
            <li>The brush that comes in the kit has incredibly soft, featherweight bristles which is wonderful for on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has everything, so easy to clean</li>
            <li>The scraper mixes the mask well and makes it easy to clean up after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>The only con would be the brush which didn&#x27;t do so great at application.</li>
            <li>Cheap,</li>
            <li>it will be great if its a bit bigger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful set and the green is the same as in ad pics and this is great for making my clay masks.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>Cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>in all it gets the job done and is a very handy thing to have if you use face masks regularly.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re putting things like mud and egg whites and honey and yoghurt on your face; you don&#x27;t need rich tools to apply it, for heaven&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>First thing I thought when I saw it in person was how cute the item and its packaging was.</li>
            <li>Small, perfect size.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t even worth a penny!</li>
            <li>Good size for a facial.</li>
            <li>much use it comfortably on your face!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size for mixing facial masks.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>Everything about this set is handy and helpful so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for my clay facial mask and it has been doing a very good job so far.</li>
            <li>The brush came apart quickly though.</li>
            <li>super cute and the main reasoning for picking this kit.  </li>
            <li>I went out to buy a wider high quality paint brush to use instead of the brush that came with this; it works much better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for your home based SPA :-)</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap and took a while to get here,</li>
            <li>The little brush works great.  </li>
            <li>Thank You for such a nice product</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected but did the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>And it has the right sizes of spoons for measuring.</li>
            <li>The price is right and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>The brush picked up enough product easily and applied it smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put several little bags of clays with it, and it will make a great gift/goody bag!</li>
            <li>Love that it comes in green, matches my bathroom decor :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good set helps you with your masks instead of making a mess here</li>
            <li>Cheap soft plastic</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Includes everything you need to get the exact 1:1 ratio, mix, &amp; apply.  </li>
            <li>, I would compare it top two Chinese tea chips put together.</li>
            <li>I thought the plastic would be flexible like the first one I ordered, but its does it job.</li>
            <li>i love it, a bit small, but its ok for what i&#x27;ll use it for</li>
            <li>Brush came apart in first cleaning.</li>
            <li>Simple Bowl for mixing, love it.</li>
            <li>Bowl and mixing utensil worked well, however the brush fell apart on first use.</li>
            <li>It came in 2 days and was inexpensive yet warranted for me as I am really beginning to delve in to the &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; face/hair masks, etc.!</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected, however it really is perfect for mixing up my facial mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are soft and not hard plastic as you would expect form a cheap product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have little measuring cups as well</li>
            <li>and I really quite prefer it for this reason.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap, so the material also feel that way, especially the brush.</li>
            <li>for the price you pay, it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like I can really mis the product up well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the bowl and measuring spoons.</li>
            <li>so i dont mind too much</li>
            <li>and there .. arrived as expected :)</li>
            <li>I bought mine from a seller in China without knowing and had to wait a whole month for delivery.</li>
            <li>and it has held up very well.</li>
            <li>Super cheap quality, not worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect little bowl for mixng small batches of things.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading other reviews people wrote about using it to mix Aztec Clay masks (clay + apple cider vinegar &#x3D; magic).</li>
            <li>This is a perfect size bowl for face mask because it&#x27;s small, about the size of a regular-sized green apple (Granny Smith).</li>
            <li>This product is 100% worth it, it&#x27;s inexpensive (less than $3 + free shipping) and the quality might feel \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; but it does the job</li>
            <li>The shipping time was decent.  </li>
            <li>The main reason why I ordered this was because of the brush that was included.</li>
            <li>However, the very first time I used it, I just pulled it out of the package and began using the brush, and it broke instantly.  </li>
            <li>This bowl is small, about 3 inches wide by just over 2 inches tall, which is perfect for whipping up your facial!</li>
            <li>The bristles are long enough that it is pretty easy to avoid getting the mixture on the metal.</li>
            <li>Love this little mixing bowl...</li>
            <li>and it was the right amount to cover my face &amp; neck, with just a bit left over to cover areas I may have missed.  </li>
            <li>It was very Low quality although they did have pretty decent customer service.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little bowl I can use for facial treatments.</li>
            <li>Glad I only spent 2.50</li>
            <li>Love this little set!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but when dealing with face masks you don&#x27;t really need a huge bowl.</li>
            <li>I received a CLEAR PLASTIC handle with SHARP edges (cheap plastic from where the mold didn&#x27;t break off).</li>
            <li>This took a long while to receive and although I find it useful</li>
            <li>Adore the bright colors; one suggestion I would make to the manufacturer is to consider selling a small, simple case for it to store it cohesively -- I was personally thinking of using something like a smaller square or rectangle labeled Rubbermaid container to keep all the parts stored together; a Ziploc bag will do for now though and for the price point, it is definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li>The black on the brush is cheap paint that was peeled when I received it.</li>
            <li>It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, though this didn&#x27;t bother me since it really does make the perfect amount of a mask to use on your face (I&#x27;m guilty of constantly making too much in a regular sized bowl and wasting product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use a clay mask you need to be careful that the metal doesn&#x27;t touch the clay since it causes a chemical reaction that makes the mask less effective.</li>
            <li>I use the little spatula that comes with this set to apply the mask to my face and smooth it around, which allows you to achieve the thickness needed for the mask to do</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>this product is much smaller in real life</li>
            <li>I think the bristles are way too soft for this use.</li>
            <li>I like the brush though it is really soft and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve usd it to mix homemade masks and conditioners and it&#x27;s held up well so far.</li>
            <li>The price was right, the shipping was okay, but the quality was very poor.  </li>
            <li>It is to small and it is a cheap quality.</li>
            <li>After the first use, the metal part of the brush became very loose.</li>
            <li>the black metal and the plastic handle easily comes apart and was already loose when I received the item.</li>
            <li>This set is small but more than big enough for what it is made for.</li>
            <li>It is indeed smaller than how it seems to be based on the picture, and when I received it I was a bit surprised by the toy-size.</li>
            <li>No regrets</li>
            <li>If you have a thin mask to apply it would work better in that situation</li>
            <li>It was a tiny bit smaller than I expected, but the size is right on for mixing a face mask.</li>
            <li>I avoided getting it for a long time since I don&#x27;t like adding clutter to my home, but it&#x27;s definitely very convenient to have in the bathroom, especially if you use bentonite clay on a regular basis, since they recommend a non-metal vessel to make a face pack with it.</li>
            <li>I thought the bowl and teaspoons were going to be normal size wasnt as i espected very small bowl looks more like for a little girl kitchen play set</li>
            <li>Seriously folks, just go to Walmart and just buy a cheap plastic bowl and some measuring spoons.</li>
            <li>The item is a bit flimsy and a bit smaller than expected, but for its main purpose I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s bristles when it arrived, but when you pay less than $3, you can&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>The brush was missing half of its bristles, but the rest should work fine.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good for mask as I read u shouldn&#x27;t use metal</li>
            <li> the quality is not so good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good,</li>
            <li> It does what the descriptions says it does at a great price love the color.</li>
            <li> Very cute and sturdy too and so affordable too..</li>
            <li> great product, love to use this for my Indian healing clay mask mixture.</li>
            <li> good for facials, love the bright lime color</li>
            <li> Probably will use these forever or until I need more!</li>
            <li> The measuring spoons allowed me to easily measure the product according to the instructions and the mask stick was great for mixing.</li>

            <li> and I love the size and having everything in one place and in a bright color.</li>
            <li> Nice set for the price</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes did is good for doing my face mesk</li>
            <li> I use this to make my clay face mask and found each tool has its own use.</li>
            <li> it comes in handy being that I do a lot of mask.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the brush (it doesn&#x27;t mesh too well with mud) but the measuring spoons, bowl and spatula are perfect!</li>
            <li> I often like to mix up my own DIY face masks</li>
            <li> A must have if you mix your own.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is not glued together, does not stay attached and comes apart very easily.</li>
            <li> I dont need much clay in one application so its all good!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and liked it:)</li>
            <li> It was very cheaply made and glue was smeared on the piece that holds the bristles.</li>
            <li> I love this mask set.</li>
            <li> Really better than using a cup or bowl from the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have big hopes for this considering the price, but it is awesome!</li>
            <li> Its cheap but effective.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s quite adorable though.</li>
            <li> The bowl is bendable and I love that.</li>
            <li> But it appeared to be actually the perfect size.</li>
            <li> After all, you don&#x27;t need a salad bowl for applying your face mask :)</li>
            <li> The brush is just okay</li>
            <li> love the color.  </li>
            <li> Love price and product</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure you can just re-glue it if it falls off</li>
            <li> but I was satisfied with this kit.</li>
            <li> Cute but haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li> but I do love this set</li>
            <li> My favorite color</li>
            <li> I love this for mixing face masks.</li>
            <li> I use it for clay face masks and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Cleanup was very easy, just used a baby wipe to clean up remaining residue.</li>
            <li> The bowl is the perfect size for mixing a single mask!</li>
            <li> They were smallest than I expected but worked perfect for mixing my mask.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy to use and I love the fact that the bowl is just the right size for mixing and all sorts of cosmetic things.</li>
            <li> And the brush is great quality which really surprised me--and it cleaned up easily with no stain.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for mixing facial masks, the materials worked great to get the right consistency and the brush was exactly the right size and make to apply the clay mask I use.</li>
            <li> It seems to get scratched up easily with the blending stick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong, yet somewhat pliable plastic, has a silicon-like brush, measuring spoons and a spatula.</li>
            <li> Nice product,  good tools for homemade facial masks.</li>
            <li> I used the spatula like tool to apply the mask but everything else work fine, my brush didn&#x27;t fall apart either.</li>
            <li> The small scoop is good for making spot batches for a breakout or insect bites, the medium scoop is great for making face masks, and the large scoop is perfect for making wrap or multiple masks.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect little &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; set for mixing together my Aztec mud facials.</li>
            <li> This little kit is great!</li>
            <li> The brush that comes in the kit has incredibly soft, featherweight bristles which is wonderful for on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has everything, so easy to clean</li>
            <li> The scraper mixes the mask well and makes it easy to clean up after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> The only con would be the brush which didn&#x27;t do so great at application.</li>
            <li> Cheap,</li>
            <li> it will be great if its a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful set and the green is the same as in ad pics and this is great for making my clay masks.</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> Cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> in all it gets the job done and is a very handy thing to have if you use face masks regularly.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re putting things like mud and egg whites and honey and yoghurt on your face; you don&#x27;t need rich tools to apply it, for heaven&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> First thing I thought when I saw it in person was how cute the item and its packaging was.</li>
            <li> Small, perfect size.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even worth a penny!</li>
            <li> Good size for a facial.</li>
            <li> much use it comfortably on your face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size for mixing facial masks.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Everything about this set is handy and helpful so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my clay facial mask and it has been doing a very good job so far.</li>
            <li> The brush came apart quickly though.</li>
            <li> super cute and the main reasoning for picking this kit.  </li>
            <li> I went out to buy a wider high quality paint brush to use instead of the brush that came with this; it works much better.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for your home based SPA :-)</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap and took a while to get here,</li>
            <li> The little brush works great.  </li>
            <li> Thank You for such a nice product</li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but did the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> And it has the right sizes of spoons for measuring.</li>
            <li> The price is right and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The brush picked up enough product easily and applied it smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put several little bags of clays with it, and it will make a great gift/goody bag!</li>
            <li> Love that it comes in green, matches my bathroom decor :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good set helps you with your masks instead of making a mess here</li>
            <li> Cheap soft plastic</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Includes everything you need to get the exact 1:1 ratio, mix, &amp; apply.  </li>
            <li> , I would compare it top two Chinese tea chips put together.</li>
            <li> I thought the plastic would be flexible like the first one I ordered, but its does it job.</li>
            <li> i love it, a bit small, but its ok for what i&#x27;ll use it for</li>
            <li> Brush came apart in first cleaning.</li>
            <li> Simple Bowl for mixing, love it.</li>
            <li> Bowl and mixing utensil worked well, however the brush fell apart on first use.</li>
            <li> It came in 2 days and was inexpensive yet warranted for me as I am really beginning to delve in to the &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; face/hair masks, etc.!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, however it really is perfect for mixing up my facial mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are soft and not hard plastic as you would expect form a cheap product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have little measuring cups as well</li>
            <li> and I really quite prefer it for this reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap, so the material also feel that way, especially the brush.</li>
            <li> for the price you pay, it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I can really mis the product up well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the bowl and measuring spoons.</li>
            <li> so i dont mind too much</li>
            <li> and there .. arrived as expected :)</li>
            <li> I bought mine from a seller in China without knowing and had to wait a whole month for delivery.</li>
            <li> and it has held up very well.</li>
            <li> Super cheap quality, not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little bowl for mixng small batches of things.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading other reviews people wrote about using it to mix Aztec Clay masks (clay + apple cider vinegar &#x3D; magic).</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size bowl for face mask because it&#x27;s small, about the size of a regular-sized green apple (Granny Smith).</li>
            <li> This product is 100% worth it, it&#x27;s inexpensive (less than $3 + free shipping) and the quality might feel \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; but it does the job</li>
            <li> The shipping time was decent.  </li>
            <li> The main reason why I ordered this was because of the brush that was included.</li>
            <li> However, the very first time I used it, I just pulled it out of the package and began using the brush, and it broke instantly.  </li>
            <li> This bowl is small, about 3 inches wide by just over 2 inches tall, which is perfect for whipping up your facial!</li>
            <li> The bristles are long enough that it is pretty easy to avoid getting the mixture on the metal.</li>
            <li> Love this little mixing bowl...</li>
            <li> and it was the right amount to cover my face &amp; neck, with just a bit left over to cover areas I may have missed.  </li>
            <li> It was very Low quality although they did have pretty decent customer service.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little bowl I can use for facial treatments.</li>
            <li> Glad I only spent 2.50</li>
            <li> Love this little set!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but when dealing with face masks you don&#x27;t really need a huge bowl.</li>
            <li> I received a CLEAR PLASTIC handle with SHARP edges (cheap plastic from where the mold didn&#x27;t break off).</li>
            <li> This took a long while to receive and although I find it useful</li>
            <li> Adore the bright colors; one suggestion I would make to the manufacturer is to consider selling a small, simple case for it to store it cohesively -- I was personally thinking of using something like a smaller square or rectangle labeled Rubbermaid container to keep all the parts stored together; a Ziploc bag will do for now though and for the price point, it is definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The black on the brush is cheap paint that was peeled when I received it.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, though this didn&#x27;t bother me since it really does make the perfect amount of a mask to use on your face (I&#x27;m guilty of constantly making too much in a regular sized bowl and wasting product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use a clay mask you need to be careful that the metal doesn&#x27;t touch the clay since it causes a chemical reaction that makes the mask less effective.</li>
            <li> I use the little spatula that comes with this set to apply the mask to my face and smooth it around, which allows you to achieve the thickness needed for the mask to do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> this product is much smaller in real life</li>
            <li> I think the bristles are way too soft for this use.</li>
            <li> I like the brush though it is really soft and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve usd it to mix homemade masks and conditioners and it&#x27;s held up well so far.</li>
            <li> The price was right, the shipping was okay, but the quality was very poor.  </li>
            <li> It is to small and it is a cheap quality.</li>
            <li> After the first use, the metal part of the brush became very loose.</li>
            <li> the black metal and the plastic handle easily comes apart and was already loose when I received the item.</li>
            <li> This set is small but more than big enough for what it is made for.</li>
            <li> It is indeed smaller than how it seems to be based on the picture, and when I received it I was a bit surprised by the toy-size.</li>
            <li> No regrets</li>
            <li> If you have a thin mask to apply it would work better in that situation</li>
            <li> It was a tiny bit smaller than I expected, but the size is right on for mixing a face mask.</li>
            <li> I avoided getting it for a long time since I don&#x27;t like adding clutter to my home, but it&#x27;s definitely very convenient to have in the bathroom, especially if you use bentonite clay on a regular basis, since they recommend a non-metal vessel to make a face pack with it.</li>
            <li> I thought the bowl and teaspoons were going to be normal size wasnt as i espected very small bowl looks more like for a little girl kitchen play set</li>
            <li> Seriously folks, just go to Walmart and just buy a cheap plastic bowl and some measuring spoons.</li>
            <li> The item is a bit flimsy and a bit smaller than expected, but for its main purpose I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bristles when it arrived, but when you pay less than $3, you can&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> The brush was missing half of its bristles, but the rest should work fine.</li>
            <li> Spatula and measure spoons are ok, the  bristles on the facial brush are hard and stiff as well.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED A BRUSH WITH A CLEAR PLASTIC HANDLE THAT HAS SHARP EDGES AND AN ALL WHITE BRUSH TIP.</li>
            <li> Item looks used and dirty even has some kind of strange smell , package was not sealed gonna throw in the trash</li>
            <li> , it works for now but it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the plastic package it came in was opened and only slightly closed with tape....</li>
            <li> I found it easier to smoothly combine the materials inside this small bowl rather than one with a larger surface area; the same space restriction means it dries out a little slower as well with less air contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bowl is smaller than other similar mask bowls I have used</li>
            <li> The color is definitely off, mine was a dark green rather than the vibrant neon the picture shows.</li>
            <li> and when I opened it it was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> It took a really long time for me to get this order, over a month.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive this item from overseas.</li>
            <li> It also has a long, lightweight handle which makes mixing/application easier.</li>
            <li> Be warned that this takes a very long time to arrive and is &amp;#34;petite&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> It did take a very long time to receive this item.</li>
            <li> I was mixing ACV and Calcium bentonite clay and that maybe why it became loose.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than expected! !</li>
            <li> Item was a little smaller than I thought,  and it took a long time to come.</li>
            <li> It takes up less room in a cabinet and the smaller size makes for quicker cleanup.</li>
            <li> The brush could be bigger half way through</li>
            <li> I am a bit concerned about the plastics that might be used in this product, but it has not faded or anything, so I think it is probably fine for cold mixing.</li>
            <li> It is a small hard plastic bowl, it&#x27;s decent sized for mixing up a facial mask.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a thin cheap hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Thinner material than expected but durable quality.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several from friends and family and off myself to have a few on hand as friends are always asking to borrow...</li>
            <li> Also the brush in the picture is white with a green tip..</li>
            <li> Just be careful from whom you purchase it from.</li>
            <li> The brush is kind of worthless.</li>
            <li> A brush is not very soft, but on the other hand you wont waste a lot of product as it doesn&#x27;t stay inside the brush applicator.</li>
            <li> Using it every other day..</li>
            <li> These look silly at first glance, but I have used them and used them</li>
            <li> Way to small, was not worth the extremely long wait</li>
            <li> The only reason it loses a star is for the fact that the brush has metal by the bristles.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get here, not sure how someone got it in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the money paid...shipped from China...cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Not well made, not worth the $.</li>
            <li> Also, one of the brushes faded to a pink tip instead of green?</li>
            <li> I got this product used wrapped in bubble wrap with a pink brush and green bowl.</li>
            <li> A half of brush was absent, I had to throw it.</li>
            <li> The brush is about half a size too small in my opinion (the brush is about 1/2 inch wide).</li>
            <li> The brush was missing half</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard, medium-thick bowl the size of my hand, minus my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;The brush:</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a cheap kit but that doesn&#x27;t make it worthless.</li>
            <li> I , also, purchased this set for whipping up my [[ASIN:B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing, 1 Pound]].</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Like this little set a lot!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bright green, won&#x27;t lose it!</li>
            <li> The bowl is so small you can&#x27;t even mix your face mask ingredients without them flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s useless, didn&#x27;t send it back although I should have.</li>
            <li> The bristles were ROCK HARD, you can&#x27;t even bend them,</li>
            <li> reminds me to use plastic with my bentonite clay;  Metal is not good for it.  </li>
            <li> may indicate that it was used or just poorly put together</li>
            <li> The bowl was broken when I receive it.....</li>
            <li> However, when I received the product the plastic seemed thin.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Brush is broken after 3 times of using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set 3 months ago and it has held up well, nothing has broken yet.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> metal that connected the bristles to the handle was glued poorly and may fall off</li>
            <li> Can I give an item negative stars?!!</li>
            <li> There is a reason I&#x27;m using this rather than my porcelain bowls and expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Very-very-very bad quality.</li>
            <li> but I was just disappointed about the brush.</li>
            <li> just horrible shipping,</li>

            <li> Like this little set a lot! The brush came apart quickly though.</li>
            <li> Good product and  serves  its purpose well.</li>
            <li> Way to small, was not worth the extremely long wait</li>
            <li> It has everything, so easy to clean</li>
            <li> perfect for all my beauty  proyects, recepies  and more....</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought and took forever to get to me. Glad I only spent 2.50</li>
            <li> This set of 3 is very handy so you can do several facials in a row without having to wash out your bowl and utensils.&lt;br /&gt;Bright green, won&#x27;t lose it!</li>
            <li> Cheap soft plastic but it gets the job done. My only gripe is that the plastic package it came in was opened and only slightly closed with tape.... may indicate that it was used or just poorly put together, i don&#x27;t know but I still went ahead and sterilized it all.</li>
            <li> Received it in two days and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! I use it for clay face masks and so far so good!</li>
            <li> This bowl is smaller than other similar mask bowls I have used and I really quite prefer it for this reason. It takes up less room in a cabinet and the smaller size makes for quicker cleanup. Doing a lot of clay and charcoal masks I found it easier to smoothly combine the materials inside this small bowl rather than one with a larger surface area; the same space restriction means it dries out a little slower as well with less air contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cheap kit but that doesn&#x27;t make it worthless. I can&#x27;t bear to wonder why people complain about the quality for something that costs $2 with shipping included. There is a reason I&#x27;m using this rather than my porcelain bowls and expensive brushes. You&#x27;re putting things like mud and egg whites and honey and yoghurt on your face; you don&#x27;t need rich tools to apply it, for heaven&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy to use and I love the fact that the bowl is just the right size for mixing and all sorts of cosmetic things.</li>
            <li> I love this mask set. This set is small but more than big enough for what it is made for. I use mine to make clay masks with bentonite clay. The scraper mixes the mask well and makes it easy to clean up after I&#x27;m done. The small scoop is good for making spot batches for a breakout or insect bites, the medium scoop is great for making face masks, and the large scoop is perfect for making wrap or multiple masks. The only reason it loses a star is for the fact that the brush has metal by the bristles. If you use a clay mask you need to be careful that the metal doesn&#x27;t touch the clay since it causes a chemical reaction that makes the mask less effective. The bristles are long enough that it is pretty easy to avoid getting the mixture on the metal.</li>
            <li> The brush looked used with scraping on the metal part.  Also the brush bristles looks as if someone cut the left corner of it.  It looks used.</li>
            <li> The bowl was broken when I receive it.....</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size bowl for face mask because it&#x27;s small, about the size of a regular-sized green apple (Granny Smith). It&#x27;s really cheap, so the material also feel that way, especially the brush. the black metal and the plastic handle easily comes apart and was already loose when I received the item. However, you can force it back on and it&#x27;ll stay. for the price you pay, it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> The color is definitely off, mine was a dark green rather than the vibrant neon the picture shows. Also, one of the brushes faded to a pink tip instead of green? However this is not a big deal. It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, though this didn&#x27;t bother me since it really does make the perfect amount of a mask to use on your face (I&#x27;m guilty of constantly making too much in a regular sized bowl and wasting product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it gets the job done and is a very handy thing to have if you use face masks regularly.</li>
            <li> Love this little set! Love that it comes in green, matches my bathroom decor :)</li>
            <li> It was very Low quality although they did have pretty decent customer service.</li>
            <li> The brush is about half a size too small in my opinion (the brush is about 1/2 inch wide). I went out to buy a wider high quality paint brush to use instead of the brush that came with this; it works much better.</li>
            <li> This is a toy-sized item. I must have missed the dimensions when I bought this. I wanted it to mix my bentonite and hibiscus clay hair applique.  No go!  Way too tiny!</li>
            <li> Really better than using a cup or bowl from the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Thank you. This is a nice little bowl I can use for facial treatments. Great doing buisiness with you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have big hopes for this considering the price, but it is awesome! The bowl is the perfect size for mixing a single mask! And it has the right sizes of spoons for measuring. And the brush is great quality which really surprised me--and it cleaned up easily with no stain.&lt;br /&gt;Since it is so functional and cute--I&#x27;m ordering a bunch of these for girls night at my house! I&#x27;ll put several little bags of clays with it, and it will make a great gift/goody bag!</li>
            <li> It was the correct product, however, it took a lengthy amount of time to receive.  Way longer then ever anticipated.</li>
            <li> Another thing I&#x27;ve been looking for the longest time. i can finally put my facial creams in this.</li>
            <li> The item is a bit flimsy and a bit smaller than expected, but for its main purpose I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> reminds me to use plastic with my bentonite clay;  Metal is not good for it.  Simple inexpensive items.  The little brush works great.  The spoon or spatula is good for smashing out the lumps.</li>
            <li> this product is much smaller in real life lol...... but hey.  I dont need much clay in one application so its all good!  Kinda cute when u get used to it. :D</li>
            <li> Great for what it is! a bowl and tools to mix facial masks with. i use all the tools in it and the scoops are perfect for measuring the amount of liquid vs clay mask stuff needed to make an amazing mask! :]</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do. Thinner material than expected but durable quality. The brush is kind of worthless.</li>
            <li> I got this product used wrapped in bubble wrap with a pink brush and green bowl. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> Perfect for my DIY bentonite clay mask! Its cheap but effective.</li>
            <li> Good size for a facial. The brush could be bigger half way through I used the spatula like tool to apply the mask but everything else work fine, my brush didn&#x27;t fall apart either. Took a long time to get here, not sure how someone got it in 2 days. Will buy another brush</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here and when I opened it it was smaller than expected. I think it&#x27;s quite adorable though. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for mixing facial masks, the materials worked great to get the right consistency and the brush was exactly the right size and make to apply the clay mask I use. It&#x27;s nice to have little measuring cups as well so I can have equal parts of ingredients.</li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive to the product is very good. It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but when dealing with face masks you don&#x27;t really need a huge bowl. I would buy again, but as I said delivery does take a while.</li>
            <li> Nice set for the price but it took forever to receive.</li>
            <li> The shipping time was decent.  However, when I received the product the plastic seemed thin. (Which you get what you pay for) However, the very first time I used it, I just pulled it out of the package and began using the brush, and it broke instantly.  The price was right, the shipping was okay, but the quality was very poor.  I&#x27;d suggest looking somewhere else before buying this product.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in conjunction with my Aztec Healing Clay Mask.  Includes everything you need to get the exact 1:1 ratio, mix, &amp; apply.  I used the larger measuring spoon and it was the right amount to cover my face &amp; neck, with just a bit left over to cover areas I may have missed.  The brush picked up enough product easily and applied it smoothly.  Cleanup was very easy, just used a baby wipe to clean up remaining residue.</li>
            <li> I just used this for my Bentonite Clay Mask and it was perfect. This is the perfect little bowl for mixng small batches of things. The bowl is bendable and I love that. It makes me feel like I can really mis the product up well. The measuring spoons allowed me to easily measure the product according to the instructions and the mask stick was great for mixing. The only con would be the brush which didn&#x27;t do so great at application. I think the bristles are way too soft for this use. If you have a thin mask to apply it would work better in that situation but if you&#x27;re looking for the bowl and spoons, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive. Smaller than expected, however it really is perfect for mixing up my facial mask.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. The brush was missing half it&#x27;s bristles when it arrived, but when you pay less than $3, you can&#x27;t expect too much. I really wanted the bowl and measuring spoons.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but will work. The brush was missing half of its bristles, but the rest should work fine.</li>
            <li> Good price and good quality and compact item. It does what the descriptions says it does at a great price love the color.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading other reviews people wrote about using it to mix Aztec Clay masks (clay + apple cider vinegar &#x3D; magic). These clay masks (Aztec Indian Healing Clay) are supposed to be mixed in plastic (not glass or metal) and mixed up well before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that mixing the mask in this plastic with the tools in this set allowed me to whip the mask into a perfect consistency and the brush and stick helped me get an even and cleaner application. Sold! I even bought a second set for my sister.  This product is 100% worth it, it&#x27;s inexpensive (less than $3 + free shipping) and the quality might feel \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; but it does the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a photo so you can see the size with a quarter for context. It was a tiny bit smaller than I expected, but the size is right on for mixing a face mask.</li>
            <li> This is all you need to prepare your mask.  I use it with the Indian Healing Clay and all I need is there.  The price is right and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than expected! !</li>
            <li> Cheap, but I can still use it. Packaging came covered in dust</li>
            <li> it will be great if its a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I like it, the bowl is smaller than I anticipated but it doesn&#x27;t need to be big, I would compare it top two Chinese tea chips put together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and liked it:)</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Brush is broken after 3 times of using it.</li>
            <li> It is a small hard plastic bowl, it&#x27;s decent sized for mixing up a facial mask. Came with 3 spoons, brush and applicator thing like pictured. The brush was a piece of junk which I threw away upon opening up the package. It was very cheaply made and glue was smeared on the piece that holds the bristles. Also, it took forever to arrive!! Seriously folks, just go to Walmart and just buy a cheap plastic bowl and some measuring spoons.</li>
            <li> Great set for mask application. A brush is not very soft, but on the other hand you wont waste a lot of product as it doesn&#x27;t stay inside the brush applicator. Highly recommend it for your home based SPA :-)</li>
            <li> I am not too fascinated with the bowl. It seems to get scratched up easily with the blending stick. I like the brush though it is really soft and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin (:</li>
            <li> Be warned that this takes a very long time to arrive and is &amp;#34;petite&amp;#34;...now the great news! It&#x27;s a wonderful set and the green is the same as in ad pics and this is great for making my clay masks. I may get another for dying eyebrows and/or bleaching facial hair. It&#x27;s a strong, yet somewhat pliable plastic, has a silicon-like brush, measuring spoons and a spatula. This is really great. It was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> The size is just perfect for the purpose! It is indeed smaller than how it seems to be based on the picture, and when I received it I was a bit surprised by the toy-size. But it appeared to be actually the perfect size. After all, you don&#x27;t need a salad bowl for applying your face mask :)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes did is good for doing my face mesk</li>
            <li> I thought the plastic would be flexible like the first one I ordered, but its does it job.</li>
            <li> good for facials, love the bright lime color</li>
            <li> Good for mask as I read u shouldn&#x27;t use metal</li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> It just perfect. You don&#x27;t need any instructions because it&#x27;s so simple to use. It&#x27;s perfect for us who are into D.I.Y beauty treatments</li>
            <li> Very cute and sturdy too and so affordable too.. Using it every other day.. Thank You for such a nice product</li>
            <li> Cheap but will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Love , love  this !!! It&#x27;s a must have for you&#x27;re masks to apply with ease !!! I have purchased several from friends and family and off myself to have a few on hand as friends are always asking to borrow...</li>
            <li> This bowl is small, about 3 inches wide by just over 2 inches tall, which is perfect for whipping up your facial! I , also, purchased this set for whipping up my [[ASIN:B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing, 1 Pound]]. If you did too, DON&#x27;T USE THE BRUSH in this set because it has a metal ferrule - you are to avoid using metals during all steps of the Aztec facial. I use the little spatula that comes with this set to apply the mask to my face and smooth it around, which allows you to achieve the thickness needed for the mask to do it&#x27;s job.  This was a great buy that I&#x27;m very happy with! It did take a very long time to receive this item.</li>
            <li> the quality is not so good. I wish I never buy this again!</li>
            <li> First thing I thought when I saw it in person was how cute the item and its packaging was. I use this to make my clay face mask and found each tool has its own use. Small, perfect size. I just wish it came in blue!</li>
            <li> Brush fell apart when I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my clay facial mask and it has been doing a very good job so far. I purchased this set 3 months ago and it has held up well, nothing has broken yet. Definitely a good buy for the money!</li>
            <li> Plastic material it&#x27;s good, im giving it a 3 stars because the brush that came with it came off but for the price wath can you expect...</li>
            <li> It took awhile to receive the set, it came from Hong Kong, but it is&lt;br /&gt;great for mixing and applying my Aztec Clay mask. Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but it works just fine. shipping takes forever.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. The black on the brush is cheap paint that was peeled when I received it. The bowl is so small you can&#x27;t even mix your face mask ingredients without them flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and plenty of tools. The brush is just okay, it works for now but it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is not glued together, does not stay attached and comes apart very easily. The bristles were ROCK HARD, you can&#x27;t even bend them, much use it comfortably on your face! Also not that it mattered to me but the brush tip was pink, not green as shown in the picture. This isn&#x27;t even worth a penny! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Great utensils for making masks or doing whatever! Great shipping time and awesome packaging! Probably will use these forever or until I need more! Great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller thank what I thought it would be but I like it. It does its job.</li>
            <li> i love it, a bit small, but its ok for what i&#x27;ll use it for and it arrived on time!!</li>
            <li> Product received is not what was advertised. In the description it says the brush is a wooden handle. I received a CLEAR PLASTIC handle with SHARP edges (cheap plastic from where the mold didn&#x27;t break off). Also the brush in the picture is white with a green tip.. super cute and the main reasoning for picking this kit.  I RECEIVED A BRUSH WITH A CLEAR PLASTIC HANDLE THAT HAS SHARP EDGES AND AN ALL WHITE BRUSH TIP.</li>
            <li> I thought the bowl and teaspoons were going to be normal size wasnt as i espected very small bowl looks more like for a little girl kitchen play set but you get what you pay for so i dont mind too much it will still do the job</li>
            <li> basic tools for anyone who is thinking of trying some DIY masks</li>
            <li> love the color.  be prepared for the bowl to be smaller than you expect but it does the job so it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s a good size for mixing facial masks. Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Time saver when having to make and apply a facial mask. I recommend it if you are looking to buy it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for mixing the clay mask.</li>
            <li> Item was a little smaller than I thought,  and it took a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Great with easy to use features. Perfect for DIY beauty treatment.</li>
            <li> This took a long while to receive and although I find it useful I think it could be sold at a cheaper price for the quality.</li>
            <li> Love price and product</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but did the job perfectly. It&#x27;s a hard, medium-thick bowl the size of my hand, minus my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;The brush: metal that connected the bristles to the handle was glued poorly and may fall off (mine didn&#x27;t but I read a lot of reviews where their&#x27;s did) but I&#x27;m sure you can just re-glue it if it falls off and it&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and not hard plastic as you would expect form a cheap product but I was satisfied with this kit.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected and it&#x27;s a thin cheap hard plastic. It was delivered with a dent in the bowl. I will probably use it once and throw it away. Spatula and measure spoons are ok, the  bristles on the facial brush are hard and stiff as well.</li>
            <li> Very-very-very bad quality. A half of brush was absent, I had to throw it.</li>
            <li> Cood tools for the price</li>
            <li> Item looks used and dirty even has some kind of strange smell , package was not sealed gonna throw in the trash</li>
            <li> It took a really long time for me to get this order, over a month. The bristles of the brush were glued together so it&#x27;s useless, didn&#x27;t send it back although I should have.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the money paid...shipped from China...cheaply made.  Brush came apart in first cleaning. Can I give an item negative stars?!!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Not well made, not worth the $.</li>
            <li> As advertised and perfect for our needs.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap and took a while to get here, but I&#x27;ve usd it to mix homemade masks and conditioners and it&#x27;s held up well so far. I am a bit concerned about the plastics that might be used in this product, but it has not faded or anything, so I think it is probably fine for cold mixing.</li>
            <li> It is to small and it is a cheap quality.Please send me the return receipt</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Cute but haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li> Took over 2 MONTHS to receive!!!!!!!!!. just horrible shipping, but I do love this set it comes in handy being that I do a lot of mask.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I ordered this was because of the brush that was included. After the first use, the metal part of the brush became very loose. I was mixing ACV and Calcium bentonite clay and that maybe why it became loose. It serves its purpose but I was just disappointed about the brush.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought. Shipping takes forever.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect little &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; set for mixing together my Aztec mud facials. I don&#x27;t really care for the brush (it doesn&#x27;t mesh too well with mud) but the measuring spoons, bowl and spatula are perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice product,  good tools for homemade facial masks.</li>
            <li> Simple Bowl for mixing, love it.</li>
            <li> Cheap and does the job. I avoided getting it for a long time since I don&#x27;t like adding clutter to my home, but it&#x27;s definitely very convenient to have in the bathroom, especially if you use bentonite clay on a regular basis, since they recommend a non-metal vessel to make a face pack with it.</li>
            <li> it does what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> Works great for price. I actually use the spatula for both mixing and applying the mud mask. it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive this item from overseas. Bowl and mixing utensil worked well, however the brush fell apart on first use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good set helps you with your masks instead of making a mess here and there .. arrived as expected :)</li>
            <li> I use this for facial masks. It does the job and has all the key tools needed. It&#x27;s cheap and does the job. Just be careful from whom you purchase it from. I bought mine from a seller in China without knowing and had to wait a whole month for delivery.</li>
            <li> They were smallest than I expected but worked perfect for mixing my mask.</li>
            <li> For the price, this kit is really great!  I often like to mix up my own DIY face masks so this was the perfect addition to my supplies :)</li>
            <li> These look silly at first glance, but I have used them and used them and I love the size and having everything in one place and in a bright color.</li>
            <li> This little kit is great! It came in 2 days and was inexpensive yet warranted for me as I am really beginning to delve in to the &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; face/hair masks, etc.! The brush that comes in the kit has incredibly soft, featherweight bristles which is wonderful for on my sensitive skin. It also has a long, lightweight handle which makes mixing/application easier. Everything about this set is handy and helpful so far and it has held up very well. Adore the bright colors; one suggestion I would make to the manufacturer is to consider selling a small, simple case for it to store it cohesively -- I was personally thinking of using something like a smaller square or rectangle labeled Rubbermaid container to keep all the parts stored together; a Ziploc bag will do for now though and for the price point, it is definitely worth it for me. Would buy again, definitely!</li>
            <li> Love this little mixing bowl...</li>
            <li> Great mixing tools for my clay mask sold at a great price.</li>
            <li> My favorite color and it&#x27;s perfect with the Aztec healing clay and apple cidar vinegar. Best face mask I&#x27;ve ever used- and I can make it myself!</li>
            <li> It is really great!! No regrets</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my clay mask!</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while but it works as needed!</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixing my bentonite clay masks to help treat me eczema.</li>
            <li> Disappoint with the size.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a starter like me.</li>
            <li> thank you!! great product, love to use this for my Indian healing clay mask mixture.</li>
            <li> I love this for mixing face masks. A must have if you mix your own.</li>
            <li> Super cheap quality, not worth it.</li>
