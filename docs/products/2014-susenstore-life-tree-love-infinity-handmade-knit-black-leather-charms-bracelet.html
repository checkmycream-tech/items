            <li>and I knew she would love it.</li>
            <li>This bracelet means something to me with the infinity sign, the word love, and the tree, which is a symbol in my clan Anderson.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and fashionable.</li>
            <li>&gt; is more like pleather, stretches with body heat.</li>
            <li>Love the bracelet but the chain part keeps breaking</li>
            <li>The lobster claw closer makes for a more secure clasp.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made but cute.</li>

            <li>slightly loose fit, but over all happy with purchase</li>
            <li>It showed up super fast!!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a leather bracelet that combined the tree of life and the infinity symbol together as each holds a special place in my heart.</li>
            <li>It was pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Pretty design, but cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It will make a nice gift for a teenage girl</li>
            <li>I think that the teen I bought it for will be thrilled.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>The clasp and the chain the clasp connects to is very cheap and flimsy, but if I am careful it will do just fine.</li>
            <li>I really like this braclet its very pretty.</li>
            <li>clasps break easily....but other than that very cute bracelet</li>
            <li>This broke within the first 10 hours of me owning it.  </li>
            <li>I would purchase more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>its really cute but keeps falling off every once in a while because the hook is loose and the bracket kept falling off</li>
            <li>I know that it is  inexpensive, and  all that, yet, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE IT and WEAR it to much</li>
            <li>I will try to fix it somehow, because I really like it.</li>
            <li>will be getting more in the near future.</li>
            <li>Better then the other one I got.</li>
            <li>It is good for a few wears but not daily wearing.</li>
            <li>But it is a cute little costume piece.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s cheap but just a little trinket</li>
            <li>I do suspect this to last forever, but that is ok for the little bit of $$ I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I fixed it though for like $2 at walmart.</li>
            <li>And older kid that would not likely put it in their mouth.</li>

            <li> its really cute but keeps falling off every once in a while because the hook is loose and the bracket kept falling off and i keep having to re hook the braclet.</li>
            <li> This broke within the first 10 hours of me owning it.  It was pretty cheap but I am still Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really like this braclet its very pretty. Not cheaply made. It will make a nice gift for a teenage girl</li>
            <li> Bought as gifts for middle school age kiddos. They love the them!</li>

            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect this to be as nice as it is.  I would purchase more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my best friend and she loves it. She wears it everyday and it has not worn out. Great quality at a great price. I would recommend it for yourself or a friend. I also bought myself a few bracelets as well different designs. I love them all!!!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely charm bracelet. I was looking for a leather bracelet that combined the tree of life and the infinity symbol together as each holds a special place in my heart. The love charm was a great addition to the find. The lobster claw closer makes for a more secure clasp. I would recommend this bracelet.</li>
            <li> Pretty design, but cheaply made. It tore up in less than a week. Just the piece at the end that holds all strands together is garbage. I fixed it though for like $2 at walmart. Put different end on it and I think it looks nicer now.</li>
            <li> Nice product and the 2 kids that got them love them. It took a little bit for them to come in the mail.</li>
            <li> I bought this to give to my niece who likes tower stuff like this. It is cute and I knew she would love it.</li>
            <li> This bracelet means something to me with the infinity sign, the word love, and the tree, which is a symbol in my clan Anderson.  I know that it is  inexpensive, and  all that, yet, I really like it.  Since it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet, I&#x27;m going to wear it until it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and fashionable. I wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> Had I known this was being shipped from China I would not have ordered .. The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; is more like pleather, stretches with body heat. Chain is flimsy  flimsy flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Good as a dress up toy for a kid.. .....  And older kid that would not likely put it in their mouth.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT and WEAR it to much I wish you have another one a difference color WHEN can I get another one</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Wore it once and it broke.</li>
            <li> It took over a month to recieve, and after I got the product discovered it had  no clasp. Very disappointed, was so looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made but cute. It is good for a few wears but not daily wearing. Better then the other one I got.</li>
            <li> It is a nice looking bracelet, too bad it broke after 5 minutes of wearing it. I will try to fix it somehow, because I really like it.</li>
            <li> Love the bracelet but the chain part keeps breaking</li>
            <li> I love this style of bracelet, the three charms are just the right size and it fits perfectly.  All findings are firmly attached.  A lot of quality for a small price.</li>
            <li> slightly loose fit, but over all happy with purchase</li>
            <li> The front of the bracelet are well made and attractive.  The clasp is solid but not attached all that well.  Then again it is an inexpensive piece.  Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> clasps break easily....but other than that very cute bracelet</li>
