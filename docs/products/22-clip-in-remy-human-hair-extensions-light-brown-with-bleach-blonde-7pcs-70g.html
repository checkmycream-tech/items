            <li>Very nice hair</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, the way the hair pieces are put together  hair pieces are already falling out andat the top part is already coming apart</li>
            <li>and she was pretty impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly think I&#x27;d need to get a good 3 sets and sew them together myself before I was satisfied....</li>
            <li>it can be washed and curled loved it:)</li>
            <li>love them I could get more.</li>
            <li>but like most ordered hair extensions, stringiness is hit n miss.  </li>
            <li>We are satisfied with the amount of extensions and the quality.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna order another one soon :)</li>
            <li>I love this hairpiece it blend into my hair color  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>so id recommend buying some thing of better quality and thickness.</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>However, you can fit 6 packages on your scalp.</li>
            <li>The track is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>And the kids had a fun time pretending they had mullets!</li>
            <li>Matched my hair color perfectly but comes in super thin layers.</li>
            <li>These extensions are long and beautiful and very pretty and soft.  </li>
            <li>I liked the color a lot, and tried to have my hair dresser actually match my hair to the color of the extensions.</li>
            <li>Very pretty came much faster that predicted</li>
            <li>They hold very well!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we were anticipating.</li>
            <li>First off its not even connected together.</li>
            <li>When I first got them I wasn&#x27;t even sure if they were human hair or synthetic.</li>
            <li>I caucasion with dark blonde natural hair and the texture and color blend perfectly!!</li>
            <li>but other then that is  nice</li>
            <li>but you have the buy 2 packs and the color was really off.</li>
            <li>And the clips do not hold onto your real hair AT ALL.</li>
            <li>Had originally paid $20 extra for express shipping 3-5 days from China but the seller refunded that to me when they didn&#x27;t get sent.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 sets as 1 would not be enough to make a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Wife purchased this to get a little more hair for a wedding</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like bleach blonde with a few light brown low lights.</li>
            <li>Go to your local Sally&#x27;s beauty supply same color and quality hair for more hair the same price</li>
            <li>But the color was NO WHERE near what was pictured.</li>
            <li>Ordered several times &amp; shipping is fast..</li>
            <li>I ordered brown with blonde high lights.</li>
            <li>, IT CANNOT BE TONED OR EVEN BLEACHED, IT ALSO SECRETLY CHARGES 30 MORE BUCKS WHEN U ALREADY PAY FOR IT,</li>
            <li>Mine are pretty stringy, so I&#x27;ll have to play around with them a little bit to fix that</li>
            <li>I ordered brown with blonde highlights and I got a light blonde with a few dark blonde highlights</li>

            <li> I ordered brown with blonde highlights and I got a light blonde with a few dark blonde highlights</li>
            <li> Are they really long, or about medium length?</li>
            <li> These were pretty thin.  </li>
            <li> Thinner than expected.</li>
            <li> I 100% TOTALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND, ITS NOT HUMAN HAIR, IT IS HEAT 100% HEAT RESISTANT JAPANESE FIBER, AND IT IS VERY THIN</li>
            <li> So for the price of buying two sets and having to do the work myself they are not worth it.</li>
            <li> They have synthetic hair added into what little hair is there, so you can&#x27;t use heat on them.</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> I thought this would actually be to my advantage because I have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> You will get a bunch of pieces and its so thin that you look like you have parts of your hair thats longer than the other.</li>
            <li> it is a little thin</li>
            <li> and i find the clip ins cause the least amount of damage</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> If you have medium to thick hair, you&#x27;ll need probably 3 sets.</li>
            <li> They look thick in the image</li>
            <li> said they were thin.</li>
            <li> However these are wayyy too thin.</li>
            <li> These are SO thin.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t blend them, because they&#x27;re literally too thin to cut.</li>
            <li> But unless I curled my hair to blend them, they looked awkward and thin comparatively to the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Just received these not what I was expecting if you order these you need to order 2 packs very thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn clip in extensions for years now and I bought these for the price, very thin</li>
            <li> These extensions are very thin.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t bad for the price.  </li>
            <li> Worst extensions ever!</li>
            <li> I was very very unhappy!!!</li>

            <li> love them I could get more.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and I honestly think I&#x27;d need to get a good 3 sets and sew them together myself before I was satisfied....not even that but so it looks like my hair. The quality isn&#x27;t bad for the price.  But the color was NO WHERE near what was pictured. I ordered brown with blonde high lights. It&#x27;s more like bleach blonde with a few light brown low lights.</li>
            <li> They match my hair color...but like most ordered hair extensions, stringiness is hit n miss.  Mine are pretty stringy, so I&#x27;ll have to play around with them a little bit to fix that</li>
            <li> I have worn hair extensions for over 10 years.  i have done tape, glue, mircro rings, wefts, cornrows and i find the clip ins cause the least amount of damage and i can make the hair last longer as i don&#x27;t sleep in them and can take them out and condition them well.  These extensions are long and beautiful and very pretty and soft.  I wish they were double wefts as they are singles sewed to the clips.  The clips are awesome.  The best clips I have ever had!  They hold very well!  I bought 2 sets as 1 would not be enough to make a full head of hair.  2 is perfect and the length is awesome.  The mixture of color is awesome as well.  Had originally paid $20 extra for express shipping 3-5 days from China but the seller refunded that to me when they didn&#x27;t get sent.  I have no complaints!  Really beautiful hair at a great price!!  I caucasion with dark blonde natural hair and the texture and color blend perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Just received these not what I was expecting if you order these you need to order 2 packs very thin</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were anticipating. We are satisfied with the amount of extensions and the quality. The color is just as it appears as well.</li>
            <li> Are they really long, or about medium length?</li>
            <li> Very pretty came much faster that predicted</li>
            <li> These were pretty thin.  If you have medium to thick hair, you&#x27;ll need probably 3 sets.</li>
            <li> Matched my hair color perfectly but comes in super thin layers. I had to but another set and sew them together. So for the price of buying two sets and having to do the work myself they are not worth it. Go to your local Sally&#x27;s beauty supply same color and quality hair for more hair the same price</li>
            <li> Used them for my daughters hair for prom and they worked and looked great!</li>
            <li> I love them but you have the buy 2 packs and the color was really off. I ordered brown with blonde highlights and I got a light blonde with a few dark blonde highlights</li>
            <li> Thinner than expected. I have fairly fine hair, but a lot of it. I liked the color a lot, and tried to have my hair dresser actually match my hair to the color of the extensions. But unless I curled my hair to blend them, they looked awkward and thin comparatively to the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Worst extensions ever!</li>
            <li> Loved it! I&#x27;m gonna order another one soon :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn clip in extensions for years now and I bought these for the price, very thin and I&#x27;ve worn them once and two clips broke already and another fell off.</li>
            <li> It did not even look like what I saw in the picture. First off its not even connected together. You will get a bunch of pieces and its so thin that you look like you have parts of your hair thats longer than the other. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this hairpiece it blend into my hair color  it can be washed and curled loved it:)</li>
            <li> I read in the reviews before I bought these and a lot of problem said they were thin. I thought this would actually be to my advantage because I have very thin hair. However these are wayyy too thin. Even for me. You definitely get what you pay for with these.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair it is a little thin but other then that is  nice</li>
            <li> I was very very unhappy!!!</li>
            <li> Love these. I wear them everyday. Durable and a perfect match to my own hair. Ordered several times &amp; shipping is fast..even tho they come from China.</li>
            <li> These extensions are very thin. They look thick in the image but they are not. If you are purchasing these to add length, you will need to order multiple packages. I have medium thickness hair and in order for them to blend to my hair, id need about 6 packages. However, you can fit 6 packages on your scalp. so id recommend buying some thing of better quality and thickness.</li>
            <li> These are SO thin. You can&#x27;t blend them, because they&#x27;re literally too thin to cut. They have synthetic hair added into what little hair is there, so you can&#x27;t use heat on them. The track is cheaply made. And the clips do not hold onto your real hair AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not buy again. When I first got them I wasn&#x27;t even sure if they were human hair or synthetic. The color is beautiful, the way the hair pieces are put together  hair pieces are already falling out andat the top part is already coming apart</li>
            <li> Wife purchased this to get a little more hair for a wedding and she was pretty impressed with it.  And the kids had a fun time pretending they had mullets!</li>
            <li> Good product. Very good communication.  Hope to deal with you again.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I 100% TOTALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND, ITS NOT HUMAN HAIR, IT IS HEAT 100% HEAT RESISTANT JAPANESE FIBER, AND IT IS VERY THIN AND IT DOESNT HOLD A CURL WELL ENOUGH, IT CANNOT BE TONED OR EVEN BLEACHED, IT ALSO SECRETLY CHARGES 30 MORE BUCKS WHEN U ALREADY PAY FOR IT, IM SO MISSERALBY</li>
