            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my head and honestly I can understand why she doesn&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li>She even asks to brush her own hair.</li>
            <li>Works great on my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair</li>
            <li>The best thing about this brush is that somehow it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the tangles at all, so even my 3 year old will let me use this brush with no tears.  </li>
            <li>better, it&#x27;s a wonderful tool for teaching my four year old self care.</li>

            <li>(mostly b/c</li>
            <li>When she does, I will be sure to report back.&lt;br /&gt;BUY</li>
            <li>I think someone at Hogwarts was involved in this because there&#x27;s definitely magic here.</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>My kids love it and insist I use it when brushing there hair.</li>
            <li>Even on days when we were able to get the tangles out</li>

            <li>This is simply the best thing ever.  </li>
            <li>It works just okay for my daughter.</li>
            <li>We found an inexpensive brush at Walmart that works much better.</li>
            <li>I used to have to load up her hair with conditioner before being able to attempt to comb her hair.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it does get the tangles out better then</li>
            <li>Figures :)</li>
            <li>Knot Genie Detangling Brush (Puff of Purple)]]I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>Nothing to make it look like it could do anything better than the brushes and combs</li>
            <li>However, strictly as a detangling brush used as part of your routine, it is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>thanks, Knot Genie, for a truly wonderful product, that comes in lots of fun colors for your child to choose from. :)</li>
            <li>I think because it fits the contours of their hand more than anything else.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>Just love this brush.</li>
            <li>While the Knot Genie isn&#x27;t some miracle brush that makes every brushing a breeze, it is certainly better than a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush and does make the process easier.  </li>
            <li>I am in awe at how this brush is able to effortlessly untangle her hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is very fine and tangles easily</li>
            <li>It glides thru her hair smoothly and makes the morning fits of fixing her hair more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>It was so nice and pleasant not to feel like I was hurting her for something that has  to be done daily</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li>I tried it on my own hair before trying it on hers to see what if it really did detangle without pulling</li>
            <li>me, I noticed that starting at the top of her head was more effective.  </li>
            <li>She gave us a fit all the time.</li>
            <li>I even tried it on my own hair and didn&#x27;t think it handles hair any differently than my own brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and daughters after watching them tear hair when brushing/combing (they have beautiful long hair).  </li>
            <li>Whole strands of hair!!!  </li>
            <li>and/or dads) need to know how well this works!&lt;br /&gt;I was able to remove a rather large snarl (aka \\&quot;rats</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t look special at all</li>
            <li>My mom is as convinced as I am that this is a true miracle.</li>
            <li>Overall good</li>
            <li>Gets the knots out quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>I have a girl who&#x27;s hair is super curly.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, it&#x27;s always super knotty when she wakes up.  </li>
            <li>and she got almost every rat out on her first try!  </li>
            <li>The Knot Genie seems to be the step between the baby brush and a more adult brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thin, Shirley Temple curls and this brush works great!  </li>
            <li>worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This brush is interesting because the bristles are just plastic and much skinnier/smaller than most brushes, along with the fact that they alternate in length, which probably help with the pulling part that hurts.</li>
            <li>We liked it enough to buy another.</li>
            <li>They work ok, bigger ones fit better in your palm and worked a little better.</li>
            <li>Dont be fooled, this brush will not make all your detangling dreams come true, but its a MUCH better alternative to a regular brush.</li>
            <li>You have to spend more time brushing, but I don&#x27;t mind because its not nearly as painful as using a regular brush.</li>
            <li>I am confident that she will eventually be able to use this herself in the near future.</li>
            <li>Because it is wide and oval shaped, it would be nice to have a soft handle on top of the brush (perhaps an elastic handle)</li>
            <li>good for most tangles, not recommended for very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Now she even tries to brush her own hair with it.</li>
            <li>With this she wasn&#x27;t even aware I was brushing her hair.</li>
            <li>So I clicked on it and heard of Knot Genie for the first time.</li>
            <li>I should have ordered this brush the moment I first laid eyes on it.</li>
            <li>It is great for untangling my daughters thick hair.</li>
            <li>Though We are completely tear free all the time-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li>Even so, it&#x27;s still better than any standard brush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this brush does a better job than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>it really only works well when her hair (which is medium weight, fine texture and wavy) when it is soaked with detangler or freshly washed</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to brush her hair and not have to chase her to sit back down.</li>
            <li>nest\\&quot; LOL) from the back of my four year old daughter&#x27;s waist length, moderately curly hair (think Rapunzel in training).</li>
            <li>BUT, much to my surprise, it did exactly what it said it would do.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this brush no more tears while brushing my daughters long curly hair Highly recommend for people with very sensitive scalps</li>
            <li>Works great on wet or dry hair!</li>
            <li>She even likes to gently brush my hair w/ it when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>It does really seem to do a number on tangles.</li>
            <li>This brush has made it much easier to deal with the knots in her hair.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>The knot genie has made it so much easier.  </li>
            <li>they really like this brush and prefer using it.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t get the whole way through the thickness of the hair.</li>
            <li>my husband wants one for himself.</li>
            <li>Works really, really well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Wish I would have looked at the size more closely as this is way too big for our 4yr old&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This brush is really great at first I was skeptical about it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>My daughters hair was tangle free and ready to blow dry in under two minutes.</li>
            <li>The main reason I got</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, but for us it was a bust.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I did not order for a few more months.</li>
            <li>my other brush without huge clumps of hair</li>
            <li>One day on facebook I saw an ad for a new hair brush for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I sent my daughter to my moms house for a week with the new brush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very sensitive headed and this causes no pain</li>
            <li>Brushing my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s curly curly hair after a bath used to be a 45 minute nightmare!  </li>
            <li>I have four girls and doing their hair in the morning is no small task.  </li>
            <li>I use the knot genie first to detangle then use a regular brush with ease.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d have preferred the smaller one, but LOVE the fact that we have one less argument everyday was well worth it in my book!!</li>
            <li>I will need to buy more of them, the complete family uses, even the boys who usually don&#x27;t like a brush.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this brush would make hair detangling painless for the little ones&#x27; fine hair but besides not having a brush handle, not sure how this is different than my own drug store bought hair brush.</li>
            <li>If your child has a sensitive scalp, you might want to go a little easy when brushing that area.  </li>
            <li>The top layer of hair got brushed, but it never touched the bottom layer of hair leaving a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li>I was certain I was going to be sending this product back.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many different brushes we went through before we found this little piece of heaven.</li>
            <li>it was for when my husband brushes our 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a complete 180 degrees from where we were.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 14 years old</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: bought for four year old daughter who gets lots of knots despite conditioner and detangling spray and blowdrying hair before bed, etc., etc...  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my young daughters who both have waist length hair.</li>
            <li>My 18 month old loves this brush.</li>
            <li>but the bristles are MUCH stiffer, so it&#x27;s much more painful to use than our original.</li>
            <li>on wet hair right out of the bathtub.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve made changes to the design, or if this is a look-a-like that missed the mark, but it definitely causes more discomfort for my girls than our old Knot Genie.</li>
            <li>Wish it had some sort of a handle , kind of hard to do on long hair</li>
            <li>The baby brushes were just ok when she was smaller, but now they seem to do very little with the longer hair.  </li>
            <li>But it does not get the tangles out of hair as easily as stated, and it is hard to old on to.  </li>
            <li>and I ordered a new one today because the old one finally but the dust..</li>
            <li>Daughter still fusses when I brush her hair with it but not near as much.  </li>
            <li>This brush was used on fine straight chin length hair with poor results.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be more gentle, and hair brushing is much less of a chore than it was in the past.</li>
            <li>These new brushes are smaller than the ones they used to make.</li>
            <li>She has very long, semi-thick, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested out the Knot Genie brush on dry and wet hair, and because her hair is so thick I have to brush it once from the top and again from the underside, but this thing glides through like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>My niece&#x27;s hair is really long and gets very tangled (especially underneath).  </li>
            <li>My 15 month old would scream when I brushed her hair, Ever since I purchased the knot Genie she sits and is content</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even give my old hairbrush a second glance.</li>
            <li>My daughter won&#x27;t let me come near her hair with a regular brush anymore.  </li>
            <li>Because of her curls I can only use it on her hair when it it wet, but I have used it on my very thick and straight hair when it was dry (basically to test it out), and it worked great, without ripping out too much of my hair (which is usually the problem).  </li>
            <li>I will say that it does not get all the knots completely out (those tiny ones are a pain), but it does work well enough that I would recommend this product over and over again.</li>
            <li>This is the only brush I will ever use as long as I live.</li>
            <li>This brush has been a life saver with my six year old daughter with long wavy hair!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go all the way through in one stroke, but each time you brush from the top down in an area, the tangled \\&quot;mess\\&quot; moves down a little each time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My mom is as convinced as I am that this is a true miracle.</li>
            <li> Overall good</li>
            <li> Gets the knots out quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> I have a girl who&#x27;s hair is super curly.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, it&#x27;s always super knotty when she wakes up.  </li>
            <li> and she got almost every rat out on her first try!  </li>
            <li> The Knot Genie seems to be the step between the baby brush and a more adult brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin, Shirley Temple curls and this brush works great!  </li>
            <li> worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This brush is interesting because the bristles are just plastic and much skinnier/smaller than most brushes, along with the fact that they alternate in length, which probably help with the pulling part that hurts.</li>
            <li> We liked it enough to buy another.</li>
            <li> They work ok, bigger ones fit better in your palm and worked a little better.</li>
            <li> Dont be fooled, this brush will not make all your detangling dreams come true, but its a MUCH better alternative to a regular brush.</li>
            <li> You have to spend more time brushing, but I don&#x27;t mind because its not nearly as painful as using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I am confident that she will eventually be able to use this herself in the near future.</li>
            <li> Because it is wide and oval shaped, it would be nice to have a soft handle on top of the brush (perhaps an elastic handle)</li>
            <li> good for most tangles, not recommended for very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Now she even tries to brush her own hair with it.</li>
            <li> With this she wasn&#x27;t even aware I was brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> So I clicked on it and heard of Knot Genie for the first time.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered this brush the moment I first laid eyes on it.</li>
            <li> It is great for untangling my daughters thick hair.</li>
            <li> Though We are completely tear free all the time-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li> Even so, it&#x27;s still better than any standard brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this brush does a better job than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> it really only works well when her hair (which is medium weight, fine texture and wavy) when it is soaked with detangler or freshly washed</li>
            <li> It is so nice to be able to brush her hair and not have to chase her to sit back down.</li>
            <li> nest\\&quot; LOL) from the back of my four year old daughter&#x27;s waist length, moderately curly hair (think Rapunzel in training).</li>
            <li> BUT, much to my surprise, it did exactly what it said it would do.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this brush no more tears while brushing my daughters long curly hair Highly recommend for people with very sensitive scalps</li>
            <li> Works great on wet or dry hair!</li>
            <li> She even likes to gently brush my hair w/ it when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> It does really seem to do a number on tangles.</li>
            <li> This brush has made it much easier to deal with the knots in her hair.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> The knot genie has made it so much easier.  </li>
            <li> they really like this brush and prefer using it.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t get the whole way through the thickness of the hair.</li>
            <li> my husband wants one for himself.</li>
            <li> Works really, really well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have looked at the size more closely as this is way too big for our 4yr old&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This brush is really great at first I was skeptical about it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> My daughters hair was tangle free and ready to blow dry in under two minutes.</li>
            <li> The main reason I got</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but for us it was a bust.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did not order for a few more months.</li>
            <li> my other brush without huge clumps of hair</li>
            <li> One day on facebook I saw an ad for a new hair brush for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I sent my daughter to my moms house for a week with the new brush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very sensitive headed and this causes no pain</li>
            <li> Brushing my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s curly curly hair after a bath used to be a 45 minute nightmare!  </li>
            <li> I have four girls and doing their hair in the morning is no small task.  </li>
            <li> I use the knot genie first to detangle then use a regular brush with ease.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d have preferred the smaller one, but LOVE the fact that we have one less argument everyday was well worth it in my book!!</li>
            <li> I will need to buy more of them, the complete family uses, even the boys who usually don&#x27;t like a brush.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this brush would make hair detangling painless for the little ones&#x27; fine hair but besides not having a brush handle, not sure how this is different than my own drug store bought hair brush.</li>
            <li> If your child has a sensitive scalp, you might want to go a little easy when brushing that area.  </li>
            <li> The top layer of hair got brushed, but it never touched the bottom layer of hair leaving a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> I was certain I was going to be sending this product back.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many different brushes we went through before we found this little piece of heaven.</li>
            <li> it was for when my husband brushes our 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a complete 180 degrees from where we were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 14 years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: bought for four year old daughter who gets lots of knots despite conditioner and detangling spray and blowdrying hair before bed, etc., etc...  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my young daughters who both have waist length hair.</li>
            <li> My 18 month old loves this brush.</li>
            <li> but the bristles are MUCH stiffer, so it&#x27;s much more painful to use than our original.</li>
            <li> on wet hair right out of the bathtub.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve made changes to the design, or if this is a look-a-like that missed the mark, but it definitely causes more discomfort for my girls than our old Knot Genie.</li>
            <li> Wish it had some sort of a handle , kind of hard to do on long hair</li>
            <li> The baby brushes were just ok when she was smaller, but now they seem to do very little with the longer hair.  </li>
            <li> But it does not get the tangles out of hair as easily as stated, and it is hard to old on to.  </li>
            <li> and I ordered a new one today because the old one finally but the dust..</li>
            <li> Daughter still fusses when I brush her hair with it but not near as much.  </li>
            <li> This brush was used on fine straight chin length hair with poor results.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be more gentle, and hair brushing is much less of a chore than it was in the past.</li>
            <li> These new brushes are smaller than the ones they used to make.</li>
            <li> She has very long, semi-thick, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested out the Knot Genie brush on dry and wet hair, and because her hair is so thick I have to brush it once from the top and again from the underside, but this thing glides through like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> My niece&#x27;s hair is really long and gets very tangled (especially underneath).  </li>
            <li> My 15 month old would scream when I brushed her hair, Ever since I purchased the knot Genie she sits and is content</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even give my old hairbrush a second glance.</li>
            <li> My daughter won&#x27;t let me come near her hair with a regular brush anymore.  </li>
            <li> Because of her curls I can only use it on her hair when it it wet, but I have used it on my very thick and straight hair when it was dry (basically to test it out), and it worked great, without ripping out too much of my hair (which is usually the problem).  </li>
            <li> I will say that it does not get all the knots completely out (those tiny ones are a pain), but it does work well enough that I would recommend this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I will ever use as long as I live.</li>
            <li> This brush has been a life saver with my six year old daughter with long wavy hair!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go all the way through in one stroke, but each time you brush from the top down in an area, the tangled \\&quot;mess\\&quot; moves down a little each time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it for little kids, even if tangles aren&#x27;t a big issue!  </li>
            <li> In the 8 years or so of buying various items through Amazon, I have yet to review a single product...</li>
            <li> Her baby fine hair seems to knot if you look at it wrong.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Thrilled to have found this detangling aide and looking forward to using it daily instead of deciding to \\&quot;hide the snarl\\&quot; in an up-do or other various hairstyles born out of a necessity rather than purpose</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve started using a standard wide bristle brush with balls on the ends of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> Detangles hair with minor or no pulling.  </li>
            <li> I should have bought one long before now.</li>
            <li> Her hair is long and very thick, and she is a pretty rough and tumble girl, so her hair is constantly tangled.</li>
            <li> If your kids&#x27; long hair is a pain, get one of these!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried lots of other brushes and this is the only brush that doesn&#x27;t try to yank her hair out of her head.  </li>
            <li> but this is also the case with other traditional brushes we have.  </li>
            <li> I have dropped it countless times due to</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve actually broken teeth off of our combs trying to bulldoze through her pretty but long hair.  </li>
            <li> This product does not live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;n</li>
            <li> Thank you I would highly recommend it as she hasn&#x27;t cried to brush her hair lately.</li>
            <li> Of course, she&#x27;s not old enough to realize that hair-fixing is the highest form of torture for a little girl...</li>
            <li> There are still the occasional tears and cries, but much less.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry or wet.</li>
            <li> Works with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly conducive to getting my daughter&#x27;s hair up into a ponytail.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 18-month old daughter who has long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> She HATES getting her hair brushed as she is very active and gets lots of tangles.</li>
            <li> They are mixed with tight curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works on wet or dry hair and cheaper here than any other site we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> B004GSX31K Knot Genie Detangling Brush, Pink]]</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, my daughter has LONG, dark brown, medium-thick hair that is wavy.  Not curly, but wavy.</li>
            <li> All she has to do is wet her hair with water and brushes through it.</li>
            <li> The wet brush works wonders.</li>
            <li> Makes hair smooth but not great for thick hair and still hurts on knots and tangles</li>
            <li> Painful detangling was the reason I cut my hair super short as a little girl and kept it that way until the teen years.</li>
            <li> For extreme cases use on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> other moms (</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this is where it blew me away.</li>
            <li> I felt like it pulls significantly less than any other brush I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I got the dark purple</li>
            <li> We all have natural wavy, curly hair long uncut hair and tangles</li>
            <li> This brush does not make detangling any quicker, especially if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I can now leave her hair down all day and not worry about brushing it out before</li>
            <li> My daughter has long thick hair that gets extremely knotty.  </li>
            <li> I have very long (hip length) very thick hair which was such a pain to detangle until I got this little gem.</li>
            <li> Before, I would NEVER leave her hair down or even partially down for fear of the tangled mess at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I got a knot genie about a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> There is less struggle to comb her hair.</li>
            <li> My four-year-old daughter has quite the head of tight, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Brushing the hair of my daughter with anything other than the baby hair brushes usually brought about screams and cries.</li>
            <li> we were both a crying mess by the time we were done.</li>
            <li> Wish they&#x27;d had these when I was little.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived, I looked at this little contraption and thought..</li>
            <li> It should be noted that the bristles of this brush are a little pointy.  </li>
            <li> Its takes a little getting used to because there is no handle, but after a few days you will get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, she still HATES having her hair fixed</li>
            <li> and crying-</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t but buy a few at once.</li>
            <li> Our mornings consisted of alot of tears and crying.  </li>
            <li> for a few years</li>
            <li> No more crying.</li>
            <li> Also, the spikes are a little pokey, but my tender-headed daughter hasn&#x27;t complained about it.  </li>
            <li> Very, very hard on little girls that have tight curls</li>
            <li> My daughter got this and her hair is usually so tangled after the bath</li>
            <li> No more tantrums.</li>
            <li> No more \\&quot;fro\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> There were a couple of small tangles that she missed</li>
            <li> I bought a Knot Genie hair brush for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, and it is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It is truly unbelievable.</li>
            <li> No more tears from my granddaughter when I comb her hair now.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure why it works as well as it does</li>
            <li> no fuss....and no more knots in her hair!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> For the past year, I have dreaded washing and combing her hair.</li>
            <li> I find the shape a little odd and awkward to use, other than that it works as designed .</li>
            <li> , they were doubtful before using it, but really endorse it!</li>
            <li> She does not have curly hair, but extremely thick straight/wavy hair, an inch or two past her</li>
            <li> we have a hard time keeping up with our hairbrushes with 3 girls in the house</li>
            <li> but the bristles are HARD...</li>
            <li> it least the brush doesn&#x27;t stop and jerk the hair.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old is tender-headed just like me, so I understand how painful brushing out your hair can be.</li>
            <li> Made combing our 4yo&#x27;s hair much less dramatic.  </li>
            <li> The sound is horrible when you use this bursh, but it does what it says.</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> No more battles to comb hair in the morning!</li>
            <li> Overall we are very disappointed and this brush is currently sitting at the bottom of the drawer unused.</li>
            <li> She said that the bristles are very hard and hurt her head.</li>
            <li> Not a great brush for a child with med length curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster and alot less painful.  </li>
            <li> very difficult to brush through thick curly hair still pulls and causes pains.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that has not been the case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am sorry</li>
            <li> My daughter is a mixed race and problems with her hair has been horrible.</li>
            <li> My daughter has waist length hair with a rough cuticle, so her hair tangles horribly.  </li>
            <li> I had been DESPERATE To find a brush for my daughter who cries whenever a brush touches her head.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awkward shape</li>
            <li> Even when she has a bad tangle she doesn&#x27;t fight me.</li>
            <li> Brushing her hair after a shower is a painful experience, for all involved.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought, it does help ease out tangles, but we still had tears :(</li>
            <li> My daughter hated to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is curly and gets horrible tangles and this brush gets through them in no time at all.  </li>

            <li> My 15 month old would scream when I brushed her hair, Ever since I purchased the knot Genie she sits and is content everytime I use it. Even when she has a bad tangle she doesn&#x27;t fight me. Now she even tries to brush her own hair with it.</li>
            <li> My 3.5 y/o calls this her princess brush.  It glides thru her hair smoothly and makes the morning fits of fixing her hair more tolerable.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, she still HATES having her hair fixed (mostly b/c she has to sit still!) but she doesn&#x27;t cry b/c it hurts.  She even likes to gently brush my hair w/ it when I&#x27;m done.  My 1.5 y/o likes it too.  She actually smiles when I brush her hair b/c it tickles.  Of course, she&#x27;s not old enough to realize that hair-fixing is the highest form of torture for a little girl...</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this detangler brush for couple weeks now and she loves it. Recommended for anyone struggling to brush their hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair</li>
            <li> After reading all the awesome reviews I had to try this for my daughter. She HATES getting her hair brushed as she is very active and gets lots of tangles. I tried it on my own hair before trying it on hers to see what if it really did detangle without pulling and I was impressed. I felt like it pulls significantly less than any other brush I have tried before. When I used it on my daughter, she only said &amp;#34;ow&amp;#34; once or twice and didn&#x27;t pull away, didn&#x27;t cry, and it only took a fraction of the time to get her hair brushed through. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> My daughter got this and her hair is usually so tangled after the bath and she screams when I brush her hair. With this she wasn&#x27;t even aware I was brushing her hair. It was so nice and pleasant not to feel like I was hurting her for something that has  to be done daily</li>
            <li> This is a great baby gift!!</li>
            <li> In the 8 years or so of buying various items through Amazon, I have yet to review a single product...I have been compelled to change my mind...other moms (and/or dads) need to know how well this works!&lt;br /&gt;I was able to remove a rather large snarl (aka \\&quot;rats nest\\&quot; LOL) from the back of my four year old daughter&#x27;s waist length, moderately curly hair (think Rapunzel in training). There were NO TEARS, NO SQUIRMING, AND NO SCREECHING!!!! It is truly remarkable...&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled to have found this detangling aide and looking forward to using it daily instead of deciding to \\&quot;hide the snarl\\&quot; in an up-do or other various hairstyles born out of a necessity rather than purpose (we pick our battles around here). I am confident that she will eventually be able to use this herself in the near future. When she does, I will be sure to report back.&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004GSX31K Knot Genie Detangling Brush, Pink]]</li>
            <li> I think someone at Hogwarts was involved in this because there&#x27;s definitely magic here. I can&#x27;t tell you how many different brushes we went through before we found this little piece of heaven. I&#x27;m about to order the pet version too.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would.  Daughter still fusses when I brush her hair with it but not near as much.  It does really seem to do a number on tangles.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush so much I ordered two more, one for my sis and one for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;you wont regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> This thing is like a horse brush! I had been DESPERATE To find a brush for my daughter who cries whenever a brush touches her head. I thought this was the answer to my prayers. However, after brushing her hair she was screaming in pain! The brush was pulling her hair out by the roots- hair was everywhere...all over her back and the floor. Whole strands of hair!!!  So yes, the hair was definitely untangled...by removal.</li>
            <li> I was certain I was going to be sending this product back.  BUT, much to my surprise, it did exactly what it said it would do.  The main reason I got it was for when my husband brushes our 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  There is nothing but tears...mostly because guys don&#x27;t always understand how to brush hair with knots in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my daughter has LONG, dark brown, medium-thick hair that is wavy.  Not curly, but wavy. This brush has made it much easier to deal with the knots in her hair.  Before, I would NEVER leave her hair down or even partially down for fear of the tangled mess at the end of the day.  I tried every spray detangler out there, but nothing has worked like this!  I can now leave her hair down all day and not worry about brushing it out before bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I noticed that starting at the top of her head was more effective.  It doesn&#x27;t go all the way through in one stroke, but each time you brush from the top down in an area, the tangled \\&quot;mess\\&quot; moves down a little each time.  My sister prefers to go from the bottom up, so I think it depends on the type of hair.  Also, the spikes are a little pokey, but my tender-headed daughter hasn&#x27;t complained about it.  I&#x27;ve also used it on myself and can&#x27;t believe how great it worked!</li>
            <li> These new brushes are smaller than the ones they used to make. They work ok, bigger ones fit better in your palm and worked a little better.</li>
            <li> Only brush our tender-headed daughter will let us use. She actually LETS us brush her hair with out a fight now!</li>
            <li> very difficult to brush through thick curly hair still pulls and causes pains. Very, very hard on little girls that have tight curls</li>
            <li> Brushing the hair of my daughter with anything other than the baby hair brushes usually brought about screams and cries. Her baby fine hair seems to knot if you look at it wrong. The baby brushes were just ok when she was smaller, but now they seem to do very little with the longer hair.  The Knot Genie seems to be the step between the baby brush and a more adult brush. It seems to be more gentle, and hair brushing is much less of a chore than it was in the past. There are still the occasional tears and cries, but much less.  I&#x27;d recommend this brush for anyone in a similar situation, where you need to actually brush their hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great detangling brush. My kids love it and insist I use it when brushing there hair. I find the shape a little odd and awkward to use, other than that it works as designed .</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial with thick curly hair. Every day was a battle to get her hair brushed. Even on days when we were able to get the tangles out she we were both a crying mess by the time we were done. One day on facebook I saw an ad for a new hair brush for curly hair. So I clicked on it and heard of Knot Genie for the first time. I did not order for a few more months. I should have ordered this brush the moment I first laid eyes on it. No more crying. No more tantrums. No more \\&quot;fro\\&quot; hair. Nevaeh asks me to brush her hair now. It is a complete 180 degrees from where we were. I sent my daughter to my moms house for a week with the new brush. My mom is as convinced as I am that this is a true miracle. She is a developmental therapist with the state of Missouri and she is buying these brushes for some of her clients.</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;knot&amp;#34; my favorite brush.  This brush was used on fine straight chin length hair with poor results.  The top layer of hair got brushed, but it never touched the bottom layer of hair leaving a tangled mess.  I had high hopes for this, but for us it was a bust.</li>
            <li> My niece&#x27;s hair is really long and gets very tangled (especially underneath).  It was a constant battle to comb her hair out after she showered (or any time!).  I saw this here on Amazon and bought her one.  She said it worked like magic!  Her mom wanted another one and Grandma wanted one for when she visits her house too.  Definitely a must have for those prone to getting knots in their hair!</li>
            <li> My four-year-old daughter has quite the head of tight, curly hair. Getting it brushed was a daily battle, oh my god, I dreaded this part of the day. I decided to give this $13 gizmo a shot, figuring it was only $13 lost if the thing was just hype. IT WORKS! It&#x27;s a great brush. My husband loves it too, keeps asking me why I didn&#x27;t buy it two years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, just buy the darn thing. It really does work.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who always gets rats in her hair.  My wife and I detest combing time because it always hurts her and we&#x27;ve actually broken teeth off of our combs trying to bulldoze through her pretty but long hair.  I gave this to her and told her to try it out and she got almost every rat out on her first try!  There were a couple of small tangles that she missed but I got them with ease using this brush.  We just love it!</li>
            <li> Very good on my daughters hair. Thank you I would highly recommend it as she hasn&#x27;t cried to brush her hair lately.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best thing ever.  Brushing my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s curly curly hair after a bath used to be a 45 minute nightmare!  Now it only takes a minute...and NO TEARS!!!!  I&#x27;m not kidding!</li>
            <li> I got a knot genie about a year and a half ago and I ordered a new one today because the old one finally but the dust.. But it works wonderfully! I got the dark purple and it&#x27;s very pretty! I&#x27;m 14 years old and I&#x27;m very sensitive headed and this causes no pain what so ever. I love it! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> This brush has been a life saver with my six year old daughter with long wavy hair!  She now INSISTS that we use this to brush her hair every night/ morning - she gets upset if I don&#x27;t!  I think I&#x27;d have preferred the smaller one, but LOVE the fact that we have one less argument everyday was well worth it in my book!!</li>
            <li> My daughter hated to brush her hair. She gave us a fit all the time. I came across this item and couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it and she loves it she said it makes such a difference when getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> I heard this was the best brush every for curly hair. It works just okay for my daughter. We found an inexpensive brush at Walmart that works much better.</li>
            <li> It is great for untangling my daughters thick hair. There is less struggle to comb her hair. This is truly an amazing brush.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush no more tears while brushing my daughters long curly hair Highly recommend for people with very sensitive scalps</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin, Shirley Temple curls and this brush works great!  I used to have to load up her hair with conditioner before being able to attempt to comb her hair. With the Knot Genie, I can use it while she has conditioner in or not.  Because of her curls I can only use it on her hair when it it wet, but I have used it on my very thick and straight hair when it was dry (basically to test it out), and it worked great, without ripping out too much of my hair (which is usually the problem).  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought a Knot Genie hair brush for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, and it is unbelievable. Her hair is long and very thick, and she is a pretty rough and tumble girl, so her hair is constantly tangled. Brushing her hair after a shower is a painful experience, for all involved. I&#x27;ve tested out the Knot Genie brush on dry and wet hair, and because her hair is so thick I have to brush it once from the top and again from the underside, but this thing glides through like a hot knife through butter. It is truly unbelievable. If your kids&#x27; long hair is a pain, get one of these!</li>
            <li> Our second order- we have a hard time keeping up with our hairbrushes with 3 girls in the house so I ordered a second! We all have natural wavy, curly hair long uncut hair and tangles are no joke! Though We are completely tear free all the time- it least the brush doesn&#x27;t stop and jerk the hair. Without it, my kids would be all out screaming and crying- I highly recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this brush would make hair detangling painless for the little ones&#x27; fine hair but besides not having a brush handle, not sure how this is different than my own drug store bought hair brush. I even tried it on my own hair and didn&#x27;t think it handles hair any differently than my own brush. I still had to grab my hair on the root side in order to detangle painlessly. This product does not live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;n</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought this would work for my daughter. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. It works like a regular brush!!</li>
            <li> Wish it had some sort of a handle , kind of hard to do on long hair&lt;br /&gt;it does get the tangles out better then my other brush without huge clumps of hair</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, just buy this brush already. I have very long (hip length) very thick hair which was such a pain to detangle until I got this little gem. It glides through my hair weather it&#x27;s dry or wet. I don&#x27;t even give my old hairbrush a second glance. This is the only brush I will ever use as long as I live.</li>
            <li> I got this after rave reviews from Amazon and from friends to try to combat tangles on my tender headed kid.  She doesn&#x27;t like it...screaming still commences.  I&#x27;ve used it on my head and honestly I can understand why she doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m not tender headed so I actually find it to be rather massaging but the bristles are HARD...so if you&#x27;re not looking for a sort of scratchy head massage then this may not work for you.  We&#x27;ve started using a standard wide bristle brush with balls on the ends of the bristles.  My daughters babysitter got it at the dollar store...for $1.  Figures :)</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007RDOWY8 Knot Genie Detangling Brush (Puff of Purple)]]I love this product.  No more tears from my granddaughter when I comb her hair now.</li>
            <li> She said that the bristles are very hard and hurt her head. I wish this would have worked.  I will have to try the one from the infomercial</li>
            <li> Works ok. Makes hair smooth but not great for thick hair and still hurts on knots and tangles</li>
            <li> My daughter will now brush her hair by herself every morning and night. Before we found this brush she would just cry. Works with wet or dry hair. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very fine and tangles easily and this brush is great!</li>
            <li> Gets the knots out quickly and painlessly.  Wish they&#x27;d had these when I was little.  Painful detangling was the reason I cut my hair super short as a little girl and kept it that way until the teen years.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and daughters after watching them tear hair when brushing/combing (they have beautiful long hair).  They said it works great, they were doubtful before using it, but really endorse it!</li>
            <li> This brush is really great at first I was skeptical about it.&lt;br /&gt;When it was put to the test it was amazing to see how easily my daughters hair combed with almost no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;i am sorry I didn&#x27;t but buy a few at once.</li>
            <li> good for most tangles, not recommended for very thick hair.  Overall good&lt;br /&gt;product worth the money.  Good variety of colors</li>
            <li> I have four girls and doing their hair in the morning is no small task.  They are mixed with tight curly hair. Our mornings consisted of alot of tears and crying.  The knot genie has made it so much easier.  It&#x27;s faster and alot less painful.  So happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I have a girl who&#x27;s hair is super curly. Her hair knots with such ease that brushing it was a battle. I found out about the knot genie from watching a youtube video and I thought, why not. When it arrived, I looked at this little contraption and thought..it can&#x27;t work for her hair. It is so simple. I tried it and NO COMPLAINTS. It is so nice to be able to brush her hair and not have to chase her to sit back down. I will say that it does not get all the knots completely out (those tiny ones are a pain), but it does work well enough that I would recommend this product over and over again. If you have a child who&#x27;s hair is curly or knots with ease, I suggest you give this product a try. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old is tender-headed just like me, so I understand how painful brushing out your hair can be. This brush is interesting because the bristles are just plastic and much skinnier/smaller than most brushes, along with the fact that they alternate in length, which probably help with the pulling part that hurts. Dont be fooled, this brush will not make all your detangling dreams come true, but its a MUCH better alternative to a regular brush. This brush does not make detangling any quicker, especially if you have thick hair. You have to spend more time brushing, but I don&#x27;t mind because its not nearly as painful as using a regular brush. I bet if you combined this with a leave in detangler the results would probably be amazing. I would recommend this to anyone with a tender head and/or children with them. Its takes a little getting used to because there is no handle, but after a few days you will get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I took it out of the box and I looked at it.  I thought, &amp;#34;no way is this going to work.&amp;#34;  There were no bells, no whistles.  No flashing lights. Nothing to make it look like it could do anything better than the brushes and combs I currently have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: bought for four year old daughter who gets lots of knots despite conditioner and detangling spray and blowdrying hair before bed, etc., etc...  She does not have curly hair, but extremely thick straight/wavy hair, an inch or two past her shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First try:  on doing hair in morning.  Noticeable decrease in tears and sobs as well as time to brush hair in total.  Thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second try:  on wet hair right out of the bathtub.  AWESOME. Holy cow, this is where it blew me away. My daughters hair was tangle free and ready to blow dry in under two minutes. I was in awe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is not a brush that can replace the brush(es?) in your arsenal. It&#x27;s not particularly conducive to getting my daughter&#x27;s hair up into a ponytail. I still need to use a comb for that part.  However, strictly as a detangling brush used as part of your routine, it is outstanding.  Now I can do the combing without the crying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, it&#x27;s a wonderful tool for teaching my four year old self care. She&#x27;s eager to brush her own hair now, where she was afraid to try before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thanks, Knot Genie, for a truly wonderful product, that comes in lots of fun colors for your child to choose from. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my young daughters who both have waist length hair. they really like this brush and prefer using it. I think because it fits the contours of their hand more than anything else.</li>
            <li> My daughter has waist length hair with a rough cuticle, so her hair tangles horribly.  We&#x27;ve tried lots of other brushes and this is the only brush that doesn&#x27;t try to yank her hair out of her head.  The best thing about this brush is that somehow it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the tangles at all, so even my 3 year old will let me use this brush with no tears.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it for little kids, even if tangles aren&#x27;t a big issue!  We liked it enough to buy another.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a mixed race and problems with her hair has been horrible. Till we found the Knot Genie. All she has to do is wet her hair with water and brushes through it. She has prefect ringlet curls just like that.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought, it does help ease out tangles, but we still had tears :(</li>
            <li> I will need to buy more of them, the complete family uses, even the boys who usually don&#x27;t like a brush.</li>
            <li> Made combing our 4yo&#x27;s hair much less dramatic.  Extremely pleased.  For extreme cases use on wet hair.  I use the knot genie first to detangle then use a regular brush with ease.</li>
            <li> The brush looks just like one we have had (and love!) for a few years but the bristles are MUCH stiffer, so it&#x27;s much more painful to use than our original. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve made changes to the design, or if this is a look-a-like that missed the mark, but it definitely causes more discomfort for my girls than our old Knot Genie. Even so, it&#x27;s still better than any standard brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is curly and gets horrible tangles and this brush gets through them in no time at all.  The brush doesn&#x27;t look special at all and I am not sure why it works as well as it does but I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have looked at the size more closely as this is way too big for our 4yr old&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;Also it really only works well when her hair (which is medium weight, fine texture and wavy) when it is soaked with detangler or freshly washed but this is also the case with other traditional brushes we have.  Overall we are very disappointed and this brush is currently sitting at the bottom of the drawer unused.</li>
            <li> Not a great brush for a child with med length curly hair. She can&#x27;t get the whole way through the thickness of the hair. She is constantly dropping it!  We end up throwing it out.  The wet brush works wonders. Try it!</li>
            <li> Worked so well for my 10-month-old girl.&lt;br /&gt;No tears...no fuss....and no more knots in her hair!&lt;br /&gt;Now my husband wants one for himself.</li>
            <li> Best brush I have EVER bought.  Would have eliminated a lot of arguments if I would have had this earlier!!!</li>
            <li> Just love this brush. The touch to my scalp is marvelous and my fair feels silky to the touch. The only drawback is holding the brush in my hand. Because it is wide and oval shaped, it would be nice to have a soft handle on top of the brush (perhaps an elastic handle) so that I could stick my hand through in order for it not to slip out of my hand.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long thick hair that gets extremely knotty.  I can&#x27;t say this brush does a better job than a regular brush. Not overly thrilled.</li>
            <li> My daughter HATES having her hair brushed.  She has very long, semi-thick, straight hair.  For whatever reason, it&#x27;s always super knotty when she wakes up.  While the Knot Genie isn&#x27;t some miracle brush that makes every brushing a breeze, it is certainly better than a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush and does make the process easier.  My daughter won&#x27;t let me come near her hair with a regular brush anymore.  It should be noted that the bristles of this brush are a little pointy.  If your child has a sensitive scalp, you might want to go a little easy when brushing that area.  All in all, this brush definitely helps make brushing easier.</li>
            <li> Works really, really well.  Detangles hair with minor or no pulling.  I am going to order another one for grandma&#x27;s house</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I should have bought one long before now. The tangles come out without pulling hair and causing tears. No more battles to comb hair in the morning! Works great on wet or dry hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing a blurb in Oprah magazine... But it does not get the tangles out of hair as easily as stated, and it is hard to old on to.  I have dropped it countless times due to it&#x27;s awkward shape and o handle</li>
            <li> daughter in law says it has worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> My 18 month old loves this brush. She even asks to brush her own hair. Works on wet or dry hair and cheaper here than any other site we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The sound is horrible when you use this bursh, but it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 18-month old daughter who has long, thick, curly hair. For the past year, I have dreaded washing and combing her hair. I read the reviews and decided to give this a try. It is AMAZING!!!!!!! I am in awe at how this brush is able to effortlessly untangle her hair. My only regret is not buying this a year ago. It would have saved me a lot of headaches. I highly recommend this product!</li>
