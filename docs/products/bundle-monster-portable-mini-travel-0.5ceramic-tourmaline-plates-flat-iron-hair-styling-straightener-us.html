            <li>Light weight, heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>and I just drape it over a hook (it&#x27;s that lightweight) and let it cool when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not a bad deal though.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, and gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li>i love it , gets hot fast</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it first came in</li>
            <li>The box was a little bit dented on the sides, but the product was in great condition.</li>
            <li>(turn up a little) but it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>grt no problems nice smaller size for bangs</li>
            <li>but no disappointment yet</li>
            <li>I use this to curl the short bottom layer of my hair, and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>The plates get super hot even though theres no temp.</li>
            <li>The order arrived quickly and the little flat iron is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is great that it is small and compact, but it did not work well with my hair.</li>
            <li>It gets to hot to the point</li>
            <li>It look so pretty</li>
            <li>This thing heats up and it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that what you want, something hot and pretty?</li>
            <li>I actually ordered this to seal my coffee pods that I make, so I haven&#x27;t used it for my hair.  :-)  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm and does exactly what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets hot.</li>
            <li>Why pay over $40 for a pod sealer when this mini flat iron does the job, and probably better.</li>
            <li>Works to help calm my new hair.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but the once heated, it can leave a red stain on whatever surface it&#x27;s sitting on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them much</li>
            <li>I just leave the button in the &#x27;on&#x27; position and unplug the whole thing when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>the pros of this product are size and the fact that it heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Great little flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Its definitely cute, gets hot fast just wish it came with a little case to store it in...</li>
            <li>But, a temperature dial or different heat settings would be useful.</li>
            <li>She told me that it did the trick for her, so I decided to get one for myself, so I can bring it with me when I travel, instead of bringing my normal sized one.</li>
            <li>although the picture shows the red rose colored plates as black.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough to fully straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair stayed the exact same.</li>
            <li>For long term use, it may be better to purchase a more expensive iron.</li>
            <li>These little cute flat irons does the job.</li>
            <li>Small easy to travel.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron gets very hot very quickly and if you spend a little bit too much time with it your hand might start to hurt a bit since it is so small.</li>
            <li>The price is so low, even if it doesn&#x27;t last as long as bigger, heavier and more expensive products, I am glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li>In order for it to work on my hair, I had to blow dry first, then flat iron.</li>
            <li>A bigger straightener would have&lt;br /&gt;been clumsy to use and this one is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Its small and great for traveling or for somebody who has thin or short hair!</li>
            <li>This iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some of the other flat irions that I have.  </li>
            <li>It also gets REALLY hot, so be careful out there!!!!  </li>

            <li> It also gets REALLY hot, so be careful out there!!!!  </li>
            <li> I do like the way the ceramic flat iron looks, I just wish it was a tiny bit smaller in circumference and wished I could control the heat temp</li>
            <li> I have thick and as of right now, long hair.</li>
            <li> I keep this flat iron in my gym locker: I use it for straightening my baby hairs</li>
            <li> No adjustable heat setting, just plug and go, but again, not something that I would consider for a daily user if you have medium or long hair.</li>
            <li> but when I tried flat ironing my hair, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I could not let my hair air dry then flat iron.</li>
            <li> When you see them they look tiny and insufficient but don&#x27;t be fooled by that this little guy kicks butt.</li>
            <li> Not something that you will want to do a lot of work with, but use for only a few minutes to get the movement I am looking for in the bangs.</li>
            <li> I can also give my hair a little curl</li>
            <li> I can get the smallest sections of hair with this little baby.</li>
            <li> A little flimsier than I anticipated</li>
            <li> You might as well use your two fingers because that&#x27;s how small it is.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t think i would buy it for everyday hair styling?!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small unit to use at the YMCA.</li>
            <li> It was in a small box.</li>
            <li> It works well and is small and lightweight!</li>
            <li> Be very very careful!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair too.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so thin.</li>
            <li> Sucks!!</li>
            <li> Was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this, but hey, you get what you paid for...</li>
            <li> Growing hair after chemo is so annoying</li>

            <li> It get in tiny spots great. Heats up quick. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great flat irons. They get very hot and work great on my short hair.</li>
            <li> Sucks!! It gets to hot to the point I can&#x27;t pick it up..</li>
            <li> The order arrived quickly and the little flat iron is perfect. It&#x27;s lightweight, so cute (I got the one with the red rose design) and fits great in my purse.</li>
            <li> Actually purchased this to seal coffee pods and it works great.  Why pay over $40 for a pod sealer when this mini flat iron does the job, and probably better.</li>
            <li> Its soooo cuuuteee. It look so pretty I could not resist. The plates get super hot even though theres no temp. dial. So heat protectant is needed. I use to straighten/flip my closure.</li>
            <li> grt no problems nice smaller size for bangs</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough to fully straighten my hair.  I have thin hair too.</li>
            <li> Be very very careful!!!! On multiple occasions now even though I have turned the straightener OFF, I have gone back into the bathroom later to find that the heat had turned back on, and it scorched my bathroom counter! See pictures. Even though the power is off, the straightener is still ON!!</li>
            <li> Works fine, but the once heated, it can leave a red stain on whatever surface it&#x27;s sitting on. Protect your counters/ or sink area.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my short hair. Light weight, heats up quickly. I use it every day. It&#x27;s very simple - just a tiny on/off switch. The price is so low, even if it doesn&#x27;t last as long as bigger, heavier and more expensive products, I am glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve plunged these up in every outlet in my house &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work. it just does nothing the light doesn&#x27;t come on or anything.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect mini hair straightener for my bangs. It is the only thing I need for my hair and I am set to go. I can also give my hair a little curl if I&lt;br /&gt;want to to. It heats up in no time and I just drape it over a hook (it&#x27;s that lightweight) and let it cool when I&#x27;m done. A bigger straightener would have&lt;br /&gt;been clumsy to use and this one is easy to handle. Makes all the difference in the world. Soooo happy with it.</li>
            <li> not wowed by this i just use it for my edges and it does and ok job. Guess that&#x27;s what I got for my money</li>
            <li> This thing heats up and it&#x27;s pretty. Isn&#x27;t that what you want, something hot and pretty? It&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s awesome if you have a pixie cut and it&#x27;s so thin. You might as well use your two fingers because that&#x27;s how small it is. Sure it&#x27;s damaging but every heating thing is damaging so that makes it okay.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this to seal my coffee pods that I make, so I haven&#x27;t used it for my hair.  :-)  But I&#x27;m sure it would be great for hair, too!</li>

            <li> Just got it today, love it!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love the size and colors.</li>
            <li> although the picture shows the red rose colored plates as black. Mine were actually white. Which im not complaining about. This flat iron gets very hot very quickly and if you spend a little bit too much time with it your hand might start to hurt a bit since it is so small. I can get the smallest sections of hair with this little baby.</li>
            <li> This product is a very good thing. It will fit in a woman&#x27;s purse for easy travel. They are very good at straightening hair.</li>
            <li> I keep this flat iron in my gym locker: I use it for straightening my baby hairs so it doesn&#x27;t look like I have an afro of baby hair around my face. It works well and is small and lightweight!</li>
            <li> This iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some of the other flat irions that I have.  It does seem to straighten the hair  and it serves the immediate purchase.  For long term use, it may be better to purchase a more expensive iron.</li>
            <li> When you see them they look tiny and insufficient but don&#x27;t be fooled by that this little guy kicks butt.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This was just too cute to pass up ! It also gets REALLY hot, so be careful out there!!!!  Works like a charm and does exactly what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> A little flimsier than I anticipated but this will work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> It looked cheap and appeared used.</li>
            <li> Its definitely cute, gets hot fast just wish it came with a little case to store it in...</li>

            <li> Works to help calm my new hair. Growing hair after chemo is so annoying but this helps.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small unit to use at the YMCA. This fills the bill. I have short hair so it works for me. 4 stars because it would not work with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Great little flat iron.  Not something that you will want to do a lot of work with, but use for only a few minutes to get the movement I am looking for in the bangs. Small easy to travel.  Great for short hair. was worried that it would fry it&#x27;s self out, but not an issue as yet.  No adjustable heat setting, just plug and go, but again, not something that I would consider for a daily user if you have medium or long hair. Just for as needed fixes or short hair.</li>
            <li> Was extremely disappointed. I was so excited when it first came in but when I tried flat ironing my hair, it didn&#x27;t work. At all. My hair stayed the exact same. Do not recommend</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a tool like this without the big investment.  It is perfect.  Lightweight, easy to handle and does the job.</li>
            <li> I use this to curl the short bottom layer of my hair, and it works nicely. Heats up quickly, and gets VERY hot. The button is on the inside of the panels for some reason, so rather than burn my fingers I just leave the button in the &#x27;on&#x27; position and unplug the whole thing when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> great flat irons that happen to be the perfect temperature for my hair. But, a temperature dial or different heat settings would be useful.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly. It was in a small box. The box was a little bit dented on the sides, but the product was in great condition. I reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> It looked completely different and I thought it had a buttom to control the temperature. I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. I got this for my friend as a gift and she loved it. She told me that it did the trick for her, so I decided to get one for myself, so I can bring it with me when I travel, instead of bringing my normal sized one. This is great that it is small and compact, but it did not work well with my hair. I have thick and as of right now, long hair. In order for it to work on my hair, I had to blow dry first, then flat iron. I could not let my hair air dry then flat iron. I was disappointed in this, but hey, you get what you paid for...the pros of this product are size and the fact that it heats up fast. I think it would work better for finer hair. It&#x27;s still not a bad deal though.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling. Gets hot.</li>
            <li> i love it , gets hot fast</li>
            <li> Cute, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I do like the way the ceramic flat iron looks, I just wish it was a tiny bit smaller in circumference and wished I could control the heat temp (turn up a little) but it was a great purchase.</li>
