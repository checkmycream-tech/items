            <li>I can honestly say that this product is a miracle.</li>
            <li>I ended up loving it</li>
            <li>I brush it?&amp;#34; when I go get the brush AND even his brushing is effective and not just theatrics.  </li>
            <li>By far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>The brush is light weight,easy to clean, and attractive.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s bamboo</li>
            <li>it love theirs</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great experience.</li>
            <li>so glad I don&#x27;t have to use the plastic version like my daughter.</li>
            <li>Love the bamboo and will be ordering 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE the brush and will probably buy another one.</li>
            <li>Among the bristles that still remain, many have lost their nylon topper balls, leaving scratchy, pokey stems in their wake.</li>
            <li>He does most of it himself</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>admit I fell for the eco friendly bamboo earth collection right on cue and am happy to have the feel of wood in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is also super light, making it easy to travel with, but because of the bamboo it looks attractive rather than cheap.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice, it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>excellent purchase…glides through wet hair and is excellent styling and brushing dry hair as well.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and this style makes it look classy,</li>
            <li>and it gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely brush, perfect for my thin hair although I suspect it might not perform too well for ladies with abundant hair, I always had problems with hair fallout after showering and now with this brush</li>
            <li>It is a beautifully designed care product I will use daily.</li>
            <li>detangle free.</li>
            <li>I ordered this expecting the light wood, but got this one instead.  </li>
            <li>This one quite elegant and worth the additional $.</li>
            <li>I originally bought one for my daughters hair on the recommendation of our hair stylist.</li>
            <li>Real pretty.</li>
            <li>The brush is probably best for unruly, curly hair as advertised, but it does a great job for my active 10-year-old who refuses to cut her long straight hair, too.</li>
            <li>She has long gorgeous curly red hair and this is a great brush for her</li>
            <li>I am so happy I spent the money on this brush.</li>
            <li>Tangles are endemic and this brush is the best we&#x27;ve found for working out those knots with the least discomfort.  </li>
            <li>The seller was fast, thoughtful, and thorough!</li>
            <li>This brush comes in many different colors, but I love the Bamboo Earth Collection.</li>
            <li>Use in shower and tub freely but dry brush out great between uses, never laying/leaving in standing water once task is complete.</li>
            <li>Thrilled that my favorite brush has gone green.</li>
            <li>Great brush for painless detangling...until the bristles started falling out after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li>well worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for my dad after he discovered my plastic Wet Brush and loved it.</li>
            <li>After ordering and returning other brushes, I am delighted with the quality and materials of the product.</li>
            <li>This brush glides right through without pulling and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I like the wooden brush as opposed to the colored ones -- feels strong and secure.</li>
            <li>I now have a large pile of them, any ideas on how I can upcycle them?!</li>
            <li>I wish I could post a picture of the pretty great but completely challenging long head of curly hair this brush has to go through on our little man.  </li>
            <li>Looks like nice handle but still pulls alot of my hair out when wet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>Alas, it turns out it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair that gets easily tangled-- paired with a very tender head!</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I chose to spend $25 instead of $8.99 because it was bamboo and thought I was doing the responsible, earthly thing.</li>
            <li>but they do not have really tangled hair.</li>
            <li>so much I bought this one and the paddle brush style for myself.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Having been in his chair with unruly hair my whole childhood</li>
            <li>I am very greatful I found this brush.</li>
            <li>I can get all of the tangles out without losing much hair in the process.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love wet brushes!</li>
            <li>it!&lt;br /&gt;(Don&#x27;t forget to clean your hairbrush regularly.)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all hair types.</li>
            <li>It magically goes through my thick, curly, long hair easily just like it advertises.</li>
            <li>I went bald for bucks and am growing my hair out super long</li>
            <li>hence the dark wood instead of light bamboo.  </li>
            <li>We both have a lot of fine and easily tangled hair and this brush works perfectly wet or dry with minimal pulling and breakage.</li>
            <li>The plastic chemical smelling wet brush version is still going strong over a year later.</li>
            <li>It has a natural finish, so will not chip or peel off over time or with use.</li>
            <li>Transaction was seamless.</li>
            <li>I read about it in a fashion magazine and was hesitant to pay the price, but it was worth every dollar spent.</li>
            <li>I have below shoulder length hair and this brush really does work on my wet hair.  </li>
            <li>As someone who spends a lot (too much) money on hair products, I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone with long hair or a tender head!</li>
            <li>It also did its job well for the first few months.</li>
            <li>I was confused at first, but it seems like it&#x27;s very high quality</li>
            <li>This brush really works on detangling long wet hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I personally have fine hair and was afraid of this brush damaging my hair, but now I can&#x27;t live without this brush.</li>
            <li> Do keep in mind that its purpose is for wet hair, I find that the bristles are not sturdy enough for styling my hair, I use different brushes for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It is crazy to me how much better this thing is at untangling my hair.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says, especially detangles wet hair without breaking the strands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip:  A brief attempt on dry hair proved ineffective, we thoroughly wet, and condition and then detangle with brush.  </li>
            <li> It still *sort of* detangles, but my hair has become damaged as a result of continuing to use this thing - it&#x27;s brittle, frayed, and dry.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s the Wet Brush Pro</li>
            <li> ordered one, then a few weeks later bought another to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> that is but a distant memory now as he says in the tub ...&amp;#34;can</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;My Wet Brush Bamboo Earth Collection&amp;#34; helps style my hair.</li>
            <li> Other people I&#x27;ve talked to about</li>
            <li> Really thought the hype around this brush would turn out to be silly and unfounded.</li>
            <li> The only negative aspect is that some of the bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> I would say about half of the brush pins/needles/</li>
            <li> and then I do a twice round at the end.  </li>
            <li> With my old brush I found myself tugging maniacally at a knotted mess (which was particularly bad when wet).</li>
            <li> it was hard for me to lay down the law about hair brushing and frequency when the length and curls turned into a torture session from Marathon Man....</li>
            <li> Cuts through my thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, my thick hair isn&#x27;t being pulled out.</li>
            <li> This brush now pulls my hair so badly that I can actually feel it breaking off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had if for about a year and have become so disappointed with it that I had to come back and write a review.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brush has not stood the test of time.</li>
            <li> Sadly, would not recommend.</li>

            <li> Really thought the hype around this brush would turn out to be silly and unfounded. But no. This brush is a boss. It is crazy to me how much better this thing is at untangling my hair. With my old brush I found myself tugging maniacally at a knotted mess (which was particularly bad when wet). None of that now. This brush is also super light, making it easy to travel with, but because of the bamboo it looks attractive rather than cheap. At the time of this writing it costs $10.50... well worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have below shoulder length hair and this brush really does work on my wet hair.  No pulling and snagging.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;(Don&#x27;t forget to clean your hairbrush regularly.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I have very curly hair and it gets tangled easily. I chose to spend $25 instead of $8.99 because it was bamboo and thought I was doing the responsible, earthly thing. I would say about half of the brush pins/needles/teeth whatever you want to call them have come out. When they are put back in, the don&#x27;t stay in place. I now have a large pile of them, any ideas on how I can upcycle them?! The concept is great and I love that it&#x27;s bamboo but if you truly have tangled hair, I don&#x27;t believe this is the answer. Other people I&#x27;ve talked to about it love theirs but they do not have really tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Great brush - easy on hair. I like the wooden brush as opposed to the colored ones -- feels strong and secure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a month now, and every day I am grateful I found it. After ordering and returning other brushes, I am delighted with the quality and materials of the product. It has a natural finish, so will not chip or peel off over time or with use. It is a beautifully designed care product I will use daily. Great packaging too. Thanks for a great experience.</li>
            <li> I heard of the West Brush before, but was not fully convinced that a brush could detangle hair without using a dentangling product. I decided to purchase it on a whim. I can honestly say that this product is a miracle. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and it leaves your hair detangle free. I highly recommend this product to all hair types. I personally have fine hair and was afraid of this brush damaging my hair, but now I can&#x27;t live without this brush. This brush comes in many different colors, but I love the Bamboo Earth Collection. You won&#x27;t regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> Great brush, never gets snagged and it feels great on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and this style makes it look classy, so glad I don&#x27;t have to use the plastic version like my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. She has long gorgeous curly red hair and this is a great brush for her</li>
            <li> The brush is probably best for unruly, curly hair as advertised, but it does a great job for my active 10-year-old who refuses to cut her long straight hair, too. Tangles are endemic and this brush is the best we&#x27;ve found for working out those knots with the least discomfort.  The packaging was nice, it arrived quickly. Transaction was seamless.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love wet brushes! I originally bought one for my daughters hair on the recommendation of our hair stylist. I ended up loving it so much I bought this one and the paddle brush style for myself.  We both have a lot of fine and easily tangled hair and this brush works perfectly wet or dry with minimal pulling and breakage.</li>

            <li> Thrilled that my favorite brush has gone green. Cuts through my thick and curly hair. Best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever owned! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting the light wood, but got this one instead.  It says it&#x27;s made of evergreen wood hence the dark wood instead of light bamboo.  It says it&#x27;s the Wet Brush Pro... I was confused at first, but it seems like it&#x27;s very high quality which is what I wanted and for the price it&#x27;s a beautiful brush.  I went bald for bucks and am growing my hair out super long so I hope this brush will help.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my dad after he discovered my plastic Wet Brush and loved it. This one quite elegant and worth the additional $.</li>
            <li> This brush really works on detangling long wet hair</li>
            <li> Perfect brush. Love the bamboo and will be ordering 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Looks like nice handle but still pulls alot of my hair out when wet. Not happy with this product. I thought it would help eliminate the hair loss ... It did not help .</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the brush and will probably buy another one. I have long hair that gets easily tangled-- paired with a very tender head! This brush glides right through without pulling and doesn&#x27;t hurt.The only negative aspect is that some of the bristles have fallen out. I haven&#x27;t noticed it changing the effectiveness of the brush, but over time I imagine that it will not work as well.  However, I still gave it 5 stars because of how well it works. As someone who spends a lot (too much) money on hair products, I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone with long hair or a tender head!</li>
            <li> ordered one, then a few weeks later bought another to keep in my purse. Does everything it says, especially detangles wet hair without breaking the strands.</li>
            <li> excellent purchase…glides through wet hair and is excellent styling and brushing dry hair as well.</li>
            <li> Great brush for painless detangling...until the bristles started falling out after a few months of use.  The plastic chemical smelling wet brush version is still going strong over a year later.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brush has not stood the test of time. I&#x27;ve had if for about a year and have become so disappointed with it that I had to come back and write a review.  Pros: It&#x27;s pretty. Real pretty. It also did its job well for the first few months. It seemed to effortlessly glide through tangles in a way I never thought was possible for my hair. Alas, it turns out it was too good to be true.  Cons: The bristles have fallen out in gobs. Among the bristles that still remain, many have lost their nylon topper balls, leaving scratchy, pokey stems in their wake. This brush now pulls my hair so badly that I can actually feel it breaking off. It still *sort of* detangles, but my hair has become damaged as a result of continuing to use this thing - it&#x27;s brittle, frayed, and dry. Yuck.   Sadly, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish I could post a picture of the pretty great but completely challenging long head of curly hair this brush has to go through on our little man.  A never ending struggle to get him to sit still for brushing which I have lost countless times.  Howls and drama from him non-stop.  Having been in his chair with unruly hair my whole childhood it was hard for me to lay down the law about hair brushing and frequency when the length and curls turned into a torture session from Marathon Man....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that is but a distant memory now as he says in the tub ...&amp;#34;can I brush it?&amp;#34; when I go get the brush AND even his brushing is effective and not just theatrics.  The brush is amazing.  Completely amazing.  He does most of it himself and then I do a twice round at the end.  Presto, relationship between Mother and beloved Son intact!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I fell for the eco friendly bamboo earth collection right on cue and am happy to have the feel of wood in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  A brief attempt on dry hair proved ineffective, we thoroughly wet, and condition and then detangle with brush.  Use in shower and tub freely but dry brush out great between uses, never laying/leaving in standing water once task is complete.</li>
            <li> I am very greatful I found this brush. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been looking for for six decades! Finally, my thick hair isn&#x27;t being pulled out. &amp;#34;My Wet Brush Bamboo Earth Collection&amp;#34; helps style my hair. Now it remains quite manageable. The brush is light weight,easy to clean, and attractive. I will introduce my hairdresser to this winner! The seller was fast, thoughtful, and thorough!</li>
            <li> By far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to de-tangle my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely brush, perfect for my thin hair although I suspect it might not perform too well for ladies with abundant hair, I always had problems with hair fallout after showering and now with this brush I can get all of the tangles out without losing much hair in the process. Do keep in mind that its purpose is for wet hair, I find that the bristles are not sturdy enough for styling my hair, I use different brushes for that purpose.</li>
