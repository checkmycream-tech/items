            <li>but they are nice and bond</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them and will be purchasing again ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>Would be better if all the sized came in the order.</li>
            <li>The tips are okay, but they weren&#x27;t glitter.</li>
            <li>or I would have):)</li>
            <li>Theyre pretty good.</li>
            <li>Im going to love them excited to do my nails with these instead of shaping the square ones.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re are super cute</li>
            <li>plus they are a cheap quality.</li>

            <li>For the price they&#x27;re definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t flimsy and actually pretty strong.</li>

            <li>That was so much work</li>
            <li>The stiletto nail tips are super sturdy, they are really long, if you are going to jut put them on and paint your nails, make sure you file them down or buff them</li>
            <li>The nail are nice but a little to long for me...</li>
            <li>, the nail tip line connected to your actual nail, other wise for acrylic or gel nails there super nice and keep my nails looking weird if I had cut square nails into a stiletto shape, will buy again once I start to run low, shipping doe take a long time however, 3 weeks for me.</li>
            <li>The material looks clear.</li>
            <li>I like that they are not heavy or have a well because it allows me to place them at different lengths.</li>

            <li> This is my first time buying fake nails, but I can say they&#x27;re around the strength of real nails.</li>
            <li> Came in way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Did not really like these all sizes are a little to big</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not really a problem, just if the description says glitter color stiletto tips then it should be that.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single one of these defective or broken, yet, and i make a new set at least once a month.</li>
            <li> Missing size 8.</li>
            <li> The fake nails seemed a bit thin for my nails, but you could only notice it up close.</li>
            <li> Long time for shipping - and some of the nails looked dirty.  </li>
            <li> Nail tips where bad quality and Verry squishy and way to big</li>
            <li> Sorry it wouldnt let me upload a picture</li>
            <li> I want to try these out so badly</li>
