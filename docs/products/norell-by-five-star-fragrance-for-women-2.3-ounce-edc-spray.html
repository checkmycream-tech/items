            <li>When I asked my husband, he said he liked what I wore when we were dating (some 20 years earlier), so I began searching for Norell &amp; was very happy to find it online &amp; ordered right away.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite, so I was excited to find it</li>
            <li>Does not smell like the original and</li>
            <li>Love  Norell  cologne so much.. ...</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and the order was&lt;br /&gt;shipped to me quickly.  </li>
            <li>I first wore Norell in my 20&#x27;s &amp; 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I would like to order more of the same !!!!!</li>
            <li>Lou has passed now, I&#x27;m nearly 65, but I continue to love Norell &amp; wear it &amp; still get frequent compliments &amp; questions as to what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>however, it arrived unwrapped in it&#x27;s original box with no tampering apparent.</li>

            <li>My wife took this oversees to give to her mom and she absolutely likes it a lot and the scent stays with you all day.  </li>
            <li>and the real product</li>

            <li>Now if only she&#x27;d put a little less on each time, we&#x27;d both be happy!</li>
            <li>the box is aged but, it smells fine</li>
            <li>I paid 3 TIMES THE NORMAL COST.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to gt it thru you since it is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>Please bring it back soon at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s a scent my Grandmother has worn for longer than I&#x27;ve been alive and</li>

            <li> I first wore Norell in my 20&#x27;s &amp; 30&#x27;s. As it became impossible to find in retail stores, I drifted to others, but was never really happy with any of them. When I asked my husband, he said he liked what I wore when we were dating (some 20 years earlier), so I began searching for Norell &amp; was very happy to find it online &amp; ordered right away. He was, too. It brought back memories of our early life &amp; love. Lou has passed now, I&#x27;m nearly 65, but I continue to love Norell &amp; wear it &amp; still get frequent compliments &amp; questions as to what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.</li>

            <li> I would like to order more of the same !!!!!</li>
            <li> sometimes I order my fragrance and it seems like it is a bootleg version.  This is the real deal and the order was&lt;br /&gt;shipped to me quickly.  I will order from them again in the future.</li>

            <li> This is my signature fragrance and lately it&#x27;s been out of stock. It&#x27;s a delicious fresh fragrance with a hint of spice. Please bring it back soon at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Formula has changed, it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be.</li>
