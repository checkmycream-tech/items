    <ol>
            <li>let this put you off the wipes idea - the Cutex ones are great!</li>
            <li>smell great and remove all the polish!</li>
            <li>These are really great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I think for taking on vacation these pads are great, but for home use I still prefer the liquid ones with acetone.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>These are great...</li>
            <li>, acetone is supposedly not that great for your nails, but it does remove the nail color the best and fastest, that&#x27;s the reason why most nail salons use</li>
            <li>I love these, they&#x27;re not as awesomely powerhouse as my bottle of OPI remover,but then I&#x27;m not going to keep a bottle in my purse or desk drawer at work either...</li>
            <li>La Fresh product does an excellent job of removing nail polish and travels well too.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, super hydrating, takes off polish perfectly</li>
            <li>Nice smell,</li>
            <li>They work great and smell even better, which is very rare with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>The scent is really nice, but it takes A LOT more work to remove polish.  </li>
            <li>The cvs or wal mart store brand works much better than these do</li>
            <li>, I make sure that I apply the Vitaville</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>That being said, these smell lovely and if you work quickly they are able to remove two color coats and a top coat from both hands (I use one side per hand).  </li>
            <li>One pad does work fine for all 10 fingers, but it&#x27;s a lot of rubbing to remove even the lightest nail polish.  </li>
            <li>These do smell good and are very gentle, so they may be good to keep in your purse or in your medicine cabinet for a back up, or to use in a pinch.</li>
            <li>These do remove the polish from all ten nails, and are great to take in your travel bag.  </li>
            <li>Super convenient packaging, nice smell and indeed works on exactly 10 fingers.</li>
            <li>These are great for long trips if you don&#x27;t want to have to worry about nail polish spilling or bursting in your bag. . .</li>
            <li>Originally got these as a sample in a Birchbox one month</li>
            <li>like the fresh scent of these pads.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of removing power, I have to say they are not as strong as the ones with acetone in</li>
            <li>took ONE pad to quickly remove 2 coats of METALLIC nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves nails feeling pampered and fragrantly conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>4 FL OZ, Super Size.]</li>
            <li>but I love them because they condition my nails leaving them soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>If I have to double-up on the remover, it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>These are no mess and easy to use, they do take off all the polish on 10 fingers</li>
            <li>I also love the convenience of a wipe - especially when traveling.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, a little strong</li>
            <li>Much easier to use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore these wipes.</li>
            <li>They do a real bang up job on removing polish, even intense straining colors like red.</li>
            <li>the liquid evaporates leaving you with dry felt, so move quickly.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I received them as a sample when I bought some other products and instantly fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>I bought them for travel, but find myself reaching for them at home instead of the old cotton ball and bottle of acetone.  </li>
            <li>However, I did need 2 pads per hand to fully remove my (2 week old) nail polish.</li>
            <li>Even at the salon, they always put some oils on your nails and cuticles to make them look young and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it works very well without the dangerous chemicals.  </li>
            <li>They work well enough if you work quickly before the pad has a chance to dry out.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is sometimes needing more than one wipe for a hand</li>
            <li>wearing nail polish for over 50 years and La Fresh is not just in an another league, it is hands down, a GOLD METAL WINNER!</li>

            <li> and that&#x27;s not typical so not a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li> Unlike other polishes, they do not leave the white drying residue that acetone nail polish remover leaves.  </li>
            <li> dry, oily i pour reover onto these to get polish off.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering, and the pads did not leave my fingernails dry.</li>

            <li> I was a little skeptical because some Eco items don&#x27;t work as well as the original</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews.</li>
            <li> The formula leaves behind an oily residue, so I still needed to use an acetone remover to take the residue off before applying new polish.  </li>
            <li> Very weak and dry.</li>
            <li> I bought these pads to bring it on vacation as liquid remover are really not convenient and dangerous as they are flammable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Virgin Cold Pressed, Grade A, Odorless.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> which, trust me, is the worst!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> dry, oily i pour reover onto these to get polish off.</li>
            <li> These were inexpensive and looked convenient, so I thought I&#x27;d give them a try. I agree with other reviews. These pads are not very strong and they do take extra effort to remove your polish. They get the job done, but I prefer a traditional bottle and cotton ball acetone based remover. These do smell good and are very gentle, so they may be good to keep in your purse or in your medicine cabinet for a back up, or to use in a pinch.</li>
            <li> These do remove the polish from all ten nails, and are great to take in your travel bag.  I bought them for travel, but find myself reaching for them at home instead of the old cotton ball and bottle of acetone.  I&#x27;d use them every time, not just for traveling, but they&#x27;re pricey.</li>
            <li> These are really great. The smell is ok, a little strong but I love them because they condition my nails leaving them soft and shiny.Unlike other polishes, they do not leave the white drying residue that acetone nail polish remover leaves.  These are no mess and easy to use, they do take off all the polish on 10 fingers/toes like it says.</li>
            <li> These are great for long trips if you don&#x27;t want to have to worry about nail polish spilling or bursting in your bag. . . which, trust me, is the worst! They work well enough if you work quickly before the pad has a chance to dry out.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering, and the pads did not leave my fingernails dry. However, I did need 2 pads per hand to fully remove my (2 week old) nail polish.</li>
            <li> Very weak and dry. Gave up on them after the effort it took for just three nails. Nice smell, but I wanted my nail polish off.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let this put you off the wipes idea - the Cutex ones are great!</li>
            <li> Super convenient packaging, nice smell and indeed works on exactly 10 fingers. I used them for the international trip. They flew in cabin and did not raise any concern from TSA. Great product. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Extremely disappointed. The cvs or wal mart store brand works much better than these do</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, super hydrating, takes off polish perfectly</li>
            <li> WOW! If I could give this product &#x27;five stars PLUS,&#x27; I would!&lt;br /&gt;Only took ONE pad to quickly remove 2 coats of METALLIC nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves nails feeling pampered and fragrantly conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;Been wearing nail polish for over 50 years and La Fresh is not just in an another league, it is hands down, a GOLD METAL WINNER!</li>

No Preservatives, No Dyes, No Animal Testing. 4 FL OZ, Super Size.]] to put back the moisture and hydration back into my nails and cuticles. Even at the salon, they always put some oils on your nails and cuticles to make them look young and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Originally got these as a sample in a Birchbox one month and I fell in love. These are great...they are non-acetone, grapefruit scented, moisturizing heaven. They do a real bang up job on removing polish, even intense straining colors like red. My only complaint is sometimes needing more than one wipe for a hand but they&#x27;re fab and that&#x27;s not typical so not a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li> I love these, they&#x27;re not as awesomely powerhouse as my bottle of OPI remover,but then I&#x27;m not going to keep a bottle in my purse or desk drawer at work either... That being said, these smell lovely and if you work quickly they are able to remove two color coats and a top coat from both hands (I use one side per hand).  If you take too long the liquid evaporates leaving you with dry felt, so move quickly.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan.  The scent is really nice, but it takes A LOT more work to remove polish.  One pad does work fine for all 10 fingers, but it&#x27;s a lot of rubbing to remove even the lightest nail polish.  The formula leaves behind an oily residue, so I still needed to use an acetone remover to take the residue off before applying new polish.  If I have to double-up on the remover, it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> smell great and remove all the polish!</li>
            <li> La Fresh product does an excellent job of removing nail polish and travels well too. I prefer these pads over the bottled nail polish. Much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it works very well without the dangerous chemicals.  I was a little skeptical because some Eco items don&#x27;t work as well as the original but this item does and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Gave as part of a gift, so can&#x27;t say how it works.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these wipes. I received them as a sample when I bought some other products and instantly fell in love with them. They work great and smell even better, which is very rare with nail polish remover. I also love the convenience of a wipe - especially when traveling. I&#x27;ll be purchasing them as stocking stuffers for the ladies in my family this year.</li>
            <li> It took two pads to remove polish from 10 nails rather than the one pad for ten nails.</li>
