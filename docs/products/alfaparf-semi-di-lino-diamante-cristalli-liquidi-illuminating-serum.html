            <li>This purfume hair oil has a great scent but use very sparingly because it can be a bit pricey depending on where you purchase it..</li>

            <li>I get compliments all the time on the scent and how shiny and healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>It does not perform any better than the inexpensive oil products sold at WalMart or Target.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair oil.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil too.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the product and was able to buy it for 1/3 of the price of a salon.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>so glad I purchased it</li>
            <li>To my hair there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it helps keep your hair safe when using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for many years.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time &amp;amp; as expected,they&#x27;re just what d doctor ordered!My wife love them so much,she&#x27;s using them as her sandwich spread</li>
            <li>it for sure helps with the frizzes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love the way it leaves my hair after styling.</li>
            <li>Right away I could tell my hair loved it.</li>
            <li>This product is VERY rich.</li>
            <li>My daughters favorite and cannot live without this item for her hair and it has a great pice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;ve made it more accessible to the masses.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and shining, has an great smell.</li>
            <li>It did its job as far as being a heat protector, but not the great product it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li>Highly suggest this product to anyone with damaged hair and even healthy hair for the nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of other oils and serums, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so I wash with Dove soap after to make sure that the product isn&#x27;t too rich for my skin.</li>
            <li>At that time, it wasn&#x27;t so easy to come by; you had to have a business or cosmetology license to buy it.</li>
            <li>Too strong of a scent.</li>
            <li>The samples i tried from a hair dresser, were better than full bottle.</li>
            <li>It works good, but I must have really dry hair because I use a lot more than some reviewers say they use!</li>
            <li>I have MBL fine, relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells this way less than salons which is awesome.</li>
            <li>The smell is not super feminine (which is awesome), but it&#x27;s just a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect to use on your hair if it feels and looks a little dry.....brings out the shine like you cannot imagine...</li>
            <li>Has light scent, I am using it after every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully light and</li>
            <li>Fortunately we can buy it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>When I wear my hair straight it is amazing as a smoother for blowdrying.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and shiny without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading thru internet, I came to know that this is advanced version of hairgel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>beautiful, a little like men&#x27;s cologne (which I personally love)</li>
            <li>I was excited to see that I could purchase this online.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my hair felt dryer and more brittle.</li>
            <li>That is the perfect amount for my hair, which is just past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Others have mentioned that it leaves a clean smell, almost like laundry.  </li>
            <li>This product not only makes my hair look shiny and healthy, it also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Delicious soft smell the only complain is not about the product in self</li>
            <li>No big deal until I used it the first time and the wonderful smell that I was used to wasn&#x27;t as strong as it normally was.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and it protects from high humidity.</li>
            <li>I have fine, very curly hair, which frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and nice looking too.</li>
            <li>I only got to try it once which would not be a fair review.</li>
            <li>might* be good for coarse hair, or anyone who blow-dries, but it was not the right fit for me</li>
            <li>I have even tried other brands with new products and lots of promises, and none of that has worked like this, the smell is wonderful, and every time I wear it people make compliments.</li>
            <li>I always get the product quickly and packed well..</li>
            <li>My hair became greasy really quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, but it&#x27;s worth putting up with: this does tame those fly aways, and does leave a super gorgeous gloss.  </li>
            <li>I really love this and love that it lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Living in Florida with the rain and humidity, this product really keeps my hair looking nice and feeling soft!</li>
            <li>Helps calm curly hair.</li>
            <li>When this product is used it adds a soft silkie healthy shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li>heavenly scent, and it makes your hair feel more manageable, and soft - have used it for years</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>My wife has thick, gorgeous hair and this makes it even more lustrous.</li>
            <li>so it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone but especially for those of us who frequently style our hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves it soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>Delivery was very reasonable and quick.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny and super soft, and it&#x27;s SO light-</li>
            <li>It usually works great by itself, but the final look when using AlfaParf is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>price was right</li>
            <li>Price was right</li>
            <li>Smells good but have to be careful of what clients to use it on, smells very high</li>
            <li>Warm it between your hands and rub through dry hair to style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light but has a strong scent which,does die down once it has been applied.</li>
            <li>It is light, smells great, and works well on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean, like French milled soap, or clean laundry.</li>
            <li>Exactly the product I was looking for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had short hair but was able to grow mine out to a sleek bob with the help of this serum.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and smells very fr3shNcl3an!</li>
            <li>The first thing that caught my attentionswas the fragrance.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, and I will always order it!</li>
            <li>First off, I should say the package came in record time.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>Like the smell, make hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, but still very affordable.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!!</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Arrived pretty quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best of all, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but I&#x27;m actually giving up on it after a week.</li>
            <li>Even better is that it&#x27;s super effective, put a few drops throughout my hair before blow drying (or even when I let it air dry, gasp)</li>
            <li>While it was cool to use and smelled nice, I&#x27;m not really sure what it did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall rating is good for this product and it is applicable to male and female.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay- reminds me of a men&#x27;s cologne, but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long, so  </li>
            <li>Leave a very elegant smell and immediately untangles my frizzy, dried ends.  </li>
            <li>I had yet to find an effective shine spray/serum that gave results without weighing my hair down or making it look like I could fry an egg on my head, but this product is absolutely perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It advertises that it makes your hair less frizzy and that it holds it in place, but I didn&#x27;t honestly notice too much of a difference in either of those departments.</li>
            <li>My hair is permed and with this oil its hydrated and stays in soft curls, looking naturally and easy to stile.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this actually gives me body and shine.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how it feels just a little oily when in the palm of your hand-but it doesn&#x27;t in any way make your hair oily.</li>
            <li>Much easier for her to maintain.</li>
            <li>My hair is super-fine, so I really notice that this product is just a bit heavier...</li>
            <li>Fast shipment,love the product</li>
            <li>not so much...</li>
            <li>it really brings some shine to your hair and it protects against humidity.</li>
            <li>But because the product is so light and non-greasy; it evenly spreads along the entire hair-shaft without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>overall, a fantastic product</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The real thing and the price can&#x27;t be beat...</li>
            <li>and I really see a difference.</li>
            <li>Product was packed very well.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must have staple in my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and it gave it so much life and shine after I tried it.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to put about a dime size amount in your palms, rub your hands together and then gently apply it to the ends.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t protect too much from the frizz though.</li>
            <li>product fast shipping</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with straight hair.</li>
            <li>Makes hear soft, shiny and maneagable!!!  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser busted this amazing smelling serum out one day after pressing and styling my hair and I was on a serious hunt right after.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and long.</li>
            <li>I like the product but the top came off after the first few times that I used it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, reliable, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have a nice scent, but it also helps those dry and split ends.</li>
            <li>I have always liked the way it made my hair shine and the texture, but was a little leery of the nearly $40 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>I live in Florida which is very humid</li>
            <li>So point is I don&#x27;t know if what I received was an older or newer formula</li>
            <li>Apply it to your hair wet or dry to give it a super silky feel!!!</li>
            <li>The scent does not linger on the hair--once my hair is dry, I barely notice it any more.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>As to the product highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend</li>
            <li>Fabulous for Dry Curly Hair!</li>
            <li>I only used two pumps which ends up being a dime-sized amount, doesn&#x27;t seem like much and at first</li>
            <li>, so normally my hair turns into an Afro...</li>
            <li>and this keeps the frizzies at bay and makes my dead ends appear healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair extremely shiny and it&#x27;s as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>I live in a climate that is almost 100% humidity.</li>
            <li>I live in florida</li>
            <li>Three girls in family cannot live without it&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product  and is only sold in upscale salons and online-it is generally only offered at 1-2 salons in a town.</li>
            <li>and this is so light it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or make it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>THIS product, along with a new flat iron were the first two purchases I knew I needed to make.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine hair and tends to get oily fast...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or gooky but seems to keep everything in place withshine.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky in touch and it protects hair from styling damage.</li>
            <li>My hair dries to a soft beach wave.</li>
            <li>shiny and soft results.</li>
            <li>I have used this since I was 8 or 9 years old.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that really calms my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair is shiny and smooth with just a few drops.</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair with a GHD professional styler.</li>
            <li>The alfaparf makes it soft and shiny, but not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to get two for the price of one when I received my package.</li>
            <li>The small pump is easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>It can get frizzy easily and not many products work well on it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, long blonde hair and this product weighed it down.</li>
            <li>I will search high &amp; low for this serum.....</li>
            <li>It puts the same shine and tames down my bushy hair before flat ironing as it did when I bought it at the salons for alot more money.  </li>
            <li>Used the product for the first time this morning on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Several years ago I had a haircut in a New Jersey salon that specializes in curly hair...</li>
            <li>I have always bought this from my salon but had recently moved and have yet to find a new salon.</li>
            <li>But I use this product before and after I dry my hair, and it really smooths my fried ends.</li>
            <li>still do.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it lightly to my thick, coarse hair and make sure not to get it on my roots.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick fine hair</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it smells fantastic...</li>
            <li>After drying with a hair dryer, I usually add a few more pumps to smooth down extra frizz.</li>
            <li>I have big, naturally curly, mixed race hair.</li>
            <li>when I get it half of the bottle are empty and spilled the product for all over&lt;br /&gt;the bag ,,, I think seller need to be more carefully when send the products and check</li>
            <li>and I am constantly trying many anti-frizz products because our humidity level here is crazy which makes a good blow dry or any hair do difficult to upkeep throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non oily, and the fragrance is very delicate.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, so the lightness of the product is a huge benefit.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> so glad I purchased it</li>
            <li> To my hair there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it helps keep your hair safe when using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for many years.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp;amp; as expected,they&#x27;re just what d doctor ordered!My wife love them so much,she&#x27;s using them as her sandwich spread</li>
            <li> it for sure helps with the frizzes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love the way it leaves my hair after styling.</li>
            <li> Right away I could tell my hair loved it.</li>
            <li> This product is VERY rich.</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite and cannot live without this item for her hair and it has a great pice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;ve made it more accessible to the masses.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and shining, has an great smell.</li>
            <li> It did its job as far as being a heat protector, but not the great product it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li> Highly suggest this product to anyone with damaged hair and even healthy hair for the nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other oils and serums, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so I wash with Dove soap after to make sure that the product isn&#x27;t too rich for my skin.</li>
            <li> At that time, it wasn&#x27;t so easy to come by; you had to have a business or cosmetology license to buy it.</li>
            <li> Too strong of a scent.</li>
            <li> The samples i tried from a hair dresser, were better than full bottle.</li>
            <li> It works good, but I must have really dry hair because I use a lot more than some reviewers say they use!</li>
            <li> I have MBL fine, relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells this way less than salons which is awesome.</li>
            <li> The smell is not super feminine (which is awesome), but it&#x27;s just a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect to use on your hair if it feels and looks a little dry.....brings out the shine like you cannot imagine...</li>
            <li> Has light scent, I am using it after every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light and</li>
            <li> Fortunately we can buy it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> When I wear my hair straight it is amazing as a smoother for blowdrying.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and shiny without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading thru internet, I came to know that this is advanced version of hairgel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> beautiful, a little like men&#x27;s cologne (which I personally love)</li>
            <li> I was excited to see that I could purchase this online.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my hair felt dryer and more brittle.</li>
            <li> That is the perfect amount for my hair, which is just past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Others have mentioned that it leaves a clean smell, almost like laundry.  </li>
            <li> This product not only makes my hair look shiny and healthy, it also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Delicious soft smell the only complain is not about the product in self</li>
            <li> No big deal until I used it the first time and the wonderful smell that I was used to wasn&#x27;t as strong as it normally was.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and it protects from high humidity.</li>
            <li> I have fine, very curly hair, which frizzes easily.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and nice looking too.</li>
            <li> I only got to try it once which would not be a fair review.</li>
            <li> might* be good for coarse hair, or anyone who blow-dries, but it was not the right fit for me</li>
            <li> I have even tried other brands with new products and lots of promises, and none of that has worked like this, the smell is wonderful, and every time I wear it people make compliments.</li>
            <li> I always get the product quickly and packed well..</li>
            <li> My hair became greasy really quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, but it&#x27;s worth putting up with: this does tame those fly aways, and does leave a super gorgeous gloss.  </li>
            <li> I really love this and love that it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Living in Florida with the rain and humidity, this product really keeps my hair looking nice and feeling soft!</li>
            <li> Helps calm curly hair.</li>
            <li> When this product is used it adds a soft silkie healthy shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li> heavenly scent, and it makes your hair feel more manageable, and soft - have used it for years</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> My wife has thick, gorgeous hair and this makes it even more lustrous.</li>
            <li> so it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone but especially for those of us who frequently style our hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves it soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Delivery was very reasonable and quick.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and super soft, and it&#x27;s SO light-</li>
            <li> It usually works great by itself, but the final look when using AlfaParf is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> price was right</li>
            <li> Price was right</li>
            <li> Smells good but have to be careful of what clients to use it on, smells very high</li>
            <li> Warm it between your hands and rub through dry hair to style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light but has a strong scent which,does die down once it has been applied.</li>
            <li> It is light, smells great, and works well on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and clean, like French milled soap, or clean laundry.</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I was looking for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had short hair but was able to grow mine out to a sleek bob with the help of this serum.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and smells very fr3shNcl3an!</li>
            <li> The first thing that caught my attentionswas the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and I will always order it!</li>
            <li> First off, I should say the package came in record time.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Like the smell, make hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, but still very affordable.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!!</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> Arrived pretty quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best of all, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but I&#x27;m actually giving up on it after a week.</li>
            <li> Even better is that it&#x27;s super effective, put a few drops throughout my hair before blow drying (or even when I let it air dry, gasp)</li>
            <li> While it was cool to use and smelled nice, I&#x27;m not really sure what it did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall rating is good for this product and it is applicable to male and female.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay- reminds me of a men&#x27;s cologne, but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long, so  </li>
            <li> Leave a very elegant smell and immediately untangles my frizzy, dried ends.  </li>
            <li> I had yet to find an effective shine spray/serum that gave results without weighing my hair down or making it look like I could fry an egg on my head, but this product is absolutely perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It advertises that it makes your hair less frizzy and that it holds it in place, but I didn&#x27;t honestly notice too much of a difference in either of those departments.</li>
            <li> My hair is permed and with this oil its hydrated and stays in soft curls, looking naturally and easy to stile.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this actually gives me body and shine.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how it feels just a little oily when in the palm of your hand-but it doesn&#x27;t in any way make your hair oily.</li>
            <li> Much easier for her to maintain.</li>
            <li> My hair is super-fine, so I really notice that this product is just a bit heavier...</li>
            <li> Fast shipment,love the product</li>
            <li> not so much...</li>
            <li> it really brings some shine to your hair and it protects against humidity.</li>
            <li> But because the product is so light and non-greasy; it evenly spreads along the entire hair-shaft without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li> overall, a fantastic product</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The real thing and the price can&#x27;t be beat...</li>
            <li> and I really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Product was packed very well.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have staple in my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and it gave it so much life and shine after I tried it.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to put about a dime size amount in your palms, rub your hands together and then gently apply it to the ends.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t protect too much from the frizz though.</li>
            <li> product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with straight hair.</li>
            <li> Makes hear soft, shiny and maneagable!!!  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser busted this amazing smelling serum out one day after pressing and styling my hair and I was on a serious hunt right after.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and long.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the top came off after the first few times that I used it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, reliable, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a nice scent, but it also helps those dry and split ends.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the way it made my hair shine and the texture, but was a little leery of the nearly $40 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> I live in Florida which is very humid</li>
            <li> So point is I don&#x27;t know if what I received was an older or newer formula</li>
            <li> Apply it to your hair wet or dry to give it a super silky feel!!!</li>
            <li> The scent does not linger on the hair--once my hair is dry, I barely notice it any more.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> As to the product highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend</li>
            <li> Fabulous for Dry Curly Hair!</li>
            <li> I only used two pumps which ends up being a dime-sized amount, doesn&#x27;t seem like much and at first</li>
            <li> , so normally my hair turns into an Afro...</li>
            <li> and this keeps the frizzies at bay and makes my dead ends appear healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair extremely shiny and it&#x27;s as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> I live in a climate that is almost 100% humidity.</li>
            <li> I live in florida</li>
            <li> Three girls in family cannot live without it&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product  and is only sold in upscale salons and online-it is generally only offered at 1-2 salons in a town.</li>
            <li> and this is so light it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or make it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> THIS product, along with a new flat iron were the first two purchases I knew I needed to make.</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine hair and tends to get oily fast...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or gooky but seems to keep everything in place withshine.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky in touch and it protects hair from styling damage.</li>
            <li> My hair dries to a soft beach wave.</li>
            <li> shiny and soft results.</li>
            <li> I have used this since I was 8 or 9 years old.</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that really calms my hair.</li>
            <li> Hair is shiny and smooth with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair with a GHD professional styler.</li>
            <li> The alfaparf makes it soft and shiny, but not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to get two for the price of one when I received my package.</li>
            <li> The small pump is easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> It can get frizzy easily and not many products work well on it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, long blonde hair and this product weighed it down.</li>
            <li> I will search high &amp; low for this serum.....</li>
            <li> It puts the same shine and tames down my bushy hair before flat ironing as it did when I bought it at the salons for alot more money.  </li>
            <li> Used the product for the first time this morning on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I had a haircut in a New Jersey salon that specializes in curly hair...</li>
            <li> I have always bought this from my salon but had recently moved and have yet to find a new salon.</li>
            <li> But I use this product before and after I dry my hair, and it really smooths my fried ends.</li>
            <li> still do.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it lightly to my thick, coarse hair and make sure not to get it on my roots.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick fine hair</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it smells fantastic...</li>
            <li> After drying with a hair dryer, I usually add a few more pumps to smooth down extra frizz.</li>
            <li> I have big, naturally curly, mixed race hair.</li>
            <li> when I get it half of the bottle are empty and spilled the product for all over&lt;br /&gt;the bag ,,, I think seller need to be more carefully when send the products and check</li>
            <li> and I am constantly trying many anti-frizz products because our humidity level here is crazy which makes a good blow dry or any hair do difficult to upkeep throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, non oily, and the fragrance is very delicate.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, so the lightness of the product is a huge benefit.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, curly, long Italian unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very oil hair and this product after I flat iron does not get heavy or oily</li>
            <li> The price tag is pretty steep for such a small bottle but as long as I use it sparingly, I could see it lasting a very long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time because you only need a drop or two.</li>
            <li> Now, from time to time, I&#x27;ve decided I will do a blow out and flat iron just to mix things up a bit with my hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Then I either air dry or blow it out, then flat iron.</li>
            <li> This stuff usually does the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve bought this long time ago.</li>
            <li> So I bought this as a drunken purchase one night because I used to have relatively long hair.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this product which sat in my drawer for a long time.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this product for as long as I continue to find it.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that does not weigh it down or makes it instantly oily.</li>
            <li> Her hair has grown dry over time and she wanted something that would help bring silkiness and softness to it.</li>
            <li> Can be used before and after blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I think the serum helps my hair to dry faster--</li>
            <li> I air dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t blow dry just clipped it and allowed it to hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I find it so helpful for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> thing, after you wash your hair, dry it up and then apply it.&lt;br /&gt;you can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with thick course hair.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for the past 4 months and so far no adverse side</li>
            <li> it makes your hair shiny with a little drop and it last long.</li>
            <li> I use this every day on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Could not live without it!</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair when it &#x27;s wet, along with some leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> tightly closed</li>
            <li> Has a healing effect to dry hair without weighing down hair or leaving greasy residue.</li>
            <li> and you only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I continue to try other products, but nothing has beet this yet.</li>
            <li> i should have not believed the reviews of other amazon customers.  </li>
            <li> I use it to control dry ends and fly-aways after blow-dry by applying just a little on the ends.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair due to washing and blow-drying everyday.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t too greasy and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This is not sticky, not oily or greasy, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> I have a bit less volume with the AlfaParf.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is smoother and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I do not like harsh, chemical fragrances, but this fragrance does not bother me.</li>
            <li> and I always have trouble with frizz...</li>
            <li> I discovered Alfaparf at beauty exhibition few years ago and was given few testers.</li>
            <li> This oil is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Not cheap like store brand silicone products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review that just as soon as I use it a few times.</li>
            <li> A little on the ends and the pieces around my face do the trick!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like it very much :(</li>
            <li> This serum made my hair feel heavy and greasy, and it seemed hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> My gray hair sometimes has the tendency to look dull.</li>
            <li> If you are clumsy like me, this could be an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 5 years already.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> If you have curls, you will understand what I mean.</li>
            <li> but I still have half of it!!!</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy, does not weigh my hair down, and does not make it look dirty.</li>
            <li> My hair is addicted to it.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the late feedback.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, for my highlighted, thin, blond hair.</li>
            <li> At some point my supply was exhausted.</li>
            <li> Seriously, there is nothing compared!</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with an Alfaparf product.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed..</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love it. will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love using this on my hair, I don&#x27;t like using hair products like mouse or hairspray. This is perfect when you are straightening your hair and need to get the frizz or hair to relax. Smells really good too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only thing that gets tangles out of my hair extensions which is why I bought it. Makes my hair soft and nice looking too.</li>
            <li> My wife tried ALOT of different hair treatments and found this one at a local beauty supply shop and tried it upon recommendation from the owner. It is about $10 cheaper buying it through Amazon.com.  You will not be dissappointed! Her hair is silky and sexy. Much easier for her to maintain.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! I have damaged hair from straightening and dying.  When this product is used it adds a soft silkie healthy shine to my hair.  Makes my hair more managable.  Highly suggest this product to anyone with damaged hair and even healthy hair for the nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but I&#x27;m actually giving up on it after a week. I have fine, very curly hair, which frizzes easily. This serum made my hair feel heavy and greasy, and it seemed hard to wash out. I can imagine it *might* be good for coarse hair, or anyone who blow-dries, but it was not the right fit for me and I will be passing it on to a fellow curly-top asap.</li>
            <li> Smells like Cologne and makes my hair shiny</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I was looking for and I received it in a timely manner.  Great product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  Makes my hair super shiny and super soft, and it&#x27;s SO light- doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other oils and serums, but this is the best.  The smell is okay- reminds me of a men&#x27;s cologne, but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long, so  it&#x27;s okay.  This beats Moroccanoil, and Frizz Ease, in my opinion.  Will definitely buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> A nice light oil for my hair.  Have used it before and love it</li>
            <li> The samples i tried from a hair dresser, were better than full bottle. For some reason it was not as efficient.</li>
            <li> Smells really really good</li>
            <li> I read about this on a blog and gave it a try. I love the product and will buy it again. It has a lovely smell. I have wavy/curly hair (depending on the day and humidity) and this helps keep the frizz away and define my curls.</li>
            <li> Not oily, smoothing. Luscious aroma. Helps calm curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with every Semi Di Lino (Alfaparf) product I have used to date. From the scent to the results. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with an Alfaparf product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve had short hair but was able to grow mine out to a sleek bob with the help of this serum.  It&#x27;s not heavy or gooky but seems to keep everything in place withshine.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and smells very fr3shNcl3an!</li>
            <li> My salon charges $34 for this and I got it here for $14. My hair is addicted to it.</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I was looking for a product to take the place of my beloved (and lost) Crystal D&#x27;Oro.  This is close.  My hair is super-fine, so I really notice that this product is just a bit heavier... I have a bit less volume with the AlfaParf.  Others have mentioned that it leaves a clean smell, almost like laundry.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, but it&#x27;s worth putting up with: this does tame those fly aways, and does leave a super gorgeous gloss.  Recommended?  You bet!  As good as the Crystal D&#x27;Oro?  Almost.</li>
            <li> This product is VERY rich. It is amazing at getting all of your waterproof make up, and makes for a great mini-facial massage. I have oily skin, so I wash with Dove soap after to make sure that the product isn&#x27;t too rich for my skin. It works great with sensitivity and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for your hair smells delicious</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product. It&#x27;s the best treatment you can get for your hair. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it after a hair wash instead of conditioner. It leaves my hair better.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the late feedback. Will continue to buy from you... great service and product. As to the product highly recommend it. I just love it!!!  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 4 years ago when I had a stylist use it on me in the salon. The first thing that caught my attentionswas the fragrance. In my opinion, it is heavenly. However, ultimately the reason I continue to use this product above all others is that it works. My hair is fine and long. I live in a climate that is almost 100% humidity. Those two things create disaster hair days. With AlfaParf I have wonderful hair days consistently. I recommend it without hesitation. The prices on Amazon are unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and never found anything else that would give the same results. It&#x27;s light, non oily, and the fragrance is very delicate. 5 starts no doubt!</li>
            <li> Generous quantity for the price! Great Buy!</li>
            <li> This product is great, smooths out my hair and gives it shine.  I use it every day!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment,love the product</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and this is the best hair glossing oil! Several years ago I had a haircut in a New Jersey salon that specializes in curly hair...not so much...but they used this product on me and I loved it. It&#x27;s made in Milan, smells amazing and you only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;The price was right and I received it on time. I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like this serum! I have even tried other brands with new products and lots of promises, and none of that has worked like this, the smell is wonderful, and every time I wear it people make compliments. All my friends have tried and they just love it too! Seriously, there is nothing compared! I ordered this one here almost 4 months ago, and I use it every day but I still have half of it!!! The shipping was fast, and I will always order it!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have MBL fine, relaxed hair. I only apply 2 pumps to my hair before blow drying. It&#x27;s very light but has a strong scent which,does die down once it has been applied.</li>
            <li> Beware. The bottle is glass. After only one use, it fell on tile and broke. I only got to try it once which would not be a fair review. If you are clumsy like me, this could be an issue.</li>
            <li> the salon I go to uses this after my cut or color. I have always liked the way it made my hair shine and the texture, but was a little leery of the nearly $40 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;Was so happy to find it on Amazon at an affordable price!!</li>
            <li> I have always bought this from my salon but had recently moved and have yet to find a new salon. I was excited to see that I could purchase this online. When I received it, the bottle looked different than the picture. No big deal until I used it the first time and the wonderful smell that I was used to wasn&#x27;t as strong as it normally was. After the first use, my hair felt dryer and more brittle. This stuff usually does the complete opposite. So point is I don&#x27;t know if what I received was an older or newer formula but I don&#x27;t like it very much :(</li>
            <li> Excellent product - great for making my hair look fantastic.  I love it.  I highly recommend it for anyone with thick course hair.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, for my highlighted, thin, blond hair. Has light scent, I am using it after every time I wash my hair. Great product for great price. Makes my hair soft and silky in touch and it protects hair from styling damage. Will buy definetly again!!! Fast shipping, reliable, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic ! It leaves your hair soft and shining, has an great smell. Should&#x27;ve bought this long time ago. Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells this way less than salons which is awesome. Love the way it smells and feels on my hair whether I leave it curly or straighten. Yes would recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light and the fragrance is amazing. Would recommend to anyone who uses an oil serum in their hair. Five stars.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, makes hair smooth</li>
            <li> I would order again no problem</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!! great product for fine hair. it really brings some shine to your hair and it protects against humidity. I live in florida and I am constantly trying many anti-frizz products because our humidity level here is crazy which makes a good blow dry or any hair do difficult to upkeep throughout the day. This is an awesome product, my hair is very straight, and fine and I have highlights as well and use a lot of hot tools, this is a great product. !</li>
            <li> heavenly scent, and it makes your hair feel more manageable, and soft - have used it for years</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this glosser.  I have been using it for years and my hairdresser stopped carrying it.  I have really thick hair and this is so light it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or make it feel greasy.  The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> First off, I should say the package came in record time. I was expecting it to be here around the 8th of May but I got it on the 29th of April. So I&#x27;m very impressed with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product. Never in my life has my hair ever been so shiny.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very light serum and not greasy at all. I only used two pumps which ends up being a dime-sized amount, doesn&#x27;t seem like much and at first I thought I&#x27;d have to used more. But because the product is so light and non-greasy; it evenly spreads along the entire hair-shaft without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;Smells beautiful, a little like men&#x27;s cologne (which I personally love) and it gives your hair a mirror like sheen.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s impressive. I had yet to find an effective shine spray/serum that gave results without weighing my hair down or making it look like I could fry an egg on my head, but this product is absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It tames flyaways as well and frizz is...gone. It&#x27;s raining today, so normally my hair turns into an Afro... but it&#x27;s been hours since I applied this product (I&#x27;ve even been out in the rain) and frizz has yet to appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY con is the price. The price tag is pretty steep for such a small bottle but as long as I use it sparingly, I could see it lasting a very long time. (just two droplets, twice a week [I only style my hair twice a week]... I&#x27;d expect it to last 6months to a year for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, a fantastic product and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years!!!  It&#x27;s truly one of the best products out there.  I always get compliments about my hair -- just don&#x27;t over do it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived on time, smooth process!  Please maintain the good service! Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;No more words needed to describe satisfaccion!  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Better and cheaper than Morocan Oil! Fabulous for Dry Curly Hair!</li>
            <li> once you&#x27;ve used and abused from hair dryer and hair ironing, this product comes in for help to improve your hair brightness</li>
            <li> My mom loves it! Her hair has grown dry over time and she wanted something that would help bring silkiness and softness to it. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you have greasy hair. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this actually gives me body and shine. I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! The smell is not super feminine (which is awesome), but it&#x27;s just a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; smell, not overpowering. Even better is that it&#x27;s super effective, put a few drops throughout my hair before blow drying (or even when I let it air dry, gasp) and my hair is smoother and less frizzy. Will continue to buy! I continue to try other products, but nothing has beet this yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 5 years already. Putting a small amount on before blowdrying do prevent hair from becoming overly dried. And the bonus - Amazon&#x27;s price was a lot cheaper than at the hair salon.</li>
            <li> Great product! Could not live without it!</li>
            <li> The real thing and the price can&#x27;t be beat...Paul Nehrich  6/22/15</li>
            <li> Leaves hair (even damaged hair) looking healthy, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I like the way this serum makes your hair feel and the way it makes your hair smell..It also add a shine that my hair needed especially for the winter time.</li>
            <li> My gray hair sometimes has the tendency to look dull. This product makes it shiny without being greasy and it smells great.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better! It is light, smells great, and works well on wet or dry hair. My hair is thin, so the lightness of the product is a huge benefit.</li>
            <li> So I bought this as a drunken purchase one night because I used to have relatively long hair. While it was cool to use and smelled nice, I&#x27;m not really sure what it did. It advertises that it makes your hair less frizzy and that it holds it in place, but I didn&#x27;t honestly notice too much of a difference in either of those departments. That said, it did make my hair look shinier (and not in a greasy way), so that was a definite plus!</li>
            <li> My hair looks so healthy and shinny after using this serum. I love it. It&#x27;s light and has a great scent</li>
            <li> Bought this because my hair dresser always uses on my hair and I love it. It smells great and leaves my hair very smooth!</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed..i should have not believed the reviews of other amazon customers.  Kerastese oleo relax serum is a lot more better and effective for static hair.</li>
            <li> It puts the same shine and tames down my bushy hair before flat ironing as it did when I bought it at the salons for alot more money.  Love it!</li>
            <li> it makes your hair shiny with a little drop and it last long. It smells great. I am a hair stylist and my customers love it.</li>
            <li> This purfume hair oil has a great scent but use very sparingly because it can be a bit pricey depending on where you purchase it..</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.  A salon in England recommended it to her.  Fortunately we can buy it through Amazon.  My wife has thick, gorgeous hair and this makes it even more lustrous.</li>
            <li> Leave a very elegant smell and immediately untangles my frizzy, dried ends.  Can be used before and after blow dry.  I use it every night because my ends is severely damaged.</li>
            <li> Like the smell, make hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over 10 years and I love it... I always get the product quickly and packed well..</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, color-treated hair. This serum works perfectly for me. I wash with shampoo, do not use conditioner, brush out my hair and use two pumps of this serum. That is the perfect amount for my hair, which is just past my shoulders. The scent of the serum is nice. It reminds me of a mild, pleasant perfume. The scent does not linger on the hair--once my hair is dry, I barely notice it any more. I do not like harsh, chemical fragrances, but this fragrance does not bother me. I think the serum helps my hair to dry faster--I air dry. I have not tried using it before blow drying. My hair dries to a soft beach wave. This product is not greasy, does not weigh my hair down, and does not make it look dirty.</li>
            <li> this line of products is great!  my hair looks and feels so much better then before using.  this oil smells great and does not leave your hair oily.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product....once you try it you are instantly hooked! A little goes a long way and it smells fantastic...I get compliments all the time on the scent and how shiny and healthy my hair looks. I have thick fine hair and I always have trouble with frizz...this allows my hair to stay shiny and it helps keep it nice an sleek :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks. It does not perform any better than the inexpensive oil products sold at WalMart or Target. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this oil and the fragrance...still do.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it lightly to my thick, coarse hair and make sure not to get it on my roots.&lt;br /&gt;Very shiny and soft results.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product  and is only sold in upscale salons and online-it is generally only offered at 1-2 salons in a town. This is one item line (Semi Di Lino) that you will not find at Walmart or Target. It is GREAT for color treated hair, and very concentrated so the bottle lasts a while. It is amazing how it feels just a little oily when in the palm of your hand-but it doesn&#x27;t in any way make your hair oily. And to make it even better-it smells wonderful! This is one of my makeup table &amp;#34;staples&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Apply it to your hair wet or dry to give it a super silky feel!!! would buy it over again</li>
            <li> I have used this since I was 8 or 9 years old. I&#x27;m 28 now, and I still use this product. It smells great, and it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and it protects from high humidity.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser and I really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Too strong of a scent.</li>
            <li> LOVE&amp;#60;LOVE&amp;#60;LOVE</li>
            <li> This product will keep your hair soft, healthy, and smelling great!! It is worth every penny, but still very affordable.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair due to washing and blow-drying everyday.  But I use this product before and after I dry my hair, and it really smooths my fried ends.</li>
            <li> Used the product for the first time this morning on wet hair.  I didn&#x27;t blow dry just clipped it and allowed it to hair dry.  Wow...what a shiny head of hair.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to shine and smell great, this is the item. Makes my hair smell wonderful. Highly reccomend</li>
            <li> I love it. Good product</li>
            <li> I discovered Alfaparf at beauty exhibition few years ago and was given few testers. I tried shampoo and this illuminating serum and was amazed. It fines hair, makes it shine, doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I have oily, died hair and apply this serum occasionally. My hair feels like after saloon.  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Try the serum once and I like it. It is light weight and it smells great. The small pump is easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> So,glad to find this product again! I used it all the time and loved it...but had lost track of the name of this product! Yay!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair oil. I use it for about a year now. I absolutely happy with the results. My hair is permed and with this oil its hydrated and stays in soft curls, looking naturally and easy to stile.</li>
            <li> Great. I&#x27;ve used this before and it was exactly what I expected. Product was packed very well.</li>
            <li> This oil is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I use this on my curly hair- it isn&#x27;t too greasy and it does not weigh it down. It lasts a long time because you only need a drop or two. Warm it between your hands and rub through dry hair to style. It smells amazing and I always get compliments when I wear it. I use it on days when I want to freshen up my curls, and not shower all over again. If you have curls, you will understand what I mean. It allows you to reshape them and style as you would like. Creates great shine too. If you use hairspray, it will still work bc it is not too greasy. When I wear my hair straight it is amazing as a smoother for blowdrying. It will not cause frizz. I really love this and love that it lasts a long time so it is well worth the cost. Not cheap like store brand silicone products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It smooths my hair without making it greasy. Living in Florida with the rain and humidity, this product really keeps my hair looking nice and feeling soft! A little on the ends and the pieces around my face do the trick!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the only thing that really calms my hair. I love the smell of this oil too. I am so glad I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the product and was able to buy it for 1/3 of the price of a salon.  Delivery was very reasonable and quick.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have big, naturally curly, mixed race hair. I used to use this serum when I chemically straightened my hair, but that&#x27;s been well over 7 years ago now. IT. IS. AMAZING!!  At that time, it wasn&#x27;t so easy to come by; you had to have a business or cosmetology license to buy it. I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;ve made it more accessible to the masses. Now, from time to time, I&#x27;ve decided I will do a blow out and flat iron just to mix things up a bit with my hairstyles. THIS product, along with a new flat iron were the first two purchases I knew I needed to make. This stuff SEALS your hair, especially the ends, and gives it hella shine without being at all greasy! I put it on my hair when it &#x27;s wet, along with some leave in conditioner. Then I either air dry or blow it out, then flat iron. I&#x27;m telling you, the best money you&#x27;ll spend on a hair product!  I&#x27;ve also just decided I&#x27;ll be getting their protein deep conditioner to repair some damage to my hair. I&#x27;ll review that just as soon as I use it a few times. This is definitely a 5 star product, if I could, I&#x27;ve give it 6!!</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite and cannot live without this item for her hair and it has a great pice</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> I love it, very good product, amazing , shipping too fast</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. This is an absolute must have staple in my hair care regimen. I have super thick, curly, long Italian unruly hair. It can get frizzy easily and not many products work well on it. This is not sticky, not oily or greasy, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and I can use it whether I straighten it leave it curly. I live in Florida which is very humid and this keeps the frizzies at bay and makes my dead ends appear healthy and hydrated. Been using this product since 2001. Love it. Never found a product like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair serum!!! Makes hear soft, shiny and maneagable!!!  Not greasy at all, I was using Babyliss Pro argan oil before but it does not detangles the hair as this oil does. Great product!!! Recommendend for all types of hair!!!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!! I will search high &amp; low for this serum.....it&#x27;s the best ever!!! Thank YOU! My hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Another hair oil as good as any. Smells nice. Price was right so I got two.  ;)  That&#x27;s all, Folks !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Arrived pretty quick.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Alfaparf products for quite some time but had never tried this specific product before. Completely satisfied with the results. My hair is curly and it gave it so much life and shine after I tried it.  Also works great controlling the frizz and smells amazing! I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Battles the frizzed and adds shine</li>
            <li> I like the product but the top came off after the first few times that I used it.</li>
            <li> This product not only makes my hair look shiny and healthy, it also smells amazing. Best of all, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought it because I&#x27;m literally in love with it! I bought it 3 days ago and I already received it!</li>
            <li> For me AlphaParf is the HG for everything related to hair care. Having said that, I went along and purchased its serum. Smells amazing, but there are better product of its kind in the market, like It&#x27;s a 10 serum.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect to use on your hair if it feels and looks a little dry.....brings out the shine like you cannot imagine...so glad I purchased it</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone but especially for those of us who frequently style our hair.  I use this every day on wet or dry hair.  The trick is to put about a dime size amount in your palms, rub your hands together and then gently apply it to the ends.  Great to help prevent and treat split ends.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I find it so helpful for my dry hair. I always keep a bottle at work in, in my handbag, and at home. It makes my hair so smooth and shiny without a greasy feeling. I Love the scent as well!</li>
            <li> To my hair there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair nice and shiny.  Doesn&#x27;t protect too much from the frizz though.</li>
            <li> I would pay twice the price this is amazing</li>
            <li> My hair dresser busted this amazing smelling serum out one day after pressing and styling my hair and I was on a serious hunt right after. It smells so wonderful and it helps to eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> Delicious soft smell the only complain is not about the product in self&lt;br /&gt;is when I get it half of the bottle are empty and spilled the product for all over&lt;br /&gt;the bag ,,, I think seller need to be more carefully when send the products and check&lt;br /&gt;are tightly closed</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have used after styling my hair. It leaves it soft, shiny and healthy. It also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great product for hair. Has a healing effect to dry hair without weighing down hair or leaving greasy residue. I use on wet or dry hair. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> my wife and my doughter always use this product. they say it feels great on their hair. the bottle is very nice</li>
            <li> I have very oil hair and this product after I flat iron does not get heavy or oily I love it</li>
            <li> I have very fine, long blonde hair and this product weighed it down. My hair became greasy really quickly. It did its job as far as being a heat protector, but not the great product it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible. Like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair serum with manly smell.&lt;br /&gt;My hairstylist recommended me this product.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing, after you wash your hair, dry it up and then apply it.&lt;br /&gt;you can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for the past 4 months and so far no adverse side effects.&lt;br /&gt;After reading thru internet, I came to know that this is advanced version of hairgel.&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating is good for this product and it is applicable to male and female.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Always trust alfaparf. The beauty salons in dominican republic gets the best in hair products and trust me this is one of the most expensive items they have at their salons. Best price, best product. I also use this with my shampoo and mask from alter ego (semi de lino) also italian products. I will definetly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair serum. Hair is shiny and smooth with just a few drops. Always get compliments when this product is used. A must buy!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it helps keep your hair safe when using a curling iron. Love it! :-) Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this product which sat in my drawer for a long time. I found it and tried it after using cheaper brands found in regular stores. Right away I could tell my hair loved it. Decided to purchase on Amazon. I have thick, wavy hair so I apply about 4 pumps into damp hair. After drying with a hair dryer, I usually add a few more pumps to smooth down extra frizz. My hair looks and feels really great. Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone! Not only does it have a nice scent, but it also helps those dry and split ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for many years. It was recommended to me by my hair stylist back home (in Europe.) I had no idea that I could buy it in the US. At some point my supply was exhausted. So I started trying out all kinds of similar products. Nothing worked as good as AlfaParf. I am extremely happy that I found it on amazon. It makes my hair extremely shiny and it&#x27;s as smooth as silk. I love its smell too! I straighten my hair with a GHD professional styler. It usually works great by itself, but the final look when using AlfaParf is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I like it, but tad over priced</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp;amp; as expected,they&#x27;re just what d doctor ordered!My wife love them so much,she&#x27;s using them as her sandwich spread too!lolThey are awesome!</li>
            <li> this makes hair feel and smell terriffic. It smells so good I wish they made a perfume of it. But I have curly hair and it for sure helps with the frizzes</li>
            <li> Smells good but have to be careful of what clients to use it on, smells very high</li>
            <li> Three girls in family cannot live without it&lt;br /&gt;Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> THE BEST FOR FRIZZY HAIR</li>
            <li> It works good, but I must have really dry hair because I use a lot more than some reviewers say they use! I add about 7  or 10 pumps to my elbow length hair before styling, and my hair just soaks it in. I am Caucasian with straight hair. The alfaparf makes it soft and shiny, but not oily at all. The smell is fresh and clean, like French milled soap, or clean laundry.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to get two for the price of one when I received my package. I keep one at work and one at home and get compliments on how great my hair looks and smells!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love the way it leaves my hair after styling. I use it to control dry ends and fly-aways after blow-dry by applying just a little on the ends. I have thick, fine hair and tends to get oily fast... this is the only product that does not weigh it down or makes it instantly oily. Hair is shiny and just smells so good! Will continue to use this product for as long as I continue to find it.</li>
