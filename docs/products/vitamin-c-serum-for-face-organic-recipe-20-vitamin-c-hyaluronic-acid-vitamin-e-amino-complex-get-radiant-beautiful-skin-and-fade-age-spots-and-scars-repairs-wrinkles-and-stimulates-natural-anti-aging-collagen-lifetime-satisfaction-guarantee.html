            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Hope to see more products in this line soon.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li>Some of them worked, some were OK and some did not do anything.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C serum is in my top list of skin care products.</li>
            <li>so glad I took the plunge.</li>
            <li>Love this serum.</li>
            <li>How can you be sure it is working like &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; say?  </li>
            <li>Many companies also add fragrance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many benefits to putting the cocktail of Vitamin C,  Hyaluronic  Acid and Vitamin E on your skin.</li>
            <li>so many companies-</li>
            <li>What I am excited about is that I have seen a nice reduction in the appearance of my fine lines!  </li>
            <li>Very rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>This product is very light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It feels natural and absorbs beautifully.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working pretty good.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is looking clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Well worth a purchase!!</li>
            <li>My skin looks so great, moisturized, soft with a lovely glow.</li>
            <li>Great product, I have very sensitive skin and do not like to put stuff on my face.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s to the pursuit beautiful, healthy, younger looking skin ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>For a more detailed review see here http://www.essentiallysavvy.com/product-reviews/</li>
            <li>but so far its great</li>
            <li>This has a great citrus smell and even though I have sensitive skin, this did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a nightly skincare routine that involves a gentle cleanser, twice weekly exfoliation, tonic, the Vitamin C Serum and a really good moisturizer</li>
            <li>this serum proves to be effective in this full sized bottle in reducing wrinkles, age spots, discoloration and more on the skin.</li>
            <li>A full pump can cover face neck hands &amp; elbows!.  </li>
            <li>it feels great when first applied, on clean skin of course, and it dries quickly so you can apply your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I  would highly recommend this serum, as a multipurpose addition to your skincare routine that is quick, easy, and most importantly, effective!</li>
            <li>It goes on the skin easily and feels invigorating.</li>
            <li>For the most part I like the product and think it will work great on skin with larger pore sizes.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easily addressed with lotion.</li>
            <li>The stinging sensation was very mild and did not cause pain.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to apply under makeup.  </li>
            <li>I feel overall that this product is very effective in creating a smoother, more even toned complexion.</li>
            <li>In just two weeks, my skin texture feels incredibly smooth and soft, my skin looks more even and bright</li>
            <li>Hi, I never generally write reviews, but I want to mention about this as I felt good products should never go out of market, so I thought a review might help both the company and the customer a chance to buy and sell these nice products.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product, it broke me out and it kind of stung with</li>
            <li>No bad overwhelming smell or stickiness.</li>
            <li>Also I would say some of the fine lines and wrinkles have smoothed out and my skin feels softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>After 5 weeks I noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing; it looks much smoother and is softer.</li>
            <li>It goes on a bit sticky but leaves your face feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li>this serum makes my face so smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li>I just pump the bottle once  onto my fingertip and smooth the serum onto my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Products goes on nice and dries fast</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C in this product neutralizes free radicals and reverses the damage they have caused to the skin and evens skin tone.  </li>
            <li>But the product itself is great and seems to make a difference in my overall complexion!</li>
            <li>I have noticed that you want to apply this evenly but lightly.</li>
            <li>Great product overall</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I cannot say that regarding this product.</li>
            <li>After using it I have noticed a smooth and radiant feel to my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is great and I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
            <li>it comes in a great looking package and was pleasantly surprised to find a link to a useful PDF inside the box.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I love afterwards how my skin just feels fresh and clean -</li>
            <li>I have used the serum exactly as prescribed in the morning and evening and have am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Will have to use a bit longer to report any significant changes.</li>
            <li>I am excited to continue to use this.  </li>
            <li>It is important for me to share the true experience with you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be aware of -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its because organic or because its not too strong, but my skin tolarates this product pretty well!</li>
            <li>It is applied to a clean face twice a day, morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>I used this product for a full 3 weeks before giving a review since I wanted to make sure that it really produces the result as advertised.</li>
            <li>The reason being, it might work great the first couple of days then tank out later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular with facial serums and this one is great -- organic, light, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The imbue naturals company was so sweet and sent me a email explaining there product</li>
            <li>and already my skin feels so much softer and more supple.</li>
            <li>So many products out there filling our skin with really toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>Improving don&#x27;t really see to many people so no one to notice.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and its fast results.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin has become brighter, with fine lines reducing and skin texture becoming incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have certain red spots (under my nose, cheeks, under my eyes, chin) that are greatly diminished when using this product.</li>
            <li>It distributes just the right amount of product for application (no waste &#x3D; better value!)  </li>
            <li>The serum has no parabens or alcohol and this seperates the serum from many others that tend to infuse more ingredients hoping for a bigger result.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly and is not sticky unlike some serums.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how or what it does, but results that quickly..</li>
            <li>Very happy with the results in such a short time!</li>
            <li>My skin is clear, smooth and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is filled with natural ingredients</li>
            <li>QUICKLY</li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>My sister commented yesterday that my skin looks better and she had no idea what I have been using, so that pretty much sums up</li>
            <li>Not greasy and gets absorbed quickly into skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite products!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend purchasing!!!</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about two weeks and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light, not oily and the skin absorbs the product super fast.  </li>
            <li>For a company with the Natural in the name, I would have expected a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and makes her skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Going on, the product feels light and and doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.</li>
            <li>Ok, no problem...let&#x27;s see if that is just the product in action.</li>
            <li>It is fun to watch it get soaked up by my skin.  </li>
            <li>#34;just took a run&amp;#34; look... fresh, well hydrated and well</li>
            <li>So far I love it.  </li>
            <li>Although I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to someone who needs help evening out their skin tone or tightening their pores.</li>
            <li>The over all feel of the skin is soft and it just looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>and it goes away within minutes once the serum is absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li>Much more potent than other serums.</li>
            <li>I have been applying a pea size amount of the Imbue Vitamin C Serum twice a day, once in the morning before I put on my moisturizer, and right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>The reason why I&#x27;m giving 3 stars is because of you don&#x27;t apply a moisturizer right after</li>
            <li>right away!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get yours today right here --&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love that this serum is a natural skincare product, with a 20% potency of Vitamin C to really help your skin glow!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin silky smooth and super soft w/</li>
            <li>Whereas, Imbue Naturals serum, quickly absorbs into your skin and your skin feels instantly smooth, soft and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The serum is gentle enough for twice a day use and so far, I am really happy to have had the opportunity to experience it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if you are interested in a Vitamin C serum, Imbue Naturals product is truly worth the time and cost.  </li>
            <li>Extra star for the ingredients though, which are mostly natural and good for your skin.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and it has helped tremendously with the intense itching.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is the primary water-soluble antioxidant in the body, disarming free radicals and preventing damage both inside and outside cells</li>
            <li>The fabulous addition of the Hylauronic Acid helps to enhance the skin&#x27;s natural moisture barrier, so skin is plumped up and smoothed out!</li>
            <li>I have learned to very VERY gently press on the pump to get the amount of product I need.</li>
            <li>Plus, the more a product of this nature is  exposed to Oxygen, it can actually lose effectiveness, so this was a genius addition!</li>
            <li>My face is really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>and I know exactly what I&#x27;m putting on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and soft after using it, it also keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s not greasy or oily at all, and it actually makes my makeup apply more evenly.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it a lot of product squirted out.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell results, but it seems to be a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Really keeps my skin tighter, and has lightened my age spots!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If your going to buy a serum for your face than you must try this one FIRST.</li>
            <li>an anti-aging is the only benefit you desire, there are others out there that are better but for a heftier price</li>
            <li>The company sent an email at shipment with directions and stated that this would occur for the first couple uses but it probably took two weeks for mine to stop.</li>
            <li>I only apply this product to my face at night and then put a night moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>(I am a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34;) I thought they would never go away.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to see how this continues to improve my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely stellar product.</li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first product I would like to review is Imbue Naturals vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>The way I used it was exactly as explained in the insert.</li>
            <li>I have been really interested in Vitamin C serums and have implemented it into my nightly beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>I did notice my skin seems brighter after using consistently.</li>
            <li>It is made of organic ingredients and has no useless or harmful fillers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, and I&#x27;m already in love with it.  </li>
            <li>20% Vitamin C  Serum contains only the best ingredients: Hyaluronic Acid, Amino Complex, VitaminC, and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>But I most likely wont use it again because my skin is very oily as it is and adding serum to my face doens&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>and I am not required to write a positive review.  </li>
            <li>Most of the other brands have a glass dropper vial top which makes it harder to use the right amount, as well as exposing the product to Oxygen, compromising some of the effectiveness!</li>
            <li>I did squeeze a bit too much our the first time I used the serum, so</li>
            <li>My face was dry before where now it&#x27;s super smooth.</li>
            <li>Imbue Naturals Vitamin C Serum also stimulates collagen production as well and regenerating skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using Imbue Naturals Vitamin C Serum for very long but have noticed that my skin looks more radiant and know that sometimes it takes weeks to see results, as they say on their site.  </li>
            <li>Smells like pure vitamin C powder.</li>
            <li>My large pores have drastically been reduced after a week.</li>
            <li>It shrinks fine lines and wrinkles and diminishes scars to make us look younger.</li>
            <li>Fine lines around my eyes and mouth, a couple deep lines in my forehead and what I call &amp;#34;dullness&amp;#34; in my skin tone are the trophies I carry from my adventure with chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li>The serum has a very light, natural fragrance out of the bottle and absolutely no scent once itâ€™s on the skin and is absorbed.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in my face after only using this product for a week.  </li>
            <li>I only press halfway and a huge amount of the serum squirts out.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this serum.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate that a lot.</li>
            <li>It came packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Imbue Naturals</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if its doing much.  </li>
            <li>really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>or you get too much of the serum.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much softer.</li>
            <li>Antioxidant Vitamin C protects skin from free radicals and is essential in collagen production.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency of this serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much smoother and even toned.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>This seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>I think that is how you know the product is really working.</li>
            <li>No oily or gritty feeling, goes on smooth with no residue.</li>
            <li>I applied 2 times a day after cleaning my face and used for 7 days straight before writing this review.</li>
            <li>This reassured me that the product was really working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a girly girl and don&#x27;t have a whole beauty routine FYI.</li>
            <li>I did not keep the Serum a secret, so now they are happy to use it too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Could see results pretty instantly which is always cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several skin care regimens but many don&#x27;t work with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have bought numerous amount of serums throughout the years, trying to brighten my skin and make it more toned and young looking.</li>
            <li>My mother in law ask to borrow it because she suffer from very dark circles and she is loving it because its working for her even making her skin more glowing because her dark circle are going away.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and leaves my skin moisturized and super soft - not at all sticky (like some other serums I have tried!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply it once in the morning and it pretty much keeps my face soft the whole day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its because of my particular skin type; i.e. very fair, dry with microscopic pores, but it seems that t has a hard time absorbing all of the ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li>It is a very smooth serum that soaks in very quickly.i have extremely sensitive skin and have had absolutely no problems with this at all</li>
            <li>vitamin C serum by Imbue Naturals is an exciting new line of natural recipe and with no scents or fillers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this product as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>First off I am 55 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>The serum is thick and really goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>I will report back and see if how it does in the sun as I get outside more.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen any positive changes, but I have also not seen any adverse effects...  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a high quality for what it is.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>It is very important to me to keep harsh ingredients out of my skin routine...</li>
            <li>Just WOW!!</li>
            <li>I also feel like my skin tone is more even and a little brighter since using this serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with trying as many different all natural and vitamin enriched beauty products as I can get my hands on, so I was excited to try this one at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that I was sent a full bottle and that the bottle was less than some other ones on the market but contained if not more vital ingredients.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum by Imbue Naturals goes on with a very silky feel and leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years but have had trouble finding something I can use with my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely well worth it.</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin (not oily skin)</li>
            <li>and I feel like I have a fresh faced look to present to the world each day.</li>
            <li>it normally retails for $49.95!&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li>in a few days I noticed that my skin became brighter and had more glow.</li>
            <li>live high in the mountains of Colorado</li>
            <li>This serum is full of hard working ingredients and when used together produce significant results.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks younger, has reduced fine lines and pore size, and overall</li>
            <li>I can really feel it tightening my skin very shortly after I put it on, so I really feel like it&#x27;s working and living up to its reputation.</li>
            <li>I am really conscious of the harsh and/or unnatural ingredients in so many skincare products on the marlket.  </li>
            <li>I have sunspots under my eyes, general redness, and large pores on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>but this time the serum was very old and almost coagulated.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>The fine lines on my fave are less visible.  </li>
            <li>I am noticing that dullness and fine lines are being less visible.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel slightly taught and velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly -never leaving my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>The Imbue Naturals VItamin C serum is by far the most natural serum i have come across on the market!&lt;br /&gt;No nasty additives, no toxic smells when you apply it to your skin and most importantly on your face!</li>
            <li>Since buying this Vitamin C Serum for Face I have been using it twice daily and have seen positive changes in the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li>You just have to give the top a half pump to get enough serum out.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for around one week and my skin is clear and feels tighter yet soft.</li>
            <li>But this was so gentle enough for me to apply to my face.</li>
            <li>It immediately soaks into my skin, and it makes my skin feel velvety soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>will see how it goes, but so far.. I am blown</li>
            <li>Vitamin C serum is a natural skin care ingredient.</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft</li>
            <li>but I did not notice any changes as far as lightening any discoloration.</li>
            <li>No irritation seen on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight too, so it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that I have annoyingly sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>I always wait a few minutes and than apply a light face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>One is almost completely gone</li>
            <li>I did not like the smell at all, but that is because this product is so natural that there is no added fragrance which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>By the 7th day I saw much reduction in red marks and sun spots on my face.</li>
            <li>I want my skin to be revived by natural ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this serum - have been using it for only a few weeks and my hyper-pigmentation spots are lightening</li>
            <li>healthy glowing skin is only a few clicks away.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and would like to point out that the first 3 - 4 days of using the serum morning and night really dried my skin out at first.</li>
            <li>I have had a hard time with breakouts in the past when using serums and I haven&#x27;t experienced that so far.</li>
            <li>The only reason I haven&#x27;t rated this product 5 stars is because I do not yet have a long term track record with it, however I expect I will continue to enjoy this product and add it to my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I also like that this serum has a pump on top of it that you simply press down to use just enough of the serum without wasting any!</li>
            <li>I expected a more natural smelling product, but had a slight chemical smell to it.  </li>
            <li>, I felt a slight stinging sensation that quickly went away.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend to include the Serum in your daily routine</li>
            <li>The serum dissolves into the skin quickly and has no oily or greasy residue or mess.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my pores were smaller and the the little fine line wrinkles were disappearing.</li>
            <li>However, I now only use it in the morning when I immediately follow application with my normal face</li>
            <li>I love their product and definitely works, though keep in mind with any product it needs to be used at least 2 months before you will notice an improvement, but age spots do lighten after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is very acidic and when you consider the bitter scent of this product, it leads me to believe the claims of its potency (20%) and natural ingredients are correct.  </li>
            <li>I had a little bit of acne and this stuff helped clear it up right away.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean and tight and makes my pores visibly smaller.</li>
            <li>I saw the difference in both clearing of marks and a major change in the feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is apparent that this company has taken the time to refine not only its product ingredients but also their professional image and it reflects in their classy, refined packaging.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that some of my fine line are fading slowly</li>
            <li>not all weighed down like you get with so many other facial products.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t make my other products absorb strangely or affect how they apply in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m outside in the sunshine nearly every day</li>
            <li>After several days of use my skin is soft and seems smoother.</li>
            <li>have been multiplying overnight, apparently.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical to buy this product.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars is there was some slight leakage out of the top, but overall didn&#x27;t effect the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;No scent, which is just what I was hoping for with a product that I put under my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbed very quickly into my skin without leaving any oily or weird residue.</li>
            <li>This has been gentle on my skin and caused none of the issues I typically see - perhaps because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I stopped using my previous brand for a few days before begin my trial with this brand in order to be able to fully evaluate its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this for a few weeks, my skin seems to drink it right in now.</li>
            <li>So little by little, I am becoming an expert on Vitamin C beauty products as I am reviewing yet another one.  </li>
            <li>the first few times I put this on</li>
            <li>the first few times I applied the product.</li>
            <li>It is not so much a serum as it is comes out as a slightly thinner liquid version of a serum.</li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin out, but you will definitely need a moisturizer to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too much can cause a sticky residue and if you want to wear this under makeup, it&#x27;ll just create a mess.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea that the ingredients are organic, and it is also sensitive enough for my daughter to use on her skin as she cannot use other products due to her sensitivity.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and a little goes</li>
            <li>Also the serum comes out of the pump very fast, so I usually get a little too much each time.  </li>
            <li>WON&#x27;T be disappointed with this amazing product!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Hope to see more products in this line soon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li> Some of them worked, some were OK and some did not do anything.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is in my top list of skin care products.</li>
            <li> so glad I took the plunge.</li>
            <li> Love this serum.</li>
            <li> How can you be sure it is working like &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; say?  </li>
            <li> Many companies also add fragrance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many benefits to putting the cocktail of Vitamin C,  Hyaluronic  Acid and Vitamin E on your skin.</li>
            <li> so many companies-</li>
            <li> What I am excited about is that I have seen a nice reduction in the appearance of my fine lines!  </li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> This product is very light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It feels natural and absorbs beautifully.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working pretty good.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is looking clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Well worth a purchase!!</li>
            <li> My skin looks so great, moisturized, soft with a lovely glow.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have very sensitive skin and do not like to put stuff on my face.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s to the pursuit beautiful, healthy, younger looking skin ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> For a more detailed review see here http://www.essentiallysavvy.com/product-reviews/</li>
            <li> but so far its great</li>
            <li> This has a great citrus smell and even though I have sensitive skin, this did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a nightly skincare routine that involves a gentle cleanser, twice weekly exfoliation, tonic, the Vitamin C Serum and a really good moisturizer</li>
            <li> this serum proves to be effective in this full sized bottle in reducing wrinkles, age spots, discoloration and more on the skin.</li>
            <li> A full pump can cover face neck hands &amp; elbows!.  </li>
            <li> it feels great when first applied, on clean skin of course, and it dries quickly so you can apply your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I  would highly recommend this serum, as a multipurpose addition to your skincare routine that is quick, easy, and most importantly, effective!</li>
            <li> It goes on the skin easily and feels invigorating.</li>
            <li> For the most part I like the product and think it will work great on skin with larger pore sizes.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easily addressed with lotion.</li>
            <li> The stinging sensation was very mild and did not cause pain.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to apply under makeup.  </li>
            <li> I feel overall that this product is very effective in creating a smoother, more even toned complexion.</li>
            <li> In just two weeks, my skin texture feels incredibly smooth and soft, my skin looks more even and bright</li>
            <li> Hi, I never generally write reviews, but I want to mention about this as I felt good products should never go out of market, so I thought a review might help both the company and the customer a chance to buy and sell these nice products.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, it broke me out and it kind of stung with</li>
            <li> No bad overwhelming smell or stickiness.</li>
            <li> Also I would say some of the fine lines and wrinkles have smoothed out and my skin feels softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks I noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing; it looks much smoother and is softer.</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit sticky but leaves your face feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li> I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li> this serum makes my face so smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li> I just pump the bottle once  onto my fingertip and smooth the serum onto my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Products goes on nice and dries fast</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C in this product neutralizes free radicals and reverses the damage they have caused to the skin and evens skin tone.  </li>
            <li> But the product itself is great and seems to make a difference in my overall complexion!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that you want to apply this evenly but lightly.</li>
            <li> Great product overall</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I cannot say that regarding this product.</li>
            <li> After using it I have noticed a smooth and radiant feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great and I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
            <li> it comes in a great looking package and was pleasantly surprised to find a link to a useful PDF inside the box.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I love afterwards how my skin just feels fresh and clean -</li>
            <li> I have used the serum exactly as prescribed in the morning and evening and have am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Will have to use a bit longer to report any significant changes.</li>
            <li> I am excited to continue to use this.  </li>
            <li> It is important for me to share the true experience with you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be aware of -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its because organic or because its not too strong, but my skin tolarates this product pretty well!</li>
            <li> It is applied to a clean face twice a day, morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> I used this product for a full 3 weeks before giving a review since I wanted to make sure that it really produces the result as advertised.</li>
            <li> The reason being, it might work great the first couple of days then tank out later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular with facial serums and this one is great -- organic, light, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The imbue naturals company was so sweet and sent me a email explaining there product</li>
            <li> and already my skin feels so much softer and more supple.</li>
            <li> So many products out there filling our skin with really toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Improving don&#x27;t really see to many people so no one to notice.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and its fast results.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin has become brighter, with fine lines reducing and skin texture becoming incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have certain red spots (under my nose, cheeks, under my eyes, chin) that are greatly diminished when using this product.</li>
            <li> It distributes just the right amount of product for application (no waste &#x3D; better value!)  </li>
            <li> The serum has no parabens or alcohol and this seperates the serum from many others that tend to infuse more ingredients hoping for a bigger result.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs quickly and is not sticky unlike some serums.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how or what it does, but results that quickly..</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results in such a short time!</li>
            <li> My skin is clear, smooth and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is filled with natural ingredients</li>
            <li> QUICKLY</li>
            <li> Dries quickly</li>
            <li> My sister commented yesterday that my skin looks better and she had no idea what I have been using, so that pretty much sums up</li>
            <li> Not greasy and gets absorbed quickly into skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite products!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend purchasing!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about two weeks and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light, not oily and the skin absorbs the product super fast.  </li>
            <li> For a company with the Natural in the name, I would have expected a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and makes her skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Going on, the product feels light and and doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.</li>
            <li> Ok, no problem...let&#x27;s see if that is just the product in action.</li>
            <li> It is fun to watch it get soaked up by my skin.  </li>
            <li> #34;just took a run&amp;#34; look... fresh, well hydrated and well</li>
            <li> So far I love it.  </li>
            <li> Although I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to someone who needs help evening out their skin tone or tightening their pores.</li>
            <li> The over all feel of the skin is soft and it just looks so much better.  </li>
            <li> and it goes away within minutes once the serum is absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li> Much more potent than other serums.</li>
            <li> I have been applying a pea size amount of the Imbue Vitamin C Serum twice a day, once in the morning before I put on my moisturizer, and right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> The reason why I&#x27;m giving 3 stars is because of you don&#x27;t apply a moisturizer right after</li>
            <li> right away!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get yours today right here --&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love that this serum is a natural skincare product, with a 20% potency of Vitamin C to really help your skin glow!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin silky smooth and super soft w/</li>
            <li> Whereas, Imbue Naturals serum, quickly absorbs into your skin and your skin feels instantly smooth, soft and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The serum is gentle enough for twice a day use and so far, I am really happy to have had the opportunity to experience it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if you are interested in a Vitamin C serum, Imbue Naturals product is truly worth the time and cost.  </li>
            <li> Extra star for the ingredients though, which are mostly natural and good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it has helped tremendously with the intense itching.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is the primary water-soluble antioxidant in the body, disarming free radicals and preventing damage both inside and outside cells</li>
            <li> The fabulous addition of the Hylauronic Acid helps to enhance the skin&#x27;s natural moisture barrier, so skin is plumped up and smoothed out!</li>
            <li> I have learned to very VERY gently press on the pump to get the amount of product I need.</li>
            <li> Plus, the more a product of this nature is  exposed to Oxygen, it can actually lose effectiveness, so this was a genius addition!</li>
            <li> My face is really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> and I know exactly what I&#x27;m putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth and soft after using it, it also keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s not greasy or oily at all, and it actually makes my makeup apply more evenly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it a lot of product squirted out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell results, but it seems to be a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really keeps my skin tighter, and has lightened my age spots!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> If your going to buy a serum for your face than you must try this one FIRST.</li>
            <li> an anti-aging is the only benefit you desire, there are others out there that are better but for a heftier price</li>
            <li> The company sent an email at shipment with directions and stated that this would occur for the first couple uses but it probably took two weeks for mine to stop.</li>
            <li> I only apply this product to my face at night and then put a night moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> (I am a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34;) I thought they would never go away.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to see how this continues to improve my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely stellar product.</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first product I would like to review is Imbue Naturals vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> The way I used it was exactly as explained in the insert.</li>
            <li> I have been really interested in Vitamin C serums and have implemented it into my nightly beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin seems brighter after using consistently.</li>
            <li> It is made of organic ingredients and has no useless or harmful fillers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, and I&#x27;m already in love with it.  </li>
            <li> 20% Vitamin C  Serum contains only the best ingredients: Hyaluronic Acid, Amino Complex, VitaminC, and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> But I most likely wont use it again because my skin is very oily as it is and adding serum to my face doens&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> and I am not required to write a positive review.  </li>
            <li> Most of the other brands have a glass dropper vial top which makes it harder to use the right amount, as well as exposing the product to Oxygen, compromising some of the effectiveness!</li>
            <li> I did squeeze a bit too much our the first time I used the serum, so</li>
            <li> My face was dry before where now it&#x27;s super smooth.</li>
            <li> Imbue Naturals Vitamin C Serum also stimulates collagen production as well and regenerating skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using Imbue Naturals Vitamin C Serum for very long but have noticed that my skin looks more radiant and know that sometimes it takes weeks to see results, as they say on their site.  </li>
            <li> Smells like pure vitamin C powder.</li>
            <li> My large pores have drastically been reduced after a week.</li>
            <li> It shrinks fine lines and wrinkles and diminishes scars to make us look younger.</li>
            <li> Fine lines around my eyes and mouth, a couple deep lines in my forehead and what I call &amp;#34;dullness&amp;#34; in my skin tone are the trophies I carry from my adventure with chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li> The serum has a very light, natural fragrance out of the bottle and absolutely no scent once itâ€™s on the skin and is absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in my face after only using this product for a week.  </li>
            <li> I only press halfway and a huge amount of the serum squirts out.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this serum.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate that a lot.</li>
            <li> It came packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Imbue Naturals</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if its doing much.  </li>
            <li> really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> or you get too much of the serum.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much softer.</li>
            <li> Antioxidant Vitamin C protects skin from free radicals and is essential in collagen production.</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency of this serum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much smoother and even toned.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> This seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> I think that is how you know the product is really working.</li>
            <li> No oily or gritty feeling, goes on smooth with no residue.</li>
            <li> I applied 2 times a day after cleaning my face and used for 7 days straight before writing this review.</li>
            <li> This reassured me that the product was really working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a girly girl and don&#x27;t have a whole beauty routine FYI.</li>
            <li> I did not keep the Serum a secret, so now they are happy to use it too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Could see results pretty instantly which is always cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several skin care regimens but many don&#x27;t work with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous amount of serums throughout the years, trying to brighten my skin and make it more toned and young looking.</li>
            <li> My mother in law ask to borrow it because she suffer from very dark circles and she is loving it because its working for her even making her skin more glowing because her dark circle are going away.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and leaves my skin moisturized and super soft - not at all sticky (like some other serums I have tried!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply it once in the morning and it pretty much keeps my face soft the whole day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its because of my particular skin type; i.e. very fair, dry with microscopic pores, but it seems that t has a hard time absorbing all of the ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li> It is a very smooth serum that soaks in very quickly.i have extremely sensitive skin and have had absolutely no problems with this at all</li>
            <li> vitamin C serum by Imbue Naturals is an exciting new line of natural recipe and with no scents or fillers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this product as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li> First off I am 55 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> The serum is thick and really goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> I will report back and see if how it does in the sun as I get outside more.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any positive changes, but I have also not seen any adverse effects...  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a high quality for what it is.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> It is very important to me to keep harsh ingredients out of my skin routine...</li>
            <li> Just WOW!!</li>
            <li> I also feel like my skin tone is more even and a little brighter since using this serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with trying as many different all natural and vitamin enriched beauty products as I can get my hands on, so I was excited to try this one at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that I was sent a full bottle and that the bottle was less than some other ones on the market but contained if not more vital ingredients.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum by Imbue Naturals goes on with a very silky feel and leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years but have had trouble finding something I can use with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely well worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have normal skin (not oily skin)</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have a fresh faced look to present to the world each day.</li>
            <li> it normally retails for $49.95!&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li> in a few days I noticed that my skin became brighter and had more glow.</li>
            <li> live high in the mountains of Colorado</li>
            <li> This serum is full of hard working ingredients and when used together produce significant results.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks younger, has reduced fine lines and pore size, and overall</li>
            <li> I can really feel it tightening my skin very shortly after I put it on, so I really feel like it&#x27;s working and living up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> I am really conscious of the harsh and/or unnatural ingredients in so many skincare products on the marlket.  </li>
            <li> I have sunspots under my eyes, general redness, and large pores on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> but this time the serum was very old and almost coagulated.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> The fine lines on my fave are less visible.  </li>
            <li> I am noticing that dullness and fine lines are being less visible.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel slightly taught and velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly -never leaving my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> The Imbue Naturals VItamin C serum is by far the most natural serum i have come across on the market!&lt;br /&gt;No nasty additives, no toxic smells when you apply it to your skin and most importantly on your face!</li>
            <li> Since buying this Vitamin C Serum for Face I have been using it twice daily and have seen positive changes in the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> You just have to give the top a half pump to get enough serum out.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for around one week and my skin is clear and feels tighter yet soft.</li>
            <li> But this was so gentle enough for me to apply to my face.</li>
            <li> It immediately soaks into my skin, and it makes my skin feel velvety soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> will see how it goes, but so far.. I am blown</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is a natural skin care ingredient.</li>
            <li> It made my skin soft</li>
            <li> but I did not notice any changes as far as lightening any discoloration.</li>
            <li> No irritation seen on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight too, so it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I have annoyingly sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> I always wait a few minutes and than apply a light face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> One is almost completely gone</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell at all, but that is because this product is so natural that there is no added fragrance which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> By the 7th day I saw much reduction in red marks and sun spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I want my skin to be revived by natural ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this serum - have been using it for only a few weeks and my hyper-pigmentation spots are lightening</li>
            <li> healthy glowing skin is only a few clicks away.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and would like to point out that the first 3 - 4 days of using the serum morning and night really dried my skin out at first.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time with breakouts in the past when using serums and I haven&#x27;t experienced that so far.</li>
            <li> The only reason I haven&#x27;t rated this product 5 stars is because I do not yet have a long term track record with it, however I expect I will continue to enjoy this product and add it to my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I also like that this serum has a pump on top of it that you simply press down to use just enough of the serum without wasting any!</li>
            <li> I expected a more natural smelling product, but had a slight chemical smell to it.  </li>
            <li> , I felt a slight stinging sensation that quickly went away.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend to include the Serum in your daily routine</li>
            <li> The serum dissolves into the skin quickly and has no oily or greasy residue or mess.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my pores were smaller and the the little fine line wrinkles were disappearing.</li>
            <li> However, I now only use it in the morning when I immediately follow application with my normal face</li>
            <li> I love their product and definitely works, though keep in mind with any product it needs to be used at least 2 months before you will notice an improvement, but age spots do lighten after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is very acidic and when you consider the bitter scent of this product, it leads me to believe the claims of its potency (20%) and natural ingredients are correct.  </li>
            <li> I had a little bit of acne and this stuff helped clear it up right away.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean and tight and makes my pores visibly smaller.</li>
            <li> I saw the difference in both clearing of marks and a major change in the feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is apparent that this company has taken the time to refine not only its product ingredients but also their professional image and it reflects in their classy, refined packaging.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that some of my fine line are fading slowly</li>
            <li> not all weighed down like you get with so many other facial products.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t make my other products absorb strangely or affect how they apply in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m outside in the sunshine nearly every day</li>
            <li> After several days of use my skin is soft and seems smoother.</li>
            <li> have been multiplying overnight, apparently.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical to buy this product.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars is there was some slight leakage out of the top, but overall didn&#x27;t effect the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;No scent, which is just what I was hoping for with a product that I put under my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbed very quickly into my skin without leaving any oily or weird residue.</li>
            <li> This has been gentle on my skin and caused none of the issues I typically see - perhaps because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I stopped using my previous brand for a few days before begin my trial with this brand in order to be able to fully evaluate its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks, my skin seems to drink it right in now.</li>
            <li> So little by little, I am becoming an expert on Vitamin C beauty products as I am reviewing yet another one.  </li>
            <li> the first few times I put this on</li>
            <li> the first few times I applied the product.</li>
            <li> It is not so much a serum as it is comes out as a slightly thinner liquid version of a serum.</li>
            <li> It does not dry your skin out, but you will definitely need a moisturizer to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too much can cause a sticky residue and if you want to wear this under makeup, it&#x27;ll just create a mess.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea that the ingredients are organic, and it is also sensitive enough for my daughter to use on her skin as she cannot use other products due to her sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and a little goes</li>
            <li> Also the serum comes out of the pump very fast, so I usually get a little too much each time.  </li>
            <li> WON&#x27;T be disappointed with this amazing product!</li>
            <li> A half to a full pump will cover your face and within a few uses you will see the big difference.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and with other serums, i have been hesitant to use it on my face due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I received was almost half empty and unsealed.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C is just the right consistency - not too runny and not too thick.  </li>
            <li> I learn to only apply a pea size amount (a little really does go a long way) of the Imbue Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for two weeks, and normally wait to review any skin products for a few months, but I immediately saw results with this product.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to wait a few weeks before posting reviews to a particular product.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to look pretty dull and I&#x27;ve been reading up on the benefits of vitamin c serum</li>
            <li> When I applied it the first few times there was a slight stinging sensation but that subsided once I started using it regularly.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times so far but have had no reactions to it</li>
            <li> I have used Vit C products in the past but the combination of Vit C, Hyaluronic Acid, Vit E, and the amino complex made me curious if this would be even better for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My redness has definitely decreased but it does come right back if I discontinue use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because i have sensitive skin and figured this wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with dullness and discoloration for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> It got firm a lot and the pore size are reduced very well, along with a slight glow.</li>
            <li> A must try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed  and will love it!</li>
            <li> I also use this serum on a nasty scar i have on the back of my leg, and after using this serum daily for about a month now, my scar has remarkable faded already!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but I feel I may need a little extra help possible Vitamin.</li>
            <li> but it will definitely help with other issues.</li>
            <li> What makes one different than the other?</li>
            <li> Just showering causes my skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to help with severe dry skin alone, this won&#x27;t be your cure</li>
            <li> I always post my honest thoughts, opinions and experiences (good, bad and ugly!)</li>
            <li> My rough dry skin is improving day by day.</li>
            <li> I have red spots and a little acne</li>
            <li> the pump is a little tricky to use initially.  </li>
            <li> little background - I am in my mid forties</li>
            <li> , the redness in my cheeks and nose have calmed down (didnâ€™t expect this to happen â€“ BONUS!), the sunspots have been visibly dulled, and my pores look tiny!   </li>
            <li> Also the smell is a little weird (not bad, but not good) and the pump on the bottle releases too much.</li>
            <li> Formulated with a proprietary vitamin C complex to support natural collagen.</li>
            <li> shelf life is around two years and this product is offered at an empty bottle guarantee.</li>
            <li> The company stands behind the product that much.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days, but already noticing a difference in the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t which probably explains its bitter scent.  </li>
            <li> Left my usually combination skin (oily parts with dry patches)</li>
            <li> the pump is a little aggressive, a little bit goes a very long way, I only use one pump.</li>
            <li> My only complants is the pump bottle itself , it is a little tricky to push the  pump down with out squirting it in the floor.</li>
            <li> Have used it for over a month and can tell my skin is looking brighter and a few dark spots have actually began to fade!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way...</li>
            <li> Other moisturizers cause my skin to breakout or are too drying.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has tried other products but are discouraged because of ineffectiveness.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have noticed a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> FYI be careful with the pump, it tends to squirt out a lot of product!</li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t like other products on the market that leave an oily residue after you apply it and take hours to soak into your skin.</li>
            <li> The item was packaged so that the small amount that leaked into the cover did not make it further than that cap.  </li>
            <li> It works well under moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t counteract with some other stuffs I put on my face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Other products similar to this that I have used in the past have caused me to breakout and that is not the case with Imbue Naturals.</li>
            <li> I have been using Imbue Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum for the past several weeks and have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> The serum leaves my skin a little dry</li>
            <li> I returned it and received another bottle which was also half empty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other vitamin c serums since purchasing from Imbue Naturals, but I prefer their formula because it&#x27;s a bit thicker than other brands.</li>
            <li> The bottle of serum is contained in a dark brown glass bottle wuth a plastic pump distribution system.  </li>
            <li> Sun sensitivity with this serum is minimal and I do use a moisturizer with 35 SPF everyday.</li>
            <li> an active blogger I received this product for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> I use concealer on my these dark sun spots I have on my cheeks, but I&#x27;m finding I am having to use it less and less.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Did slightly improve wrinkles and age spots</li>
            <li> results were as follows; I experience slight stinging of the skin</li>
            <li> Just a half a pump will do.  </li>
            <li> and it really sucks the moisture out and leaves you looking dry and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It helps diminish dark spots and hyperpigmentation, evening out the skin tone and helping restore radiance where dullness may have once been!</li>
            <li> then my face gets a little itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using two little pumps of it every morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little tingle to my skin as I apply the Serum.  </li>
            <li> You have to be really careful not to press too hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have natural and organic ingredients that smell a little bitter than artificial fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, I ordered a few for myself as well.</li>
            <li> have uneven skin tone and this serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited to write my review until I had a chance to use it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste it.  </li>
            <li> I use Vitamin C on my face every day this organic recipe doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and is helping firm and lighten my skin..great product..</li>
            <li> After a few applications I def see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks</li>
            <li> A lot of the product was wasted for the price because of that.</li>
            <li> Tightens the skin and is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops are needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I see results already from just a few days of use..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I was provided this product by Imbue Naturals and their PR firm for the express purpose of testing and reviewing the product.</li>
            <li> Just small amount on my face did gave a difference after using for few days.</li>
            <li> The Amino Acids Complex in this serum simulates the skin to produce collagen which slows down as we age.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a little difficult is the way the product comes out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> and now it was sore and raw because I had taken off a layer of skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has even softened my skin on my arms from my excessive scratching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I see any difference in my skin yet...</li>
            <li> I had lots of air in my bottle and even a small pump would produce gobs.</li>
            <li> I have become addicted to vitamin c serums in the past few months.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have a hard time using anything with Vitmain C.</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dull or ashy.  </li>
            <li> I use Vitamin C at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> 20% Vitamin C Serum contains Hyaluronic Acid, Amino Complex, Vitamin C, and Vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> I can see my very small wrinkle lines are almost disappearing.</li>
            <li> sorta exploded on me when I opened the bottle to smell it, but if that&#x27;s the only bad thing..</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product made me breakout with small whiteheads, meaning it was clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick but moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I also noticed with continuous use that my sunspots have visibly decreased.</li>
            <li> I think it dryed my face out worse than it already was.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any dryness or flaking from the serum.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I suffer from enlarged pores and severe dryness which causes redness.</li>
            <li> I thought something was wrong because I could immediately feel my face tightening up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a faint odor to the serum that I do not like, but it is very faint</li>
            <li> I hate having my skin feel oily/greasy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a enthusiast of all kinds of skincare and of beauty products, and I have tried several Vitamin C serums. I really love that this serum is a natural skincare product, with a 20% potency of Vitamin C to really help your skin glow! It helps diminish dark spots and hyperpigmentation, evening out the skin tone and helping restore radiance where dullness may have once been! The fabulous addition of the Hylauronic Acid helps to enhance the skin&#x27;s natural moisture barrier, so skin is plumped up and smoothed out! Who doesn&#x27;t want to fight wrinkles?!  The fact that there doesn&#x27;t  seem  to  be  a  scent added is also very appealing to me! I also like that this serum has a pump on top of it that you simply press down to use just enough of the serum without wasting any! Plus, the more a product of this nature is  exposed to Oxygen, it can actually lose effectiveness, so this was a genius addition! Most of the other brands have a glass dropper vial top which makes it harder to use the right amount, as well as exposing the product to Oxygen, compromising some of the effectiveness! I  love that the serum is made in the USA, coming with a lifetime guarantee.. it shows you that this is a company that stands by their products! I  would highly recommend this serum, as a multipurpose addition to your skincare routine that is quick, easy, and most importantly, effective! A must try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed  and will love it!</li>
            <li> Hoping for good results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product all week and am loving it. I can feel my skin tightening as soon as I apply the serum. I apply it as directed, and have been using a very good moisturizer on top of it. The results are lasting all day. Kudos to the inventor of this - it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product, pure ingredients, great results! I would recommend it to all the women in my life, both family and friends!</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Have tried many vitamin C product but the one from Imbue Naturals is the best.  Never will be without it.  My face already looks younger after using only a month.  You will love this serum.  Wonderful and really works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and mother for Christmas. They are extremely happy with the product and the results have shown! it comes in a great looking package and was pleasantly surprised to find a link to a useful PDF inside the box. It goes on the skin easily and feels invigorating. A must have for any man or women. Not going to lie, I ordered a few for myself as well.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has reduced lines on my face!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about a week now. My face is really soft and smooth. My face was dry before where now it&#x27;s super smooth.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this serum. I have tried many products over the years but have had trouble finding something I can use with my oily skin. Other moisturizers cause my skin to breakout or are too drying. Not this serum.&lt;br /&gt;I have uneven skin tone and this serum helps my skin look even and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again!!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I have been using it for around one week and my skin is clear and feels tighter yet soft. I have used the serum exactly as prescribed in the morning and evening and have am completely satisfied. I would recommend this to anyone who has tried other products but are discouraged because of ineffectiveness. It is important to use a good moisturizer immediately after using the Serum for best results.</li>
            <li> Have used it for over a month and can tell my skin is looking brighter and a few dark spots have actually began to fade!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I can already see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m very particular with facial serums and this one is great -- organic, light, absorbs quickly. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product made me breakout with small whiteheads, meaning it was clogging my pores. Extra star for the ingredients though, which are mostly natural and good for your skin. It just didn&#x27;t work for my skin specifically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited to write my review until I had a chance to use it for a few weeks. I am LOVING the way my skin feels! It has almost overnight made my skin texture feel like I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s again. I can see my very small wrinkle lines are almost disappearing. This is def an awesome vit c serum. Give it a try like I did, you won&#x27;t be Dissapointed!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> Great product, I have very sensitive skin and do not like to put stuff on my face. But this was so gentle enough for me to apply to my face. Smoothed out my skin, helped with my dryness. None greasy feeling or rubbing off on to my cloths, which is also a big for me. Helped my skin look so healthy and bright. Loved this.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in my face after only using this product for a week.  WOW!  I even let my sister try it and she loves it too.  I love that it&#x27;s organic and I know exactly what I&#x27;m putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars is there was some slight leakage out of the top, but overall didn&#x27;t effect the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;No scent, which is just what I was hoping for with a product that I put under my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbed very quickly into my skin without leaving any oily or weird residue.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C serum for face! It is light and absorb fast. My skin looks smooth and soft after using it, it also keeps my skin hydrated. Love it. Will recommend to friend and family.</li>
            <li> I am not one to write reviews, but for this product, I had to. I have used Vit C products in the past but the combination of Vit C, Hyaluronic Acid, Vit E, and the amino complex made me curious if this would be even better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;So the first few times I put this on, I felt a slight stinging sensation that quickly went away. Ok, no problem...let&#x27;s see if that is just the product in action. After a week, I am glad I didn&#x27;t let that sensation deter me from this product. My skin looks amazing; it looks much smoother and is softer. I love that I can now just throw on a bit of blush and some mascara and walk out the door. If you are looking for a great product that delivers results, don&#x27;t pass this up.</li>
            <li> First, this stuff smells SO good! It goes on a bit sticky but leaves your face feeling so smooth. It takes about one pump to cover your entire face and neck. It is not so much a serum as it is comes out as a slightly thinner liquid version of a serum. It smells so good, did I say that? You can feel your skin tightening as it dries, which takes about a minute or two. It does not dry your skin out, but you will definitely need a moisturizer to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about two days I noticed that my pores appeared smaller. I had a little bit of acne and this stuff helped clear it up right away. I have a lot of sun spots and they are fading as well. My face feels more tone and it appears more even in color. I have certain red spots (under my nose, cheeks, under my eyes, chin) that are greatly diminished when using this product. My skin feels firmer and it looks better. I am very happy with this product and am going to keep using itâ€”I even bought some for my mom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itâ€™s not a miracle in a bottle, but itâ€™s definitely something you can add to your beauty routine to get your face feeling a lot nicer.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I received was almost half empty and unsealed. I returned it and received another bottle which was also half empty but this time the serum was very old and almost coagulated.</li>
            <li> I love their product and definitely works, though keep in mind with any product it needs to be used at least 2 months before you will notice an improvement, but age spots do lighten after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin C serum by Imbue Naturals is an exciting new line of natural recipe and with no scents or fillers this serum proves to be effective in this full sized bottle in reducing wrinkles, age spots, discoloration and more on the skin. I was impressed that I was sent a full bottle and that the bottle was less than some other ones on the market but contained if not more vital ingredients. The serum dissolves into the skin quickly and has no oily or greasy residue or mess. After application, it leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelf life is around two years and this product is offered at an empty bottle guarantee. If you do not like it, simply return and you will be refunded! The company stands behind the product that much. The serum has no parabens or alcohol and this seperates the serum from many others that tend to infuse more ingredients hoping for a bigger result. A half to a full pump will cover your face and within a few uses you will see the big difference. I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is made from FDA facilities and is NON-GMO and 72% Organic. Made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because i have sensitive skin and figured this wouldn&#x27;t work. I was able to test this product and i am so glad that i did. My face feels tighter and smoother as well. I have only used this a few times so far but have had no reactions to it and my skin seems to absorb it immediately.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for two weeks, and normally wait to review any skin products for a few months, but I immediately saw results with this product. I have sunspots under my eyes, general redness, and large pores on my cheeks. In just two weeks, my skin texture feels incredibly smooth and soft, my skin looks more even and bright, the redness in my cheeks and nose have calmed down (didnâ€™t expect this to happen â€“ BONUS!), the sunspots have been visibly dulled, and my pores look tiny!   I have been applying a pea size amount of the Imbue Vitamin C Serum twice a day, once in the morning before I put on my moisturizer, and right before I go to bed. It immediately soaks into my skin, and it makes my skin feel velvety soft. Itâ€™s not greasy or oily at all, and it actually makes my makeup apply more evenly. The only thing that is a little difficult is the way the product comes out of the bottle. The first time I used it a lot of product squirted out. I have learned to very VERY gently press on the pump to get the amount of product I need.</li>
            <li> I love the vitamin c serum and it has been working great for me. The imbue naturals company was so sweet and sent me a email explaining there product and I really appreciate that a lot. I have been using it for the last 4 days and it is doing wonders for my skin. It came packaged very well. Thanks Imbue Naturals</li>
            <li> I used this product for a full 3 weeks before giving a review since I wanted to make sure that it really produces the result as advertised. The serum has a very light, natural fragrance out of the bottle and absolutely no scent once itâ€™s on the skin and is absorbed. It also absorbs quickly and is not sticky unlike some serums. I have been applying a pea size twice daily, once in the morning before my moisturizer and once before bedtime. I have noticed that my skin has become brighter, with fine lines reducing and skin texture becoming incredibly smooth and soft. I also noticed with continuous use that my sunspots have visibly decreased. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful pure serum.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I have sensitive skin and this serum makes my face so smooth without irritation. I use it in the morning and before I go to bed. I do use a moisturizer afterwards, which is what they recommend. I am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell results, but it seems to be a great moisturizer. I don&#x27;t know if its because of my particular skin type; i.e. very fair, dry with microscopic pores, but it seems that t has a hard time absorbing all of the ingredients in the product. For the most part I like the product and think it will work great on skin with larger pore sizes.  After using this for a few weeks, my skin seems to drink it right in now. This is a wonderful product and I am thoroughly pleased.  Of all the Vitamin C Serums on the market, this is most assuredly top on my list, regardless of the price. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product as long as it is available.  GREAT STUFF!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I don&#x27;t know if its doing much.  I bought it to get rid of the brown spots on my face, but they don&#x27;t seam to be fading.  It does appear that my skin is a bit puffier and firmer.  Smells like pure vitamin C powder.</li>
            <li> Imbue Naturals 20% Vitamin C  Serum contains only the best ingredients: Hyaluronic Acid, Amino Complex, VitaminC, and Vitamin E. This formula of ingredients works to reduce sun damage, wrinkles, scars, and pore size while increasing collagen production -- simply put, it makes your skin look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Serum both morning and night after washing my face. I just pump the bottle once  onto my fingertip and smooth the serum onto my face and neck.  A little bit goes a long way... I only need one pump. The serum is thick and really goes on nicely. It is absorbed quickly and leaves my skin moisturized and super soft - not at all sticky (like some other serums I have tried!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Love this product and now part of my beauty supplies. Just small amount on my face did gave a difference after using for few days. Never sleep again without putting Vitamin C serum  on my face for a healthy and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It makes my skin silky smooth and super soft w/just a tiny peasized application. I put it on after my daily moisturizer during the day. I apply it once in the morning and it pretty much keeps my face soft the whole day. I have also used the product on my arms. I have eczema and it has helped tremendously with the intense itching. It has even softened my skin on my arms from my excessive scratching.</li>
            <li> I have become addicted to vitamin c serums in the past few months. It has helped with sunburn,my wrinkles on my face and let&#x27;s not forget how wonderful it smells!!! It is a very smooth serum that soaks in very quickly.i have extremely sensitive skin and have had absolutely no problems with this at all</li>
            <li> Great quality for a good price</li>
            <li> I had never used a vitamin C serum before but after using this I can&#x27;t imagine not ever having it in my skin routine!  After 5 weeks I noticed a huge difference in my skin.  My face was brighter, including my underage area!  When I applied it the first few times there was a slight stinging sensation but that subsided once I started using it regularly.  This serum has made my forehead lines a lot smoother-almost making them disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product.  Sometimes it takes people 2-3 weeks to notice a difference and sometimes it takes 5-6 so don&#x27;t be discouraged! :)</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have a hard time using anything with Vitmain C. I don&#x27;t know if its because organic or because its not too strong, but my skin tolarates this product pretty well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s day 4 of me using this product and I&#x27;ve already started seeing results. My skin feels smoother and my spots aren&#x27;t as noticeable. The reason why I&#x27;m giving 3 stars is because of you don&#x27;t apply a moisturizer right after then my face gets a little itchy. Also the smell is a little weird (not bad, but not good) and the pump on the bottle releases too much. I only press halfway and a huge amount of the serum squirts out. You have to be really careful not to press too hard or you get too much of the serum. Other than that, I have noticed a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> I have received this product at a reduced rate to write an honest review. I have received no instructions and the opinions expressed are my own. I learn to only apply a pea size amount (a little really does go a long way) of the Imbue Vitamin C Serum. I apply it twice a day, once in the morning before I put on my moisturizer, and again just before I go to bed. It soaked into my skin immediately. It makes my skin feel slightly taught and velvety smooth. Itâ€™s not greasy or oily. I find that a plus. I hate having my skin feel oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> just Love the product! Really keeps my skin tighter, and has lightened my age spots!  Just fablous@</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 1/2 weeks. So far I haven&#x27;t seen any positive changes, but I have also not seen any adverse effects...  FYI be careful with the pump, it tends to squirt out a lot of product!</li>
            <li> One of the best Vitamin C serums that I have purchased!</li>
            <li> Products goes on nice and dries fast I&#x27;m not sure if I see any difference in my skin yet...but I&#x27;m super happy this serum is not causing any breakouts or clogging my pores</li>
            <li> The Imbue Naturals VItamin C serum is by far the most natural serum i have come across on the market!&lt;br /&gt;No nasty additives, no toxic smells when you apply it to your skin and most importantly on your face! I have very sensitive skin and with other serums, i have been hesitant to use it on my face due to my sensitive skin. But with Imbue Naturals Vitamin C serum, i do not have to worry at all about putting it all over my face! It feels natural and absorbs beautifully. I also use this serum on a nasty scar i have on the back of my leg, and after using this serum daily for about a month now, my scar has remarkable faded already!&lt;br /&gt;Also, i don&#x27;t like other products on the market that leave an oily residue after you apply it and take hours to soak into your skin. Whereas, Imbue Naturals serum, quickly absorbs into your skin and your skin feels instantly smooth, soft and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;You WON&#x27;T be disappointed with this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Great buy.Works well around the eyes.I look younger already. My lines around my eyes have diminished.My skin feels much softer. I would recommend this to woman aging around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Since buying this Vitamin C Serum for Face I have been using it twice daily and have seen positive changes in the way my skin looks. The Vitamin C in this product neutralizes free radicals and reverses the damage they have caused to the skin and evens skin tone.  It shrinks fine lines and wrinkles and diminishes scars to make us look younger. Hyaluronic Acid&#x27;s moisture retention powers reduces wrinkles and the Vitamin E gives even skin tone and helps the look of pores. The Amino Acids Complex in this serum simulates the skin to produce collagen which slows down as we age. This serum is full of hard working ingredients and when used together produce significant results.  My skin is plumping up and the overall texture of my skin is improving. The fine lines on my fave are less visible.  My sister commented yesterday that my skin looks better and she had no idea what I have been using, so that pretty much sums up how great this product is! I bought this product at a promotional price and I am happy to share my honest opinions with others. I recommend this Vitamin C Serum to everyone looking to reduce the damage done by aging/smoking/tanning to the face.</li>
            <li> Love my Vitamin C!  I use Vitamin C at least twice a day.  The Imbue Naturals Vitamin C has a pump top which I love so I don&#x27;t waste it.  The Vitamin C is just the right consistency - not too runny and not too thick.  It is fun to watch it get soaked up by my skin.  My skin must be thirsty!  You just have to give the top a half pump to get enough serum out.  A full pump can cover face neck hands &amp; elbows!.  I received this serum at a reduced price for a fair opinion.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband to use.  The smell is pleasant and does not burn the nose when you put it on.  He noticed a difference in his acne within a couple days.  The item was packaged so that the small amount that leaked into the cover did not make it further than that cap.  I really like the idea that the ingredients are organic, and it is also sensitive enough for my daughter to use on her skin as she cannot use other products due to her sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing. You can see and feel the difference in your skin almost immediately. My skin looks so great, moisturized, soft with a lovely glow. Definitely well worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and good cs from the seller.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  THIS VITAMIN C SERUM FOR FACE.  SMOOTH AND FEEL GOOD.  I WILL KEEP CONTINUED AND KEEP TO POSTI RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Just WOW!! I love this serum. I have used it twice and already my skin feels so much softer and more supple. I don&#x27;t know how or what it does, but results that quickly.. I will repurchase this.&lt;br /&gt;We will see how it goes, but so far.. I am blown away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sorta exploded on me when I opened the bottle to smell it, but if that&#x27;s the only bad thing.. then ok! It dosent smell great, but not bad either.. if you can detect a scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Formulated with a proprietary vitamin C complex to support natural collagen. Vitamin C serum is a natural skin care ingredient. Antioxidant Vitamin C protects skin from free radicals and is essential in collagen production. Vitamin C is the primary water-soluble antioxidant in the body, disarming free radicals and preventing damage both inside and outside cells</li>
            <li> So far so good! I really like the consistency of this serum. It isn&#x27;t too thick or too thin. I have had a hard time with breakouts in the past when using serums and I haven&#x27;t experienced that so far. I feel like I am already seeing results as well--especially on my forehead. I would definitely recommend. Very happy it is organic as well!</li>
            <li> Really love the results in this product. Could see results pretty instantly which is always cool. Good value for you money. It is definitely firming. Love that it is organic. So many products out there filling our skin with really toxic chemicals. Even better that it is made in the USA!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  Within 2 days, my skin felt and looked smoother.  It gave me that &amp;#34;just took a run&amp;#34; look... fresh, well hydrated and well oxygenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use Vitamin C on my face every day this organic recipe doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and is helping firm and lighten my skin..great product..</li>
            <li> It made my skin soft but I did not notice any changes as far as lightening any discoloration.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite products! Soaks right in to my skin and feels great! I swear my wrinkles have faded! Everyone says that I look younger! Highly recommend purchasing!!!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is a must have for everyone and has amazing benefits. If your going to buy a serum for your face than you must try this one FIRST. it feels great when first applied, on clean skin of course, and it dries quickly so you can apply your moisturizer. After a few applications I def see a difference.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a high quality for what it is.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.  Will have to use a bit longer to report any significant changes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but it has a funky smell...but since it works I&#x27;m not complaining! Makes my face feel clean and tight and makes my pores visibly smaller. Will update if this also helps my acne scarring.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Has an amazing citrus smell&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizes my face and wrinkle spots&lt;br /&gt;-Did slightly improve wrinkles and age spots&lt;br /&gt;-Relaxes your face so its not as tense&lt;br /&gt;-Great for the mornings after a nice shower&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-If an anti-aging is the only benefit you desire, there are others out there that are better but for a heftier price</li>
            <li> I like Vitamin C serum for my skin. It works well and making my face healthy looking and radiant. It works well under moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t counteract with some other stuffs I put on my face. No irritation seen on my sensitive skin. You won&#x27;t regret buying this product because it&#x27;s a good quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent odorless formula that goes on fast, The serum absorbs in just minutes and has noticeable firmness and tightness( in a good way) in just hours after use!</li>
            <li> Product nice but I feel I may need a little extra help possible Vitamin. In ascorbic acid form with peptides in solution. Most of skin is ? Improving don&#x27;t really see to many people so no one to notice.My big concern now is the &amp;#34; fantriliquist lines,  anyone recommend anything, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be allergic to injections</li>
            <li> First off I am 55 yrs old.  I used the product for one month, every morning and every night, I did what the instructions said,  by applying then using lotion top. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, wrinkles. I think it dryed my face out worse than it already was. I have tryed alot of products, and have yet to find something to work.</li>
            <li> Love this serum - have been using it for only a few weeks and my hyper-pigmentation spots are lightening and my skin has a more youthful glow!  Very happy with the results in such a short time!</li>
            <li> This works amazingly. I&#x27;m always hesitant to buy products. I&#x27;m glad I bought this one. My face has never looked betterðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Good vitamin c serum. Not greasy and gets absorbed quickly into skin.  No bad overwhelming smell or stickiness. I do feel that my skin seems to be looking brighter and more refreshed.  I also noticed that some of my fine line are fading slowly but I think I need to keep using it for another couple months to actually see results in wrinkles. So far so good.  Seems to be working pretty good.  I recommend it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now. I am very pleased with it and am already seeing results. My skin is clear, smooth and feeling healthy. The only reason I haven&#x27;t rated this product 5 stars is because I do not yet have a long term track record with it, however I expect I will continue to enjoy this product and add it to my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> These work great! So happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of it!</li>
            <li> Purchased with discount. I absolutely love how this feels, and I love how it makes my skin look. It&#x27;s lightweight too, so it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy at all. Well worth a purchase!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 1/2 weeks now and am quite pleased! I have to be on camera every couple months for work for a video podcast, and last night was one of those nights. I always never want to watch the replay but, after the recording, my coworker called me over to watch the replay to specifically tell me to look at how good my skin looked! I definitely notice a difference... Much smoother and even toned. I use concealer on my these dark sun spots I have on my cheeks, but I&#x27;m finding I am having to use it less and less. I highly recommend this serum. I&#x27;ve been using two little pumps of it every morning and night. After I put it on, I immediately put on a good quality sunscreen moisturizer. People say you should always give a product 30 days to see results, and I am happy to say I&#x27;m seeing them so soon! Looking forward to continued amazing results! (:</li>
            <li> I saw instant results. I have red spots and a little acne my skin feels tighter and clearer. Paired with the right moisturizer it is a great product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Left my usually combination skin (oily parts with dry patches) well hydrated yet not oily, and I also noticed a healthier glow.</li>
            <li> Love my vitamin c serums!</li>
            <li> Hi, I never generally write reviews, but I want to mention about this as I felt good products should never go out of market, so I thought a review might help both the company and the customer a chance to buy and sell these nice products. Coming to my experience, I am very satisfied with what the product does. I don&#x27;t say it is miracle serum or so, but it definitely works. I saw the difference in both clearing of marks and a major change in the feel of my skin. It got firm a lot and the pore size are reduced very well, along with a slight glow. I am planning to use it for more time and will give u more updates.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I live high in the mountains of Colorado and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great product to help out my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m outside in the sunshine nearly every day and it really sucks the moisture out and leaves you looking dry and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product everything morning as part of my daily beauty routine. I noticed results a right away!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel amazing.. Tighter &amp; radiant! I follow with moisturing sunscreen and I&#x27;m ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Try it- trust me! You won&#x27;t regret it&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to the pursuit beautiful, healthy, younger looking skin ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is one of the highlights of my evening ritual. It smells so amazing and my skin is looking clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks and I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.  I have very sensitive skin and this has not caused any updates.  I did squeeze a bit too much our the first time I used the serum, so the pump is a little tricky to use initially.  But, I have that figured out now and a pea sized amount does the trick.  Jet is also incredibly customer focused and interacts with you to see how you like the product and how it&#x27;s working for you. This seems to be a great company - one that is very focused on customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I had lots of air in my bottle and even a small pump would produce gobs. The company sent an email at shipment with directions and stated that this would occur for the first couple uses but it probably took two weeks for mine to stop. A lot of the product was wasted for the price because of that. But the product itself is great and seems to make a difference in my overall complexion!</li>
            <li> This seems to work very well.  Tightens the skin and is not too heavy.  Just a few drops are needed.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Dosent leave a sticky residue on my skin. After several days of use my skin is soft and seems smoother. My only complants is the pump bottle itself , it is a little tricky to push the  pump down with out squirting it in the floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now and I am in love with it. I only apply this product to my face at night and then put a night moisturizer on top of it. In the morning, I wake up with perfect and smooth skin. When I first started using this product, it broke me out and it kind of stung with I put it on. I think that is how you know the product is really working. After a couple of uses, I stopped breaking out and my skin became amazing! I love that this product is filled with natural ingredients and I know it&#x27;s safe for my face. What works for me may not work for you, so I suggest you give this a try!</li>
            <li> I returned product because the bottle was leaking.  I didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it out, so my review is only regarding the product packaging and the smell. I expected a more natural smelling product, but had a slight chemical smell to it.  For a company with the Natural in the name, I would have expected a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff,I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying to improve the look of my skin. Unfortunately I suffer from enlarged pores and severe dryness which causes redness. My skin tends to look pretty dull and I&#x27;ve been reading up on the benefits of vitamin c serum so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for a few weeks now. I&#x27;ve tried a few other vitamin c serums since purchasing from Imbue Naturals, but I prefer their formula because it&#x27;s a bit thicker than other brands. I have noticed that you want to apply this evenly but lightly. Too much can cause a sticky residue and if you want to wear this under makeup, it&#x27;ll just create a mess. A little goes a long way! I have noticed an overall skin evening. My redness has definitely decreased but it does come right back if I discontinue use. Keep in mind that I have annoyingly sensitive skin though. Just showering causes my skin to dry out. I do LOVE the fact that it shrinks pores. I use masks, I&#x27;ve tried primers, sprays, everything and this is one product that I didn&#x27;t have to wait to see results with. Although I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to someone who needs help evening out their skin tone or tightening their pores. If you&#x27;re looking for something to help with severe dry skin alone, this won&#x27;t be your cure but it will definitely help with other issues.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it! Her skin has already improved in appearance. It absorbs fast and makes her skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> This works well, I like the way it feels!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with trying as many different all natural and vitamin enriched beauty products as I can get my hands on, so I was excited to try this one at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review. Of all the different vitamin c products I have tried, this is definitely one of my favorites. I can really feel it tightening my skin very shortly after I put it on, so I really feel like it&#x27;s working and living up to its reputation. I cannot wait to continue using this product!</li>
            <li> I see results already from just a few days of use..I get this really nice glow that i didn&#x27;t have before..My skin looks nourished and I love it!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have acne spots on my face (I am a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34;) I thought they would never go away. I started using this product and within just over a week I saw an incredible difference! It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t make my other products absorb strangely or affect how they apply in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see how this continues to improve my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely stellar product.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have only been using it for about two weeks and absolutely love it! I see a difference in the appearance of my skin tone and I am 100% satisfied! Other products similar to this that I have used in the past have caused me to breakout and that is not the case with Imbue Naturals. I suggest for everyone to buy and try this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have only been using it for a few days, but already noticing a difference in the look and feel of my skin.  I am noticing that dullness and fine lines are being less visible.  I am excited to continue to use this.  No oily or gritty feeling, goes on smooth with no residue.</li>
            <li> I have been using Imbue Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum for the past several weeks and have noticed a difference. My skin feels tighter and looks great. The directions indicate that you should follow use with moisturizer and that&#x27;s definitely the case. The serum leaves my skin a little dry but it&#x27;s easily addressed with lotion. I&#x27;ve tried several skin care regimens but many don&#x27;t work with my sensitive skin. This has been gentle on my skin and caused none of the issues I typically see - perhaps because of the natural ingredients. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful.  It is applied to a clean face twice a day, morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light, not oily and the skin absorbs the product super fast.  I always wait a few minutes and than apply a light face moisturizer.  After using this product for a couple of weeks, I have already had results.  I have started getting sun spots.  One is almost completely gone the others are already fading.  My pores have gotten smaller.  The over all feel of the skin is soft and it just looks so much better.  I have noticed a little tingle to my skin as I apply the Serum.  With the tingle I know that the Serum is working immediately.  My skin actually almost feels like there is a face mask on it when the Serum dries.  Once I put on the face moisturizer this goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a faint odor to the serum that I do not like, but it is very faint and it goes away within minutes once the serum is absorbed by the skin.  Also the serum comes out of the pump very fast, so I usually get a little too much each time.  Neither of these things take away from this wonderful serum.  I really love this product and its fast results.</li>
            <li> I was given this product by the company to try out. My views on this product are all from my own experience in using this product. I am not affiliated with this company in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first product I would like to review is Imbue Naturals vitamin C serum. The way I used it was exactly as explained in the insert. I applied 2 times a day after cleaning my face and used for 7 days straight before writing this review. I also did do the suggested exfoliating (with a coffee scrub) twice within the week. I also applied a face lotion with sunscreen in it after the serum during the day. And at night I applied just a lotion after the serum before bed. I did not add anything else to my regime to be sure my results were coming from this product only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results were as follows; I experience slight stinging of the skin the first few times I applied the product. This reassured me that the product was really working. The stinging sensation was very mild and did not cause pain. I did not like the smell at all, but that is because this product is so natural that there is no added fragrance which is a plus for me. I noticed immediate changes to my complexion, my skin appeared more even toned and smoother. By the 7th day I saw much reduction in red marks and sun spots on my face. Also I would say some of the fine lines and wrinkles have smoothed out and my skin feels softer to the touch. I feel overall that this product is very effective in creating a smoother, more even toned complexion. For a more detailed review see here http://www.essentiallysavvy.com/product-reviews/</li>
            <li> This product is very thick but moisturizing. I was expecting my skin to be sticky but it wasnt. I love the pump, it made application very easy. Great product overall</li>
            <li> this is awesome. I have been using this product for a few days and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this Vitamin C! Just turned 30 but I&#x27;m trying to fight aging while I can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already seen results.  Great product and makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive. I don&#x27;t like using things that have not been recommened to me. This product is very light and easy to use. But I most likely wont use it again because my skin is very oily as it is and adding serum to my face doens&#x27;t help. If you have normal skin (not oily skin) this product would be good for you!</li>
            <li> I have been really interested in Vitamin C serums and have implemented it into my nightly beauty regimen. Imbue Naturals has a 20% Vitamin C serum that I was so fortunate to be able to try! I stopped using my previous brand for a few days before begin my trial with this brand in order to be able to fully evaluate its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background - I am in my mid forties and I am a cancer survivor YAY!  But in the course of the (life-saving) treatments I&#x27;ve undergone, my skin is definitely showing signs of premature aging. Fine lines around my eyes and mouth, a couple deep lines in my forehead and what I call &amp;#34;dullness&amp;#34; in my skin tone are the trophies I carry from my adventure with chemotherapy.  These reasons are why I began to test and review Retinols and Vitamin C Serums.  I am really conscious of the harsh and/or unnatural ingredients in so many skincare products on the marlket.  I want my skin to be revived by natural ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok!  So I started my trial use of Imbue Naturals 20% vitamin C Serum 14 days ago.  I have a nightly skincare routine that involves a gentle cleanser, twice weekly exfoliation, tonic, the Vitamin C Serum and a really good moisturizer (PLEASE DON&#x27;T FORGET THIS VERY IMPORTANT STEP!) Upon receipt of my product, I immediately noticed the beautiful packaging! It is apparent that this company has taken the time to refine not only its product ingredients but also their professional image and it reflects in their classy, refined packaging.  The bottle of serum is contained in a dark brown glass bottle wuth a plastic pump distribution system.  The pump allows no bacteria to be introduced into the product!  It distributes just the right amount of product for application (no waste &#x3D; better value!)  Going on, the product feels light and and doesn&#x27;t really have a scent. I have not experienced any dryness or flaking from the serum. Sun sensitivity with this serum is minimal and I do use a moisturizer with 35 SPF everyday. What I am excited about is that I have seen a nice reduction in the appearance of my fine lines!  My skin is no longer dull or ashy.  My neck skin feels firmer and I feel like I have a fresh faced look to present to the world each day. The serum is gentle enough for twice a day use and so far, I am really happy to have had the opportunity to experience it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note - I was provided this product by Imbue Naturals and their PR firm for the express purpose of testing and reviewing the product. I always post my honest thoughts, opinions and experiences (good, bad and ugly!) and I am not required to write a positive review.  It is important for me to share the true experience with you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are interested in a Vitamin C serum, Imbue Naturals product is truly worth the time and cost.

            <li> I am quickly approaching my 41st birthday and these tiny wrinkles on my face have been multiplying overnight, apparently. I ordered the Imbue Naturals Vitamin C Serum because it was organic, non-GMO, and had 20% Vitamin C. I eat a 100% organic diet, and am doing the same with everything yes that goes on my body. I was also impressed that there are no parabens or alcohol in this Vitamin C serum. I know that Vitamin C has been shown to reduce wrinkles and skin blemishes. The bottle arrived in Alaska faster than what I thought - things take forever to get here! The day before it arrived I had somehow bumped my nose (don&#x27;t ask!) and now it was sore and raw because I had taken off a layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one pump of the Imbue Naturals Vitamin C Serum and massaged it into my face and on my sore nose. I thought something was wrong because I could immediately feel my face tightening up. Is that supposed to happen? Yep! I&#x27;m not a girly girl and don&#x27;t have a whole beauty routine FYI. I noticed that my pores were smaller and the the little fine line wrinkles were disappearing. Yes, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order another bottle of this and keep putting it on every morning. I will report back and see if how it does in the sun as I get outside more. Oh, and if you get some on your lips, it tastes yummy :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Bought for my mom!</li>
            <li> This serum makes ur skin feel really good its only my 2nd day using ill uodate my review in a week or 2 with more detais but so far its great</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum by Imbue Naturals goes on with a very silky feel and leaves skin feeling soft.  I did notice my skin seems brighter after using consistently.</li>
            <li> I use this serum on my cuts and stretch marks the are getting very light. My mother in law ask to borrow it because she suffer from very dark circles and she is loving it because its working for her even making her skin more glowing because her dark circle are going away. I would recommend this serum to everyone.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I have a tendency to wait a few weeks before posting reviews to a particular product. The reason being, it might work great the first couple of days then tank out later. Fortunately, I cannot say that regarding this product. After using it I have noticed a smooth and radiant feel to my skin. The use of organic items was an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly pleased with the product and will recommend to others</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum!  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly -never leaving my skin feeling greasy.  I love afterwards how my skin just feels fresh and clean - not all weighed down like you get with so many other facial products.  Love this!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Passing it along to my mother to try as well. Hope to see more products in this line soon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for use on preventing fine lines and discoloration.  I have always had a problem with dullness and discoloration for as long as I can remember.  After a couple of weeks of use, I could tell a noticable difference.  My co-workers, friends, and family noticed as well.  This has a great citrus smell and even though I have sensitive skin, this did not irritate my skin.  Great find!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great,  works wonderfully. Noticeable results after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.  I PUT IT ON MORNING AND NIGHT.  IT PENETRATES.MY SKIN QUICKLY AND MY AGE SPOTS ARE FADING.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous amount of serums throughout the years, trying to brighten my skin and make it more toned and young looking. Some of them worked, some were OK and some did not do anything. This Vitamin C serum is in my top list of skin care products. It is made of organic ingredients and has no useless or harmful fillers. Nowadays cosmetic products are full of chemical elements that do more harm than good, but not this Serum.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Serum every morning and evening after washing and toning my face. The skin feels tighter instantly and in a few days I noticed that my skin became brighter and had more glow. My friends noticed it as well and thought that I went to have facials or peel done. I did not keep the Serum a secret, so now they are happy to use it too.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend to include the Serum in your daily routine and I hope you feel more confident in your new perfect skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, and I&#x27;m already in love with it.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels smoother and my pores are smaller.  I also feel like my skin tone is more even and a little brighter since using this serum.  This is definitely going to be a permanent part of my skin care regimen!</li>
            <li> I love this serum - seems to be effective. The packaging and the pump dispenser are both great, too.</li>
            <li> I recommend this serum. I have used it about a week and can see some improvement.</li>
            <li> Nice size bottle, feels good on, doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. I was kind of skeptical to buy this product. Im so glad I took the plunge. I saw immediate results. My large pores have drastically been reduced after a week. My rough dry skin is improving day by day. Even my husband has noticed. The redness in my face has also improved. Im really really happy I came across this product.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Much more potent than other serums. Dries quickly so it&#x27;s easy to apply under makeup.  I use it morning and night and have been getting compliments on my skin.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> So little by little, I am becoming an expert on Vitamin C beauty products as I am reviewing yet another one.  Vitamin C serums are big now but how do you know which one to use?  A lot of them have Hyaluronic Acid in them which helps to moisturize and plump the skin.  What makes one different than the other? How can you be sure it is working like &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; say?  Well, I came across Imbue Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum and was asked to review it and found out some answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many serums contain fillers or added ingredients with no clinical backing.  Many companies also add fragrance.  Imbue Naturals Vitamin C Serum doesn&#x27;t which probably explains its bitter scent.  Vitamin C is very acidic and when you consider the bitter scent of this product, it leads me to believe the claims of its potency (20%) and natural ingredients are correct.  Some people might be bothered by the smell.  I&#x27;d rather have natural and organic ingredients that smell a little bitter than artificial fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many benefits to putting the cocktail of Vitamin C,  Hyaluronic  Acid and Vitamin E on your skin. It evens out the skin tone, reduces the appearance of wrinkles, helps fade scars and stretch marks and retains moisture in the skin.  Imbue Naturals Vitamin C Serum also stimulates collagen production as well and regenerating skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using Imbue Naturals Vitamin C Serum for very long but have noticed that my skin looks more radiant and know that sometimes it takes weeks to see results, as they say on their site.  I like that they don&#x27;t claim to show immediate results like so many companies- even if some people, like me, will see immediate results.  Everyone reacts differently to skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use twice a day on cleansed skin for maximum results with a good moisturizer on top.  Just a half a pump will do.  It is very hydrating and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;As an active blogger I received this product for little or no cost. All opinions are 100 percent my own.</li>
            <li> It is very important to me to keep harsh ingredients out of my skin routine... Imbue Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum contains Hyaluronic Acid, Amino Complex, Vitamin C, and Vitamin E.  I have sensitive skin and would like to point out that the first 3 - 4 days of using the serum morning and night really dried my skin out at first. However, I now only use it in the morning when I immediately follow application with my normal face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have definitely seen a difference in the quality of my skin in the 2 - 3 weeks I have been using it. My skin looks younger, has reduced fine lines and pore size, and overall a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be aware of - the pump is a little aggressive, a little bit goes a very long way, I only use one pump. This product is great and I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
            <li> cant get passed smell.  smells like you licked your hand and applied that smell to your face.</li>
