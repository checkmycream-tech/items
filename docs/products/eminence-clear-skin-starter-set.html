    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Hungarian Herbal Mud is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Incredible products!</li>
            <li>The best product in the kit is the willow bark serum.  </li>
            <li>I selected these products because my best friend raved about the brand.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best</li>
            <li>Smells and feels great!</li>
            <li>Very happy that I bought the trial size.</li>
            <li>The serum is really good as well!</li>
            <li>but if you can withstand it, it is great for increasing blood flow in the skin.</li>
            <li>Works great for my skin.</li>
            <li>The face wash and moisturizer are great.</li>
            <li>Great samples to try before you buy.</li>

            <li>Great starter kit.</li>
            <li>This is a great purchase to try out this brand of skin care.  </li>
            <li>And I am happy I gave this set a try</li>
            <li>a foaming face wash followed with a moisturizer that&#x27;s very light would be best.</li>
            <li>Love the Mask the best.</li>
            <li>It was the perfect way to test out and decide if I wanted full size products, which I did!  </li>
            <li>Loved the scent, tho.</li>
            <li>I loved the cleanser and so saved the kit for traveling.  </li>
            <li>The mask is good</li>
            <li>I started to see good results within 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>it feels good and feels like its working.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more products from this line, good luck!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many great reviews about this product but when I started using it</li>
            <li>I loved the way the booster serum felt, and the masque tingled nicely.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love Eminence organic products!</li>
            <li>I love Eminence products!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I did end up purchasing a large size of it, its the perfect serum for day and night under moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li>The masque cream in this kit feels amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe what it does for me</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for my skin and Eminence really is the best and healthiest option.</li>
            <li>This is definitely warm on application</li>
            <li>The skin care itself did not do anything for me, but I did get a nice travel size bag with all of it.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be nice -</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of these products.</li>
            <li>I really liked the probiotic cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The bag that the set comes in is high quality and looks great!</li>
            <li>The Eminence clear skin set is absolutely awesome!  </li>
            <li>It smells like licorice and seems to work better for me, so I will keep using that for problem spots.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I simply love this product</li>
            <li>, I have combo oily/dry (mostly oily) skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over a month and my skin looks better then it ever did.  </li>
            <li>I also improved my diet by staying away from sugar, fats and grease and drinking more water.  </li>
            <li>the price on amazon is so much better than the spa where I get facials (and was recommended to use this product).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am so in love.</li>
            <li>I wanted so badly to love this product.</li>
            <li>The treatment was ok, as was the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I went back to using Caudalie face wash and vino perfect serum.</li>
            <li>I was convinced to try this product and noticing the price, I figured starting with the starter set was a good idea to make sure I liked it</li>
            <li>Just ordered my full sized products!</li>
            <li>(Nov 6th-Nov 12th, arrived on Nov 9th) got a free piece of Eminence choc.</li>
            <li>The skincare feels great at the time of application, the mask especially.  </li>
            <li>Its a fresh smelling, tingly mask that does make my skin appear brighter and more toned, but</li>
            <li>Love love love these products...and my skin looks better after only 3 days!</li>
            <li>soooo worth the price!</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t suffer from acne, I would enjoy this line so much more, I believe the probiotics really benefit skin.  </li>
            <li>and this is an amazing product -- my skin has never been so clear!</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this whole set.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference and for the price, I think there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>I bought to take on vacation with me instead of the full side product.</li>
            <li>I think oily acne prone skin needs light ingredients that are easily absorbed into the pores.</li>
            <li>Probably, it&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li>Other than that, packaging was great and delivery was on time.</li>
            <li>I have normal/combination skin that is prone to mild breakouts even at age 35.  </li>
            <li>My face looks more vibrant and fresh.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked from this starter kit was the mask...</li>
            <li>Really enjoying this natural skin care set.</li>
            <li>I bought this set to see if I liked the eminence probiotic cleanser before buying the bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to see results immediately and give up on them right away.</li>
            <li>If they&#x27;re right</li>
            <li>and some were very large in sizes.</li>
            <li>The other products are pretty good, but I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.  </li>
            <li>I quickly became very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I picked up this starter kit when I became pregnant because I wanted to find a way to gently treat my acne while using an organic solution.  </li>
            <li>I have since purchased the larger sizes because I have liked this product so much.</li>
            <li>It has really helped to clear up some acne that was coming and going, she has also increased drinking of more water which would then help assist this product in clearing her</li>
            <li>The kids I work with are even asking me why I have so many &amp;#34;mosquito bites&amp;#34; on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say on a positive note that the first couple of days I used this product I did see a radiance I had never seen before in my skin and where the skin is not broken out there is a a new found softness.</li>
            <li>Just as expected and the case is lovely!</li>
            <li>So far I have been happy with the products, other than the amount in the starter kit</li>
            <li>It works for me and is worth the money for the large size bottles.</li>
            <li>so I recommend you be pretty consistent with use when you get it.</li>
            <li>Did not work for me, I actually broke out more.  </li>
            <li>For more than 10 years I used Proactive and before trying Eminence after my first facial, I had been using Exposed Skin care for about 18 months.  </li>
            <li>Overall I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of affordable prescription products that are much more likely to work.</li>
            <li>therefore you had to use more and if you wear make up extra.</li>
            <li>Like I mentioned above, I&#x27;ve heard great things about it from other people ...</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks so much healthier and happier over all combined with drinking plenty of water and watching for what in my diet triggers breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>I like the way these products made my skin look and feel, but they do absolutely nothing for breakouts.</li>
            <li>I really like this product .</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, however it made my face break out as soon as I started using it.</li>
            <li>I have used the kit as well as the other three products in combination for over a month now and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>(clear and no visible blemishes but scarring was and still is evident)</li>
            <li>With this product in conjunction with a few other products in the Eminence family I have finally found my beautiful skin!  </li>
            <li>I have an eye cream from Eminence that I LOVE, so I wanted to try this starter set because I am in my 30&#x27;s and still get occasional acne - especially on my back.</li>
            <li>I love this starter pack because it has just enough of everything to get you through about 1-2 months (though I always have left over masque).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this a try.  </li>
            <li>little pouche that comes with the set is really cute.</li>
            <li>The may make your skin red and irritated at first, but that is easier to cover up than acne, and it will subside!</li>
            <li>and I have received a facial with eminence products and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It does work for me and is worth the try, although everyone is different</li>
            <li>you have more than a few pimples, my recommendation would be see a dermatologist and stop wasting your money on these OTC products.</li>
            <li>The serum seemed to be too strong, I have dark olive skin</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Clear Skin Starter Set.</li>
            <li>However, if you have normal skin that isn&#x27;t prone to breakouts and are looking for a line that will give your skin a soft, radiant look, these products might work for you--</li>
            <li>Im using this and some other products from Olay and my face is starting to clear up and look more youthful.</li>
            <li>Their pro-biotic facemask has seemed to help decently over the past few months that I&#x27;ve been using it so hopefully their cleansing products will result in the same decent to great turn-out.</li>
            <li>If you actually have &amp;#34;problem skin,&amp;#34; there are starter kits for half the price that are much better for controlling breakouts.</li>
            <li>I tried using this kit to clear out my break outs</li>
            <li>My skin started to clear immediately after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>A family friend, and esthetician, recommended the Eminence Organics Clear Skin Kit to me along with the Pear &amp; Poppy Seed Microderm Polisher, Hungarian Herbal Mud Treatment and Tomato Oil-Control Gel.</li>
            <li>The Clear Skin line has signficantly helped to clear and balance my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problematic skin since I could remember and now being in my mid 20&#x27;s, it can be quite embarrassing at times especially in professional work settings.</li>
            <li>Probably my least favorite is the cleanser</li>
            <li>Kept y skin so soft.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural, and probiotics... which I completely believe in.  </li>
            <li>and I thought I would take action to nourish my skin the way it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I, it is working well for my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff didn&#x27;t smell &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;organic&#x27; to me.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne and sensitive skin since I was young.  </li>
            <li>I actually starting breaking out more than I ever have in the past.</li>
            <li>had such high hopes for this product because people rave about it.</li>
            <li>I tried mixing it up because I had been using the same line for a while, but I will be going back to the Dermologica Clear Start products, as they are more effective and less expensive.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer ran out long before the rest of the products did, which was really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the moisturizer ran out, I started using a new product and the acne on my chin finally subsided.</li>
            <li>have acne prone skin, I am 25 years old and have struggled with acne since my early teen years.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all the major name brand regimens for acne.</li>
            <li>Would definitely give it a try if you want to go the natural route.</li>
            <li>I used the product for only a week so far</li>
            <li>Also, I usually like the herbal smell of all natural products, but the scent of these products is a bit much.</li>
            <li>After not receiving a refund for several weeks, I complained a bit and my money was returned in full.</li>
            <li>Small sample kit but good enough to last about a month or so maybe less if using everything everyday.  </li>
            <li>I am in my late 20s with mild to moderate acne.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For more than 10 years I used Proactive and before trying Eminence after my first facial, I had been using Exposed Skin care for about 18 months.  </li>
            <li> Overall I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of affordable prescription products that are much more likely to work.</li>
            <li> therefore you had to use more and if you wear make up extra.</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned above, I&#x27;ve heard great things about it from other people ...</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks so much healthier and happier over all combined with drinking plenty of water and watching for what in my diet triggers breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> I like the way these products made my skin look and feel, but they do absolutely nothing for breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really like this product .</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, however it made my face break out as soon as I started using it.</li>
            <li> I have used the kit as well as the other three products in combination for over a month now and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> (clear and no visible blemishes but scarring was and still is evident)</li>
            <li> With this product in conjunction with a few other products in the Eminence family I have finally found my beautiful skin!  </li>
            <li> I have an eye cream from Eminence that I LOVE, so I wanted to try this starter set because I am in my 30&#x27;s and still get occasional acne - especially on my back.</li>
            <li> I love this starter pack because it has just enough of everything to get you through about 1-2 months (though I always have left over masque).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this a try.  </li>
            <li> little pouche that comes with the set is really cute.</li>
            <li> The may make your skin red and irritated at first, but that is easier to cover up than acne, and it will subside!</li>
            <li> and I have received a facial with eminence products and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It does work for me and is worth the try, although everyone is different</li>
            <li> you have more than a few pimples, my recommendation would be see a dermatologist and stop wasting your money on these OTC products.</li>
            <li> The serum seemed to be too strong, I have dark olive skin</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Clear Skin Starter Set.</li>
            <li> However, if you have normal skin that isn&#x27;t prone to breakouts and are looking for a line that will give your skin a soft, radiant look, these products might work for you--</li>
            <li> Im using this and some other products from Olay and my face is starting to clear up and look more youthful.</li>
            <li> Their pro-biotic facemask has seemed to help decently over the past few months that I&#x27;ve been using it so hopefully their cleansing products will result in the same decent to great turn-out.</li>
            <li> If you actually have &amp;#34;problem skin,&amp;#34; there are starter kits for half the price that are much better for controlling breakouts.</li>
            <li> I tried using this kit to clear out my break outs</li>
            <li> My skin started to clear immediately after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> A family friend, and esthetician, recommended the Eminence Organics Clear Skin Kit to me along with the Pear &amp; Poppy Seed Microderm Polisher, Hungarian Herbal Mud Treatment and Tomato Oil-Control Gel.</li>
            <li> The Clear Skin line has signficantly helped to clear and balance my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problematic skin since I could remember and now being in my mid 20&#x27;s, it can be quite embarrassing at times especially in professional work settings.</li>
            <li> Probably my least favorite is the cleanser</li>
            <li> Kept y skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural, and probiotics... which I completely believe in.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I would take action to nourish my skin the way it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I, it is working well for my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t smell &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;organic&#x27; to me.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne and sensitive skin since I was young.  </li>
            <li> I actually starting breaking out more than I ever have in the past.</li>
            <li> had such high hopes for this product because people rave about it.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it up because I had been using the same line for a while, but I will be going back to the Dermologica Clear Start products, as they are more effective and less expensive.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer ran out long before the rest of the products did, which was really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the moisturizer ran out, I started using a new product and the acne on my chin finally subsided.</li>
            <li> have acne prone skin, I am 25 years old and have struggled with acne since my early teen years.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all the major name brand regimens for acne.</li>
            <li> Would definitely give it a try if you want to go the natural route.</li>
            <li> I used the product for only a week so far</li>
            <li> Also, I usually like the herbal smell of all natural products, but the scent of these products is a bit much.</li>
            <li> After not receiving a refund for several weeks, I complained a bit and my money was returned in full.</li>
            <li> Small sample kit but good enough to last about a month or so maybe less if using everything everyday.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 20s with mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough but plenty to se if I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had major acne issues that began when I was a young teen and into my late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> They seemed really expensive compared to the drug store products I was currently using, so ordering the smaller sizes in the starter kit seemed like a way to try them out insteaded of paying for full price items and not liking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was referred by my esthetician to use this product due to the pro biotic facial mask that was being used in my facial sessions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many break outs unless I have cold</li>
            <li> I really do think these ingredients are too thick in consistency.</li>
            <li> Broke me out in tiny little red bumps all over my chin and around my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually glad it happened so suddenly because I stopped using the products before it got really bad.</li>
            <li> but I left it on too long (a little longer than overnight)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to tell how a skin care product will actually work with your skin when you only have 2 weeks of a 4 week always hormonally changing month</li>
            <li> I would recommended this to anyone, you will notice a difference in your skin, especially if you are coming from harsh cleaners with acids in them.</li>
            <li> but I am going to try some of the other products in this line as well.</li>
            <li> every other time I didn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> but this minimal investment might do the trick for you too!</li>
            <li> I went to a spa that used this product in a deep pore facial, needless to say I did see a result in my skin that same day.</li>
            <li> I seem to be the only one writing a negative review.</li>
            <li> The mask did seem to help but the moisturizer was definitely way too creamy and thick for my oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I do stand behind using natural ingredients</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth at least trying it out.</li>
            <li> Less not 123 Skincare)as well as the store origin not being seen anywhere.</li>
            <li> and I believe due to some of the ingredients such as the shea butter, and almond milk it made my face worse immediately.</li>
            <li> Item as described by seller,great price,wished it would have arrived a little sooner.</li>
            <li> So I have truly tried everything and seen little to no improvement...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that an organic, all natural skin care line would have any postive impact, but did it ever!  </li>
            <li> and it caused a little hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> so I kept using it for a few weeks thinking it was all coming out of my system.</li>
            <li> Every few days I add the Willow Bark Serum to the Masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I have given it 2 months now, and my acne has only gotten worse.</li>
            <li> I used this entire product line for a few months (3+) and it has not cleared my acne at all, my acne is worse now than when I started using it.</li>
            <li> and it broke my face out pretty bad but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wary of the storefront name being different than the name on the Packing Slip(Pretty Skin 4</li>
            <li> Nothing helps better than just sun bathing and drying my skin out (which I know is terrible for you skin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s with oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to work without destroying my skin in the process as well as my clothes,towels,pillowcases (proactive) or making my acne worse.</li>
            <li> There must be something in it that is irritating to me, specifically.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shortly after starting to use these products, I developed terrible, painful cystic acne on my chin, which I&#x27;ve never had before.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for that to happen.</li>
            <li> have troubled skin for 15 years</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t improve my skin.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this line broke me out immediately.</li>
            <li> and I see and feel dramatic improvement!</li>
            <li> Sounds like some people have had bad experiences with the product being expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was  sick of the medications and determined to find something that made a difference.</li>
            <li> I was given samples of the products and in that week I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only thing I liked from this starter kit was the mask... I tried using this kit to clear out my break outs and it didn&#x27;t... I wish it did work for me... Oh well, I tried...</li>
            <li> I have an eye cream from Eminence that I LOVE, so I wanted to try this starter set because I am in my 30&#x27;s and still get occasional acne - especially on my back. After only 2 uses, the cleanser and moisturizer made me break out on my cheeks, neck and arms in itchy bumps. There must be something in it that is irritating to me, specifically. I also could not tolerate the smell of either product. The booster serum was so-so. It smells like licorice and seems to work better for me, so I will keep using that for problem spots. I&#x27;m also going to keep the mask.</li>
            <li> I like eminence products.</li>
            <li> This works very well. I have tried everything for my skin and Eminence really is the best and healthiest option. I love this starter pack because it has just enough of everything to get you through about 1-2 months (though I always have left over masque). I would recommended this to anyone, you will notice a difference in your skin, especially if you are coming from harsh cleaners with acids in them. My dermatologist recommended this and I have received a facial with eminence products and it is worth the money. It is expensive, but worth at least trying it out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this natural skin care set. The Hungarian Herbal Mud is wonderful. This is definitely warm on application but if you can withstand it, it is great for increasing blood flow in the skin. The rosy red glow afterwards will fad in an hour. It has helped me with hormonal acne around the mouth. I do find the poppy seed polisher too abrasive for my skin because but I am going to try some of the other products in this line as well. Don&#x27;t expect to see results immediately and give up on them right away. I noticed an improvement after two weeks of use so I recommend you be pretty consistent with use when you get it.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, I actually broke out more.  Loved the scent, tho.</li>
            <li> I love it. Works great for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I can already see the difference. My skin looks better.</li>
            <li> The skin care itself did not do anything for me, but I did get a nice travel size bag with all of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to see if I liked the eminence probiotic cleanser before buying the bigger bottle.  I loved the cleanser and so saved the kit for traveling.  The bag that the set comes in is high quality and looks great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problematic skin since I could remember and now being in my mid 20&#x27;s, it can be quite embarrassing at times especially in professional work settings. I was convinced to try this product and noticing the price, I figured starting with the starter set was a good idea to make sure I liked it and it worked for me. I&#x27;ve heard so many great reviews about this product but when I started using it I quickly became very dissatisfied. I actually starting breaking out more than I ever have in the past. I thought maybe the product was bringing everything out at once so I kept using it for a few weeks thinking it was all coming out of my system. But the acne kept coming out and some were very large in sizes. There was no end in sight so I had to stop using it after about a month. My skin started to clear immediately after I stopped using it. Like I mentioned above, I&#x27;ve heard great things about it from other people ... just wasn&#x27;t a match for me.</li>
            <li> For the price the products in this set are tiny. The face wash and moisturizer are great. The mask is good but I left it on too long (a little longer than overnight) once and it broke my face out pretty bad but every other time I didn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> Eminence continues to impress me no matter what I get from them! Incredible products!</li>
            <li> Great samples to try before you buy.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with persistent acne since I was a teen, I have combo oily/dry (mostly oily) skin and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products. Nothing seems to work without destroying my skin in the process as well as my clothes,towels,pillowcases (proactive) or making my acne worse. A family friend, and esthetician, recommended the Eminence Organics Clear Skin Kit to me along with the Pear &amp; Poppy Seed Microderm Polisher, Hungarian Herbal Mud Treatment and Tomato Oil-Control Gel. I have used the kit as well as the other three products in combination for over a month now and LOVE IT. My skin feels and looks so much healthier and happier over all combined with drinking plenty of water and watching for what in my diet triggers breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;The following is the same review I made for 123 Skincare which is who I purchased the kit from:&lt;br /&gt;Arrived neatly packaged and within the delivery dates (Nov 6th-Nov 12th, arrived on Nov 9th) got a free piece of Eminence choc. with my order. I&#x27;m wary of the storefront name being different than the name on the Packing Slip(Pretty Skin 4 Less not 123 Skincare)as well as the store origin not being seen anywhere. Item as described by seller,great price,wished it would have arrived a little sooner.</li>
            <li> Broke me out in tiny little red bumps all over my chin and around my nose. Way too expensive for that to happen.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this whole set. The cleanser and moisturizer woe for my acne and the masque is great. The me ask definitely has a tingly feeling which was invigorating for me! The serum is really good as well! Would definitely give it a try if you want to go the natural route.</li>
            <li> I picked up this starter kit when I became pregnant because I wanted to find a way to gently treat my acne while using an organic solution.  The skincare feels great at the time of application, the mask especially.  Its a fresh smelling, tingly mask that does make my skin appear brighter and more toned, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that it has improved my acne at all.  If I didn&#x27;t suffer from acne, I would enjoy this line so much more, I believe the probiotics really benefit skin.  The best product in the kit is the willow bark serum.  I did end up purchasing a large size of it, its the perfect serum for day and night under moisturizer and makeup.  Probably my least favorite is the cleanser, it does not remove makeup well.</li>
            <li> The Eminence clear skin set is absolutely awesome!  I&#x27;ve had major acne issues that began when I was a young teen and into my late 40&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve visited dermatologists and took lots of prescription acne meds throughout the years including oral antibiotics.  I was  sick of the medications and determined to find something that made a difference. It&#x27;s been over a month and my skin looks better then it ever did.  I also improved my diet by staying away from sugar, fats and grease and drinking more water.  Eating healthier fiords such as fruits, vegetables and staying away from gluten has helped immensely!</li>
            <li> Worked very well. Kept y skin so soft.</li>
            <li> My face looks more vibrant and fresh.</li>
            <li> the price on amazon is so much better than the spa where I get facials (and was recommended to use this product).&lt;br /&gt;I have troubled skin for 15 years and this is an amazing product -- my skin has never been so clear! I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to tell how a skin care product will actually work with your skin when you only have 2 weeks of a 4 week always hormonally changing month you&#x27;d rather try it against.  I used the product for only a week so far and it seems to be nice - but this is also the &amp;#34;clear face&amp;#34; time of the 4 week month so I have stopped using it and will try it out again when my hormones are doing something different later in the month... Their pro-biotic facemask has seemed to help decently over the past few months that I&#x27;ve been using it so hopefully their cleansing products will result in the same decent to great turn-out.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a second purchase of a starter kit, I&#x27;ve had acne problems since I was a teenager and I&#x27;m now in my mid-30s!  So I have truly tried everything and seen little to no improvement... but this... has helped immensely!  After years of being on birth control pills for hormone issues I stopped talking them 6 months ago and my skin has been the worst ever, while at a spa with a friend I saw that they had this and wanted to give it a try, I started seeing an improvement in 2 days!  The ingredients are all natural, and probiotics... which I completely believe in.  I highly recommend giving this a try.  No two people are alike but this minimal investment might do the trick for you too!</li>
            <li> I like the way these products made my skin look and feel, but they do absolutely nothing for breakouts. Also, I usually like the herbal smell of all natural products, but the scent of these products is a bit much. However, if you have normal skin that isn&#x27;t prone to breakouts and are looking for a line that will give your skin a soft, radiant look, these products might work for you-- If you actually have &amp;#34;problem skin,&amp;#34; there are starter kits for half the price that are much better for controlling breakouts. I tried mixing it up because I had been using the same line for a while, but I will be going back to the Dermologica Clear Start products, as they are more effective and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I selected these products because my best friend raved about the brand. They seemed really expensive compared to the drug store products I was currently using, so ordering the smaller sizes in the starter kit seemed like a way to try them out insteaded of paying for full price items and not liking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks my skin is clearer than it has been in years. My hormonal chin acne is clearing up and even at the end of the day, my skin does not feel greasy like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Cleanser and Moisturizer in the morning and before bed all over my face and neck. I do emulsify the moisturizer with water to make it a bit lighter. I use the Willow Bark Serum on my problem areas (forehead, hose, chin) in the morning and evening as well. Every few days I add the Willow Bark Serum to the Masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Just ordered my full sized products!</li>
            <li> It was the perfect way to test out and decide if I wanted full size products, which I did!  The Clear Skin line has signficantly helped to clear and balance my skin.  I have normal/combination skin that is prone to mild breakouts even at age 35.  With this product in conjunction with a few other products in the Eminence family I have finally found my beautiful skin!  For more than 10 years I used Proactive and before trying Eminence after my first facial, I had been using Exposed Skin care for about 18 months.  I was skeptical that an organic, all natural skin care line would have any postive impact, but did it ever!  I&#x27;ve been using this line for almost 3 months and I am so in love.</li>
            <li> I seem to be the only one writing a negative review. But let me explain.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin, I am 25 years old and have struggled with acne since my early teen years.&lt;br /&gt;When I started this product my skin was ultimately at it&#x27;s best (clear and no visible blemishes but scarring was and still is evident) and I thought I would take action to nourish my skin the way it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all the major name brand regimens for acne. Nothing helps better than just sun bathing and drying my skin out (which I know is terrible for you skin). This is my third week using the product and the skin on my face truly hurts from all the acne. I don&#x27;t want to be seen in public and my self esteem is extremely low. The kids I work with are even asking me why I have so many &amp;#34;mosquito bites&amp;#34; on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say on a positive note that the first couple of days I used this product I did see a radiance I had never seen before in my skin and where the skin is not broken out there is a a new found softness. Some people say my skin may be going through a purging stage. If they&#x27;re right I hope and pray it&#x27;s almost over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had such high hopes for this product because people rave about it. I will do a follow up review next week to see if the entire month of using this product makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit. Love the Mask the best.</li>
            <li> I went to a spa that used this product in a deep pore facial, needless to say I did see a result in my skin that same day. I was given samples of the products and in that week I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I bought the travel packet because it contained everything I needed to try the product for a longer period of time without breaking the bank. All the items in the package were sealed and the quality of them was the same as the samples and the items used at the spa. I&#x27;ve battled with my acne skin and this product is now my only regemine I&#x27;ll use on my face. People at work and my boyfriend have made comments on how they see a difference in my face. It works for me and is worth the money for the large size bottles.</li>
            <li> So far I have been happy with the products, other than the amount in the starter kit, I realize it&#x27;s a starter kit but I literally used the smallest amount possible to try to stretch it about 3 weeks, which is Really not enough time to see if it will even work on problem skin. Overall I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Small sample kit but good enough to last about a month or so maybe less if using everything everyday.  It does work for me and is worth the try, although everyone is different so dont expect miracles overnight. I started to see good results within 2 weeks of use. Im using this and some other products from Olay and my face is starting to clear up and look more youthful. The masque cream in this kit feels amazing, I use it in the shower and leave it on my face for atleast 5 minutes, it does tingle and burn a bit but that doesnt bother me it feels good and feels like its working. I plan to buy more products from this line, good luck!</li>
            <li> It is not a product that I would recommend for people with acne</li>
            <li> I really like this product . It&#x27;s small enough but plenty to se if I really like it. So far I, it is working well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly to love this product. I&#x27;m in my late 20s with oily, acne prone skin. I struggle with acne daily, so I was hoping this would help. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. I liked the smell of these products. It reminds me of the beauty aisle at a health foods store. I loved the way the booster serum felt, and the masque tingled nicely. The face wash does not lather up, but that didn&#x27;t bother me. The moisturizer ran out long before the rest of the products did, which was really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after starting to use these products, I developed terrible, painful cystic acne on my chin, which I&#x27;ve never had before. I continued to use these products, hoping it was just getting out the impurities, but the issues persevered. I had issues all over my face, with my chin being the worst. When the moisturizer ran out, I started using a new product and the acne on my chin finally subsided. All in all, I just can&#x27;t use this again. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different though!</li>
            <li> This is a great purchase to try out this brand of skin care.  I have since purchased the larger sizes because I have liked this product so much.</li>
            <li> I really liked the probiotic cleanser.  The other products are pretty good, but I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.  I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference and for the price, I think there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> I used this entire product line for a few months (3+) and it has not cleared my acne at all, my acne is worse now than when I started using it.</li>
            <li> I have this product three stars because the product just did not work for my skin. Other than that, packaging was great and delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> Probably, it&#x27;s not a bad product but I don&#x27;t see any difference. I don&#x27;t have many break outs unless I have cold but then it&#x27;s internal problem. I have oily T-Zone with a lot of blackheads. This products do nothing for blackheads. I might try oily skin kit and see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;The little pouche that comes with the set is really cute. And I am happy I gave this set a try but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t improve my skin.</li>
            <li> The product I received was damaged and I started the return process. After not receiving a refund for several weeks, I complained a bit and my money was returned in full.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence organic products! Amazing doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe what it does for me skin. I am definitely hooked. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Just one day use and I see and feel dramatic improvement! I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my daughter, and she loves it!  It has really helped to clear up some acne that was coming and going, she has also increased drinking of more water which would then help assist this product in clearing her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend the Clear Skin Starter Set.</li>
            <li> I bought to take on vacation with me instead of the full side product. Just as expected and the case is lovely! I love Eminence products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching my skin care routine around for the last year and finally found my way back to Eminence.....soooo worth the price! Love love love these products...and my skin looks better after only 3 days!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use with my Clarisonic profile and my skin is glowing and keeps break outs at bay! Smells and feels great!</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t smell &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;organic&#x27; to me. (Like Aveda products). In my opinion it smelled like chemicals. The face wash does not lather, so that was different. The treatment was ok, as was the moisturizer. However, in the end it did not agree with my skin. In all fairness, my skin freaks at the slightest change. Very happy that I bought the trial size.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20s with mild to moderate acne. I bought this line at a local salon. I have given it 2 months now, and my acne has only gotten worse. I did the entire regimen (mask, cleanser, moisturizer, serum), but no improvement. If you still decide to buy it, I&#x27;d be cautious buying on Amazon. Sounds like some people have had bad experiences with the product being expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have more than a few pimples, my recommendation would be see a dermatologist and stop wasting your money on these OTC products. I&#x27;ve had acne on and off since I was a teenager and always resort back to prescription products. There are plenty of affordable prescription products that are much more likely to work. The may make your skin red and irritated at first, but that is easier to cover up than acne, and it will subside!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne and sensitive skin since I was young.  This is the only product that has cleared my skin up.  I have petroleum and paraben allergies.  Thank goodness for these products</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, however it made my face break out as soon as I started using it. I was referred by my esthetician to use this product due to the pro biotic facial mask that was being used in my facial sessions. However I have oily acne prone skin and I believe due to some of the ingredients such as the shea butter, and almond milk it made my face worse immediately. I&#x27;m actually glad it happened so suddenly because I stopped using the products before it got really bad. I really do think these ingredients are too thick in consistency. they give you the option to dilute with water however I feel as though the face wash did not lather therefore you had to use more and if you wear make up extra. I think for oily acne skin a foaming face wash followed with a moisturizer that&#x27;s very light would be best. The mask did seem to help but the moisturizer was definitely way too creamy and thick for my oily acne prone skin. The serum seemed to be too strong, I have dark olive skin and it caused a little hyper pigmentation. I think oily acne prone skin needs light ingredients that are easily absorbed into the pores. I went back to using Caudalie face wash and vino perfect serum. I hope this post helps any acne prone person. I do stand behind using natural ingredients but unfortunately this line broke me out immediately.</li>
