            <li>Love the Aveeno products!</li>
            <li>The package looks great and is filled with baby bath wash, baby lotion, &amp; baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>I liked it because it came in a basket rather than a plastic tub.</li>
            <li>However the body wash for mom is nice.</li>
            <li>The set also comes with a nice presentation.</li>
            <li>It is nice that the company thought of the mother as well.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>It looks nice</li>
            <li>It made a nice variety of products for the mother-to-be.</li>
            <li>These products are lightly scented, but pleasantly so.</li>

            <li>and they have worked wonderfully for my children&#x27;s sensitive skin!</li>

            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>The basket is cute.</li>
            <li>Three more words.</li>
            <li>Great price and Aveeno products have been very good for our little boy with eczema!</li>
            <li>great starter gift set for a new baby!</li>
            <li>This is a very effective combination of care products a new mom needs.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered this gift set, it was $11.19 with free prime shipping.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see free prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Baby does not seem to mind the shampoo and the scent is very light and pleasant, however for all the nervous moms out there who want to prepare (like I did): you will do just fine with the single Baby wash and shampoo and do not need this set!</li>
            <li>The next time to continue shopping, hope that the business is getting better and better!</li>
            <li>bottles are good sized products, you might get them individually for around $6-8 so taking that into consideration</li>
            <li>Overall still good  </li>
            <li>really sweet gift for any occasion with couples with baby and</li>
            <li>Very suitable for my daughter to use  But be careful when baby bath slipped  </li>
            <li>baby - right next to the bath tub to keep everything organized and handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most useful items in this are the shampoo/wash and daily lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this was my first prime shipping item to arrive in 3 days (instead of two), but I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>The calming comfort bath also seems a bit more moisturizing for baby than the shampoo/wash, so it is also nice if baby&#x27;s skin is a little dry.</li>
            <li>It leaves our babys skin so soft!</li>
            <li>No harsh smells</li>
            <li>no problem so far......</li>
            <li>the products seemed great so don&#x27;t hesitate to get thios u won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>

            <li> I was scheduled to receive this order by the 12th and incredibly it arrived on the 7th (USPS Sunday delivery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are good sized products, you might get them individually for around $6-8 so taking that into consideration I guess you get a good deal.  The body wash for mom is the biggest bottle of all and the caddy I guess it is a plus but not necessarily a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try this product as baby wont be here util next year.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for the mommy-to-be.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal if you want to buy a product to ship to someone. I liked it because it came in a basket rather than a plastic tub. The basket can definitely be used for storage of all those little baby things!</li>
            <li> great starter gift set for a new baby! Got it for someone at work, which is nice because everything comes prepackaged and easy to give</li>
            <li> Great price and Aveeno products have been very good for our little boy with eczema!</li>
            <li> Very nice and light scent, not too strong. My lil one enjoys it, and the lavendar is great for a bed bath</li>
            <li> I ordered this last week for a baby shower. I have used Aveeno products for both my little ones and wanted to share this with the mom-to-be. When I ordered this gift set, it was $11.19 with free prime shipping. What a steal for 4 full-sized products. Any one of these products usually average about $6 at other stores. So, this is a great deal. I did notice that the price has gone up by several dollars and I don&#x27;t see free prime shipping. At $11.19, this is an awesome deal. I wouldn&#x27;t pay $15.84 + $5.99 shipping for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most useful items in this are the shampoo/wash and daily lotion. However the body wash for mom is nice. The calming comfort bath also seems a bit more moisturizing for baby than the shampoo/wash, so it is also nice if baby&#x27;s skin is a little dry. These products are lightly scented, but pleasantly so. Not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this was my first prime shipping item to arrive in 3 days (instead of two), but I&#x27;m will review that in the shipping/packing ratings not here.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as described.  It smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was also very pretty and would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> My baby and me fell in love with Aveeno baby products. excellent set.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister in law as a gift for our newborn nephew and she loved it. She hasn not used it yet but Aveeno has a reputation for good quality products, and she was very happy about the variety. The set also comes with a nice presentation.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what I needed to bathe a baby and ordered this set thinking it would give me the basics. I was very wrong. The only thing my baby needs is a baby bath wash/shampoo (included in this set), everything else will just sit in the basket for a long time unless the adults in the home use them. I do like the basket and use it to store bath necessities - wash clothes, THE soap, thermometer and tiny cup to pour water over baby - right next to the bath tub to keep everything organized and handy. Baby does not seem to mind the shampoo and the scent is very light and pleasant, however for all the nervous moms out there who want to prepare (like I did): you will do just fine with the single Baby wash and shampoo and do not need this set!</li>
            <li> Like all Aveeno products: Great. This is a very effective combination of care products a new mom needs.  NO worries</li>
            <li> I like aveeno for my family. I&#x27;ve been using for years. This is good stuff and makes a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Very suitable for my daughter to use  But be careful when baby bath slipped  Overall still good  thans aveeno baby</li>
            <li> Love the Aveeno products! No harsh smells and they have worked wonderfully for my children&#x27;s sensitive skin!</li>
