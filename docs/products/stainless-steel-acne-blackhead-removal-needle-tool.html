            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Lady&#x27;s stock up on these utensils they are amazing</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING, it saved a life.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for all kinds of pores, but it is certainly effective for those it does work for.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>well,it is nice for me.i guss</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best at getting out whiteheads and blackheads.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>works nicely ;////////;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weight is nice and the shape is like a pencil.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice perforated grip that makes handling this tool a breeze.  </li>
            <li>It works great and was very affordable!!!  </li>
            <li>This is a great extractor for the price and the lance is very useful as well.</li>
            <li>Great pricing and fairly quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the money but not as effective with removing blackheads.</li>
            <li>By far the best extractor tool if you know how to use it!</li>
            <li>I love it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and can be cleaned and sanitized!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use this tool to keep your skin clean.</li>
            <li>LOOKS VERY CHEAP MATERIAL.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fine tip, but there was a burr on it.  </li>
            <li>but when you have a huge pimple but NO PAIN NO GAIN!</li>
            <li>however another interesting tool/gadget to have for one day if i need it.</li>
            <li>These may be OK</li>
            <li>I prefer the one sturdy piece in this kit better:</li>
            <li>When I use it for pimples, it just makes them look even more infected and as for blackheads on my nose...</li>
            <li>should have ordered more.</li>
            <li>But takes more than a month to receive the package.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad it came with a cover.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t agree more, I ordered three( one for my niece, sister-in-law, and myself).</li>
            <li>It is satisfying to get blackheads out</li>
            <li>I give my boyfriend facial and this tool is great!</li>
            <li>It also took more than 1 month to arrive.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it would be more like the comedome loop used by dermatologist, but loop</li>
            <li>Ok for millia</li>
            <li>Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Best facial tool ive bought!!!</li>
            <li>Never pop or squeeze pustules, or you will end up with many scars all over your face</li>
            <li>I love this tool for blackheads and whiteheads both.</li>
            <li>and they disnt leave any scars when I used them, but be sure you watch a couple videos on how to use them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better ones but this one is okay.</li>
            <li>I wish it came with a case or a better tip cover.</li>
            <li>Ive been able to remove ones that nothing else could.</li>
            <li>Tried it one time and was satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>Quit touching your face, wash your face....</li>
            <li>I just love the needle part of the tool...</li>
            <li>Eh...does more damage than help.</li>
            <li>Gets stuff out ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend DIY ravaging your pores.</li>
            <li>Plus, why dig at your skin when there are those adorable silicone things to rub it with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay anything for this because I have yet to get it to do what it&#x27;s suppose to yet....</li>
            <li>I find a hairpin extracts blackheads better with out bruising.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>However, it works ok.  </li>
            <li>Better than any you get in the store.  </li>
            <li>I also recommend buying more than one because if you&#x27;re one of those Girls who likes to let your friends or family know the latest and greatest beauty tool you got, you&#x27;ll have extra on hand to share.  </li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>side could be on a better angle for ease of use.</li>
            <li>Love this tool.</li>
            <li>- probably works  great for people  with real problems.</li>
            <li>(I will use them to glue on reborn eyelashes before I get to the point of hand rooting them :)</li>
            <li>I bought two more bcuz its durable</li>
            <li>I bought the Cover Girl one for 4.99 and it did a better job.</li>
            <li>and I you tube how to use it many times.</li>
            <li>I thought it would work better than my fingers</li>
            <li>Love using it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the most I can tell you, it looks like its shown, cleaning person threw away before I had a chance to use it.</li>
            <li>After I tested the item I ordered 30 more.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, Great item for the price</li>
            <li>It does the job of removing blackheads but those must have been loosened by facial cremes and gels beforehand for best results.</li>
            <li>and it is MUCH better quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest washing your face before and after using this tool and make sure to clean the tool as often as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love and recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it is easy and quick good buy</li>
            <li>Pretty good tool for the price.</li>
            <li>Pretty good item.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get an acne removal tool that sort has more of a loop on the tip that starts out wide and comes to a pinch, whereas this one is like a perfect circle on the end.</li>
            <li>Very interesting and effective in removing blackheads aslo good at other things pokeing people and moving gems around</li>
            <li>Feather light and precise ends!</li>
            <li>It works really good and the pointed tip part really goes through the pimple and skin without any problems.</li>
            <li>I have not used it on black heads yet, but I will make sure to use it after showering because that&#x27;s when it works best.</li>
            <li>Very handy tool for those who can&#x27;t resist popping pimples such as I. Very easy to use and pimples come out easily.</li>
            <li>Well made tool - just don&#x27;t think I have the right kind of blackheads</li>
            <li>Other than the size of the tool it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>Its sharp as hell, but it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The circle end is easy to see through and sturdy, if it&#x27;s pushed with force it doesn&#x27;t bend.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep things clean with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Makes getting ingrown hairs and popping pimples easy.</li>
            <li>Also easy to use.</li>
            <li>, it works great, I absolutely love it, especially the price!</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It is ok, and for this price not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Works fine, long shipping time but good to own.</li>
            <li>Super helpful!</li>
            <li>that is fine since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>Super sharp needle point is what I wanted and this company delivered it in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>i dont have that kind of acne, to really use it.</li>
            <li>But you guys sell it so cheap and free shipping ,I couldn&#x27;t let it go.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool to have to get the puss out of pimples without actually popping them which causes irritation.</li>
            <li>Made from cheap materials</li>
            <li>This tool works great unlike the 15.00 set I bought with several tools in it.</li>
            <li>she is the only rabbit that they are keeping and are giving the rest away to great homes.</li>
            <li>Its practically for free.</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>I bought it cheap to try it out and regret doing so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I was worried that it was going to be made out of cheap metal, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>The loop end doesn&#x27;t bend or budge like I thought it might if it had been made cheaply.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t settle for cheap and bendable aluminum knockoffs or something like a safety pin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>to clean and shipping was quick &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>The tip is sharp and the loop end helps, but isn&#x27;t very good for blackheads.</li>
            <li>I just find this to be very useful.</li>
            <li>Very effective for my teen.</li>
            <li>Very useful for poking, prodding, pulling and extracting things that might be caught in the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was able to remove many blackheads that I could not extract by normal means.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s stainless steel its very easy to clean and sterilize before and after each use.</li>
            <li>I was worried about it being to small based on the photo, but its perfect.</li>
            <li>I wrote my original review at 3:00 am my time  </li>
            <li>It came quickly and was packaged thoughtfully all the way from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>Definitely clean it with alcohol before and after every use.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a really good and rather cheap acne tool.</li>
            <li>Cheap but useful.</li>
            <li>cool cool cool cool</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying a better one if you really want to try a tool like this.</li>
            <li>(at least in this case)&lt;br /&gt;stay beautiful!</li>
            <li>Not bad at all,</li>
            <li>Great product, it&#x27;s strong and gets every black head you have!</li>
            <li>but it gets the job done for its price, and the sharp point is super pointy and great for poking and prodding.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly and is no joke.</li>
            <li>Very helpful works great especially helps from leaving and damaging marks on skin that we get When we do it with our hands</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a tip at the edge that enables you to pull at the very top of your blackheads which opens it for the other edge to easily pull it out, it really helps with the Marks, smooth and easy</li>
            <li>This works really well and leaves my skin super clean!  </li>
            <li>I gave this a high rating because this tool prevents you from using your fingers which can cause even more redness, irritation, and contamination.</li>
            <li>It works better then the high priced ones.</li>
            <li>product is OK main problem I have is the very tip of it bends and breaks to easily</li>
            <li>item was sharp, and had its own plastic container to keep it safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase, especially for the price, not to mention it works.</li>
            <li>Works great.  Extremely sharp!</li>
            <li>It works great to get out black heads etc.</li>
            <li>Can easily break through skin with too much pressure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for this tool at first but because it was so cheap with free shipping, bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>Easy to sanitize, and much better on your skin than constant pinching/scraping to get rid of zits and blackheads.</li>
            <li>Good product, took a very long time to get to me!</li>
            <li>Great little tool.</li>
            <li>The tip is bent and really, the quality feels so cheap that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it if the tip wasn&#x27;t bent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing especialy for the price totally recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend you get one if you havent tried one they are amazing.</li>
            <li>So cheap, I threw it straight in the trash.  </li>
            <li>not as useful as I thought.</li>
            <li>and it was worth the longer wait for the price that it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it was hella worth</li>
            <li>I bought this because my friends suggest this product to me, this is a useful product.cool</li>
            <li>Shipping takes a while so be patient totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>Effective in lancing pimplesand removing white heads.</li>
            <li>Really useful for taking care of acne and blackhead.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the wait nor the couple dollars.</li>
            <li>it is so useful to remove blackheads when we cant go to a parlor.</li>
            <li>It took a while for me to receive it in the mail (about 2 weeks) but it was so worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Minimal scarring with good accuracy.</li>
            <li>But since it was like a dollar, i thought it might be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Oh, I&#x27;m not using it right?  </li>
            <li>Is exactly what I expected, arrived on time and is good quality.</li>
            <li>Top pinpoint not sharp.</li>
            <li>Great little tool and does what it suppose to do and very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Clears things up quick without chemicals or much pain.</li>
            <li>I found one at a flea market for a few dollars more with a thicker circle and works much better</li>
            <li>Great tool much more accurate than any other product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>This tool works great for sebaceous filaments and blackheads in hard to reach areas like the nose and chin folds.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is not well made.</li>
            <li>think the end that opens pimples looks like it would be better than the one that opens pimples in the above mentioned case</li>
            <li>Make sure you do your research on how to properly use this tool before you try it out!</li>
            <li>With regular use my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Be gentle!</li>
            <li>This was my saving grace really!</li>
            <li>Will keep it because it would cost more to send it back than to keep it.</li>
            <li>Though shipped from oversea, it was still fast!</li>
            <li>first one bent-sent me a replacement.</li>
            <li>The shipping was slow but for the price it&#x27;s still a great deal.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more at a later date!</li>
            <li>You get what you see, I was spectical and first ordered 1.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t exactly pierce your skin</li>
            <li>this little tool is sharp and works great on most blackheads.</li>
            <li>Works really well on skin right after cleansing.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice sleeve and a cap for the sharp end.</li>
            <li>works pretty good, but I wish it was longer for the middle of my back.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t work as well as the flat looped end ones, but it works ok.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also good for various crafty things requiring a tight point</li>
            <li>I recommend, as others have, use this tool after a shower or hot compress, otherwise you can do as much damage to your skin with this tool as you would with your fingernails.</li>
            <li>But you will be happy to know, the rabbit is back to her old self, spry and happier than she has actually been in two years!</li>
            <li>Product is okay, however shipping took way to long.</li>
            <li>Very Sharp and wonderfully effective</li>
            <li>It helps me a lot  especially in my nose,  it remove blackhead easily after washer.</li>
            <li>When I used it it only wired with a great amount of pressure I was let down</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, took forever to arrive and the top round portion slips out if not careful.</li>
            <li>It has an extremely fine (needle-nose) point to open the pore.</li>
            <li>in stainless steal can be easly cleaned works great wont rust and gray in color does remove pimples and white heads and black heads</li>
            <li>This little tool is amazing.</li>
            <li>Handy little tool for blackhead removal.</li>
            <li>This, along with the facial sauna I purchased, has really helped to keep my skin bump free.</li>
            <li>Wow--this really gets the job done--just like the professionals.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>The cape side is really nice.for</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t popped my zits, I wouldn&#x27;t have so much scarring on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>didnt really know how to use it</li>
            <li>I probably use it way too much.</li>
            <li>It really helps a lot in cleaning blackhead.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I was mostly just curious and took a chance on it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful at all times..</li>
            <li>Since it was sent overseas and so cheap I&#x27;ve decided not to bother sending it back.</li>
            <li>The quality is very crappy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe it really works.</li>
            <li>I was able to not just use the needle end but the extraction all of which ended up actually helped me get into the wounds and clear out infection.</li>
            <li>i think the sharp tip wouldnt be good for blackheads as it actually opens the hole in your face..</li>
            <li>pretty useful tool for my large pored facial skin.</li>
            <li>This thing has worked better than any other tool I have owned.  </li>
            <li>For this reason, and because it will take time for your pierced skin to heal, the other option is better.</li>
            <li>The tool is pretty sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not worth the wait nor the money, even if it was very cheap.</li>
            <li>The one that arrived ( at last ) has a burr on the pointed end so that it catches anything when you try to clean it.</li>
            <li>I mean, it is incredibly cheap and I&#x27;m sure the more expensive, quality ones work better.</li>
            <li>Came super fast, and does the job of removing black heads super fast.</li>
            <li>The pointy end really helps remove the top layer of the black head (also known as a clog).</li>
            <li>OKAY ITEM, JUST HURTS WHEN PUSHING DOWN ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li>The point is great and very sharp, but the other end doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>The acne blackhead remover works great, especially for those hard to reach places and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I mostly wanted something to remove black heads on my nose when I get them.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of the tool is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Be careful on softer more sensitive skin because the loop can damage skin</li>
            <li>Does a decent job for removing blackheads after steam.</li>
            <li>It might sound gross to you but this thing is super handy for getting out black heads in the little crevices around your nose.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this to begin with.</li>
            <li>Does the job, and comes in a little sleeve for safe keeping.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 if it had something a little more protective to cover that &amp;#34;needle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be easy to get rid of my pimples but the point is so sharp</li>
            <li>Looped end did not bend and because it&#x27;s stainless steel, no rust has developed after cleaning.</li>
            <li>Worth buying, especially for the price and shipping.</li>
            <li>I find that using a pair of tweezers works just as well, but for the low price it was still worth trying.</li>
            <li>it more just scratches it and ends up irritating your skin more than necessary</li>
            <li>Looks simple right?</li>
            <li>This summer her owners have decided, even though they are getting out of the meat rabbit business until they get into their new house</li>
            <li>For more stubborn/imbedded blackheads, it may take several tries.   </li>
            <li>I love this little guy!</li>
            <li>purchased this after watching numerous videos on Youtube of blackhead extractions and though they were very successful with it, I was unhappy with my results.  </li>
            <li>When I first got this thing I tore my face up and woke up in the morning not wanting to go anywhere because I had red marks all over my face</li>
            <li>another side is big enough for big acne and easily to squeeze out.</li>
            <li>it goes right into the black head and the client doesn&#x27;t feel much at all....</li>
            <li>This works well, as long as you clean your face beforehand and steam it to open your pores.</li>
            <li>To clean, just wipe down with alcohol.</li>
            <li>Im giving this item a five star because as gross as it sounds i was able to remove the blackheads my little brother had in his ear.</li>
            <li>The blemishes are easier to poke at and clear with this tool.</li>
            <li>the picture does make the needle look A LOT larger than it really is..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it because the pointed end was not pointy enough.</li>
            <li>Got here within the timeframe, though I wouldn&#x27;t say it got here early at all.</li>
            <li>I like that the needle is a continuation of the barrel as opposed to my old one where the needle was kinda just placed in there.</li>
            <li>Surprised that it&#x27;s sent form China.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry to see it&#x27;s coming direct from China.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>My guess is it really doesn&#x27;t matter who you get them from, they should all be about the same.</li>
            <li>When I received the product the tip was nearly bent off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and the quality is better.</li>
            <li>But it really takes a long time to arrive...</li>
            <li>You have to be pretty careful, though, and don&#x27;t forget to sanitize.</li>
            <li>But be careful when I first tried this one I applied some pressure</li>
            <li>but I personally like the other more expensive version better.</li>
            <li>Gently washing with a regular facial cleanser is about all you can do besides seeing a doctor.</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin that turns really red when we to pop pimples and get rid of blackheads, but this helps a lot.</li>
            <li>it is a little useful.</li>
            <li>But what surprised me is that it was mailed from Chinese.</li>
            <li>It really helps get all the dead skin and oils off the nose and make sure there is no more gunk left in a whitehead.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little tool for blackhead removal, and not easy to find!</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the tool and it came in very handy while I was treating a friend of mines dearest rabbit for some horrible infections that I needed to keep open and kept closing on me.  </li>
            <li>It allows you to reach the black heads and extract them pretty well.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use what I always have, a sharp needle that is stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Also, the pointed end is incredibly sharp and that is also really helpful.</li>
            <li>Not painful, and if done correctly, barely a mark (don&#x27;t press too hard).</li>
            <li>and I enjoy this little tool and help each other out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad it works, but not for that hard to get acne.</li>
            <li>and it left my nose red and left a clear imprint.</li>
            <li>very nice except end of the pointed side is kind of hooked bc of bad cutting in the factory.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a very sharp lancet like tool that could prick the skin, I don&#x27;t think I could do that with this without really jabbing myself.</li>
            <li>The pin side is not sharp and delevering time took tooooooo long.</li>

            <li> Lady&#x27;s stock up on these utensils they are amazing</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING, it saved a life.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for all kinds of pores, but it is certainly effective for those it does work for.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> well,it is nice for me.i guss</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best at getting out whiteheads and blackheads.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> works nicely ;////////;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weight is nice and the shape is like a pencil.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice perforated grip that makes handling this tool a breeze.  </li>
            <li> It works great and was very affordable!!!  </li>
            <li> This is a great extractor for the price and the lance is very useful as well.</li>
            <li> Great pricing and fairly quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the money but not as effective with removing blackheads.</li>
            <li> By far the best extractor tool if you know how to use it!</li>
            <li> I love it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and can be cleaned and sanitized!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use this tool to keep your skin clean.</li>
            <li> LOOKS VERY CHEAP MATERIAL.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fine tip, but there was a burr on it.  </li>
            <li> but when you have a huge pimple but NO PAIN NO GAIN!</li>
            <li> however another interesting tool/gadget to have for one day if i need it.</li>
            <li> These may be OK</li>
            <li> I prefer the one sturdy piece in this kit better:</li>
            <li> When I use it for pimples, it just makes them look even more infected and as for blackheads on my nose...</li>
            <li> should have ordered more.</li>
            <li> But takes more than a month to receive the package.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad it came with a cover.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t agree more, I ordered three( one for my niece, sister-in-law, and myself).</li>
            <li> It is satisfying to get blackheads out</li>
            <li> I give my boyfriend facial and this tool is great!</li>
            <li> It also took more than 1 month to arrive.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it would be more like the comedome loop used by dermatologist, but loop</li>
            <li> Ok for millia</li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Best facial tool ive bought!!!</li>
            <li> Never pop or squeeze pustules, or you will end up with many scars all over your face</li>
            <li> I love this tool for blackheads and whiteheads both.</li>
            <li> and they disnt leave any scars when I used them, but be sure you watch a couple videos on how to use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better ones but this one is okay.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a case or a better tip cover.</li>
            <li> Ive been able to remove ones that nothing else could.</li>
            <li> Tried it one time and was satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> Quit touching your face, wash your face....</li>
            <li> I just love the needle part of the tool...</li>
            <li> Eh...does more damage than help.</li>
            <li> Gets stuff out ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend DIY ravaging your pores.</li>
            <li> Plus, why dig at your skin when there are those adorable silicone things to rub it with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay anything for this because I have yet to get it to do what it&#x27;s suppose to yet....</li>
            <li> I find a hairpin extracts blackheads better with out bruising.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> However, it works ok.  </li>
            <li> Better than any you get in the store.  </li>
            <li> I also recommend buying more than one because if you&#x27;re one of those Girls who likes to let your friends or family know the latest and greatest beauty tool you got, you&#x27;ll have extra on hand to share.  </li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> side could be on a better angle for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Love this tool.</li>
            <li> - probably works  great for people  with real problems.</li>
            <li> (I will use them to glue on reborn eyelashes before I get to the point of hand rooting them :)</li>
            <li> I bought two more bcuz its durable</li>
            <li> I bought the Cover Girl one for 4.99 and it did a better job.</li>
            <li> and I you tube how to use it many times.</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s the most I can tell you, it looks like its shown, cleaning person threw away before I had a chance to use it.</li>
            <li> After I tested the item I ordered 30 more.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Great item for the price</li>
            <li> It does the job of removing blackheads but those must have been loosened by facial cremes and gels beforehand for best results.</li>
            <li> and it is MUCH better quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest washing your face before and after using this tool and make sure to clean the tool as often as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love and recommend this product!</li>

            <li> Pretty good item.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get an acne removal tool that sort has more of a loop on the tip that starts out wide and comes to a pinch, whereas this one is like a perfect circle on the end.</li>
            <li> Very interesting and effective in removing blackheads aslo good at other things pokeing people and moving gems around</li>
            <li> Feather light and precise ends!</li>
            <li> It works really good and the pointed tip part really goes through the pimple and skin without any problems.</li>
            <li> I have not used it on black heads yet, but I will make sure to use it after showering because that&#x27;s when it works best.</li>
            <li> Very handy tool for those who can&#x27;t resist popping pimples such as I. Very easy to use and pimples come out easily.</li>
            <li> Well made tool - just don&#x27;t think I have the right kind of blackheads</li>
            <li> Other than the size of the tool it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Its sharp as hell, but it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> The circle end is easy to see through and sturdy, if it&#x27;s pushed with force it doesn&#x27;t bend.  </li>

            <li> , it works great, I absolutely love it, especially the price!</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It is ok, and for this price not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Works fine, long shipping time but good to own.</li>
            <li> Super helpful!</li>
            <li> that is fine since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Super sharp needle point is what I wanted and this company delivered it in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> i dont have that kind of acne, to really use it.</li>
            <li> But you guys sell it so cheap and free shipping ,I couldn&#x27;t let it go.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to have to get the puss out of pimples without actually popping them which causes irritation.</li>
            <li> Made from cheap materials</li>
            <li> This tool works great unlike the 15.00 set I bought with several tools in it.</li>
            <li> she is the only rabbit that they are keeping and are giving the rest away to great homes.</li>
            <li> Its practically for free.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> I bought it cheap to try it out and regret doing so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> I was worried that it was going to be made out of cheap metal, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> The loop end doesn&#x27;t bend or budge like I thought it might if it had been made cheaply.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t settle for cheap and bendable aluminum knockoffs or something like a safety pin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> to clean and shipping was quick &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> The tip is sharp and the loop end helps, but isn&#x27;t very good for blackheads.</li>
            <li> I just find this to be very useful.</li>
            <li> Very effective for my teen.</li>
            <li> Very useful for poking, prodding, pulling and extracting things that might be caught in the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was able to remove many blackheads that I could not extract by normal means.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s stainless steel its very easy to clean and sterilize before and after each use.</li>
            <li> I was worried about it being to small based on the photo, but its perfect.</li>
            <li> I wrote my original review at 3:00 am my time  </li>
            <li> It came quickly and was packaged thoughtfully all the way from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Definitely clean it with alcohol before and after every use.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a really good and rather cheap acne tool.</li>
            <li> Cheap but useful.</li>
            <li> cool cool cool cool</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying a better one if you really want to try a tool like this.</li>
            <li> (at least in this case)&lt;br /&gt;stay beautiful!</li>
            <li> Not bad at all,</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s strong and gets every black head you have!</li>
            <li> but it gets the job done for its price, and the sharp point is super pointy and great for poking and prodding.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly and is no joke.</li>
            <li> Very helpful works great especially helps from leaving and damaging marks on skin that we get When we do it with our hands</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a tip at the edge that enables you to pull at the very top of your blackheads which opens it for the other edge to easily pull it out, it really helps with the Marks, smooth and easy</li>
            <li> This works really well and leaves my skin super clean!  </li>
            <li> I gave this a high rating because this tool prevents you from using your fingers which can cause even more redness, irritation, and contamination.</li>
            <li> It works better then the high priced ones.</li>
            <li> product is OK main problem I have is the very tip of it bends and breaks to easily</li>
            <li> item was sharp, and had its own plastic container to keep it safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase, especially for the price, not to mention it works.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Extremely sharp!</li>
            <li> It works great to get out black heads etc.</li>
            <li> Can easily break through skin with too much pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this tool at first but because it was so cheap with free shipping, bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> Easy to sanitize, and much better on your skin than constant pinching/scraping to get rid of zits and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Good product, took a very long time to get to me!</li>
            <li> Great little tool.</li>
            <li> The tip is bent and really, the quality feels so cheap that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it if the tip wasn&#x27;t bent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing especialy for the price totally recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend you get one if you havent tried one they are amazing.</li>
            <li> So cheap, I threw it straight in the trash.  </li>
            <li> not as useful as I thought.</li>
            <li> and it was worth the longer wait for the price that it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it was hella worth</li>
            <li> I bought this because my friends suggest this product to me, this is a useful product.cool</li>
            <li> Shipping takes a while so be patient totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> Effective in lancing pimplesand removing white heads.</li>
            <li> Really useful for taking care of acne and blackhead.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the wait nor the couple dollars.</li>
            <li> it is so useful to remove blackheads when we cant go to a parlor.</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to receive it in the mail (about 2 weeks) but it was so worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Minimal scarring with good accuracy.</li>
            <li> But since it was like a dollar, i thought it might be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Oh, I&#x27;m not using it right?  </li>
            <li> Is exactly what I expected, arrived on time and is good quality.</li>
            <li> Top pinpoint not sharp.</li>
            <li> Great little tool and does what it suppose to do and very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Clears things up quick without chemicals or much pain.</li>
            <li> I found one at a flea market for a few dollars more with a thicker circle and works much better</li>
            <li> Great tool much more accurate than any other product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This tool works great for sebaceous filaments and blackheads in hard to reach areas like the nose and chin folds.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is not well made.</li>
            <li> think the end that opens pimples looks like it would be better than the one that opens pimples in the above mentioned case</li>
            <li> Make sure you do your research on how to properly use this tool before you try it out!</li>
            <li> With regular use my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Be gentle!</li>
            <li> This was my saving grace really!</li>
            <li> Will keep it because it would cost more to send it back than to keep it.</li>
            <li> Though shipped from oversea, it was still fast!</li>
            <li> first one bent-sent me a replacement.</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow but for the price it&#x27;s still a great deal.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more at a later date!</li>
            <li> You get what you see, I was spectical and first ordered 1.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t exactly pierce your skin</li>
            <li> this little tool is sharp and works great on most blackheads.</li>
            <li> Works really well on skin right after cleansing.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice sleeve and a cap for the sharp end.</li>
            <li> works pretty good, but I wish it was longer for the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t work as well as the flat looped end ones, but it works ok.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also good for various crafty things requiring a tight point</li>
            <li> I recommend, as others have, use this tool after a shower or hot compress, otherwise you can do as much damage to your skin with this tool as you would with your fingernails.</li>
            <li> But you will be happy to know, the rabbit is back to her old self, spry and happier than she has actually been in two years!</li>
            <li> Product is okay, however shipping took way to long.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp and wonderfully effective</li>
            <li> It helps me a lot  especially in my nose,  it remove blackhead easily after washer.</li>
            <li> When I used it it only wired with a great amount of pressure I was let down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, took forever to arrive and the top round portion slips out if not careful.</li>
            <li> It has an extremely fine (needle-nose) point to open the pore.</li>
            <li> in stainless steal can be easly cleaned works great wont rust and gray in color does remove pimples and white heads and black heads</li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing.</li>
            <li> Handy little tool for blackhead removal.</li>
            <li> This, along with the facial sauna I purchased, has really helped to keep my skin bump free.</li>
            <li> Wow--this really gets the job done--just like the professionals.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> The cape side is really nice.for</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t popped my zits, I wouldn&#x27;t have so much scarring on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> didnt really know how to use it</li>
            <li> I probably use it way too much.</li>
            <li> It really helps a lot in cleaning blackhead.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I was mostly just curious and took a chance on it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful at all times..</li>
            <li> Since it was sent overseas and so cheap I&#x27;ve decided not to bother sending it back.</li>
            <li> The quality is very crappy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it really works.</li>
            <li> I was able to not just use the needle end but the extraction all of which ended up actually helped me get into the wounds and clear out infection.</li>
            <li> i think the sharp tip wouldnt be good for blackheads as it actually opens the hole in your face..</li>
            <li> pretty useful tool for my large pored facial skin.</li>
            <li> This thing has worked better than any other tool I have owned.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, and because it will take time for your pierced skin to heal, the other option is better.</li>
            <li> The tool is pretty sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not worth the wait nor the money, even if it was very cheap.</li>
            <li> The one that arrived ( at last ) has a burr on the pointed end so that it catches anything when you try to clean it.</li>
            <li> I mean, it is incredibly cheap and I&#x27;m sure the more expensive, quality ones work better.</li>
            <li> Came super fast, and does the job of removing black heads super fast.</li>
            <li> The pointy end really helps remove the top layer of the black head (also known as a clog).</li>
            <li> OKAY ITEM, JUST HURTS WHEN PUSHING DOWN ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li> The point is great and very sharp, but the other end doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> The acne blackhead remover works great, especially for those hard to reach places and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I mostly wanted something to remove black heads on my nose when I get them.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of the tool is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful on softer more sensitive skin because the loop can damage skin</li>
            <li> Does a decent job for removing blackheads after steam.</li>
            <li> It might sound gross to you but this thing is super handy for getting out black heads in the little crevices around your nose.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this to begin with.</li>
            <li> Does the job, and comes in a little sleeve for safe keeping.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 if it had something a little more protective to cover that &amp;#34;needle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be easy to get rid of my pimples but the point is so sharp</li>
            <li> Looped end did not bend and because it&#x27;s stainless steel, no rust has developed after cleaning.</li>
            <li> Worth buying, especially for the price and shipping.</li>
            <li> I find that using a pair of tweezers works just as well, but for the low price it was still worth trying.</li>
            <li> it more just scratches it and ends up irritating your skin more than necessary</li>
            <li> Looks simple right?</li>
            <li> This summer her owners have decided, even though they are getting out of the meat rabbit business until they get into their new house</li>
            <li> For more stubborn/imbedded blackheads, it may take several tries.   </li>
            <li> I love this little guy!</li>
            <li> purchased this after watching numerous videos on Youtube of blackhead extractions and though they were very successful with it, I was unhappy with my results.  </li>
            <li> When I first got this thing I tore my face up and woke up in the morning not wanting to go anywhere because I had red marks all over my face</li>
            <li> another side is big enough for big acne and easily to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> it goes right into the black head and the client doesn&#x27;t feel much at all....</li>
            <li> This works well, as long as you clean your face beforehand and steam it to open your pores.</li>
            <li> To clean, just wipe down with alcohol.</li>
            <li> Im giving this item a five star because as gross as it sounds i was able to remove the blackheads my little brother had in his ear.</li>
            <li> The blemishes are easier to poke at and clear with this tool.</li>
            <li> the picture does make the needle look A LOT larger than it really is..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it because the pointed end was not pointy enough.</li>
            <li> Got here within the timeframe, though I wouldn&#x27;t say it got here early at all.</li>
            <li> I like that the needle is a continuation of the barrel as opposed to my old one where the needle was kinda just placed in there.</li>
            <li> Surprised that it&#x27;s sent form China.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry to see it&#x27;s coming direct from China.</li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> My guess is it really doesn&#x27;t matter who you get them from, they should all be about the same.</li>
            <li> When I received the product the tip was nearly bent off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and the quality is better.</li>
            <li> But it really takes a long time to arrive...</li>
            <li> You have to be pretty careful, though, and don&#x27;t forget to sanitize.</li>
            <li> But be careful when I first tried this one I applied some pressure</li>
            <li> but I personally like the other more expensive version better.</li>
            <li> Gently washing with a regular facial cleanser is about all you can do besides seeing a doctor.</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin that turns really red when we to pop pimples and get rid of blackheads, but this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> it is a little useful.</li>
            <li> But what surprised me is that it was mailed from Chinese.</li>
            <li> It really helps get all the dead skin and oils off the nose and make sure there is no more gunk left in a whitehead.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little tool for blackhead removal, and not easy to find!</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the tool and it came in very handy while I was treating a friend of mines dearest rabbit for some horrible infections that I needed to keep open and kept closing on me.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to reach the black heads and extract them pretty well.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use what I always have, a sharp needle that is stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Also, the pointed end is incredibly sharp and that is also really helpful.</li>
            <li> Not painful, and if done correctly, barely a mark (don&#x27;t press too hard).</li>
            <li> and I enjoy this little tool and help each other out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad it works, but not for that hard to get acne.</li>
            <li> and it left my nose red and left a clear imprint.</li>
            <li> very nice except end of the pointed side is kind of hooked bc of bad cutting in the factory.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a very sharp lancet like tool that could prick the skin, I don&#x27;t think I could do that with this without really jabbing myself.</li>
            <li> The pin side is not sharp and delevering time took tooooooo long.</li>
            <li> but come in a little plastic case (thin sleeve), and arrived pretty quickly considering they came from Hong Kong.  </li>
            <li> The tip that is supposed to be sharp is just the pointy end of the soft metal of the body.</li>
            <li> and it arrived within a week I live in CA for less than a dollar</li>
            <li> The needle part is pretty sharp so keep the little cover on.</li>
            <li> I have tried using this and the other, bowl type blackhead remover to very little success.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, the tip of it has rusted already, but the other side is good.</li>
            <li> Only the loop is STAINLESS STEEL, the other end is rough and plain metal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for blackhead removal and so far it has worked and the other end is extremely sharp..</li>
            <li> Took away one-star because of the long shipping.</li>
            <li> TOOK SO LONG TO ARRIVE</li>
            <li> Wash your face in warm water, if you have a larger pimple that hurts, just use the sharp end to pierce it, use the other end to extract the oil from the pimple or blackhead and rinse in cold water.</li>
            <li> it get all the white and black heads off the face and back.</li>
            <li> Hurts my nose since I&#x27;m no expert at this but later found other uses for this tool for the household.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a metal stick with a pointy end to pop pimples and such, and the ring at the other end helps &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; out the pus...</li>
            <li> The loop side is not sharp it leaves only a small mark.</li>
            <li> It can be painful to use to get all the yuck out but its so much better than getting a pimple over and over in the same spot.</li>
            <li> It helped so much in keeping the wounds open and providing a way to clean out the infections in a very very less painful way for her.</li>
            <li> because it was only a dollar and some change, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Takes a LONG time to receive but it is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The needle part i woukd only use o help a black head come out.</li>
            <li> It removed black head that I had been trying to remove for year from my back.</li>
            <li> I really have hard time w my black porus</li>
            <li> It only got a little out of my pores.</li>
            <li> However, I do recommend exercising extreme caution when using this tool as it is very sharp and capable of damaging delicate skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s INSANE), and great tool.</li>
            <li> It delivered as a empty package.</li>
            <li> Not much to do here.</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> can barely see it, but there is small hook on end of needle.</li>
            <li> be careful with that and don&#x27;t damage your skin.</li>
            <li> Therfore not really helpul.</li>
            <li> Be careful to check, or you may hurt yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> so be careful,</li>
            <li> Not stainless at all, it&#x27;s chrome plated.  </li>
            <li> This tool is not really a blackhead remover.</li>
            <li> It did come alot faster than I expected, considering that it came from China somewhere.</li>
            <li> I use the point to dig into them,and then you place the circle around the area and press and drag and usually,with one try,I can get them out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one just buy one at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> so i guess i should have expected something...</li>
            <li> I suppose it works well for larger blacheads, but I have several small ones and they did not come out at all with this, even when pressing hard enough to cause my skin to start to tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be really careful with the pointy part because it is SHARP.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> the pointy end is WAY Sharp, be careful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, but the pointy end isn&#x27;t that sharp.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you just need a sharp tip.</li>
            <li> It also has a plastic guard on the sharp pointed end to protect yourself when using the other side.</li>
            <li> the needle end is effin sharp</li>
            <li> THIS was such a pointless purchase.</li>
            <li> no THANKS!</li>
            <li> The sharp end is too wide....would never use on face.  </li>
            <li> Not at all what I had expected!</li>
            <li> The tip is really sharp.</li>
            <li> i used it as soon as I got it, one end is suuuper sharp, like a needle</li>
            <li> its safety hazard but the other end of  it which looks like a loop, did the job.</li>
            <li> The tool is both Sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li> , my niece took one and my son took the other.</li>
            <li> i like that the point is sharp and it does what its job..</li>
            <li> her in month of April 2014; I would buy from them again and due to their customer service, I am conformtable to do business with them on other products.</li>
            <li> and the other end HURTS</li>
            <li> I actually have this in my repair kit for small surgeries.  </li>
            <li> The tip is extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp on one end and shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> This is very sharp so if you&#x27;re careful you can&#x27;t even feel the poke.</li>
            <li> The end of the tool is very sharp so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> the round part hurts a bit more than a rectangular shaped ones, but not too bad for the price</li>
            <li> Is an easy product to use and isn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> , it works well squeezing whiteheads and the sharp end really is sharp!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for black heads or any other blemishes you may have.</li>
            <li> I wish the pointed end was straighter, it has a slight curve to it and it isn&#x27;t as sharp as I would like it.</li>
            <li> took over 45 days to get it, really not worth the wait</li>
            <li> IS JUST NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> This rabbit gets to experience the &amp;#34;free range&amp;#34; life this summer and will be breaded next spring for the first time since she was sick.</li>
            <li> It arrived just days before her owners were about to put her down even.</li>
            <li> I use it often and never lets me down.</li>
            <li> It did come with a little rubber cap for the EXTREMELY SHARP end, but it fell off as I took it out of the sleeve, never to be found.</li>
            <li> I get these little white hard specks in my chin and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp so keep it out of children&#x27;s reach.</li>
            <li> I have poked myself in the hand or finger with the sharp point a few times, while using the loop end.</li>
            <li> The needle end is very sharp but doesnt damage or scar you if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> The lance end is very very sharp.</li>
            <li> Its very small and and actually can damage my skin!!</li>
            <li> The needle end is very sharp and pointy</li>
            <li> The metal ring is thin and small enough for those areas, for larger areas like cheeks it didn&#x27;t work so well, but</li>
            <li> i recomend for all black head extraction</li>
            <li> It hurts less than what he was doing.</li>
            <li> When I previously reviewed this product I had not used it yet.</li>
            <li> Hence, less damage.</li>
            <li> this was a rip off, it helped huge pimples but not blackheads at all, all i was doing was stabbing at myself!</li>
            <li> Just be careful because it will damage your skin with excessive use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected.</li>
            <li> Should have made sharp end thin like a needle.&lt;br /&gt;The end with circle is also too big.</li>
            <li> I used the round part and pressed on to the black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit upset because now i have to wait for them to send me another one which I will have to wait longer.</li>
            <li> It took a while for the little thing to come in the mail.</li>
            <li> The other end, not sure what the point of it is, maybe to hang it up?</li>
            <li> The extraction loop end is way too small and sharp.</li>
            <li> not that sharp!!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all waste of money</li>
            <li> IT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> i attack my face everyday</li>
            <li> The tool needle side could be a bit sharper and the round hole ended</li>
            <li> What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago and have used it once or twice.</li>
            <li> this product was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> but the circle end broke off after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do watch out, is VERY sharp point!</li>
            <li> Not fine enogh tool to do the job.</li>
            <li> You will have to press down Hard and move across the skin in order for all the gunk to come out.</li>
            <li> First, it is very inconvenient and not useful in removing blackhead at all.</li>
            <li> but, I found them to be a little thin and harder to push on your skin without scraping it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little painful, but it does its job very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful and leaves a red circle instead of actually getting anything out of my skin.</li>
            <li> It can take off some skin leaving you with ugly scabs, but to avoid that be gentle and patient while using the tool.</li>
            <li> usually don&#x27;t complain about the product</li>
            <li> Use it as usual.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Aesthetician and this is truly a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small that I lost it.</li>
            <li> This item locally was 3x as expensive.</li>
            <li> The sharp point also damaged the thin plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li> Pretty worthless.</li>
            <li> And is quite helpful at getting those little hard balls out without a lot of bleeding!</li>
            <li> The thin metal loop just doesn&#x27;t have the surface area to push down and remove the blackhead or pimple as well.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time getting this to work.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing to use for my pimples that are hard to get.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to it you know how hard to push and how to hold it for maximum results...</li>
            <li> I use this tool to poke holes in hard objects like a belt needing an additional notch or to widen an existing hole in my incense holder.</li>
            <li> I use this tool at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do anything, least of all remove blackheads/whiteheads.</li>
            <li> and it so happened that my acne has improved, greatly, lately without it.  </li>
            <li> Custom service is slow.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!!</li>
            <li> And for only $1, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> But I mean you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The tool is sharp (as it should be), but it&#x27;s still scary looking in person, and I hope to never have to use it.</li>
            <li> The product is very small and doesn&#x27;t even remove any blackheads.</li>
            <li> but for stubborn pimples and nasty things, yeah it can be useful.</li>
            <li> Pointed end was not deburred nor smoothed out before polishing therefor not good for what it is supposed to be for.</li>
            <li> not a good idea.</li>
            <li> THE NEEEDLE PART OF THIS TOOL IS TOO DULL!  </li>
            <li> does what it says it does, just be careful with it because it is rather dangerous and not to mention painful if you press down too hard</li>
            <li> Metal is a bit weak.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disgusted the first time I used it and saw what my pores had been storing.</li>
            <li> (especially when this product cost me less then 5 dollars), but the quality disgusted me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I believe the pointed end is very dangerous, couldn&#x27;t believe such is allowed and</li>
            <li> THIS IS VERY THICK POINT</li>
            <li> it is really thin.</li>
            <li> Granted this was inexpensive, but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li> If you do forget, your face might get worse.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t take care of it dirt will get in and look worse than before.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expecting, the circle end is too thin and hurts to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those needles made my pimples worse.</li>
            <li> The loop is just to thin of wire and flimsy to work for me.</li>
            <li> Took some getting-used-to to learn how to use it, but its not as irritating to my skin as it would be had</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just scary looking</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so in expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry ...</li>
            <li> Because it gets all the nasty stuff plus doesn&#x27;t leave dark marks and by the way it does hurt someone time .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use it</li>
            <li> It leaves Nasty marks if you press to hard</li>
            <li> The loop works, but when the blackheads start scurrying around it is very difficult to stab them with pointy end.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible it made marks on my skin and the quality sucks.</li>
            <li> If you miss this chance then too bad for you</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, but can be a bit painful.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> It is VERY unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Will tear up your skin something awful!</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing that you can do for acne or pimples!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed! Feather light and precise ends!</li>
            <li> Good tool for blemishes. Took away one-star because of the long shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and works as intended.</li>
            <li> So glad I ordered this!  Wonderful tool for removing unwanted blemishes.  Easy to use, just remember to disinfect after use.</li>
            <li> for 2 bucks, i cant complain.. the picture does make the needle look A LOT larger than it really is.. i also dont see it for blackheads.. i would imagine you can pop pimples or get out stubborn junk with it.. i dont have that kind of acne, to really use it. however another interesting tool/gadget to have for one day if i need it. i think the sharp tip wouldnt be good for blackheads as it actually opens the hole in your face.. which you dont want, because you want your pores to look smaller.. but for stubborn pimples and nasty things, yeah it can be useful. took over a month for delivery though!</li>
            <li> THE NEEEDLE PART OF THIS TOOL IS TOO DULL!  I NEEDS TO BE ALOT SHARPER, BECAUSE AS IT IS, IT DAMAGES THE SKIN</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it because the pointed end was not pointy enough. Might as well use a sewing needle.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price!</li>
            <li> works as described.......</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It was inexpensive. Arrived quickly. Unfortunately, it is not well made. It works, but I can see it is not built for travel. Metal is a bit weak. Good to have in a pinch.</li>
            <li> These may be OK but, I found them to be a little thin and harder to push on your skin without scraping it. I prefer the one sturdy piece in this kit better: http://www.amazon.com/Blackhead-Blemish-Remover-Kit-Professional/dp/B00KP5TS4Y&lt;br /&gt;I think the end that opens pimples looks like it would be better than the one that opens pimples in the above mentioned case but, I haven&#x27;t used it. I mostly wanted something to remove black heads on my nose when I get them.</li>
            <li> pretty useful tool for my large pored facial skin.</li>
            <li> Its great. the circular end is he perfect size. I was worried about it being to small based on the photo, but its perfect. The pointy end really helps remove the top layer of the black head (also known as a clog).</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;needle&amp;#34; is a total joke - my sewing needles are sharper.</li>
            <li> Product came on time, packaged well and is as described by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest washing your face before and after using this tool and make sure to clean the tool as often as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love and recommend this product!</li>
            <li> ZERO STARS. I bought this because it was only a dollar and some change, it&#x27;s not worth it. The tip is bent and really, the quality feels so cheap that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it if the tip wasn&#x27;t bent. I do not recommend this acne needle.</li>
            <li> The tip has a piece of metal on it. The tool in unusable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad it works, but not for that hard to get acne. It leaves Nasty marks if you press to hard but it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this to work, and it seems it would damage you skin. I watched videos online and read about it before purchasing it, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> First, it is very inconvenient and not useful in removing blackhead at all. Second, it caused inflammation although I cleaned it with alcohol before and after. I don&#x27;t know if it is because of the bacteria or because it hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> not as useful as I thought.</li>
            <li> Wow--this really gets the job done--just like the professionals.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I recommend this for black heads or any other blemishes you may have. It works really well.</li>
            <li> When I use it for pimples, it just makes them look even more infected and as for blackheads on my nose... it&#x27;s easier to use my fingers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this thing works. No details, but it works. Took a while to get it though, you can probably find one at your local grocery store.</li>
            <li> Good purchase. should have ordered more.</li>
            <li> The loop works, but when the blackheads start scurrying around it is very difficult to stab them with pointy end.  Oh, I&#x27;m not using it right?  Oh, yours don&#x27;t move around once removed?</li>
            <li> Great price (some of these things are like $12!! That&#x27;s INSANE), and great tool. The pointy end scares me a bit, but it works great!</li>
            <li> it didnt work , how it was supposed to , i would not repurchase or suggest it to anyone , sorrry</li>
            <li> Good tool. Very durable. Excellent price. But takes more than a month to receive the package.</li>
            <li> I took off a star because I have no use for the pointy end. It&#x27;s just scary looking so I&#x27;m glad it came with a cover. I did want to complain why it was sent without any type of packaging, it was just the remover in the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use the loop end for anything or anywhere else than the blackheads on my nose but that&#x27;s what I bought it for. In that case, it does work as gunk continues to come out. If anyone was wondering, I go over my face with a toner afterwards and wipe the loop too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, but the pointy end isn&#x27;t that sharp. I recommend, as others have, use this tool after a shower or hot compress, otherwise you can do as much damage to your skin with this tool as you would with your fingernails.</li>
            <li> This is the business... it arrived quickly and is no joke. Great buy</li>
            <li> Great little tool. It&#x27;s very sharp so keep it out of children&#x27;s reach. Works really well on skin right after cleansing. Every girl needs this.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t agree more, I ordered three( one for my niece, sister-in-law, and myself). The metal is  a very sturdy, heavy metal. Would buy again, though this should last for quite some time !!!&lt;br /&gt;Do watch out, is VERY sharp point! When I received mine I thought, this must be the metal Wolverine&#x27;s claws are made of! lol&lt;br /&gt;Well made quality beauty tool, and a great price. Mine came  China post, ordered Dec. 17 2013, received Dec 29, 2013. two weeks ahead of estimated delivery. (JAN 14- JAN 30 was the estimate) impressed :-)</li>
            <li> This product does not cure acne (of course). It is satisfying to get blackheads out but they&#x27;ll always come back. There&#x27;s no cure for acne all you can do is try to manage your diet and skin oil level.</li>
            <li> Great for facials. Wish I would have found it sooner. I give my boyfriend facial and this tool is great! The blemishes are easier to poke at and clear with this tool.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!! very good product and is made quite well</li>
            <li> This thing is so pricy in the store. But you guys sell it so cheap and free shipping ,I couldn&#x27;t let it go.</li>
            <li> Great service and works great</li>
            <li> It delivered as a empty package. Nothing in the package.</li>
            <li> Low grade material. The point came as a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shaped needle. Not much to do here. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Pretty good tool for the price.</li>
            <li> This works well, as long as you clean your face beforehand and steam it to open your pores. Easy to sanitize, and much better on your skin than constant pinching/scraping to get rid of zits and blackheads. Make sure you do your research on how to properly use this tool before you try it out!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this. Only the loop is STAINLESS STEEL, the other end is rough and plain metal. I prefer to use what I always have, a sharp needle that is stainless steel. It also took more than 1 month to arrive. Not worth the wait nor the money, even if it was very cheap.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it would be more like the comedome loop used by dermatologist, but loop it is really thin. It&#x27;s okay for the money but not as effective with removing blackheads. It was delivered  timely.</li>
            <li> It works great and was very affordable!!!  I&#x27;m very impressed and thought it was great for the money!! yeah ye</li>
            <li> Very interesting and effective in removing blackheads aslo good at other things pokeing people and moving gems around cause im blinging out my keyboard</li>
            <li> product is OK main problem I have is the very tip of it bends and breaks to easily</li>
            <li> This is a great extractor for the price and the lance is very useful as well. It came quickly and was packaged thoughtfully all the way from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Will tear up your skin something awful!</li>
            <li> The tip of the needle is noticeably crooked and bent (up to the point that you cannot even call it a needle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t complain about the product (especially when this product cost me less then 5 dollars), but the quality disgusted me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess they don&#x27;t even look at the quality of the needle before they ship it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> What else can you say it does what it is supposed to do.  The product is mailed from Hong Kong so it takes a while to get to you.</li>
            <li> Got here within the timeframe, though I wouldn&#x27;t say it got here early at all. I like that the needle is a continuation of the barrel as opposed to my old one where the needle was kinda just placed in there. The latter situation leads to the needle to falling out and this one feels a lot sturdier.</li>
            <li> Granted this was inexpensive, but the quality is poor. The one that arrived ( at last ) has a burr on the pointed end so that it catches anything when you try to clean it. Never have bought anything like this, so I have no idea if this is what to expect.</li>
            <li> IT DOES THE JOB OF REMOVING WHITE HEADS WELL!!!</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time getting this to work. I will get the occasional blackhead out but its probably just user error.</li>
            <li> This item is really good.The cape side is really nice.for another side is big enough for big acne and easily to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> Received it under two weeks from China. I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of the tool is better than I expected. Does the job.</li>
            <li> product worked just as described . and it was worth the longer wait for the price that it was. i would definitely order fronm this seller again.</li>
            <li> extracts it like an ice cream scooper. way bettr.</li>
            <li> Only gave two stars because this thing hurts like hell maybe i just dont know how to use it.., but i try not to because it hurts</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I expected, arrived on time and is good quality. It is also a good length making it easy-to-use.</li>
            <li> this little tool is sharp and works great on most blackheads. Be careful on softer more sensitive skin because the loop can damage skin</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to have to get the puss out of pimples without actually popping them which causes irritation.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these but only one arrived and I was charged for 2. The tool is pretty sharp and easy to use. I&#x27;m a little bit upset because now i have to wait for them to send me another one which I will have to wait longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing especialy for the price totally recommend it to anyone! It took a while for the little thing to come in the mail.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing to use for my pimples that are hard to get. It works really good and the pointed tip part really goes through the pimple and skin without any problems. I advice to sterilize this after every use.</li>
            <li> Love it! Made from cheap materials but it gets the job done for its price, and the sharp point is super pointy and great for poking and prodding. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> I use this tool at least twice a week. Cheap but useful. Ok for millia</li>
            <li> OKAY ITEM, JUST HURTS WHEN PUSHING DOWN ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li> its good if u know how to us it i dont so it just sits in my bedroom if u know how to us them then get it</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s strong and gets every black head you have! I&#x27;d definitely buy one again but I doubt I&#x27;ll need to. You can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you just need a sharp tip. This works well. Needles will rust. So far so good. The other end, not sure what the point of it is, maybe to hang it up? But the point works well.</li>
            <li> i bought it only 0.46 cents, only shipping takes times..everything is good..it working fine,however,keep aways from child, it danger.that all</li>
            <li> took over 45 days to get it, really not worth the wait</li>
            <li> Best facial tool ive bought!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, took a very long time to get to me!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all waste of money</li>
            <li> This tool works great unlike the 15.00 set I bought with several tools in it. Very happy with it. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this tool at first but because it was so cheap with free shipping, bought it anyway. Hurts my nose since I&#x27;m no expert at this but later found other uses for this tool for the household. Goes to my toolbox now. LOL</li>
            <li> Metal coating came off, the needle end is not hollowed for deeper extractions, it&#x27;s not even functional!! The extraction loop end is way too small and sharp.</li>
            <li> I WOULD NO&#x27;T HAVE GIVEN ANY STAR BUT I DID NOT HAD A CHOICE. THIS IS VERY THICK POINT THAT IF YOU USE IT WILL DEFINETELY SCAR THE FACE. LOOKS VERY CHEAP MATERIAL. TOOK SO LONG TO ARRIVE IS JUST NOT WORTH IT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> good idea for comedone removal, however loop is flimsy  very easily bent.</li>
            <li> This works really well and leaves my skin super clean!  Be really careful with the pointy part because it is SHARP.</li>
            <li> Great, and inexpensive comedone removal tool. Does the job, and comes in a little sleeve for safe keeping. It also has a plastic guard on the sharp pointed end to protect yourself when using the other side.</li>
            <li> Very sharp on one end and shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> I gave this a high rating because this tool prevents you from using your fingers which can cause even more redness, irritation, and contamination. Wash your face in warm water, if you have a larger pimple that hurts, just use the sharp end to pierce it, use the other end to extract the oil from the pimple or blackhead and rinse in cold water. I just find this to be very useful.</li>
            <li> When I first got this thing I tore my face up and woke up in the morning not wanting to go anywhere because I had red marks all over my face lol but once you get used to it you know how hard to push and how to hold it for maximum results...the needle end is effin sharp so be careful and it arrived within a week I live in CA for less than a dollar I&#x27;d say it was hella worth it lol</li>
            <li> Im giving this item a five star because as gross as it sounds i was able to remove the blackheads my little brother had in his ear. I used the round part and pressed on to the black heads. The needle part i woukd only use o help a black head come out. I really liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it hurts when you use it but come on your poking your skin, ofcourse it supposed to hurt.</li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing. I was a bit disgusted the first time I used it and saw what my pores had been storing. With regular use my skin looks so much better. I do wish it was a bit easier to grip, but for the money it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Shipped so fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loop is made with thinner metal, Good qualityÔºÅ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and can be cleaned and sanitized!</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing that you can do for acne or pimples! Never pop or squeeze pustules, or you will end up with many scars all over your face like I did. I use this tool to poke holes in hard objects like a belt needing an additional notch or to widen an existing hole in my incense holder. Please don&#x27;t use on your face! Gently washing with a regular facial cleanser is about all you can do besides seeing a doctor. Then you just have to wait. My acne improved around age 30 on it&#x27;s own. If I hadn&#x27;t popped my zits, I wouldn&#x27;t have so much scarring on my cheeks. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This tool is great. I was able to remove many blackheads that I could not extract by normal means. Just be careful because it will damage your skin with excessive use. It can take off some skin leaving you with ugly scabs, but to avoid that be gentle and patient while using the tool. If a blackhead is too stubborn to come out then let it be. Also wash your face and use moisturizer after you are finished.</li>
            <li> this is the tool i neededd i recomend for all black head extraction it is easy and quick good buy</li>
            <li> just got in the mail.</li>
            <li> It does work and it gets the job done. You have to be pretty careful, though, and don&#x27;t forget to sanitize. If you do forget, your face might get worse.</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Very helpful works great especially helps from leaving and damaging marks on skin that we get When we do it with our hands</li>
            <li> I bought this because my friends suggest this product to me, this is a useful product.cool cool cool cool cool</li>
            <li> Does NOT have a hardened point. The tip that is supposed to be sharp is just the pointy end of the soft metal of the body.</li>
            <li> I love this tool for blackheads and whiteheads both. It did come with a little rubber cap for the EXTREMELY SHARP end, but it fell off as I took it out of the sleeve, never to be found. I have poked myself in the hand or finger with the sharp point a few times, while using the loop end. It is VERY unpleasant. The sharp point also damaged the thin plastic sleeve. I would give it 5 if it had something a little more protective to cover that &amp;#34;needle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this was a rip off, it helped huge pimples but not blackheads at all, all i was doing was stabbing at myself!</li>
            <li> THIS was such a pointless purchase. I thought this would be easy to get rid of my pimples but the point is so sharp im scared it would scar my face...no THANKS!</li>
            <li> I love it! I love it!! Lady&#x27;s stock up on these utensils they are amazing and they disnt leave any scars when I used them, but be sure you watch a couple videos on how to use them.</li>
            <li> The sharp end is too wide....would never use on face.  Should have made sharp end thin like a needle.&lt;br /&gt;The end with circle is also too big.</li>
            <li> These things are AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Handy little tool for blackhead removal.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I had expected! I believe the pointed end is very dangerous, couldn&#x27;t believe such is allowed and No instructions. I would Not recommend this product at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely bigger than I thought it would be. It does seem to work as intended though. But be careful when I first tried this one I applied some pressure and it left my nose red and left a clear imprint. Be gentle! Definitely clean it with alcohol before and after every use. I&#x27;ve used better ones but this one is okay. The tip is really sharp. I wish it came with a case or a better tip cover. Not bad at all, but I personally like the other more expensive version better.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Works great&lt;br /&gt;Awesome price</li>
            <li> Great to remover stubborn blackheads. Ive been able to remove ones that nothing else could. The needle end is very sharp but doesnt damage or scar you if you follow the directions. Im very glad that i found this &amp;&#x27; plan on getting 1 for my daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, took forever to arrive and the top round portion slips out if not careful.</li>
            <li> The acne blackhead remover works great, especially for those hard to reach places and blackheads. My bf and I enjoy this little tool and help each other out. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> it works great and the needle point is perfect for opening a pimpled before you start digging away at it.</li>
            <li> Tried it one time and was satisfied with the results.  You can&#x27;t beat the price, I recommend this item for anyone.</li>
            <li> I am always staring at my daughters face and telling them to wash them!  Quit touching your face, wash your face....but no.  There are zits.  This thing has worked better than any other tool I have owned.  The circle end is easy to see through and sturdy, if it&#x27;s pushed with force it doesn&#x27;t bend.  And is quite helpful at getting those little hard balls out without a lot of bleeding!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in up and coming esthetician and this tool is great.....it get all the white and black heads off the face and back. I just love the needle part of the tool...it goes right into the black head and the client doesn&#x27;t feel much at all....i will order another one.</li>
            <li> Junk  junk junk junk oh and junk. Don&#x27;t buy unless you like throwing money away. It&#x27;s just a needle. Junk!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use this tool to keep your skin clean.</li>
            <li> Eh...does more damage than help. Gets stuff out ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend DIY ravaging your pores.</li>
            <li> i attack my face everyday</li>
            <li> I love it ! Because it gets all the nasty stuff plus doesn&#x27;t leave dark marks and by the way it does hurt someone time .</li>
            <li> can barely see it, but there is small hook on end of needle. be careful with that and don&#x27;t damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the tool and it came in very handy while I was treating a friend of mines dearest rabbit for some horrible infections that I needed to keep open and kept closing on me.  It helped so much in keeping the wounds open and providing a way to clean out the infections in a very very less painful way for her. This was my saving grace really! I was able to not just use the needle end but the extraction all of which ended up actually helped me get into the wounds and clear out infection. It arrived just days before her owners were about to put her down even. But you will be happy to know, the rabbit is back to her old self, spry and happier than she has actually been in two years! This summer her owners have decided, even though they are getting out of the meat rabbit business until they get into their new house she is the only rabbit that they are keeping and are giving the rest away to great homes. This rabbit gets to experience the &amp;#34;free range&amp;#34; life this summer and will be breaded next spring for the first time since she was sick. I will go and fix my review. I wrote my original review at 3:00 am my time  so I must have just miss clicked the amount of stars. This product is AMAZING, it saved a life. That should be a gold medal for the seller and a no-brainier for future buyers.</li>
            <li> This product works great! Very handy tool for those who can&#x27;t resist popping pimples such as I. Very easy to use and pimples come out easily.</li>
            <li> Beauty hurts. This is no exception. It doesn&#x27;t work for all kinds of pores, but it is certainly effective for those it does work for. The lance end is very very sharp.</li>
            <li> does what it says it does, just be careful with it because it is rather dangerous and not to mention painful if you press down too hard</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! Perfect for stubborn acne...</li>
            <li> Super sharp needle point is what I wanted and this company delivered it in perfect condition. Thank you..</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to use</li>
            <li> Product as described, made well.</li>
            <li> Works fine, long shipping time but good to own.</li>
            <li> It is like a needle did not know that</li>
            <li> I am clueless on how to use it.  Plus, why dig at your skin when there are those adorable silicone things to rub it with</li>
            <li> Perfect and functional, in good physical condition all the pizzas and good quality covers expectations, very good sales all well recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay anything for this because I have yet to get it to do what it&#x27;s suppose to yet....</li>
            <li> This tool does what it is supposed to do. Not painful, and if done correctly, barely a mark (don&#x27;t press too hard). For more stubborn/imbedded blackheads, it may take several tries.   Tool is of good quality.  Looped end did not bend and because it&#x27;s stainless steel, no rust has developed after cleaning.</li>
            <li> Use it as usual.  Surprised that it&#x27;s sent form China.</li>
            <li> This has been so helpful in my all of a sudden development of acne. Clears things up quick without chemicals or much pain.</li>
            <li> The tip is sharp and the loop end helps, but isn&#x27;t very good for blackheads. I find a hairpin extracts blackheads better with out bruising.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and shipping was quick &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I have tried using this and the other, bowl type blackhead remover to very little success.  I suppose it works well for larger blacheads, but I have several small ones and they did not come out at all with this, even when pressing hard enough to cause my skin to start to tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this after watching numerous videos on Youtube of blackhead extractions and though they were very successful with it, I was unhappy with my results.  Perhaps you just get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The point is great and very sharp, but the other end doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> This, along with the facial sauna I purchased, has really helped to keep my skin bump free.</li>
            <li> the only con I have for this product is that there are no directions......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt really know how to use it becuase nothing came with it. I think I have inadvertantly figured it out but otherwise, youtube it is......</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It works great to get out black heads etc.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know that this product was from out of the country...</li>
            <li> not that sharp!!  :( Therfore not really helpul. Means, what the point! But well, nothing to do now, but know forthe next time</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.  However, it works ok.  Will keep it because it would cost more to send it back than to keep it.</li>
            <li> come in time, does the work, for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t if it will vanish the pimple forever,&lt;br /&gt;but it got rid of it!</li>
            <li> item was sharp, and had its own plastic container to keep it safe.</li>
            <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;The pointy needle end will leave your skin pierced after poking at your pores. If you don&#x27;t take care of it dirt will get in and look worse than before. For this reason, and because it will take time for your pierced skin to heal, the other option is better. You will have to press down Hard and move across the skin in order for all the gunk to come out.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fine tip, but there was a burr on it.  Be careful to check, or you may hurt yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to see it&#x27;s coming direct from China.</li>
            <li> Came super fast, and does the job of removing black heads super fast. Definitely recommend you get one if you havent tried one they are amazing. To clean, just wipe down with alcohol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected it to be. It&#x27;s a metal stick with a pointy end to pop pimples and such, and the ring at the other end helps &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; out the pus...</li>
            <li> It works as it explains. I use it often and never lets me down.</li>
            <li> this item works and leaves almost no damage.I use it on my husbands back and under his arms.It hurts less than what he was doing.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. QUALITY IS VERY GOOD.</li>
            <li> Did not put use to it.</li>
            <li> Good for extracting blackheads and oils from pores. Be sure to keep things clean with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a tip at the edge that enables you to pull at the very top of your blackheads which opens it for the other edge to easily pull it out, it really helps with the Marks, smooth and easy</li>
            <li> Great little tool and does what it suppose to do and very inexpensive.  Took about 2 to 3 weeks to arrive as it was shipped from China.  Used to have someone doing it for me at the salon - now I can do it myself but take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Used this as soon as I got it, works amazing!  Better than any you get in the store.  Shipping takes a while so be patient totally worth it.  I also recommend buying more than one because if you&#x27;re one of those Girls who likes to let your friends or family know the latest and greatest beauty tool you got, you&#x27;ll have extra on hand to share.  They&#x27;re so in expensive it&#x27;s great :)</li>
            <li> The product is very small and doesn&#x27;t even remove any blackheads. Its very small and and actually can damage my skin!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expecting, the circle end is too thin and hurts to use. I found one at a flea market for a few dollars more with a thicker circle and works much better</li>
            <li> Worked well.  It removed black head that I had been trying to remove for year from my back.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the tool to be so big, when it arrived. Other than the size of the tool it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Have bought others but I love this one!</li>
            <li> Effective in lancing pimplesand removing white heads. The needle end is very sharp and pointy so please be cautious.</li>
            <li> It was ok. The tool needle side could be a bit sharper and the round hole ended side could be on a better angle for ease of use. It is ok, and for this price not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Love this tool. I probably use it way too much. And for only $1, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Makes getting ingrown hairs and popping pimples easy. Nice product.</li>
            <li> well,it is nice for me.i guss it is a little useful.But what surprised me is that it was mailed from Chinese.</li>
            <li> BUYER BE AWARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those needles made my pimples worse. There is rust on the needles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have a pleasant experience dealing with uxcell either.</li>
            <li> i used it as soon as I got it, one end is suuuper sharp, like a needle so be careful, its safety hazard but the other end of  it which looks like a loop, did the job. It allows you to reach the black heads and extract them pretty well. I was surprised.</li>
            <li> this is an great tools and you have to buy it, my pimples is gone in an week.If you miss this chance then too bad for you</li>
            <li> Really useful for taking care of acne and blackhead. But it really takes a long time to arrive...</li>
            <li> Great deal! It really helps a lot in cleaning blackhead. Also easy to use. Though shipped from oversea, it was still fast!</li>
            <li> This tool works great for sebaceous filaments and blackheads in hard to reach areas like the nose and chin folds. The metal ring is thin and small enough for those areas, for larger areas like cheeks it didn&#x27;t work so well, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for. It comes with a nice sleeve and a cap for the sharp end. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Aesthetician and this is truly a waste of money! It doesn&#x27;t work well !!! Pass it up. You&#x27;ll be thankful you did.</li>
            <li> When I used it it only wired with a great amount of pressure I was let down</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this to begin with. The loop is just to thin of wire and flimsy to work for me. It&#x27;s painful and leaves a red circle instead of actually getting anything out of my skin. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I was mostly just curious and took a chance on it. I mean, it is incredibly cheap and I&#x27;m sure the more expensive, quality ones work better. I would suggest buying a better one if you really want to try a tool like this.</li>
            <li> When I previously reviewed this product I had not used it yet. I have used the product and like it.</li>
            <li> You have to be patient as it takes time for the product to arrive but once it did, I was very happy.  I did have to sign for the package.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase, especially for the price, not to mention it works.</li>
            <li> Does not work as described</li>
            <li> The price is great but the tool isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li> Not stainless at all, it&#x27;s chrome plated.  So cheap, I threw it straight in the trash.  What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get but it works.</li>
            <li> Well made tool - just don&#x27;t think I have the right kind of blackheads - probably works  great for people  with real problems.</li>
            <li> This tool is not really a blackhead remover. Not sure what it is but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The tool is both Sharp and sturdy. Despite its size it holds up to the tasks I want it to.</li>
            <li> It might sound gross to you but this thing is super handy for getting out black heads in the little crevices around your nose.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I can zit pick and blackhead pop with the best of them with these !  They are skinny- but come in a little plastic case (thin sleeve), and arrived pretty quickly considering they came from Hong Kong.  They&#x27;re also good for various crafty things requiring a tight point (I will use them to glue on reborn eyelashes before I get to the point of hand rooting them :)</li>
            <li> The circle at the end was bent when I took it out of the package but that is fine since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for ance !!</li>
            <li> I only bought two and I regret it, my niece took one and my son took the other. I bought two more bcuz its durable, it works great, I absolutely love it, especially the price! Its practically for free. It works better then the high priced ones.</li>
            <li> Works great. Using this tool with a 10-20x mirror becomes addictive</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Get the job done.  Can easily break through skin with too much pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible it made marks on my skin and the quality sucks.I won&#x27;t recommend this</li>
            <li> This tool works great. It&#x27;s a little painful, but it does its job very well.</li>
            <li> Good. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> By far the best extractor tool if you know how to use it!</li>
            <li> It is what it shows.. basically a needle with a loop on the end. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s what I intended to order. Rather, it doesn&#x27;t function like  i was hoping. I was hoping to get an acne removal tool that sort has more of a loop on the tip that starts out wide and comes to a pinch, whereas this one is like a perfect circle on the end. It did come alot faster than I expected, considering that it came from China somewhere.</li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago and have used it once or twice. So far I like it, it works well squeezing whiteheads and the sharp end really is sharp! I have not used it on black heads yet, but I will make sure to use it after showering because that&#x27;s when it works best.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those blackheads that are in the ear or surrounding the nose area</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work. I&#x27;ve used others before, so I knew what to expect. But I mean you get what you pay for. It wasn&#x27;t worth the wait nor the couple dollars.</li>
            <li> i like that the point is sharp and it does what its job..what more can i say abt it lol</li>
            <li> it is so useful to remove blackheads when we cant go to a parlor. It is very helpful at all times..</li>
            <li> Pointed end was not deburred nor smoothed out before polishing therefor not good for what it is supposed to be for.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find this item for over a year. This is to replace similar items that were lost or worn out. This is the absolute best at getting out whiteheads and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;  Mother of twin teens.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This needle was bent at the time of arrival. Since it was sent overseas and so cheap I&#x27;ve decided not to bother sending it back. My advice is not to buy from this tool.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Extremely sharp!</li>
            <li> Very Sharp and wonderfully effective</li>
            <li> Too bad, the tip of it has rusted already, but the other side is good. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!  Something I keep by every mirror!  My guess is it really doesn&#x27;t matter who you get them from, they should all be about the same.</li>
            <li> this is it is for acne i think, cuz when i use it it is work,  and sometime i think it is work for me</li>
            <li> I get these little white hard specks in my chin and around my mouth.I use the point to dig into them,and then you place the circle around the area and press and drag and usually,with one try,I can get them out.</li>
            <li> When I received the product the tip was nearly bent off. It also showed signs of rust within a few days (low quality stainless steel).</li>
            <li> Pretty good item. The needle part is pretty sharp so keep the little cover on. Ive poked myself a couple times when I forgot to put the slip cover back on.</li>
            <li> Hole is to big to pop pimples. Pretty worthless.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The tool is strong, made of quality materials and comes at a marvelous price. No allergies triggered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy! It took a while for me to receive it in the mail (about 2 weeks) but it was so worth the wait. I use this on my pimples and blackheads and then sterilize it to use on my husband. He has very sensitive skin that turns really red when we to pop pimples and get rid of blackheads, but this helps a lot. It really helps get all the dead skin and oils off the nose and make sure there is no more gunk left in a whitehead. It can be painful to use to get all the yuck out but its so much better than getting a pimple over and over in the same spot. Since it&#x27;s stainless steel its very easy to clean and sterilize before and after each use.</li>
            <li> I bought it cheap to try it out and regret doing so. The quality is very crappy. Low end material. I tried it on my blackheads and it didn&#x27;t do anything. It&#x27;s so small that I lost it. I bought the Cover Girl one for 4.99 and it did a better job. It&#x27;s thick and the quality is better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one just buy one at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Looks simple right? But no it did not work for me and I you tube how to use it many times. It only got a little out of my pores. I thought it would work better than my fingers but it did not work</li>
            <li> first one bent-sent me a replacement.</li>
            <li> It helps me a lot  especially in my nose,  it remove blackhead easily after washer.</li>
            <li> Is a good product. Its sharp as hell, but it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very good for extractions.  Fir students to learn extractions with a lancer this work every well.  They can be des infected</li>
            <li> I really have hard time w my black porus it helps a lot but doens&#x27;t work in some areas like nose....</li>
            <li> Great quality! It&#x27;s comparable to what sephora and ultra carries for a much better price - yay!!! great price!  The shipping was slow but for the price it&#x27;s still a great deal.</li>
            <li> Love using it. Works great. Took FOREVER to come.</li>
            <li> the round part hurts a bit more than a rectangular shaped ones, but not too bad for the price</li>
            <li> This is a nice little tool for blackhead removal, and not easy to find! However, I do recommend exercising extreme caution when using this tool as it is very sharp and capable of damaging delicate skin. That being said, it is a great addition to my skincare kit. Great pricing and fairly quick shipping.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the most I can tell you, it looks like its shown, cleaning person threw away before I had a chance to use it.</li>
            <li> works pretty good, but I wish it was longer for the middle of my back. Loops could be stiffer too.</li>
            <li> Great tool much more accurate than any other product I have used in the past. Minimal scarring with good accuracy.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do anything, least of all remove blackheads/whiteheads. this product was a waste of my money. don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> Good quality! Actually works well! Worth buying, especially for the price and shipping. I will be buying more at a later date!</li>
            <li> The order took about a month to get to me, but the service after i contacted them was good, so that&#x27;s a plus. but the circle end broke off after a few uses. It&#x27;s cheap so i guess i should have expected something...</li>
            <li> okay you can&#x27;t really go wrong with this contraption!&lt;br /&gt;just watch those online tutorials a bunch of times&lt;br /&gt;it might hurt a but when you have a huge pimple but NO PAIN NO GAIN! (at least in this case)&lt;br /&gt;stay beautiful!</li>
            <li> very nice except end of the pointed side is kind of hooked bc of bad cutting in the factory. so it gets stuck in your pore. not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Loop could be bigger.</li>
            <li> This is very sharp so if you&#x27;re careful you can&#x27;t even feel the poke.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, but can be a bit painful. I find that using a pair of tweezers works just as well, but for the low price it was still worth trying. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> works nicely ;////////;</li>
            <li> Perfect size &amp; great to help maintain the pores on your face!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it really works.</li>
            <li> Super helpful! I was worried that it was going to be made out of cheap metal, but it&#x27;s not. The loop end doesn&#x27;t bend or budge like I thought it might if it had been made cheaply. Also, the pointed end is incredibly sharp and that is also really helpful. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a really good and rather cheap acne tool.</li>
            <li> Now that I have it I&#x27;m afraid to use it and it so happened that my acne has improved, greatly, lately without it.  The tool is sharp (as it should be), but it&#x27;s still scary looking in person, and I hope to never have to use it.</li>
            <li> The end of the tool is very sharp so you have to be careful. I don&#x27;t know quite how to use this tool somaybe it would be good if I knew how.</li>
            <li> Needs help in its directions for use of what seems a very simple t9ol.</li>
            <li> You get what you see, I was spectical and first ordered 1.  After I tested the item I ordered 30 more.  Customer service person was very nice and wonderful to work with.  I spoke with him/her in month of April 2014; I would buy from them again and due to their customer service, I am conformtable to do business with them on other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected. I was looking for a very sharp lancet like tool that could prick the skin, I don&#x27;t think I could do that with this without really jabbing myself.</li>
            <li> I wish the pointed end was straighter, it has a slight curve to it and it isn&#x27;t as sharp as I would like it. it doesn&#x27;t exactly pierce your skin it more just scratches it and ends up irritating your skin more than necessary</li>
            <li> Does a decent job for removing blackheads after steam.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. Took some getting-used-to to learn how to use it, but its not as irritating to my skin as it would be had I ust used my fingers. A+</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Great item for the price</li>
            <li> It does the job of removing blackheads but those must have been loosened by facial cremes and gels beforehand for best results.</li>
            <li> the pointy end is WAY Sharp, be careful.  and the other end HURTS, i  have one i got from Sephora and it is MUCH better quality.  But since it was like a dollar, i thought it might be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I love it is an amazing product. Is an easy product to use and isn&#x27;t painful. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of time. Don&#x27;t bother.Didn&#x27;t work for my pores. Not fine enogh tool to do the job. Sorry ...</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and the product works wonderfully. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very effective for my teen.Very good price and good service.This item locally was 3x as expensive.Will do business with them again.</li>
            <li> Digs out ingrown hairs like a champ.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t work as well as the flat looped end ones, but it works ok.  The thin metal loop just doesn&#x27;t have the surface area to push down and remove the blackhead or pimple as well.</li>
            <li> It is as described, and it is sturdy and good quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for blackhead removal and so far it has worked and the other end is extremely sharp..The loop side is not sharp it leaves only a small mark.</li>
            <li> Great tool for removing milia without damaging your skin. It has an extremely fine (needle-nose) point to open the pore. Hence, less damage.</li>
            <li> Product is okay, however shipping took way to long.</li>
            <li> The pin side is not sharp and delevering time took tooooooo long.</li>
            <li> Bad quality. Top pinpoint not sharp. Custom service is slow. Finally Credit back to me.</li>
            <li> Takes a LONG time to receive but it is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good I just have to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for removing millia without scaring or damage to the skin. Can help remove blemishes as well, like white heads. Just poke the blemish or millia to open it, then use the round circle end to gently roll out the pus or pustule.</li>
            <li> I actually have this in my repair kit for small surgeries.  It&#x27;s weight is nice and the shape is like a pencil.  Very useful for poking, prodding, pulling and extracting things that might be caught in the skin.  The tip is extremely sharp.  It has a nice perforated grip that makes handling this tool a breeze.  Don&#x27;t settle for cheap and bendable aluminum knockoffs or something like a safety pin.</li>
            <li> in stainless steal can be easly cleaned works great wont rust and gray in color does remove pimples and white heads and black heads</li>
