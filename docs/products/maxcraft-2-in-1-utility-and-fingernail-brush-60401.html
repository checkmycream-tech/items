            <li>and I can&#x27;t get as good a scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased when this nail brush arrived.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right in stiffness for the brush side, and the angled fingernail side is at a perfect angle.  </li>

            <li>This is a nice fingernail brush...</li>

            <li>This brush is good at helping me get my hands and nails clean!  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great price.</li>
            <li>Just what many of us who work with our hands</li>
            <li>If the bristles in the nail portion of this brush were a lot stiffer, I&#x27;d give it a much better rating.  </li>
            <li>too love it as a farmer I get all manner of animal crud under my nails, but to look at my hands away from the farm</li>
            <li>Did not realize it it HUGE compared to most nail brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice product well worth the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of other brushes, but this one is the best!  </li>
            <li>This fingernail brush is strong and durable.  </li>
            <li>Bristles not as strong as described.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li>, Why aren&#x27;t these available everywhere?</li>
            <li>I made a lanyard from nylon rope and it easily hangs on a hook and quickly air dries after a shower.</li>
            <li>the large bristle side is great for the entire hand, over top your fingers and between them as well.</li>
            <li>This brush works well to clean it all out.  </li>
            <li>I am a stickler for clean hands.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind and did not cost as much as many of lesser quality.</li>
            <li>Perfect nail brush for hard working hands.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re too soft to really do any good under your fingernails.  </li>
            <li>the main bristles are pretty soft, a bit softer than I would prefer but the nail brush works good.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and at last found one that really works.  </li>
            <li>There is also a small line of bristles along the top to clean your nails.</li>
            <li>Having a medical background, clean hands are a neccessity.  </li>
            <li>True, the bristles are not as stiff but the advantage is that they clean your fingers in a gentle manner.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm and do a great job getting under the nail and the larger brush scrubs the hands clean without being too rough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other fingernail brushes where you can rest your fingers on the plastic and the brushes line up perfectly to clean under your fingernails.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE SOFT BRUISHES</li>
            <li>This is a wimpy soft brush.</li>
            <li>I get grease under my nails and this brush was too soft to get in between to get the job done.</li>
            <li>The bristles for cleaning under your fingernails are too far from the plastic.</li>
            <li>The nylon bristles are firm enough but don&#x27;t immediately curl up like the bristles on the cheap nail brushes you find at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are NOT fine and soft - they are hard enough to get a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>So far they seem to be durable as I have not notice one single bristle fall out of the brush.</li>

            <li> Was looking for a hard bristle nail brush and this is it! It does the job and gets under finger nails. Fast delivery and great price. Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is a nice fingernail brush...the main bristles are pretty soft, a bit softer than I would prefer but the nail brush works good. will see how it holds up. The magnet helps keep track of it!</li>
            <li> This fingernail brush is strong and durable.  the large bristle side is great for the entire hand, over top your fingers and between them as well. The shorter, stiffer bristles are good for your nails. Personally I would like them a little stiffer like one I used to have but these are the best I can find.</li>
            <li> I keep theses in my shower after a hard days work my hands usually get dirt under my fingernails and these do the job taking out all the dirt.</li>
            <li> Having a medical background, clean hands are a neccessity.  The Maxcraft fingernail brush does a great job of getting under the nails without ripping the skin off of you.  I now have one at every sink in the house.  Affordable and good quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gardener so I&#x27;m always trying to get the dirt out from cracks in my hand or under my fingernails.  This brush is good at helping me get my hands and nails clean!  The brush itself fits well into the palm of one hand while I scrub the other.  Not the prettiest brush - but definitely functional!</li>
            <li> Great Bath~Room add on</li>
            <li> NOT FOR MEN THAT WANT A TUFF HAND BRUSH CLEANER THEY ARE SOFT BRUISHES MIGHT BE GOOD FOR SOMEONE WANTING TO REMOVE DIRT FROM GARDEN BUT NOT OIL INK</li>
            <li> The nylon bristles are firm enough but don&#x27;t immediately curl up like the bristles on the cheap nail brushes you find at the grocery store.  They&#x27;re firmer than the typical wimpy back brush (hate that) and softer than plastic scrub brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for getting grease, dirt, etc...from under a man&#x27;s finger nails.  It may be a bit rough if a woman has delicate polished nails, but it definitely can do the job without the bristles coming out.  I made a lanyard from nylon rope and it easily hangs on a hook and quickly air dries after a shower.</li>
            <li> This brush is great!  I&#x27;m a woman, but I really appreciate a brush with firm bristles that gets in there and cleans up my nails, cuticles and the rest of my hands.  I do lapidary work and I get all kinds of rock muck under my nails and embedded in my cuticles.  This brush works well to clean it all out.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other brushes, but this one is the best!  The bristles are NOT fine and soft - they are hard enough to get a good cleaning.  Just what many of us who work with our hands need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I could only figure out how to keep my hands from drying out .....</li>
            <li> Bristles not as strong as described.  Wish it would be more sturdy but for the price it isn&#x27;t bad.  I wish the magnet was stronger.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing.  Whoever invented them is genius.  Every mechanic or gardener needs one of these!  Works great to get under the nails clean.</li>
            <li> Did not realize it it HUGE compared to most nail brushes. Not very strong bristles except for small nail part.</li>
            <li> I am a stickler for clean hands. I was very pleased when this nail brush arrived. It is sturdy and will last a long long time. It is easy to handle and clean. You can hang it up out of the way. The bristles are firm and do a great job getting under the nail and the larger brush scrubs the hands clean without being too rough. A little expensive but worth it because you won&#x27;t have to replace it for ages and ages. I recommend this brush to any one who works alot with their hands. Cooks, mechanics, gardeners, etc...</li>
            <li> Perfect nail brush for hard working hands. Cleans under nails beautifully.</li>
            <li> If the bristles in the nail portion of this brush were a lot stiffer, I&#x27;d give it a much better rating.  They&#x27;re too soft to really do any good under your fingernails.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a wimpy soft brush.It is not &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; by any stretch of the imagination. Buy the &amp;#34;Great neck&#x27; brush. I get grease under my nails and this brush was too soft to get in between to get the job done. Sorry,it was terrible.</li>
            <li> True, the bristles are not as stiff but the advantage is that they clean your fingers in a gentle manner. So far they seem to be durable as I have not notice one single bristle fall out of the brush. Also, they seem to keep their shape after use. I am not sure about the practicality of the magnet but one can always find a use for it.</li>
            <li> The brush does a great job at getting dirt from under my nails. The cost can&#x27;t be beat. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and at last found one that really works.  The bristles are just right in stiffness for the brush side, and the angled fingernail side is at a perfect angle.  I think this brush is the best of it&#x27;s kind and did not cost as much as many of lesser quality.</li>
            <li> This brush was met with great joy from my niece the metal smith. She puts it to the test with her metal grime!&lt;br /&gt;I too love it as a farmer I get all manner of animal crud under my nails, but to look at my hands away from the farm you would not guess what I use them for! Nice product well worth the price, Why aren&#x27;t these available everywhere?</li>
            <li> The bristles for cleaning under your fingernails are too far from the plastic. I&#x27;ve used other fingernail brushes where you can rest your fingers on the plastic and the brushes line up perfectly to clean under your fingernails. With this one i need to hover above it and I can&#x27;t get as good a scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for cleaning your hands of just about anything. It seems to be well made and the bristles are just stiff enough without doing any damage to your skin. There is also a small line of bristles along the top to clean your nails. All in all in works great</li>
