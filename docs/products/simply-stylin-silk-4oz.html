            <li>This product is Amazing!</li>
            <li>It does smell delightful and leaves your hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is very light weight, smells great, and does the job with just a drop.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great for hair extensions to keep them smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It keeps it smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>you get instant shine and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I ordered it a day ago and received it today; I put it on in sections (my weave is sewn in) and it restored it immediately almost just as smooth and manageable as the day I purchased it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It really Instantly detangles which i love!</li>
            <li>However, with this one I was my lace wig and then use a dime size amount and gently rub it on the wig and it smooth&#x27;s out split ends and gives the wig a glossy shine.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to find a product that actually works.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>It seems to work better than the spray version for some reason, although I thought the ingredients were the same.</li>
            <li>You only use a drop and it makes your hair shiny and healthy looking without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li>You have to remember not use too much</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>And does not tangle as much.....</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shinny and smooth especially after I wash it.  </li>
            <li>Other than heat protectant, this is my absolute favorite product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gamble, but I think you would have good results, if not great.</li>
            <li>Restored my wig to almost new after damage from heat and tangling.</li>
            <li>And thank you Amazon for such a fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The product came fast and really does stop weave from tangling, however I think it&#x27;s just a little overpriced.. not too much can be done about that though.</li>
            <li>It absolutely brought the hair back to life.</li>
            <li>not heavy at all</li>
            <li>I still need to let the beauty outlet know that this was not a good batch of hair but by the same token I&#x27;m glad I no longer look like it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>So, I bought some \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair extensions that were a hot mess after I washed them.</li>
            <li>less than 3 weeks later it was a tangled dry wreck even after washing it thoroughly and using special conditioners.</li>
            <li>The hair actually felt like plastic and get could barely get a comb through.</li>
            <li>Putting too much will weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether I like it because the TSA took it from me at the airport because it was half an ounce too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It tamed my hair, but not a long enough length of time.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> it works for protection from the humidity for ethnic hair that&#x27;s susceptible to humidity.  but it didn&#x27;t shine my hair at all!</li>
            <li> This product is the best for my hair. It keeps it smooth and tangle free. You have to remember not use too much or it can weight down and make your hair heavy but if you use the right amount, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> So, I bought some \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair extensions that were a hot mess after I washed them. The hair actually felt like plastic and get could barely get a comb through. I read about this online and decided to give it a try. It absolutely brought the hair back to life. I am so grateful, as I was really angry about how the hair was looking. This product really works! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff. It seems to work better than the spray version for some reason, although I thought the ingredients were the same. Makes hair silky without weighing it down. It is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This does the job.  Hair feels silky and no more frizz.  A little goes a long way, so be cautious not to use too much.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this product, however I prefer the mist.  However, with this one I was my lace wig and then use a dime size amount and gently rub it on the wig and it smooth&#x27;s out split ends and gives the wig a glossy shine.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a product to rejuvenate my human hair weave and my search is over. This product is very light weight, smells great, and does the job with just a drop.</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing! It really Instantly detangles which i love! you get instant shine and it smells great. not heavy at all</li>
            <li> This product restored my dry weave. I love this stuff!!  It works. It is worth the price.  It is nice to find a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> The product came fast and really does stop weave from tangling, however I think it&#x27;s just a little overpriced.. not too much can be done about that though.</li>
            <li> Love it! I can put a dab in my hand and run it through my extensions after they&#x27;re dry and straightened, and they look like they did when I bought them 3 months ago. I wear my extensions every day, wash them, sleep with them in  and everything. Other than heat protectant, this is my absolute favorite product. Love it!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Im using it for my hair extensions that keep tangling for soke reason. I put this on and i do see a difference. My hair is easier to comb or brush through. And does not tangle as much.....&lt;br /&gt;****ADVICE****&lt;br /&gt;I little goes a long way so what i do is divide myvhait into 4 sections and 1 or 2 drops are perfect  for each section.  Putting too much will weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Not perfect for all hair types, but most it seems to cover. It does smell delightful and leaves your hair feeling smooth. Just running my fingers through my hair I could tell the difference of smoothness. And it SMELLS SO GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tamed my hair, but not a long enough length of time. It&#x27;s not a lifesaver for a bad hair day. It&#x27;s a gamble, but I think you would have good results, if not great.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  You only use a drop and it makes your hair shiny and healthy looking without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Restored my wig to almost new after damage from heat and tangling. I sprayed it on my wig after washing and conditioning it.</li>
            <li> Had to come back and do a review. I purchased some very expensive human hair and less than 3 weeks later it was a tangled dry wreck even after washing it thoroughly and using special conditioners. i did some research and bought this product. I ordered it a day ago and received it today; I put it on in sections (my weave is sewn in) and it restored it immediately almost just as smooth and manageable as the day I purchased it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I still need to let the beauty outlet know that this was not a good batch of hair but by the same token I&#x27;m glad I no longer look like it wasn&#x27;t. Great product for weave restoration! I wrote this because if anyone is as desperate as I was for a product and want THE TRUTH before purchasing this is it!!!! Best Wishes!!! And thank you Amazon for such a fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether I like it because the TSA took it from me at the airport because it was half an ounce too much.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shinny and smooth especially after I wash it.  You only need a dab.  I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> Great for hair extensions to keep them smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> awesome product. great for extensions and relaxed hair!!!!</li>
