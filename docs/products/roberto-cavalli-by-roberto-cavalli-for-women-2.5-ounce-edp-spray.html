            <li>It is sweet but never too heavy.</li>
            <li>Its not heavy like Michael Kors (which I like but for totally opposite</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why its no long mainstream</li>

            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume!  I don&#x27;t know why its no long mainstream but I buy it anytime I can find it in fear of one day it will be no more!  It has a nice spiced amber smell that gets noticed anytime I wear it.  You can get away wearing this by day or by night.  The Oro is good too, but more of an evening fragrance for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this 10 stars if able.  Its just that amazing..oh!...and the fragrance lingers all day is subtle way.  Its not heavy like Michael Kors (which I like but for totally opposite reasons).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worthy purchase.  Take m word for it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for so long that I can&#x27;t even smell it when I spray some on!  Why would that be?  Hmmm...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite a bargain - a huge bottle that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was really upset that this perfume was not available in stores anymore.  However, I was extremely excited to find it here.  This perfume is flowery and sweet, yet it is not overly sweet like most of the \\&quot;summer\\&quot; perfumes on the market.  This is the only sweet summery perfume that I can wear that does not make me dizzy and nauseous because I am allergic to most perfumes.  I am glad that I found this product for such a great price, and not to mention that it is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> This perfume always gets credit. It is sweet but never too heavy. Very unique and always feminine. And it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> My Sister wanted it. She is extremely happy with it. I paid much less than the price on the market. Excellent Buy!</li>
            <li> excellent and very cheap, it is a great perfume at a great price, love it soo much excelent quality :)</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for 10yrs and I will be wearing it for 10 more.  It has a natural fresh smell and it seems as it is just the laundry detergent that you use that&#x27;s what I hear all the time.  I have loved this perfume since Roberto Cavalli advertised it in Nordstrom&#x27;s.  It was $100 then and you can not find this perfume any were other than Amazon oh and maybe some side perfume store.  At any rate this is a must have scent for the summer, spring, winter and fall.  I love love love it.</li>
            <li> This purfume is amazing must get I luv thebbottle this is da only purfume I use I hope it never get Discontinue</li>

            <li> I received this perfume as a gift about 10 years ago and I&#x27;m loving it since day one for very feminine, exquisite, intriguing aroma everybody&#x27;s always complementing. It became my trademark....lol.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my daughter who loves this scent.  I must say, I&#x27;ve also become a fan...it is delicious!</li>
            <li> It smells okay, but not for the Grown and Sexy Woman but for more like the High school teenager or young girl.........</li>
            <li> Wish it were in a more graceful container. The scent is lovely. My niece received the perfume but is afraid to leave it out for fear it will fall over and break.</li>
