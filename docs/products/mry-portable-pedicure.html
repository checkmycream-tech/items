            <li>I should of read more reviews.</li>

            <li>It just takes some getting used to the appropriate amount of pressure that doesn&#x27;t cause it to stop.  </li>
            <li>I love being barefoot and my feet show it...</li>

            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I felt pressured to give a review on something I had only used 1 time which isn&#x27;t going to fly in my book.</li>
            <li>The seller gave me this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I received this yesterday, right  on time, and I&#x27;m already in love</li>

            <li>I was extremely pleased with how simple and effective it was to use.</li>
            <li>This product seems to do a good job at reducing callouses if used regularly.</li>

            <li>Thank you very much !</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use this much, but I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>I actually picked this one because of the way it looks, a nice color and clean looking.</li>
            <li>This item works as it should it tickles my wife&#x27;s feet ; )  have used it several times now and works good.  </li>
            <li>The device was easy to put together and there were no unnecessary pieces.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one con is that the head of the remover can easily stop spinning when applying too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Nice foot appliance if used daily, overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It comes with two attachments, so that when the first piece wears out, you have a backup to use!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, very sensitive to pressure &amp; will stop if pressed too firmly.</li>
            <li>It felt great on my foot, like a massage, and powered through the dead skin.</li>
            <li>Now our feet can be together, his are soooo soft, sooo smooth!</li>
            <li>The seller gave this callus remover to me in exchange for my honest feedback, but I definitely would have paid money for it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and understanding how to use the product was actually pretty easy.</li>
            <li>but after using this last night, almost effort free, what a huge difference,</li>
            <li>It removed months of neglect and left my feet feeling smoother than I have been able to get them in years.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty handy since the calluses tend to be harder on one part of my foot, and softer in another.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly like the images given.</li>
            <li>My feet were really smooth afterwards and after using it a few more times</li>
            <li>It also came apart at one point, but it was easy to put back on.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li>This is evident by the considerable amount of &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; produced when using it.</li>
            <li>Definitely a product worth buying for anyone needing calluses gently removed.</li>
            <li>They are soft and sooth and ready for summer.</li>
            <li>This unit looks much more professional than all the pink and blue callus removers on the market.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so soft now.  </li>
            <li>Only issue I have is the company constantly sending emails right after I purchased the item wanting me to rate it.</li>
            <li>As a guy, I appreciate that this comes in black and silver rather than the pastel colors of many other products out there.</li>
            <li>I really like the Callus Remover for sanding the rough patches on my heels and ball of my feet.</li>
            <li>Even though it lacks enough power to remove callouses quickly, it does work if you do a little at a time.</li>
            <li>and it comes with a cute little black bag to keep it in too!!  </li>

            <li> Very satisfied, works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would by another if needed.</li>
            <li> Good product, valued price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Even though it lacks enough power to remove callouses quickly, it does work if you do a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item exactly as posted..thank you!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it . I tried it on him and works great!! You see it work instantly and it arrived sooner than expected . Thank you very much !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. I am a man who was looking to god rid of some calloused feet and this piece of garbage isn&#x27;t the answer. If you apply any pressure what so ever it won&#x27;t spin. So basically you have to sit there for 30 minutes or more letting it spin on your foot with no pressure.</li>
            <li> Not that powerful kind of bogs out.</li>
            <li> Nice foot appliance if used daily, overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my heels and soles which have been building callouses ever since I started walking in dress shoes. The callouses become a problem when I run, since they will crack or separate from the skin underneath. This product seems to do a good job at reducing callouses if used regularly. You cannot push against the skin too hard because the motor doesn&#x27;t have a ton of torque, but light pressure will still remove a lot of dead skin from the surface. This is evident by the considerable amount of &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; produced when using it. As a guy, I appreciate that this comes in black and silver rather than the pastel colors of many other products out there.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to receive the MRY Callus Remover to test it out on my calluses! I received the remover for free in exchange for an unbiased review of the product. I found it was so simple to use, came organized well in a box and with a convenient velvet bag for future keeping. The device turned on so easily and gently massaged my calluses until they were gone! I was extremely pleased with how simple and effective it was to use. Definitely a product worth buying for anyone needing calluses gently removed.</li>
            <li> OMG, I can&#x27;t get enough of this!  Ask my husband.  My feet are so soft now.  I wear flip flops all summer and or no shoes, so I get ugly calluses.  This does the trick, no pain and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love it, it works fine thank you 😘😘😘</li>
            <li> I received the package a few days after I ordered the product. I received this product for free in exchange for unbiased opinion. I really like the Callus Remover for sanding the rough patches on my heels and ball of my feet. It does an excellent job. They are soft and sooth and ready for summer. The velvet bag makes it very handy for travel</li>
            <li> This item works as it should it tickles my wife&#x27;s feet ; )  have used it several times now and works good.  Only issue I have is the company constantly sending emails right after I purchased the item wanting me to rate it. After the it 3rd email I had to get a little ugly  I felt pressured to give a review on something I had only used 1 time which isn&#x27;t going to fly in my book. Good product annoying emails</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use this much, but I love it so far.  It doesn&#x27;t allow you to press too hard.  Which limits any possible damage you could do.  It removed months of neglect and left my feet feeling smoother than I have been able to get them in years.  Also served as a mini-massage.  So incredibly pleased with my purchase!  I might buy more as gifts for family!</li>
            <li> It is not strong enough for me. My wife likes it.</li>
            <li> The callus remover is wonderful! At first I was a bit skeptical because this is my first time receiving a product for an unbiased review; however, all my doubts have disappeared within a couple uses. I have EXTREMELY deep calluses, so I had to use the callus remover more often than others, but I was very satisfied with the results. It made the bottom of my feet feel like a baby&#x27;s butt! I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs to get rid of their foot calluses!</li>
            <li> Very good product that works as specified.  This unit looks much more professional than all the pink and blue callus removers on the market.  I actually picked this one because of the way it looks, a nice color and clean looking.</li>
            <li> Totally a solid company to stand behind their product!  Two thumbs up guys!!</li>
            <li> I missed my husband feet, so i decided to purchase this item. OMG, im so happy with the results. Now our feet can be together, his are soooo soft, sooo smooth! Im happy and love his caveman feet :)</li>
            <li> Good product. Better customer service from seller</li>
            <li> I should of read more reviews. The motor needs to be much more stronger to be effective. It will take forever to accomplish the desired effect you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I received the package 3 days after I ordered the product. Shipping was fast, and understanding how to use the product was actually pretty easy. (Although there is an instruction manual provided.) The product comes with an interchangeable roller for different fineness. I thought it was pretty handy since the calluses tend to be harder on one part of my foot, and softer in another. When actually using the roller, I found out that my calluses started “sanding” down to a smoother finish making my feet softer, and smoother. THANK GOODNESS… What I like about this product is that it is portable, has a cleaner and baggy for cleanliness (since it does get a bit messy) and storage. Product is exactly like the images given. Surprisingly, this has done me justice. The seller gave me this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I think it needs more torque and power.  Works fine if you have the patience to let the product do the job.</li>
            <li> The seller gave this callus remover to me in exchange for my honest feedback, but I definitely would have paid money for it. I am too lazy to go to a spa or spend money I don&#x27;t have on a manicure so this magical device came to the rescue. I have used it 3 times in the week since I got it. The device was easy to put together and there were no unnecessary pieces. It felt great on my foot, like a massage, and powered through the dead skin. My feet were really smooth afterwards and after using it a few more times some of the harder parts of my feet are starting to feel soft. It&#x27;s kind of better than a pedicure in every way- cheaper, no manual labor, and no awkward conversations.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice Callus Remover.  It comes with two attachments, so that when the first piece wears out, you have a backup to use!  It also is really nice that it included the needed batteries instead of having to hunt for some batteries before you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to operate, with a flick of a button it&#x27;s ready to go.  It&#x27;s also extremely easy to grip and angle where you need it.  There&#x27;s also a small little brush included to clean the device after you use it, so that you don&#x27;t have dead skin stuck in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one con is that the head of the remover can easily stop spinning when applying too much pressure.  It also came apart at one point, but it was easy to put back on.  It just takes some getting used to the appropriate amount of pressure that doesn&#x27;t cause it to stop.  It definitely isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, but I just wanted to note that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sample Provided for Testing &amp; Honest Review</li>

            <li> Excellent product, very sensitive to pressure &amp; will stop if pressed too firmly. Comes with an extra roller, had already made a difference in my feet, thank you!</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday, right  on time, and I&#x27;m already in love w/this product. My heels were a mess! I love being barefoot and my feet show it...but after using this last night, almost effort free, what a huge difference, cant wait to show my feet off now in sandals!! and it comes with a cute little black bag to keep it in too!!  best of all a great price after researching others.</li>
            <li> WORKS VERY GOOD, I AM JUST WONDERING IF I CAN GET REPLACEMENT HEADS?</li>
