            <li>Overall great hair!</li>
            <li>I was in love with this hair.</li>
            <li>There are better quality brands out there</li>
            <li>It turns out it&#x27;s way better</li>
            <li>I love this hair.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied overrall.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair it moves as if its my hair n tht what matter most.</li>
            <li>The add seemed very customer friendly offering great customer service and easy exchanges, that were NOT AS ADVERTISED.</li>
            <li>To matting and easy to maintain, cut and style.</li>
            <li>The hair is good but the price is high for the quality.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best hair extensions I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>I started off on the cheap end of the scale</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s important about any sew in, clip ins, etc.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>very rarely does it tangle.  </li>
            <li>and it is still nice and natural looking.</li>
            <li>The hair lasts me over a year with proper upkeep and is a good alternative to times when I don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars on virgin hair.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of straight hair.</li>
            <li>I would only use this hair for a quick weave since it only lasts a month at best.</li>
            <li>this hair is reusable and worth the money.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and pricing is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>So this hair gets lots of good reviews on the black hair websites.</li>
            <li>She told me this brand had little sheddign &amp; was a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>I used it for a whole year!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing it on Amazon for the first time.</li>
            <li>When I first put it in at the salon is was nice, semi thick feeling and very shiny and healthy looking too.</li>
            <li>If I didnt know better I would swear that big foot or a yetti was in my bathroom shedding.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair years ago and it was not good,it looks pretty in the pack</li>
            <li>I was only able to use the hair for two installs before I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li>done sew in to $200 sew ins to homemade clip ins, and it never fails me.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the original outre velvet remi hair in the clear plastic package like u had as a display for sale not the boxed one.</li>
            <li>Moisturized hair will frizz less and hold curls better!</li>
            <li>It is okay to go with a less expensive shampoo, but make sure you have a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>I took this one out after 2 months and really wanted it out much sooner.</li>
            <li>Hair feels great, but is rather thin.</li>
            <li>I recently started getting weaves because I&#x27;m more of a natural person.</li>
            <li>The hair is also very fine, it does not resemble african american hair at all.</li>
            <li>the hair is thin but it gives a more natural look as if its your own hair and the tracks lays flat on your scalp with no bulky / lumpy look.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair its soft its silky</li>
            <li>so I put the normal stuff that I put on my scalp for soothing and it did not work.</li>
            <li>The first batch from Outre just reacted to humidity way too much and the second brand from NE 1 sucked!</li>
            <li>It has minimum shedding and when washed and conditioned it bounces right back.  </li>
            <li>Finding the right shampoos and conditioners are key.</li>
            <li>I took extra care with it, making sure that I didnt even so much as to lay down and watch TV without pinning it up with bobby pins into a duby and tying it up with a scarf.</li>
            <li>It is much better and last longer than some of the more expensive brands of remi</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but i&#x27;m ok with that because of the way I usually style my hair anyway(loose curls).  </li>
            <li>(Though in general, you will need some mousse, diluted setting lotion, or other light hold products to keep your curls completely intact).</li>
            <li>but instead a natural detangling agent) to prevent what happened anyway</li>
            <li>I left it straight.</li>
            <li>I took it to a professional hair salon</li>
            <li>Definitely will be purchasing again very soon.</li>
            <li>Now, as far as frizziness and tangling--it depends on the upkeep.</li>
            <li>I do use a really hot flat iron on it daily ..</li>
            <li>I spent so much money on this hair and it barely made it to a month.</li>
            <li>They do say one bad experience spreads faster than 10 good.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This hair is awesome.. I washed it a few times and barely any tangles like other hair. I put gel, hair lotion, oil .. everything!! and it is still nice and natural looking. I do use a really hot flat iron on it daily .. this hair is reusable and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair from a seller in person. I used it for a whole year! This is the best brand of Brazilian hair. I will be purchasing it on Amazon for the first time. Hopefully the quality is still the same</li>
            <li> I really love remi velvet. It shipped quickly and pricing is very reasonable. the only com0plaint I have about the hair is the shedding is ridiculous, but for the price it is worth it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this hair.  It does not live up to the hype or the price tag.  It tangled badly and would not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> So this hair gets lots of good reviews on the black hair websites. I decided to try it, and was so underwhelmed.  it tangled like there was no tomorrow. it does not hold a curl well, even with product.  Also it sheds a lot and is pretty thin.  I looked practically bald by the time i took it out.  I usually like to keep my sew-ins about 2.5 months.  I took this one out after 2 months and really wanted it out much sooner.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best hair extensions I have ever tried! I have gotten so many complements on my hair! Minimal shedding and tangling. I don&#x27;t wrap the hair at night but I do wear a silk bonnet to bed and in the morning it&#x27;s just a simple brush and go. Overall great hair!</li>
            <li> This hair is great!  I have worn this hair from June &#x27;til now, October, washing along with blow drying and/or air drying on a weekly basis and it still looks great.  I&#x27;m only taking it out b/c my foundation is extremely lose.  It has minimum shedding and when washed and conditioned it bounces right back.  I love this hair and would recommend any woman of color who is considering a weave to purchase it!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair from a beauty supply store and paid $60 per pack(I purchased two) so after taxes I coughed up about 132.00. Now I have only had this hair in my head, sewn in, as of today for a total of 3 weeks. This hair started to tangle and matt really bad by week 2. When I first put it in at the salon is was nice, semi thick feeling and very shiny and healthy looking too. I was in love with this hair. I took extra care with it, making sure that I didnt even so much as to lay down and watch TV without pinning it up with bobby pins into a duby and tying it up with a scarf. I moisturized it with weave aide (both the polisher and the \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version that doesnt contain oil but instead a natural detangling agent) to prevent what happened anyway (tangles...) obviously. That alone let me know this was garbage hair! I didnt even curl it with a curl wand. I never even touched it with a flat iron. I left it straight. I only combed and brushed it to undo the duby in the morning. By day four I noticed the horrible shedding, then came the tangles and matting. I currently have the hair in and I braid it every night into about four big box braids so that it waves up if I sleep with it over night. I only do this because if I leave it lose or striaght I should say, my hair starts to ball and matt like a nasty piece of lint you would find under your bed or like a tumble weed. I do not reccomend this product at all. This hair is not good and I wouldnt buy it again knowing that it tangles badly and sheds. If I didnt know better I would swear that big foot or a yetti was in my bathroom shedding. There are better quality brands out there so skip this one. Dont waste money like I did. I regret this purchase. I spent so much money on this hair and it barely made it to a month. I usually buy premium yaki hair thats in a yellow packaging and its 40 bucks for two packs and in Brooklyn I pay 80 dollars to have it sewn in. I think I will go back to my old brand for less money and last me 3 months without tangeling. I am sick to my stomach thinking about the 132.00 I spent plus the 80 to sew the wefts in. Like I said dont be an ass like me and make a bad purchase! I dont even feel good giving it 1 star because it sure as hell deserve zero.</li>
            <li> I got this because of all the rants and raves about it. I paid $90 for 2 packs of 10 inch short and went to get my sew in as always. By the second day I had a lot of irritation on my scalp so I put the normal stuff that I put on my scalp for soothing and it did not work. With in a week my scalp was on fire! I have sores all in my hair and my scalp looks raw! This by far is the worst weave that I have ever brought! to top it off it sheds a lot and tangles too! Please do not buy this hair it is not all of what you think! Now I have been getting sew ins for the past 2 years straight and this is the worst experience ever. Now I have to leave my hair out for like two weeks so my scalp can heal. I AM SO UPSET!!!!!!!! I will be contacting the company about this</li>
            <li> I bought this hair years ago and it was not good,it looks pretty in the pack but it gets frizzy often and does not curl well. I was only able to use the hair for two installs before I had to throw it out. The hair is also very fine, it does not resemble african american hair at all. I no longer use package hair, only pound hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair two weeks ago and it&#x27;s already nappy! I&#x27;m brushing it 5X a day to try to keep it nice.  I would not recommend this hair to anyone... I&#x27;ve had better results from synthetic hair..very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible service! Do not buy from this buyer! I purchased two bags of hair  on Nov  15th and I was supposed to receive my hair between Nov 19th through the 22nd . When I did receive my hair by that Saturday , I started to get worried . I waited to see if the hair would come that Monday Nov 25th, but it did not! I mined up have to call the post office with the tracking information to see where the package was located . The post office could not locate the package . I needed up calling the seller and the package was NEVER sent ! I had to cancel my hair appointment , go buy hair from a hair store and spend double the money ! Horrible customer service! Unorganized business! Waste of time and money !</li>
            <li> Hair feels great, but is rather thin.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 packs of body wave \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; Malaysian from hair extension buy.com. The add seemed very customer friendly offering great customer service and easy exchanges, that were NOT AS ADVERTISED. When I received the hair it was not the typical colors that are seen on a color chart or match what I had seen on the website. I tried to exchange the hair as to their policy, taking a picture of the hair and sending it to them along with the reason for the exchange but I was still given the run around. The did not respond to may email for 3 weeks!!At this point I had just decided to keep the hair and die it another color. Unfortunately this hair does not dye well. I took it to a professional hair salon and it came out all different colors of the RAINBOW!!!This hair is extremely dry and dose not wave up when you wash it. I have tried all types of moisturizing regimens, deep conditioners and smoothing products but this hair is drier than shredded wheat!!! I have only had this hair in for a month and a half.  You need to comb it several times a day, or it will tanged into a huge ball, and shed like crazy!!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!!!</li>
            <li> The hair is good but the price is high for the quality.  The hair constantly sheds. The hair comes out with minimal combing or brushing. I would only use this hair for a quick weave since it only lasts a month at best.</li>
            <li> After trying Remi Remi by Dreamweaver, I stand by this brand.  Two and a half months and several washings and it&#x27;s still bouncing and behaving.  To matting and easy to maintain, cut and style.</li>
            <li> I recently started getting weaves because I&#x27;m more of a natural person. I started off on the cheap end of the scale and I regretted it soooooo much lol. The first batch from Outre just reacted to humidity way too much and the second brand from NE 1 sucked! When I say SUCK i mean SUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKK! Matting and tangling and dry and DISGUSTING! SO don&#x27;t buy it but I recently purchased this. Now to say the least I thought I would be as disappointed as before because of the reviews I read, they were all over the place. It turns out it&#x27;s way better than 4 stars. I think if you wanna decide that it&#x27;s for you then YOU should try it. They do say one bad experience spreads faster than 10 good.</li>
            <li> I love this hair. I read some reviews on YT and didn&#x27;t notice many bad reviews at all.  So I proceeded to purchase two packs.  I got it installed July 1st and so far so good.  It blends PERFECTLY with my hair.  Very minimal shedding and very rarely does it tangle.  I am satisfied overrall.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but i&#x27;m ok with that because of the way I usually style my hair anyway(loose curls).  Definitely will be purchasing again very soon.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of the reviews mention shedding and tangling. What&#x27;s important about any sew in, clip ins, etc. is sealing the wefts. There will be shedding with any hair you buy, and with this hair it can be prevented with a $2 bottle of fray check. Now, as far as frizziness and tangling--it depends on the upkeep. This is human hair and it will dry out. Finding the right shampoos and conditioners are key. You have to treat this hair like it is your own. It should be washed at least once a week. I typically use a detangler/conditioner at night and in the morning when I comb through. I have been using this hair for years with a home done sew in to $200 sew ins to homemade clip ins, and it never fails me. Most people don&#x27;t recognize that it&#x27;s not mine! I use Mizani products on my hair and this weave. It is okay to go with a less expensive shampoo, but make sure you have a good conditioner. Moisturized hair will frizz less and hold curls better! (Though in general, you will need some mousse, diluted setting lotion, or other light hold products to keep your curls completely intact). The hair lasts me over a year with proper upkeep and is a good alternative to times when I don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars on virgin hair.</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and I try to purchase different types of hair so I can reccomend it to my clients. I really like this hair its soft its silky and I have no shedding at all. I installed 2 packs in my hair the hair is thin but it gives a more natural look as if its your own hair and the tracks lays flat on your scalp with no bulky / lumpy look. I love this hair it moves as if its my hair n tht what matter most. The key to manageing weaves is the LESS product u use the LESS problems u will have with your install and u MUST always wash and condition with a moitireizing shampoo and conditioner. I hope this helps u all on your next purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of straight hair. It is much better and last longer than some of the more expensive brands of remi</li>
            <li> Tangles and sheds like crazy! Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Outre hair is horrible!! It looks good when you leave the salon- give it about 3 hours to start the frizz. This hair felt worse than my neice&#x27;s barbie doll&#x27;s hair- and she is rough on those dolls!! My stylist actually recommended it, to save me soem money over the $129 packs I was considering. She told me this brand had little sheddign &amp; was a good deal for the money. Well, I wouldn&#x27;t pay $10 for this hair, so NO IT IS NOT a good deal for the money!! It itched my scalp so bad and the wefts wee much mroe lumpy than any other brand. I had to keep cutting it to wear it &amp; after 2 weeks it was in a ponytail &amp; I had to take Benadryll. I finally jsut took it all out, a hot frizzy tangled mess!!!! Save up for a better product!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the original outre velvet remi hair in the clear plastic package like u had as a display for sale not the boxed one. I didn&#x27;t care for the quality of that one.</li>
