            <li>Bought this Panasonic razor for $250 from Brookstone over five years ago and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to achieve in years.</li>
            <li>So I replaced them and while it didn&#x27;t make a noticeable impact on how close my shave was, it did &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; better during the shave.</li>
            <li>So much better than buying elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a head more substancial...not plastic.  </li>
            <li>I feel I get a better shave under this system.</li>
            <li>This is one thing that I need to do more often:  change my razor foil and blade.  </li>
            <li>The shaver foil fits perfectly and the blades are very simple to change.  </li>
            <li>Works great as a replacement for my razor although the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic WES9014PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set fits the shaver perfectly and works as would be expected.  </li>
            <li>And I love it that the replacement parts are available.</li>
            <li>Panasonic makes a quality shaver that travels well and gives me exactly what I need from a shaver - consistently great, comfortable shaves, quickly and without any residual razor burn.</li>
            <li>Just as good as new!</li>
            <li>Easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Foils and blades wear down over time, and this is an excellent replacement to my Dad&#x27;s Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>After purchase I noticed a huge difference in the quality and closeness of my shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been totally reliable and gives me consistently great shaves.   </li>
            <li>This set fit my shaver&lt;</li>
            <li>great quality, it last and never brakes.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased -- the quality of the shave has been restored to when new.    </li>
            <li>Ordered a replacement after the screen wore through on the original head.  </li>
            <li>Bought it to replace the foil on my razor, the original began to scratch my face.  </li>
            <li>Did not seem to be an improvement over the shave of the original blades, would not buy again.</li>
            <li>I do use this Panasonic a good more than the Fusion due to the cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li>It always amazes me how great it feels to shave with a new set of blades and new heads.</li>
            <li>(of course, right where it&#x27;s hardest to shave!).  </li>
            <li>Evidently the blades were becoming dull, but the foil seemed to remain in excellent condition.     </li>
            <li>and good quality.. Will definitely order from this company again..  </li>
            <li>If your shaver is taking longer and longer to give you a good shave, consider this to bring it back to like-new condition.  </li>
            <li>many thanks.</li>
            <li>The blades are of good quality and last almost a year before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that the replacments are still available on amazon for my old razor.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I have a pretty light beard except on my neck</li>
            <li>It seemed better than new.</li>
            <li>I have had the Panasonic electric razor for almost two years and just now replaced the foil and cutter for the first time!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>This is a replacement set for electric razor which I replace once a year and is consistent with original parts.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $40</li>
            <li>right product .</li>
            <li>I opened it because I thought it was the right piece</li>
            <li>I did not get new ones last year and still was getting a good shave each morning</li>
            <li>So far this Panasonic has been fantastic...</li>
            <li>This was my first foil/blades combo replacement on my Panasonic ES8228.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the razor blades though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had so many problems with this company and the same product</li>
            <li>This combo replacement shaver foil and blade set is the exact replacement for my Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li>My shaver will operate like new again and my face will be happy for another few years.   </li>
            <li>Keeps my 80&#x27;s style porn look clean and trouble free!  </li>
            <li>I recommend replacing this on your razor at least once a year if you have a light stubble like mine, more often if you have a thicker beard.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Charges fast and holds a charge for almost two weeks at a time.</li>
            <li>As expected, seems to shave better.......</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic.</li>
            <li>- the parts don&#x27;t look like they cost that much to manufacture.</li>
            <li>Used replacements this morning and cut shaving time by 30% and the shave was as close as a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized how much the performance of my shaver had deteriorated.  </li>
            <li>and only then did I learn that it didn&#x27;t fit the shaver head.</li>
            <li>The blades give a really close shave.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Nice to have new again, after shaving with the old cutters &amp; screen for so long.  </li>
            <li>I have had my original foil and blade set from my purchase back in 2009.  </li>
            <li>The foil only lasts a year or two before the blades eat through the mesh (probably because I don&#x27;t clean the blades as often as I should).</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After replacing the blades and the foil the razor works like new!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll live it!</li>
            <li>The shaver cuts much closer with the new blade set.</li>
            <li>I will buy the blades only (Panasonic WES9068PC, $17.82 at Amazon), and see if I can continue to use the same foil for an additional six months or more.</li>
            <li>Super simple.  </li>
            <li>It  felt like my shave was not getting very close with the old blades.  </li>
            <li>The reason for the replacement was, that after 7-8 months, the shave was becoming less close.</li>
            <li>Just like getting a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I buy a new set every 6 months or so.  </li>
            <li>This product makes it new again.  </li>
            <li>The new blades and the year</li>
            <li>NOW I HAVE A SPARE IN CASE NEW ONE BREAKS.</li>
            <li>However, I knew it was time for new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now it performs like new.  </li>
            <li>You are going to be amazed how much a new set of blades makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Makes my shaver feel like new.</li>
            <li>What else can you ask for from new blades and foil.</li>
            <li>New blades and foil help keep this razor shaving like new.  </li>
            <li>Guaranteed action!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even bother with bic&#x27;s unless you enjoy throwing money down the drain weekly.</li>
            <li>, I hopped on over to Amazon and was excited to find that I could get new razor blades and the foil for less than the foil was going for directly from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>True, I am diligent about rinsing the foil and blades clean by dumping out the cut hair daily, and rinsing them at least weekly.  </li>
            <li>old ones are not so far apart in sharpness.</li>
            <li>This was the first item in the search results, the picture looked like the right item, so I ordered it based on my past experience with Amazon search accuracy.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that these (as well as the original ones) do not seem to last as long as the user manual says they should.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>the shaver foil because my old one was loose,  and it was time to replace the blades.  </li>

            <li> However, I knew it was time for new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now it performs like new.  </li>
            <li> You are going to be amazed how much a new set of blades makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Makes my shaver feel like new.</li>
            <li> What else can you ask for from new blades and foil.</li>
            <li> New blades and foil help keep this razor shaving like new.  </li>
            <li> Guaranteed action!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with bic&#x27;s unless you enjoy throwing money down the drain weekly.</li>
            <li> , I hopped on over to Amazon and was excited to find that I could get new razor blades and the foil for less than the foil was going for directly from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> True, I am diligent about rinsing the foil and blades clean by dumping out the cut hair daily, and rinsing them at least weekly.  </li>
            <li> old ones are not so far apart in sharpness.</li>
            <li> This was the first item in the search results, the picture looked like the right item, so I ordered it based on my past experience with Amazon search accuracy.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that these (as well as the original ones) do not seem to last as long as the user manual says they should.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> the shaver foil because my old one was loose,  and it was time to replace the blades.  </li>
            <li> My old Braun&#x27;s had to be replaced every year at least..and the razor itself only lasted about 4 years or so on average.  </li>
            <li> This is my second replacement set and neither seems to work as well as or last as long as the set that the shaver came with.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wait so long next time.</li>
            <li> and I thought I was going to be out a few hundred dollars for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> Now, those little stubborn neck hairs I was having trouble getting without 7 - 10 strokes are getting cut off the first stroke, just like when the shaver was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> have replaced the foil a few times over the years buying the replacement part directly from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I waited way too long to replace these.  </li>
            <li> After 18 months with the same foil/blade combo, I didn&#x27;t realize how dull they had gotten until I put new ones in.  </li>
            <li> This product came earlier than expected, is as described, and works as expected.</li>
            <li> HARD TO TELL IF THE BLADES &amp; FOIL ARE AN IMPROVEMENT ON OLD ONES, BUT MAYBE&lt;</li>
            <li> I have a Panasonic ES8228 Shaver that I use for wet (shaving cream) shaves.</li>
            <li> The blades seem to stay sharp for about 8 months.</li>
            <li> It stays sharp and he doesnt have to go to the barber.</li>
            <li> But that is likely because of my thick, rough and fast-growing hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BLADES ARE PROBABLY NECESSARY - NO MORE LITTLE NICKS FOR NOW.&lt;br /&gt;FOIL</li>
            <li> The razor will now last at least another three years.</li>
            <li> A rip-off, but the only option is to use a blade razor.</li>
            <li> However, upon receipt, the foil does not fit my shaver.</li>
            <li> I only wish they were less expensive</li>
            <li> That time usually comes when I began to get a razor rash from using dule razor blades.</li>
            <li> Without sounding like I work for these companies, which I do not, I find that the blades begin to dull on the Panasonic way before the year is up.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, but it&#x27;s a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Amazon, especially since I had only returned 1 item in 4 years.</li>
            <li> They worked, too bad the razor only lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> was only a little cheaper and their customer service is absolutely HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Before this,no did not know how expensive replacement parts were for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have found nothing wrong with the blades over the years, thus I give them a 5 star rating..</li>
            <li> When it arrived I discovered it was the wrong item for this shaver.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I went on Panasonic&#x27;s website to look for replacement parts and they were very expensive</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this item.  </li>

            <li> Amazon service great - replacement blades and foil have worked well.  No problems.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Just like getting a new razor.  I have nothing bad to say about this item.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> They worked, too bad the razor only lasted 2 years. Went back to schick titaniums. Best blades for your money, last 3 times longer than bics.. Don&#x27;t even bother with bic&#x27;s unless you enjoy throwing money down the drain weekly.</li>
            <li> I buy a new set every 6 months or so.  Keeps my 80&#x27;s style porn look clean and trouble free!  Women appreciate a man who takes care of himself.  Guaranteed action!</li>
            <li> Husband loves this shaver. Will continue to order from you when need to. Thanks. Mary</li>
            <li> Panasonic vortex shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  This product makes it new again.  Saves money no blades or shaving cream to buy.</li>
            <li> I have had the Panasonic electric razor for almost two years and just now replaced the foil and cutter for the first time!  My old Braun&#x27;s had to be replaced every year at least..and the razor itself only lasted about 4 years or so on average.  So far this Panasonic has been fantastic...good close shave without any kind of razor burn.  Charges fast and holds a charge for almost two weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of replacements in just under three years. The shaver cuts much closer with the new blade set. The blades seem to stay sharp for about 8 months.</li>
            <li> This was my first foil/blades combo replacement on my Panasonic ES8228. I am very pleased -- the quality of the shave has been restored to when new.    The reason for the replacement was, that after 7-8 months, the shave was becoming less close. Evidently the blades were becoming dull, but the foil seemed to remain in excellent condition.     For my next replacement (8 months from now?) I will buy the blades only (Panasonic WES9068PC, $17.82 at Amazon), and see if I can continue to use the same foil for an additional six months or more.</li>
            <li> I bought this to restore the performance of the shaver and it just hasn&#x27;t been working as well as it should have. The new blades and the year old ones are not so far apart in sharpness. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> These are authentic replacement blades and foil from Panasonic. No complaints. Work as good as the original ones that came with the shaver. My only gripe is that these (as well as the original ones) do not seem to last as long as the user manual says they should. But that is likely because of my thick, rough and fast-growing hair.</li>
            <li> HARD TO TELL IF THE BLADES &amp; FOIL ARE AN IMPROVEMENT ON OLD ONES, BUT MAYBE&lt;br /&gt;BLADES ARE PROBABLY NECESSARY - NO MORE LITTLE NICKS FOR NOW.&lt;br /&gt;FOIL MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY, BUT NOW I HAVE A SPARE IN CASE NEW ONE BREAKS.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for a mans electric razor. if you have this razor you&#x27;ll need replacement heads. my son and husband both have this razor and they use it daily with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I was able to find the replacement parts I wanted thur the webpage for my razor, came in two days, at a good price.</li>
            <li> As expected, seems to shave better.......</li>
            <li> Bought this Panasonic razor for $250 from Brookstone over five years ago and love it. However, it recently stopped performing like it used to and I thought I was going to be out a few hundred dollars for a new electric razor. I went on Panasonic&#x27;s website to look for replacement parts and they were very expensive, I hopped on over to Amazon and was excited to find that I could get new razor blades and the foil for less than the foil was going for directly from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have replaced the foil a few times over the years buying the replacement part directly from Panasonic. I never thought to look on Amazon! The foil only lasts a year or two before the blades eat through the mesh (probably because I don&#x27;t clean the blades as often as I should). This was the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the razor blades though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After replacing the blades and the foil the razor works like new! Closest electric shave I&#x27;ve been able to achieve in years. It&#x27;s awesome. The razor will now last at least another three years. Well worth the $40, I just wish I realized Amazon had this product years ago.</li>
            <li> A rip-off, but the only option is to use a blade razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement and it worked perfectly and my shaver feels like new again. Would definately recomend to anyone looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> No problems. Fast shipping, great prices (the best I could find online!) and good quality.. Will definitely order from this company again..  PS don&#x27;t order from videodirect.com - I had so many problems with this company and the same product was only a little cheaper and their customer service is absolutely HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Great Product  Great Price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES8228 wet/dry electric shaver for about 5 years. It&#x27;s been totally reliable and gives me consistently great shaves.   This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this replacement pack. My shaver will operate like new again and my face will be happy for another few years.   Panasonic makes a quality shaver that travels well and gives me exactly what I need from a shaver - consistently great, comfortable shaves, quickly and without any residual razor burn. It recharges rapidly and the cleaning/self-sharpening cycle is also great. Get one. You&#x27;ll live it!</li>
            <li> My husband is happy with the purchase of the refills. It stays sharp and he doesnt have to go to the barber.</li>
            <li> Great combo product which we order twice a year.  This is a great razor and a perfect way to package the replacement blades and foil.  Thanks Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nice to have new again, after shaving with the old cutters &amp; screen for so long.  My face is happy.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t changed the blades on my shaver in almost two years.  True, I am diligent about rinsing the foil and blades clean by dumping out the cut hair daily, and rinsing them at least weekly.  Plus, I have a pretty light beard except on my neck (of course, right where it&#x27;s hardest to shave!).  However, I knew it was time for new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered these, and the changeover took about 1 minute.  Super simple.  Now, those little stubborn neck hairs I was having trouble getting without 7 - 10 strokes are getting cut off the first stroke, just like when the shaver was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t replace the shaver...replace the foil and blades and save money and your skin.</li>
            <li> After 18 months with the same foil/blade combo, I didn&#x27;t realize how dull they had gotten until I put new ones in.  Wow!  It makes a huge difference.  If your shaver is taking longer and longer to give you a good shave, consider this to bring it back to like-new condition.  I only wish they were less expensive - the parts don&#x27;t look like they cost that much to manufacture.</li>
            <li> Excellent and the price is right!  Cuts close to the face for a nice shave.  We have order several of the Foil heads.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic WES9014PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set fits the shaver perfectly and works as would be expected.  At a discounted price of almost $50,which is a about a third of the price of the actual shaver, I feel its over priced.</li>
            <li> I replace the head and blades on my electric razor when I remember to do so. That time usually comes when I began to get a razor rash from using dule razor blades. It always amazes me how great it feels to shave with a new set of blades and new heads.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> It  felt like my shave was not getting very close with the old blades.  So I replaced them and while it didn&#x27;t make a noticeable impact on how close my shave was, it did &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; better during the shave.</li>
            <li> I have owned three of these Panasonic electric razors and rather than replacing foil and blades I would replace razor. Used replacements this morning and cut shaving time by 30% and the shave was as close as a straight razor. It seemed better than new. I won&#x27;t wait two years again and will replace every six months. This is still cheaper than the cost of razor blades today.</li>
            <li> Ordered a replacement after the screen wore through on the original head.  Fits perfect and cuts like new again.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL PARTS, FAIR PRICE</li>
            <li> Great service/fast shipping.</li>
            <li> right product . I am happy</li>
            <li> This product came earlier than expected, is as described, and works as expected.</li>
            <li> So much better than buying elsewhere. Before this,no did not know how expensive replacement parts were for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Of all the razors I&#x27;ve purchased - this one works the best. And I love it that the replacement parts are available.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying a whole new razor.  Amazing what a difference it made in the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a head more substancial...not plastic.  Will not be ordering this item again.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace the foil on my razor, the original began to scratch my face.  The replacement was damaged after the 1st cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is my second replacement set and neither seems to work as well as or last as long as the set that the shaver came with. It works well enough, but it&#x27;s a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have a Panasonic ES8228 Shaver that I use for wet (shaving cream) shaves. I find that the Panasonic razor cuts almost as close as my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor. Without sounding like I work for these companies, which I do not, I find that the blades begin to dull on the Panasonic way before the year is up. Probably my beard. I do use this Panasonic a good more than the Fusion due to the cost of replacement blades. Yikes! I replace the Panasonic blades once every 9 months instead of yearly. I feel I get a better shave under this system. I have found nothing wrong with the blades over the years, thus I give them a 5 star rating..</li>
            <li> This is a replacement set for electric razor which I replace once a year and is consistent with original parts.</li>
            <li> I waited way too long to replace these.  I hadn&#x27;t realized how much the performance of my shaver had deteriorated.  Now it performs like new.  I won&#x27;t wait so long next time.</li>
            <li> Foils and blades wear down over time, and this is an excellent replacement to my Dad&#x27;s Panasonic shaver. Just as good as new!</li>
            <li> Ordered it and received it in short order.&lt;br /&gt;Got it and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Had no problems. many thanks. g</li>
            <li> Did not seem to be an improvement over the shave of the original blades, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is one thing that I need to do more often:  change my razor foil and blade.  I&#x27;m glad that the replacments are still available on amazon for my old razor.  Easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the description listed on Amazon. When it arrived I discovered it was the wrong item for this shaver. When I asked to return it so I could order the correct item neither the reseller or Amazon would allow the return because it was open. I opened it because I thought it was the right piece and only then did I learn that it didn&#x27;t fit the shaver head. Very disappointed in Amazon, especially since I had only returned 1 item in 4 years.</li>
            <li> After purchase I noticed a huge difference in the quality and closeness of my shave.  I have had my original foil and blade set from my purchase back in 2009.  I oiled and cared for them regularly, but like all things wear-and-tear created tears in the foil and the blades just were not as sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of this purchase like changing your toothbrush after a period.  You are going to be amazed how much a new set of blades makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly, and gave new life to a well-used razor</li>
            <li> I recommend replacing this on your razor at least once a year if you have a light stubble like mine, more often if you have a thicker beard.</li>
            <li> I searched for a replacement foil and blade using the specific model # for my shaver.  This was the first item in the search results, the picture looked like the right item, so I ordered it based on my past experience with Amazon search accuracy. However, upon receipt, the foil does not fit my shaver. The blades are the same, so it wasn&#x27;t a total loss. After researching, the listing does not refer to my shave model at all, so I don&#x27;t understand why the search results included it. Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> Works great with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great as a replacement for my razor although the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> This combo replacement shaver foil and blade set is the exact replacement for my Panasonic shaver.  I needed to&lt;br /&gt;replace the shaver foil because my old one was loose,  and it was time to replace the blades.  This set fit my shaver&lt;br /&gt;perfectly and I am very satisfied.  If you have a Panasonic shaver model ES8228,  this should work for you.  Amazon had&lt;br /&gt;the best price that I could find!</li>
            <li> The combo replacement shaver foil and blade set it nicely packaged to prevent damage when shipping.  The product itself is a wonderful product.  The shaver foil fits perfectly and the blades are very simple to change.  The blades are of good quality and last almost a year before needing to be replaced. The blades give a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace, worked great and arrived on time. If you ever need to replace your shaver head this is the place to go.</li>
            <li> Makes my shaver feel like new. What else can you ask for from new blades and foil. If you need some, get them.</li>
            <li> great item. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> great quality, it last and never brakes.I wish they made cars.</li>
            <li> Quick service product is perfect</li>
            <li> New blades and foil help keep this razor shaving like new.  I did not get new ones last year and still was getting a good shave each morning</li>
