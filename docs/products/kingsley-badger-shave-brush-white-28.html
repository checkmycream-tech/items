            <li>and I&#x27;m quite happy about that.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaving brush.  </li>

            <li>This brush is a good brush.</li>
            <li>I assume all is good with his shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a morning ritual now for me that gives superior results.</li>
            <li>I believe my shave is slightly better but even if it&#x27;s just enjoyment going up slightly, it&#x27;s a win for</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have a couple $150 brushes and they lose hair all the time, so I decided to buy a cheaper badger brush and glad I Did!</li>
            <li>Looked for a nice brush and Found this one.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and google &amp;#34;Whipped Dog.&amp;#34; For $5-10 more you can get a MUCH superior custom-made Silvertip badger with specs to your liking.</li>
            <li>Brush fits nicely into my stand with my DE razor.</li>
            <li>It has not lost one bristle and lathers up nicely.  </li>
            <li>So nice to have a warm shave every morning.  </li>
            <li>It has held up well and has a nice feel on your face unlike some bristle brushes that can be prickly.</li>
            <li>Very good purchase and for the quality and price, was right on.</li>
            <li>Appears exactly as advertised in photo, a good looking brush, great value.</li>
            <li>He (and I) couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>Brush bristles are soft and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>it was very smooth sailing for a time</li>
            <li>However this brush is also more effective at creating a nice rich lather.</li>
            <li>Works up a wonderful lather from my Taylor shave creams and same for some soaps I have.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has history too, which I love.</li>
            <li>I felt using a brush did raise the hairs on my face more than applying shaving soap with your hand.     </li>
            <li>And i love it.</li>
            <li>so i dont know if can find something better or not.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding shaving shaving brush for the money.  </li>
            <li>What more do you want in a brush?</li>
            <li>All the bristles stay in and I look forward to getting a lot more uses out of it.</li>
            <li>This brush holds up well and has just the right bristle type to help produce a good lather.</li>
            <li>This is the first shave brush I purchased (thanks to Jack Passion, again), and it does a wonderful job for my face.</li>
            <li>It worked up a nice later and is a great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, makes a great lather, perfect size and after two months has not lost a single bristle.  </li>
            <li>early on - even great brushes do.</li>
            <li>I used it with taylor of old bond street and it whipped up a great lather.</li>
            <li>There are better brushes for sure and shaving snobs will attest to that but for price and quality it is not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>this one is my favorite brush, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great brush at a very reasonable cost!</li>
            <li>I think this brush is just as nice as some of the $50+ higher end models with the fancy titanium handles or whatever.</li>
            <li>Seems to work just fine for him, but it will have to be replaced in order to match.</li>
            <li>The bristles are fine.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful little brush is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Contributes to a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic brush for $32 to $35.</li>
            <li>easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>The foaming is fantastic, gald</li>
            <li>It is smooth for the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying it with a variety of creams and they all seem to go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and offers great quality at a much more reasonable price that in a fancy shaving retail store.</li>
            <li>This is great for old fashioned shavers like me who prefer to use real shaving cream and a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I then bought this this, it has lost maybe 5 bristles and makes a rich lather quickly.</li>
            <li>My husband is thrilled with the brush and indeed commented that it feels soft (not scratchy) on his face, but the bristles still return to their correct upright position.</li>
            <li>Whips up a nice lather with the Old Bond st.</li>
            <li>The badger is so much softer and, I feel, gives you a better lather.  </li>
            <li>You literally would have to spend well over twice as much to buy a better brush.</li>
            <li>But all in all you cannot beat it for the price, the silver tip will cost you a about double in a good brush.</li>
            <li>Luckily-</li>
            <li>Recommend rinsing it with a mild detergent before use.</li>
            <li>However once I used it I quickly realized that this is a quality product.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty good mid range starter brush.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s used it every day for over a year and the bristles are still intact, and still have that perfect, soft yet firm texture.</li>
            <li>100% worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t shed more than a couple of bristles/hairs so far</li>
            <li>This brush has totally changed by shaving from drudgery to a nice morning happening.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t have other brushes I can compare it to, but it did just fine applying the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Kingsley Badger has just the right stiffness/softness for my shaving needs.</li>
            <li>Price is right too.</li>
            <li>I would not be surprised to find out that many wet-shavers like the Kingsley brush(es); maybe not the exact same one, but a Kingsley for sure.</li>
            <li>He finds the badger fur far superior to the boar bristles on his last brush.  </li>
            <li>So far it is working fine.</li>
            <li>It holds water very well, fluffs up with a very fine and soft bubble foam, and applies it to my face gently and smoothly - much better than my last brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and smooth on his skin.  </li>
            <li>I have lost some bristles, not too many, and that is my only reason for the 4 out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>If you looking for your first shave brush you can buy this.</li>
            <li>Works fine for me and no loose hairs.</li>
            <li>This is my first shave brush and it seems to perform very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months, hasn&#x27;t lost a single bristle and gets better with each use.</li>
            <li>I am probably different from most, but i like the brush to smell a bit like a wild animal at first in order to appreciate where it came from.</li>
            <li>I kind of expected the handle to have a little more heft to it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s real badger hair which came off an animal, people.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have used this for 18 months now and can report that it is a real pleasure.</li>
            <li>It is very well built, with no hair loss during use.</li>
            <li>This brush is of a much higher quality and its bristles do a much better job of producing lather and working it into my beard than the brushes previously used.</li>
            <li>It works great and hopefully will last a long time with proper care.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a brush stand with this to make sure it dries with the bristles aiming down.</li>
            <li>It may not seem like much, but I feel like I have to hold the new one with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>Expected it to sit in the nice holder I ordered on a white tile counter.</li>
            <li>the Kingsley Badger Shave Brush White (not really white, more like cream) # 28.</li>
            <li>Very soft, real badger hair.</li>
            <li>To be brutally honest, this is not a good brush at all if you know what&#x27;s available out there for a similar price.</li>
            <li>What a change from using the high priced razors.</li>
            <li>After reading about most of the brushes (I did not consider the most or least expensive ones), I decided on the Kingsley Badger    brush because I had heard the badger bristles were kind to the face.</li>
            <li>It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to, it hasn&#x27;t lots many bristles in this week since I&#x27;ve had it and came with surprisingly little smell.</li>
            <li>The hairs are soft and yet don&#x27;t absorb too much water.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as I expected, a cheap alternative to the $50</li>
            <li>have yet to use a $100+ brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine it being much nicer as far as using</li>
            <li>This is normal and goes away over time.</li>
            <li>It was definitely different using a brush to apply shaving cream, but I think I will continue to enjoy the experience in the future.</li>
            <li>I have been using shaving brushes purchased in the drugstore for several years and have not really been satisfied with their quality or the lather they produced.  </li>
            <li>Yes, this is the correct brush to order for those who are interested in a real shave, such as one only finds with a straight razor or a high-quality safety razor.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS VERY SOFT AGAINST THE SKIN.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger shaving brush, which I purchased, just a couple of weeks back.</li>
            <li>The difference between this brush and the boar brush from the local pharmacy is pretty substantial.  </li>
            <li>As so many writers of facial hair keep saying over and over again is that no two faces are alike so no two people are likely to like the same brush (or anything else for that matter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a small brush, so it would be a great little brush for travel.</li>
            <li>The diameter of the new one (#28) is 1 1/4 inch whereas the old Kingsley was 1 1/2.  </li>
            <li>However, the feel of this original badger hairs is relatively soft and soothing, when compared to boar hair and other brushes.</li>
            <li>The other good things about this brush is that it dries relatively faster, looks cool, and small enough for my travel kit.</li>
            <li>Overall a very high quality item for the price.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t lost one bristle and is still soft.  </li>
            <li>About the brush itself, it is not heavy.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Rinse the brush out, shake it, and it will be ready for the next day.</li>
            <li>It is worth the $25 I spent.</li>
            <li>This is my first time getting back into doing a traditional shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this is to be expected at first with animal hair brush.</li>
            <li>I recently searched Amazon for a shaving brush for my husband after unsuccessfully trying to find one in several different stores where I had previously been able to buy him shaving equipment.</li>
            <li>It might not win any style or beauty contests, but for everyday use, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a major upgrade for</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little short for my larger hands, small handle and short bristles, but it performs great.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old shaving brush that I had had for some years that was finally falling apart.</li>
            <li>When you first start using it, it may give off some odd scent.</li>
            <li>Had a slight critter odor to it at first, but that went away after a couple uses and rinsing.</li>
            <li>No loose bristles after 30 days.</li>
            <li>This one feels a little pointy as the hair is a little more coarse than the silver tip&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is significantly better than the not much less expensive variety to be found in CVS and the like</li>
            <li>It will smell a little during the first several uses.</li>
            <li>AFTER A LITTLE RINSE AND A FEW SHAKES, IT DRIES VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I switched from the Mach 5 to an old single edge safety razor and do not regret it at all.</li>
            <li>As a pure badger, I was expecting this brush to be a little &amp;#34;scritchy.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> He&#x27;s used it every day for over a year and the bristles are still intact, and still have that perfect, soft yet firm texture.</li>
            <li> 100% worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t shed more than a couple of bristles/hairs so far</li>
            <li> This brush has totally changed by shaving from drudgery to a nice morning happening.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t have other brushes I can compare it to, but it did just fine applying the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Kingsley Badger has just the right stiffness/softness for my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Price is right too.</li>
            <li> I would not be surprised to find out that many wet-shavers like the Kingsley brush(es); maybe not the exact same one, but a Kingsley for sure.</li>
            <li> He finds the badger fur far superior to the boar bristles on his last brush.  </li>
            <li> So far it is working fine.</li>
            <li> It holds water very well, fluffs up with a very fine and soft bubble foam, and applies it to my face gently and smoothly - much better than my last brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and smooth on his skin.  </li>
            <li> I have lost some bristles, not too many, and that is my only reason for the 4 out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> If you looking for your first shave brush you can buy this.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me and no loose hairs.</li>
            <li> This is my first shave brush and it seems to perform very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months, hasn&#x27;t lost a single bristle and gets better with each use.</li>
            <li> I am probably different from most, but i like the brush to smell a bit like a wild animal at first in order to appreciate where it came from.</li>
            <li> I kind of expected the handle to have a little more heft to it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s real badger hair which came off an animal, people.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used this for 18 months now and can report that it is a real pleasure.</li>
            <li> It is very well built, with no hair loss during use.</li>
            <li> This brush is of a much higher quality and its bristles do a much better job of producing lather and working it into my beard than the brushes previously used.</li>
            <li> It works great and hopefully will last a long time with proper care.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a brush stand with this to make sure it dries with the bristles aiming down.</li>
            <li> It may not seem like much, but I feel like I have to hold the new one with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> Expected it to sit in the nice holder I ordered on a white tile counter.</li>
            <li> the Kingsley Badger Shave Brush White (not really white, more like cream) # 28.</li>
            <li> Very soft, real badger hair.</li>
            <li> To be brutally honest, this is not a good brush at all if you know what&#x27;s available out there for a similar price.</li>
            <li> What a change from using the high priced razors.</li>
            <li> After reading about most of the brushes (I did not consider the most or least expensive ones), I decided on the Kingsley Badger    brush because I had heard the badger bristles were kind to the face.</li>
            <li> It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to, it hasn&#x27;t lots many bristles in this week since I&#x27;ve had it and came with surprisingly little smell.</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft and yet don&#x27;t absorb too much water.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as I expected, a cheap alternative to the $50</li>
            <li> have yet to use a $100+ brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine it being much nicer as far as using</li>
            <li> This is normal and goes away over time.</li>
            <li> It was definitely different using a brush to apply shaving cream, but I think I will continue to enjoy the experience in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using shaving brushes purchased in the drugstore for several years and have not really been satisfied with their quality or the lather they produced.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this is the correct brush to order for those who are interested in a real shave, such as one only finds with a straight razor or a high-quality safety razor.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS VERY SOFT AGAINST THE SKIN.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger shaving brush, which I purchased, just a couple of weeks back.</li>
            <li> The difference between this brush and the boar brush from the local pharmacy is pretty substantial.  </li>
            <li> As so many writers of facial hair keep saying over and over again is that no two faces are alike so no two people are likely to like the same brush (or anything else for that matter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a small brush, so it would be a great little brush for travel.</li>
            <li> The diameter of the new one (#28) is 1 1/4 inch whereas the old Kingsley was 1 1/2.  </li>
            <li> However, the feel of this original badger hairs is relatively soft and soothing, when compared to boar hair and other brushes.</li>
            <li> The other good things about this brush is that it dries relatively faster, looks cool, and small enough for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> Overall a very high quality item for the price.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t lost one bristle and is still soft.  </li>
            <li> About the brush itself, it is not heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Rinse the brush out, shake it, and it will be ready for the next day.</li>
            <li> It is worth the $25 I spent.</li>
            <li> This is my first time getting back into doing a traditional shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this is to be expected at first with animal hair brush.</li>
            <li> I recently searched Amazon for a shaving brush for my husband after unsuccessfully trying to find one in several different stores where I had previously been able to buy him shaving equipment.</li>
            <li> It might not win any style or beauty contests, but for everyday use, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a major upgrade for</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little short for my larger hands, small handle and short bristles, but it performs great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old shaving brush that I had had for some years that was finally falling apart.</li>
            <li> When you first start using it, it may give off some odd scent.</li>
            <li> Had a slight critter odor to it at first, but that went away after a couple uses and rinsing.</li>
            <li> No loose bristles after 30 days.</li>
            <li> This one feels a little pointy as the hair is a little more coarse than the silver tip&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is significantly better than the not much less expensive variety to be found in CVS and the like</li>
            <li> It will smell a little during the first several uses.</li>
            <li> AFTER A LITTLE RINSE AND A FEW SHAKES, IT DRIES VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I switched from the Mach 5 to an old single edge safety razor and do not regret it at all.</li>
            <li> As a pure badger, I was expecting this brush to be a little &amp;#34;scritchy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the lather it generates out of gel is very ordinary in amount, which can easily be produced by any other XYZ shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Lost a few bristles footer the first week (30-40) but haven&#x27;t lost a single one since then.</li>
            <li> The first was this very poorly made one from a certain big box company.</li>
            <li> And it will certainly lose a small number of bristles</li>
            <li> Note that another review mentioned that the brush would not loose hairs and it did loose one or two.</li>
            <li> But the handle is much too small.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff enough to stir up lots of lather, but still soft on the face.  </li>
            <li> I am not displeased with this product though, and I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but firm badger hair.</li>
            <li> too bad because the bristles were very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush, had  a horrible smell from the hair when I received it, especially when first wet it smells like  a wet dog on your face.</li>
            <li> I can say that I have been using it for over a month and have not lost a single hair from it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> How is your experience with other soap and creme.</li>
            <li> I do usually use a Boar brush for soaps, but overall-</li>
            <li> The small size is actually an advantage, it&#x27;s easier to control applying the lather to your face.  </li>
            <li> Very few hairs lost initially- like 4 or 5.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with a boar brush and moved up to the Kingsley after a few months.  </li>
            <li> In fact if you use a tight circular motion the lather is further improved and the scratching is reduced to the point of being hardly noticable.</li>
            <li> When I received this brush I was a bit disappointed in that it is small and light.  </li>
            <li> few things to know; it is boiled and sterilized during production</li>
            <li> It takes quite some effort to spread the lather evenly and at the end still holds plenty of undistributed lather destined to be wasted.  </li>
            <li> But I shampooed it a few times and the smell dissipated some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a few months.</li>
            <li> Not easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that in fact the brush is quite scratchy relative to my previous purchase from a different vendor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for two years and use it at least 4x a week.  </li>
            <li> It is not too expensive and holds together as well as can expected.</li>
            <li> I mean, a shaving brush is a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> No more cans of crap, I am totally converted.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise and delight when I found approximately 50 brushes to choose from!</li>
            <li> It also does not feel cold, like metal handles.</li>
            <li> The lackluster density of this brush is what was really disappointing.</li>
            <li> I got one of these brushes from a guy on Ebay who felt bad about using animal hair from a badger.  </li>
            <li> The base seems to be well constructed and fits well in the hand.</li>

            <li> Excellent brush. Very soft, real badger hair. When you first start using it, it may give off some odd scent. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s real badger hair which came off an animal, people. Just rinse it out well after each time you use it, and the smell will be gone in no time.    The handle is very nice ivory coloured plastic. Will not warp or crack like wooden handles can do. It also does not feel cold, like metal handles.</li>
            <li> I will get my merkur 34c Monday night and I have astra blades coming.  I have the badger brush from the van den hagen set at Walgreen&#x27;s.  They have derby merkur and Wilkinson sword blades for order and can ship to store.  Walgreen&#x27;s has a Kingsley brush pearlized for 35  dollars.  I&#x27;ll probably order it.  What do you think of the brush.  And I have been using the Miro touch one.  The shaving soap I use is van der hagen.  How is your experience with other soap and creme.</li>
            <li> I recently searched Amazon for a shaving brush for my husband after unsuccessfully trying to find one in several different stores where I had previously been able to buy him shaving equipment. Imagine my surprise and delight when I found approximately 50 brushes to choose from! After reading about most of the brushes (I did not consider the most or least expensive ones), I decided on the Kingsley Badger    brush because I had heard the badger bristles were kind to the face. My husband is thrilled with the brush and indeed commented that it feels soft (not scratchy) on his face, but the bristles still return to their correct upright position. He (and I) couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> This is a must for anyone trying shaving cream. It really makes a difference. The hairs are soft and yet don&#x27;t absorb too much water. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got one of these brushes from a guy on Ebay who felt bad about using animal hair from a badger.  Luckily- I feel no remorse.  It is the best shave brush I have.  Works up a wonderful lather from my Taylor shave creams and same for some soaps I have.  I do usually use a Boar brush for soaps, but overall- this one is my favorite brush, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great brush at a very reasonable cost!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for two years and use it at least 4x a week.  It hasn&#x27;t lost one bristle and is still soft.  100% worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Contributes to a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush for $32 to $35. It holds water very well, fluffs up with a very fine and soft bubble foam, and applies it to my face gently and smoothly - much better than my last brush. I believe my shave is slightly better but even if it&#x27;s just enjoyment going up slightly, it&#x27;s a win for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to know; it is boiled and sterilized during production so don&#x27;t do that or you risk the handle cracking. It will smell a little during the first several uses. This is normal and goes away over time. And it will certainly lose a small number of bristles early on - even great brushes do. I haven&#x27;t had it shedding a bristle into my foam and that&#x27;s a major upgrade for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has history too, which I love. Five stars all around!</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush so I have nothing to compare it to,  I can say that I have been using it for over a month and have not lost a single hair from it. I reccomend it.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger shaving brush, which I purchased, just a couple of weeks back. So far it is working fine. It hasn&#x27;t shed more than a couple of bristles/hairs so far and I&#x27;m quite happy about that. My only issue is that the lather it generates out of gel is very ordinary in amount, which can easily be produced by any other XYZ shaving brush. It takes quite some effort to spread the lather evenly and at the end still holds plenty of undistributed lather destined to be wasted.  However, the feel of this original badger hairs is relatively soft and soothing, when compared to boar hair and other brushes. The other good things about this brush is that it dries relatively faster, looks cool, and small enough for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> This brush holds up well and has just the right bristle type to help produce a good lather. It is significantly better than the not much less expensive variety to be found in CVS and the like</li>
            <li> After looking at razor blade cartridge replacement costs, I decided to go with a safety razor and bought this brush for my venture. It was definitely different using a brush to apply shaving cream, but I think I will continue to enjoy the experience in the future. This brush is a good brush. I honestly don&#x27;t have other brushes I can compare it to, but it did just fine applying the shaving soap. I felt using a brush did raise the hairs on my face more than applying shaving soap with your hand.     About the brush itself, it is not heavy. I kind of expected the handle to have a little more heft to it. I am not displeased with this product though, and I hope it lasts a long time. I strayed away from buying one of the wood-handle brushes as I&#x27;ve read some reviews about the finish coming off of them. I would recommend getting a brush stand with this to make sure it dries with the bristles aiming down.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as an anniversary present and time was an issue. Expected it to sit in the nice holder I ordered on a white tile counter. It&#x27;s cream colored. I only selected this brush because it was listed as white and was badger hair. Seems to work just fine for him, but it will have to be replaced in order to match.</li>
            <li> This is my first shave brush and it seems to perform very well. Whips up a nice lather with the Old Bond st. shave cream I got with it. Very few hairs lost initially- like 4 or 5. Had a slight critter odor to it at first, but that went away after a couple uses and rinsing. Recommend rinsing it with a mild detergent before use. Appears exactly as advertised in photo, a good looking brush, great value.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, does not lose bristles, works great with canned shave creame, and excellent value for the price.  Made in the UK.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from my son on the brush. I assume all is good with his shaving brush.</li>
            <li> this was bought for my son-in-law and he did a lot of research before having me order it, he is very pleased with it</li>
            <li> I have had this for about two months and haven&#x27;t had any issues. easy to use and clean holds shape well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old shaving brush that I had had for some years that was finally falling apart. I have been pleasantly surprised. The bristles are soft but firm badger hair. The base seems to be well constructed and fits well in the hand. This is great for old fashioned shavers like me who prefer to use real shaving cream and a safety razor. I think this brush is just as nice as some of the $50+ higher end models with the fancy titanium handles or whatever. I mean, a shaving brush is a shaving brush. It might not win any style or beauty contests, but for everyday use, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Looked for a nice brush and Found this one. It works great and hopefully will last a long time with proper care. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!  He finds the badger fur far superior to the boar bristles on his last brush.  It&#x27;s so soft and smooth on his skin.  Also, the price was very attractive.</li>
            <li> Excellent feel and weight. The foaming is fantastic, gald I purchased this item. Very good purchase and for the quality and price, was right on.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush.  It&#x27;s stiff enough to stir up lots of lather, but still soft on the face.  It has only shed one hair since I&#x27;ve had it.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it does the trick. I switched from the Mach 5 to an old single edge safety razor and do not regret it at all. The brush works well and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> As a pure badger, I was expecting this brush to be a little &amp;#34;scritchy.&amp;#34; No problem there.The lackluster density of this brush is what was really disappointing. Do yourself a favor and google &amp;#34;Whipped Dog.&amp;#34; For $5-10 more you can get a MUCH superior custom-made Silvertip badger with specs to your liking. Go to the Badger and Blade Forum to get all the knowledge you&#x27;ll ever need about the perfect knot and loft sizes for your preferred lathering style. Wish someone gave me this advice before I purchased (and then returned) the Kingsley Badger Shave Brush White (not really white, more like cream) # 28. To be brutally honest, this is not a good brush at all if you know what&#x27;s available out there for a similar price.</li>
            <li> it was very smooth sailing for a time and then the bristles began to fall out amking it cumbersome to shave.  too bad because the bristles were very soft and smooth.  can&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with a boar brush and moved up to the Kingsley after a few months.  The difference between this brush and the boar brush from the local pharmacy is pretty substantial.  The badger is so much softer and, I feel, gives you a better lather.  I have lost some bristles, not too many, and that is my only reason for the 4 out of 5 stars.  For the cost, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as I expected, a cheap alternative to the $50 models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little short for my larger hands, small handle and short bristles, but it performs great.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this shave brush. He&#x27;s used it every day for over a year and the bristles are still intact, and still have that perfect, soft yet firm texture.</li>
            <li> This is the first shave brush I purchased (thanks to Jack Passion, again), and it does a wonderful job for my face. As so many writers of facial hair keep saying over and over again is that no two faces are alike so no two people are likely to like the same brush (or anything else for that matter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Kingsley Badger has just the right stiffness/softness for my shaving needs. I would not be surprised to find out that many wet-shavers like the Kingsley brush(es); maybe not the exact same one, but a Kingsley for sure.</li>
            <li> Lost a few bristles footer the first week (30-40) but haven&#x27;t lost a single one since then. Brush fits nicely into my stand with my DE razor.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable brush! I have close to 60 shaves with this brush and hasnt lost any hair, Im very impressed. I have a couple $150 brushes and they lose hair all the time, so I decided to buy a cheaper badger brush and glad I Did! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I would purchase this again. It is pretty good mid range starter brush. It is not too expensive and holds together as well as can expected. It has not flared out out repeated use nor lost a lot of bristles. It is smooth for the face.  There are better brushes for sure and shaving snobs will attest to that but for price and quality it is not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> It was to replace my husbands brush.  He&#x27;s very pleased.</li>
            <li> This brush has totally changed by shaving from drudgery to a nice morning happening.  Using  &amp;#34;Kiss My Face&amp;#34; key lime and this brush I get an amazing close shave with a wonderful feeling as I apply the warm shaving soap.  No more cans of crap, I am totally converted.</li>
            <li> Wonderful little brush is just what I wanted. Brush bristles are soft and the size is perfect. No loose bristles after 30 days.</li>
            <li> And i love it. Women&#x27;s can go to the beauty saloon and i have mine shave set. I never used this shaving style before so i dont know if can find something better or not. What i can say is i use it from February and i don&#x27;t see any lost hair, smell or problem with it. If you looking for your first shave brush you can buy this.</li>
            <li> I have been using a brush and lather shave soap for over 20 years.  When I received this brush I was a bit disappointed in that it is small and light.  However once I used it I quickly realized that this is a quality product.  It has not lost one bristle and lathers up nicely.  The small size is actually an advantage, it&#x27;s easier to control applying the lather to your face.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is the correct brush to order for those who are interested in a real shave, such as one only finds with a straight razor or a high-quality safety razor.  This stimulates the face and whiskers and brings your bristles to attention for the best quality shave you can get.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding shaving shaving brush for the money.  It&#x27;s soft, makes a great lather, perfect size and after two months has not lost a single bristle.  You literally would have to spend well over twice as much to buy a better brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, had  a horrible smell from the hair when I received it, especially when first wet it smells like  a wet dog on your face. But I shampooed it a few times and the smell dissipated some. I&#x27;m guessing this is to be expected at first with animal hair brush.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me and no loose hairs. What more do you want in a brush? Price is right too.</li>
            <li> After years of using shaving cream in a can I decided to go back to brush and soap.  So nice to have a warm shave every morning.  The Kingsley brush works well in lathering up the soap.  Rinse the brush out, shake it, and it will be ready for the next day.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 18 months now and can report that it is a real pleasure. It has held up well and has a nice feel on your face unlike some bristle brushes that can be prickly.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with this. It worked up a nice later and is a great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months, hasn&#x27;t lost a single bristle and gets better with each use.</li>
            <li> The bristles are fine.  It replaces an ancient Kingsley Badger Shave Brush.  But the handle is much too small.  The diameter of the new one (#28) is 1 1/4 inch whereas the old Kingsley was 1 1/2.  It may not seem like much, but I feel like I have to hold the new one with my fingertips.  Not easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> ...but I like this brush.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month with no bristle loss.  I&#x27;ve been trying it with a variety of creams and they all seem to go on smoothly.  No complaints.  I&#x27;ll update in a few months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to replace another that I left at a hotel. One of the reasons I purchased this brush was because of a review that emphasized how it would not scratch your skin. I was disappointed to find that in fact the brush is quite scratchy relative to my previous purchase from a different vendor. However this brush is also more effective at creating a nice rich lather. In fact if you use a tight circular motion the lather is further improved and the scratching is reduced to the point of being hardly noticable. I am keeping this brush, but not for the reason I purchased it. Note that another review mentioned that the brush would not loose hairs and it did loose one or two. Not an issue for me. The balance of the brush and the precision when covering is excellent. I wish there was a 3.5 star mark.</li>
            <li> HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BRUSH MANS AND ALWAYS WILL. THIS IS VERY SOFT AGAINST THE SKIN. AFTER A LITTLE RINSE AND A FEW SHAKES, IT DRIES VERY QUICKLY. FITS WELL IN THE MISSION STYLE WOOD RAZOR AND BRUSH STAND.</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush does the job. All the bristles stay in and I look forward to getting a lot more uses out of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using shaving brushes purchased in the drugstore for several years and have not really been satisfied with their quality or the lather they produced.  This brush is of a much higher quality and its bristles do a much better job of producing lather and working it into my beard than the brushes previously used.</li>
            <li> It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to, it hasn&#x27;t lots many bristles in this week since I&#x27;ve had it and came with surprisingly little smell. I am probably different from most, but i like the brush to smell a bit like a wild animal at first in order to appreciate where it came from. All in all, I recommend this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my second brush. The first was this very poorly made one from a certain big box company. It could not make lather and lost a lot of bristles. I then bought this this, it has lost maybe 5 bristles and makes a rich lather quickly. It is worth the $25 I spent.</li>
            <li> This is a small brush, so it would be a great little brush for travel. I used it with taylor of old bond street and it whipped up a great lather. I guess I&#x27;m spoiled because of using silver tip badger that is a lot softer than the bristle in this brush. This one feels a little pointy as the hair is a little more coarse than the silver tip&#x27;s. But all in all you cannot beat it for the price, the silver tip will cost you a about double in a good brush.</li>
            <li> After having my Tweezerman brush come apart twice, I purchased this one.  Ibve had it a couple of months and to date it&#x27;s been a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to use a $100+ brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine it being much nicer as far as using it goes.</li>
            <li> This brush met my expectations.  It is exactly as described and offers great quality at a much more reasonable price that in a fancy shaving retail store.</li>
            <li> This is my first time getting back into doing a traditional shaving experience. What a change from using the high priced razors. It&#x27;s a morning ritual now for me that gives superior results. I went with this brush because of the solid reviews it received. It is very well built, with no hair loss during use. Overall a very high quality item for the price.</li>
