            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.    </li>
            <li>Use it consistently and be patient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Retin A before and while it is effective, it is really really pricey and can be very drying (even the low dose).  </li>
            <li>but before I could see real results my skin got an allergic reaction against it.</li>
            <li>but they weren&#x27;t working very well.</li>

            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>You may expreince a light circle agound your dark spots if the cream spreads beyond the affected area.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I also use it on melasma after pregnancy (I have been pregnant many times, only to miscarry) and other dark patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>I had old acne scars and some discloration from the sun</li>
            <li>I wish they would not have changed the old version.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a week so far.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised and this is a product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I used to have a face full of dark spots.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take long, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll disappear overnight.</li>
            <li>it is being shipped, sometimes the little matrix is shaken up a bit, but it is still useful.  </li>
            <li>Unbelievable, the way it fades spots so quickly.</li>
            <li>I purchased it thinking that it was regular strength, and it caused me major skin irritation and some damage.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my sister recommended it for my dark spots, but I haven&#x27;t been using it much.  </li>

            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I cannot write about how effective is against spots, but, it dries the skin in a terrible way.</li>

            <li> I have tried everything to removed ance scar from my face, i am bi-racial so you can just imagine how terrible my face looked with all of those dark marks, i was using a product for some time and I did not see any result so i was ready to move to find something better. After readying the reviews i decided to try this product, it was amazing i started seeing results in one week, my skin is soooo beautiful i don&#x27;t have to wear make-up to hide my blemishes. i feel so empowered this has become my favorite skin \\&quot;can&#x27;t do without\\&quot;. i recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I absolute LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve been looking for this gel in drug stores in my area, which seem to have discountinued it but I am lucky to find it on Amazon. It works...I had old acne scars and some discloration from the sun but after a week I see the difference in my skin tone. I would definitely purchase this gel in the future.</li>
            <li> I used this gel for about 3 weeks. I think my scars faded a bit but before I could see real results my skin got an allergic reaction against it. Now I have to say, that I really have sensitive skin and I should have known that before but my skin kept reacting to this product even after I took a shower. I had to use a peeling to at least get everything off so that my skin can calm down.&lt;br /&gt;I think it works well (if you have patience) with people who are not very sensitive when it comes to putting something like that on their skin every day but it is definitely not for someone like me:((</li>
            <li> This is the only product I found to get rid of the dark marks (from Acne) on my face. It&#x27;s cheap and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this is a gel so once it dries the gel stays in it&#x27;s place. Cream products tend to spread giving you the halo effect. You may expreince a light circle agound your dark spots if the cream spreads beyond the affected area. You will not have this pproblem with this gel. It comes with a application stick that I never used because my spots were to small, so I used the tip of a bobbi pin to apply it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have suffered with acne scars forever. I have tried getting rid of them naturally with shea butter, honey and other crazy home concotions but they weren&#x27;t working very well. I have even used Clinique&#x27;s Even Better skin corrector (expensive) and I have not had the results that I have had with this product. This product does work. I wear mac foundation and now that I have used this product for a month I don&#x27;t even have to wear make up anymore and this was what I have been striving for. I am thrilled!! I put it on at night and even during the day but I make sure to put on a sunscreen everyday. I use the Neutrogena Visibly Even moisturizer with spf 30 and my skin glows. I also do coffee scrubs and regular steam facials at home and my skin is smooth and soft. Try it...you will be amazed. But don&#x27;t expect results over night. Just stick with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my sister recommended it for my dark spots, but I haven&#x27;t been using it much.  You can&#x27;t wear it and go outside.  So put it on when your about to go to sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I actually tested this on my upper chest before my face. I had a couple of dark spots there and it worked. I have not tried it on my face as though I am currently on the acne.org regimen and I read that the ingredients in this can interfere with the BP treatment. But this product really works. And I didn&#x27;t notice it until a month later..but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was working in a couple weeks. I used it twice daily.</li>
            <li> i got this and i was excited to get this and try it out. i applied it and the next morning i had red spots where i applied it. my skin was an uneven red and it was horrible. it made my face worse. i cant even use it. waste of money. this product is horrible! it ruined my face</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for over 10 years and the darkness that was once a problem around my eyes is hardly noticeabe at all. I remember how people would stare and think I had gotten a black eye earlier that was clearing up.  NOW those stares NEVER happen.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.    I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t break me out at all.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it off and on for years. I used to have a face full of dark spots.  Now, they&#x27;re almost 95% gone. Still working on my chin, so I need to order one more little bottle. I swear by it. If you are sincere about removing age/dark spots, this is your product.  Use it consistently and be patient.  It really doesn&#x27;t take long, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll disappear overnight.</li>
            <li> I wish they would not have changed the old version. The new one is not as good as the old one so I switched to something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week so far. I cannot write about how effective is against spots, but, it dries the skin in a terrible way. Wow!</li>
            <li> I purchased the fade cream after a friend told me that she had been using it for fading blimishes she had on her face from acne scares, waxing, and tweezing. I skeptically bought the fade gel, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results until at least four weeks of using the product. I have been using the product for about 10 days now, and by the fourth day, I could tell a difference in the blemish marks on my face. I am pleasantly surprised and this is a product that I will continue to use. I have use many of black opals products before from their makeup line, and now I can add this to my beauty must-have list. Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Black opal Dual complex face get for years and nothing works better.  I have very acne prone skin and I will admit that I tend to pick at bumps when the appear, which leads to dark spots ofcourse.  This stuff really helps clear it up.  Not only does it help with dark spots, it minimizes pores. I use it in the daytime also, applying it after I wash my face(with proactiv), and before I apply my make up.  I&#x27;ve tried Retin A before and while it is effective, it is really really pricey and can be very drying (even the low dose).  This stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time using this product and it works every time! Unbelievable, the way it fades spots so quickly.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Its leaving a little bit of light sports surrounding my dark areas, but I will use more precision when putting this on my face.</li>
            <li> I got this from a seller, not Amazon. I received it rather quickly although when I opened it, nearly half was gone and the green DNA design was all messed up. I notified the seller and provided some pictures and they responded quickly. I ended up getting a refund since I didn&#x27;t want a jar and a half of this stuff since the amount should last a long time.  A little goes a long way since I put thin layers. I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks, usually in the nighttime after I washed my face. Sadly, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements to my hyper pigmentation from acne. I was really hoping this would be the answer but for me, it isn&#x27;t.  It didn&#x27;t have any negative effects on me. It&#x27;s just like I&#x27;ve never tried it. I&#x27;ll continue using it to see if there&#x27;s any improvement over a greater length of time, but for the time being, I&#x27;m leaving this as 3 stars. If I see any signs of change, I&#x27;ll update my review..</li>
            <li> This item I use daily along with my other facial moisturizers, I also would recommend sun block protection as a precaution.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at drugstores and then beauty supply stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I find that it is hard to find in brick and mortar stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, good old Amazon seems to still have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this and I see dark spots start clearing up in a few days. I am one of those women that still gets some acne as an adult and it unfortunately leaves a dark spot. I also use it on melasma after pregnancy (I have been pregnant many times, only to miscarry) and other dark patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is being shipped, sometimes the little matrix is shaken up a bit, but it is still useful.  Don&#x27;t be afraid if the gel part isn&#x27;t exactly clear - it will still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problems with darker parts on your skin, this will help.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. Great product</li>
            <li> I just wish they still sold the product because my skin hasn&#x27;t been the same without it</li>
            <li> I used this religiously at night for dark circles and other dark spots. I saw no difference. The other products in this line work better.(IMO)</li>
            <li> I just wanted to be sure to caution buyers that this product is maximum strength. I purchased it thinking that it was regular strength, and it caused me major skin irritation and some damage. Understandably, the seller will not refund if it has been opened, but I do hope they will change the listing to note this. Just please be sure that you can handle a maximum strength product and are aware that you will not be able to receive a refund if you use it. Just a caution for buyers.</li>
