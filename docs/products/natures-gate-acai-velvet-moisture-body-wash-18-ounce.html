            <li>It was more like a very sweet grape candy.</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t need a lot, so that increases its value for me, which I already think is pretty good, considering the amount you get for the price.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love this body wash plus its sulfate free</li>

            <li>The texture of the body wash is smooth and velvety</li>
            <li>Nice gentle scent, not overpowering</li>
            <li>Kida like a cheap grape lollipop.</li>

            <li>But if the person using it is 8-10 years old, it may be good for them.</li>
            <li>I also love the ingredients in it, since I&#x27;ve had great results with other items that have capuacu in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also like the lather that it provides and the fact that it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s slightly sweet smelling, but not overpowering.</li>

            <li>It cleans well and rinses quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild, berry scent</li>
            <li>Usually right after a shower my skin feels so itchy</li>
            <li>I love that this product is all natural and it actually smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>On first use, just washing my hands I immediately felt a difference.  </li>
            <li>As for the smell it was VERY grapey!</li>
            <li>It smells divine and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It seems like it may be a winner if I can feel that much of a difference in using the soap on just one use.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty pleased with the speed of delivery, however, I was not pleased with the fact that my package arrive opened.  </li>
            <li>The body wash created a very rich lather and took less than 1 oz to fully wash body.  </li>

            <li>This soap does definitely clean but it doesn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>My parents have problems with winter dryness and after a few more showers if I still like it</li>
            <li>I recommend trying not to over rinse as this is the good stuff it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It seems I needed to use more than usual.</li>
            <li>But to give a quick product description, it lathers well enough but not as much as regular soap.  </li>
            <li>I am prone to eczema issues during certain times of the year, and this seems to help fight that back so far.</li>
            <li>Unless your really sensitive you probably wont have a head ache after using this soap.  </li>
            <li>later the same day.***********************&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few products that have little to no harsh chemicals in them, but this has to be my favorite so far.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I only received this soap yesterday but of course I couldn&#x27;t wait to see how it would work.  Would it lather like regular soap?  Would it feel different during the wash?  On first use, just washing my hands I immediately felt a difference.  The skin on my hands didn&#x27;t feel tight right after the dried.  Wow!  How impressive!  The next step was the shower.  This soap does definitely clean but it doesn&#x27;t dry.  Usually right after a shower my skin feels so itchy I am about to go crazy.  With this soap I didn&#x27;t notice it.  I followed with my usual routine but felt no itchiness.  It seems like it may be a winner if I can feel that much of a difference in using the soap on just one use.  I hope to come back with how my skin has recovered over time since using.  But to give a quick product description, it lathers well enough but not as much as regular soap.  The lather is a little firmer but not puffy and foamy like regular soap.  The fragrance is light and nice, not too strong.  Unless your really sensitive you probably wont have a head ache after using this soap.  It cleans well and rinses quickly.  You will feel a light moisturizing (residue?) on your skin when your done.  I recommend trying not to over rinse as this is the good stuff it leaves behind.  Just rinse off the suds and your all good.  So far I really like it.  It&#x27;s nice.  My parents have problems with winter dryness and after a few more showers if I still like it I may get on the monthly program and buy my parents one as well.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word on the distributor.  Great!  The package came in good condition and it was delivered a day early!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products that have little to no harsh chemicals in them, but this has to be my favorite so far. I really enjoy the smell, which is always an important issue with me. It&#x27;s a mild, berry scent that&#x27;s slightly sweet smelling, but not overpowering. It vaguely reminds me of grapes. I also love the ingredients in it, since I&#x27;ve had great results with other items that have capuacu in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is how silky-soft it makes my skin feel after I&#x27;ve showered. I actually washed my face with it while in the shower and on a whim, then forgot to put moisturizer on. Despite it being the arid time of the year, my face isn&#x27;t the least bit dry and it&#x27;s quite soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the lather that it provides and the fact that it rinses clean. I am prone to eczema issues during certain times of the year, and this seems to help fight that back so far. Also, no issues with UTIs at the moment, which a lot of soaps seem to trigger. You also don&#x27;t need a lot, so that increases its value for me, which I already think is pretty good, considering the amount you get for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy the papaya, but feel this softens my skin more. I&#x27;ll probably continue to switch between the two for a little variety, but this is definitely my favorite. I plan to get the liquid soap and lotion, just for the smell alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Amazon continues to carry this product and will add it to their Subscribe &amp; save! *hint, hint*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine (Coconut Derived), Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate (Coconut Derived), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate (Coconut Derived), Lauryl Glucoside (Vegetable Derived), Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Polysorbate 20, Euterpe Oleracea (Açai) Fruit Extract, Euterpe Oleracea (Açai) Fruit Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Bertholletia Excelsa(Brazil Nut) Seed Oil, Myrciaria Dubia (Camu Camu) Fruit Extract, Theobroma Grandiflorum (Cupuacu) Seed Butter, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (Plant Derived), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate (Vegetable Derived), Glyceryl Undecylenate (Vegetable Derived), Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid (Vegetable Derived), Fragrance*.&lt;br /&gt;*Natural Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(\\&quot;Paraben-free, Sulfate-free, Phthalate-free, EDTA free, Synthetic Fragrance Free\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I love this body wash plus its sulfate free</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of my son. He knows how very dry my skin is and he uses the product so I gave it a try. Love  it.</li>
            <li> Great Scent and is very smooth. Sometimes body washes can make you greasy but this wash has great texture and blends into the skin well.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was pretty anxious waiting for my package to arrive.  I placed my order on 4/30/2014 and I received the package today 5/3/2014.  I was pretty pleased with the speed of delivery, however, I was not pleased with the fact that my package arrive opened.  It came bubble wrapped and the bag was torn.  Then when I took the product out of the bubble wrap, the bottle was wrapped in a plastic bag that was properly sealed.  Once I opened the plastic bag I noticed the bottle itself had some of the contents spilled on the outside.  The bag also had some spillage within it.  I am soooo not happy about that right now!  So I will notify Amazon and keep you posted.  I would say if you order this product and have any issues with packing to let Amazon reps know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as far as the quality of the product, well I have yet to use this particular fragrance, but I suppose it will be just delightful.  I have the Papya scent and that one does me well.  Hope this review helps a bit. Ta for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************************UPDATE  later the same day.***********************&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they were very helpful.  I received a partial credit for the spilled product.  I am pleased :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells divine and makes my skin super soft. I can&#x27;t use many body washes/lotions but this one doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. Will get this month after month!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great with great ingredients. This time I ordered another flavor and loved it too.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. My skin feels great. I love that it is sulfate free. I have used Nature&#x27;s Gate products for years. Check this out especially if you tend to have dry/itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural and it actually smells fantastic! I will definitely buy this product again for my daughter and myself.</li>
            <li> Love the smell love the brand</li>
            <li> When you open the bottle, your senses are immersed in the aroma of the Aça&amp;iacute; berry.  If it wasn’t body wash, I would eat it.  The body wash created a very rich lather and took less than 1 oz to fully wash body.  The texture of the body wash is smooth and velvety (a very fitting description on the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Use the Aça&amp;iacute; lotion immediately after showering.  It doubles the robustness of the smell!</li>
            <li> Nice gentle scent, not overpowering</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a hunt to a favorite body wash that not only smells good, but no harmful ingredients. This product has good ingredients (which took that stars from 2 to 3). I don&#x27;t want to put any possibly harmful ingredients on my skin. It&#x27;s lather was not very good. It seems I needed to use more than usual. As for the smell it was VERY grapey! Didn&#x27;t smell like acai that I expected. It was more like a very sweet grape candy. Even to the point it smelled artificial. Kida like a cheap grape lollipop. Which is not what a grown woman probably would like to smell like. But if the person using it is 8-10 years old, it may be good for them. Though, It is a good price per ounce for decent ingredients.</li>
            <li> Item leaked all over other items purchased even though it was in a &amp;#34;protective&amp;#34; bag. I contacted customer service in attempts to exchange or return and they would not take it back even though half of it was gone due to the cap not being screwed on tightly. I even told customer service I would be leaving a bad review; they told me I could dispose of the item as I please.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and the smell. Thank you for awesome packaging too.</li>
