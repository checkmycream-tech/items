            <li>Was a smooth transaction and the product is great!  </li>
            <li>I think the rice-based phytos are superior to the wheat-based which I started out with and</li>
            <li>Great product... love it...</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Bought more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, thanks!</li>
            <li>I also got the free serum samples and I&#x27;m really happy with those.</li>
            <li>is in hydration, which is good because that&#x27;s what plumps your skin and helps reduce fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beautiful label and packaging by the way and love the bonus ceramide serum gift included.  </li>
            <li>Love the silky serum sample...</li>
            <li>how great they are for your skin, but I really wanted a gluten-free version.</li>
            <li>so glad I found your brand.</li>
            <li>thankyou sincerely  </li>
            <li>what is inside matters more.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find this phytoceramide made from rice.</li>
            <li>One a day is fine too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to find a skin product that actually works!</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product and for only $10,  </li>
            <li>thank you for free sample</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product and since it&#x27;s on Prime I can get it the next day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if a double dose might be more suitable or safe.</li>
            <li>My greatest reaction so far (and I&#x27;ve only been on them for about a month)</li>
            <li>3 weeks and my skin ,hair, face look amazing ,soft,  more young!</li>
            <li>I will keep you posted on my 30 day results after I finish my first bottle!</li>
            <li>E.&lt;br /&gt;-is a much better buy than many products that have the exact same ingredients making it easier to keep buying and using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly the product I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I have looked up information on phytoceramides and the research certainly looks more than a bit promising, and having your skin changed from within rather than from without makes a lot of sense.</li>
            <li>Thanks for free sample of the serum with&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>thanks so much for the Serum Free sample...love it!</li>
            <li>I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>I also like the extra vitamins, especially the added vitamin D (great during the winter).</li>
            <li>Shipping very fast.</li>
            <li>When I ran out of the another brand of phytoceramides last November, I didn&#x27;t order more as I wondered if it was the &amp;#34;phytos&amp;#34; really working (and why pay close to $20 bucks a month if its not!)</li>
            <li>I do not get any stomach upset from these as I did with the wheat-based phytoceramides and I love that these have the same added vitamins A, C, D, &amp; E, eliminating the need for me to take those additional pills.  </li>
            <li>The capsules don&#x27;t smell or taste funny.</li>
            <li>My skin is more hydrated, looks brighter, and doesn&#x27;t get painfully dry and itchy anymore.</li>
            <li>or if it was just my normal skin care routine with added vitamin C serum (I started taking phytos and using Vitamin C serum at the same time, so I wasn&#x27;t really sure which one was doing &amp;#34;the job&amp;#34;. )  </li>
            <li>It never occurred to me that a supplement could help with my dry skin so very excited to have found</li>
            <li>After about 30-40 days of use I can say I am really noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hands were drying out much quicker than before also.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, these really work to help keep my skin hydrated all day and</li>
            <li>(didn&#x27;t really see results either like with the rice-based)  </li>
            <li>After diving into the research I&#x27;m a big believer in phytoceramides but needed a Wheat Free option</li>
            <li>leaves my skin sooooo soft!!!</li>
            <li>I would quickly get that leathery feel especially on my legs.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using this product my skin as gone back to being smooth and feeling soft again.</li>
            <li>I was already losing my moisture and noticing my skin looking older .  </li>
            <li>I like what I am seeing in the mirror so far!</li>
            <li>However I do live in the dry hot state of Arizona.</li>
            <li>A few fine lines under my eyes started to reappear along with some darkness and my face didn&#x27;t feel as hydrated and soft as before.  </li>
            <li>that was fast for standard shipping.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product along with a Vitamin C serum, I definitely have seen results.</li>
            <li>I will continue stay on the rice-based phytoceramides and will buy these as long as the price stays reasonable.  </li>
            <li>, I can see a big difference since I was waiting for my new credit cards.</li>
            <li>I have been taking phytoceramides for about 8 months and there has been a clear difference in my skin, not just my face, but my entire body.  </li>
            <li>I intend to continue taking phytoceramides and see how far they will go in making my skin look younger.</li>
            <li>I think it is the combination of both, but I can say for sure that after not being on the phytoceramides for approximately 2 months, I started to see a regression in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have given this product a real college try and absolutely no change!</li>
            <li>Face skin has much less wrinkles and is much plumper and smoother.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Face skin has much less wrinkles and is much plumper and smoother.</li>
            <li> My hands used to be so dry they would be red, cracked and sore.  </li>
            <li> Been looking for something like this product for so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every lotion and cream out there and am always battling dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;s supposed to take to see results, but I haven&#x27;t seen any so far.</li>
            <li> I started taking these after suffering from very dry and itchy winter skin as well as acne on my face.</li>
            <li> They are not oily once applied, nor do they leave a residue like other products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been out of my phytoceramides for 3wks due to my purse</li>
            <li> I am going back to what I have used in the past which did not give me any problems.  </li>
            <li> This product-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-is easy to take and didn&#x27;t make me feel sick</li>
            <li> For less than a dollar a day I&#x27;m now treating my skin from the inside out.</li>
            <li> My skin has become dried even after putting body oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always nervous about the generic ingredients that don&#x27;t have studies behind them.</li>
            <li> Seems like the missing piece of the puzzle.</li>
            <li> The pills are not real huge or hard to swallow.  </li>
            <li> (which is why I tend to shy away from them) because everyone&#x27;s body system and skin is different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Supplements and skin creams/serums and like products are hard to review</li>
            <li> This formula, or maybe it is the rice base, bothers my stomach.  </li>
            <li> those gave me horrible heartburn.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like what I am seeing in the mirror so far! I will keep you posted on my 30 day results after I finish my first bottle!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller.  Ty!</li>
            <li> This product-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-is easy to take and didn&#x27;t make me feel sick (which has always been a problem with supplements I take).&lt;br /&gt;-has seemed to be gradually making a difference in the smoothness and moistness of my skin, especially my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;-also contains vitamins A, C, D, &amp; E.&lt;br /&gt;-is a much better buy than many products that have the exact same ingredients making it easier to keep buying and using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplements and skin creams/serums and like products are hard to review (which is why I tend to shy away from them) because everyone&#x27;s body system and skin is different. I have looked up information on phytoceramides and the research certainly looks more than a bit promising, and having your skin changed from within rather than from without makes a lot of sense. My greatest reaction so far (and I&#x27;ve only been on them for about a month) is in hydration, which is good because that&#x27;s what plumps your skin and helps reduce fine wrinkles. I intend to continue taking phytoceramides and see how far they will go in making my skin look younger. I will say what you&#x27;ve probably heard forever, and that is that the earlier you start caring for your skin- whatever your choices of products are- the longer you will stave off problems.</li>
            <li> After using this, my skin looks fuller and healthier. It&#x27;s great to find a skin product that actually works!</li>
            <li> Started to see some improvement in my skin after one month.</li>
            <li> If I could give this a zero, I would.  After using for a week, I broke out all over my face, chest, and neck. It has been a month since I tried it and I&#x27;m still dealing with the aftermath.  Wish I never ordered it.</li>
            <li> Was a smooth transaction and the product is great!  My skin has become dried even after putting body oil I would quickly get that leathery feel especially on my legs. After 2 weeks of using this product my skin as gone back to being smooth and feeling soft again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking two a day to see faster results. One a day is fine too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change in my skin, so am trying it another month.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Great price and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have taken before pix...but I have been pulling my jowls to measure stretch and it is tighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my body skin is tighter, smoother and softer. Bought more!</li>
            <li> I have given this product a real college try and absolutely no change!</li>
            <li> Great product! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Shipping very fast. Arrived well packaged. Only giving the product itself three stars, after two months of use I see no improvement in skin texture of appearance. However I do live in the dry hot state of Arizona. I don&#x27;t know if a double dose might be more suitable or safe.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Worked as advertised. Face skin has much less wrinkles and is much plumper and smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every lotion and cream out there and am always battling dry skin.  It never occurred to me that a supplement could help with my dry skin so very excited to have found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful label and packaging by the way and love the bonus ceramide serum gift included.  Came with helpful brochure.  Great experience with this seller.</li>
            <li> I started taking these after suffering from very dry and itchy winter skin as well as acne on my face. After about 30-40 days of use I can say I am really noticing a difference in my skin. My skin is more hydrated, looks brighter, and doesn&#x27;t get painfully dry and itchy anymore. I will continue to take these for my skin. I also like the extra vitamins, especially the added vitamin D (great during the winter).</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have been taking phytoceramides for about 8 months and there has been a clear difference in my skin, not just my face, but my entire body.  Phytoceramides have really helped to keep my skin moisturized even in the harsh winter weather.  My hands used to be so dry they would be red, cracked and sore.  When I ran out of the another brand of phytoceramides last November, I didn&#x27;t order more as I wondered if it was the &amp;#34;phytos&amp;#34; really working (and why pay close to $20 bucks a month if its not!) or if it was just my normal skin care routine with added vitamin C serum (I started taking phytos and using Vitamin C serum at the same time, so I wasn&#x27;t really sure which one was doing &amp;#34;the job&amp;#34;. )  I think it is the combination of both, but I can say for sure that after not being on the phytoceramides for approximately 2 months, I started to see a regression in my skin.  A few fine lines under my eyes started to reappear along with some darkness and my face didn&#x27;t feel as hydrated and soft as before.  I noticed my hands were drying out much quicker than before also.  So I searched Amazon looking for something that was the same formula I had been taking but not as pricey.  I was happy to find this product and for only $10,  I ordered it right away.  I have now ordered my second bottle.  The pills are not real huge or hard to swallow.  I do not get any stomach upset from these as I did with the wheat-based phytoceramides and I love that these have the same added vitamins A, C, D, &amp; E, eliminating the need for me to take those additional pills.  In my opinion, these really work to help keep my skin hydrated all day and the lines and darkness under my eyes are now fading away again (just after a couple of weeks being back on them).  I think the rice-based phytos are superior to the wheat-based which I started out with and those gave me horrible heartburn. (didn&#x27;t really see results either like with the rice-based)  I will continue stay on the rice-based phytoceramides and will buy these as long as the price stays reasonable.  Highly recommend this product along with a Vitamin C serum, I definitely have seen results.</li>
            <li> Great product... love it...thank you for free sample</li>
            <li> works well will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent , working very good, the best  purchase ever!  3 weeks and my skin ,hair, face look amazing ,soft,  more young!</li>
            <li> did not see that it helped me any, but may work for someone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;s supposed to take to see results, but I haven&#x27;t seen any so far. Will update if I do.</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I was looking for! Love the silky serum sample...leaves my skin sooooo soft!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 3 months now and my skin looks great . Not only the skin on my face seems to be tighter but also skin on legs . Will be buying this again and for this price it can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about phytoceramides and how great they are for your skin, but I really wanted a gluten-free version. I was very excited to find this phytoceramide made from rice. The price is right. The capsules don&#x27;t smell or taste funny. For less than a dollar a day I&#x27;m now treating my skin from the inside out. I also got the free serum samples and I&#x27;m really happy with those. They are not oily once applied, nor do they leave a residue like other products that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and since it&#x27;s on Prime I can get it the next day. Awesome!</li>
            <li> After diving into the research I&#x27;m a big believer in phytoceramides but needed a Wheat Free option so glad I found your brand. Impressive studies on this Ceramide-PCD ingredient used in your product! I&#x27;m always nervous about the generic ingredients that don&#x27;t have studies behind them.</li>
            <li> Been looking for something like this product for so long. Seems like the missing piece of the puzzle. Heard about Phytoceramides on Dr. Oz and will share back with you soon how my results are. thanks so much for the Serum Free sample...love it!</li>
            <li> Great Product Beautiful Packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was very impressed when the package arrived! Beautiful&lt;br /&gt;bottle and box. Thanks for free sample of the serum with&lt;br /&gt;my purchase..love the velvety texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have started taking the phytoceramides and will give you&lt;br /&gt;another update in coming month or so.</li>
            <li> thankyou I received my order yesterday .  that was fast for standard shipping.  the packaging was great I have been out of my phytoceramides for 3wks due to my purse was stolen with them in my purse, I can see a big difference since I was waiting for my new credit cards. I was already losing my moisture and noticing my skin looking older .  so I will be ordering regularly.  thankyou sincerely  sandi mikula</li>
            <li> This formula, or maybe it is the rice base, bothers my stomach.  I am going back to what I have used in the past which did not give me any problems.  Great packaging, but what is inside matters more.</li>
