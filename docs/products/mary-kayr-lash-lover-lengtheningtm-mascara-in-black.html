            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t go on clumpy and doesn&#x27;t run.  Also, if I end up sleeping with it on, I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon in the morning lol.</li>
            <li> I was sent Lash Lengthening Mascara, which is not Lash Love Lengthening. There was a typed sticker on taped on the box saying Lash Love...but it wasn&#x27;t Lash Love in the box.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping, box was a little beat up on arrival but it gets thrown away anyway</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great order turn around time!</li>
            <li> This product seemed drier than the mascara that I have gotten from MK reps in the past. After trying it out, I looked on the box and saw that it expired two years ago. I guess this is how they can sell it for much less. It would have been nice to know that up front, that this is the Big Lots of the online makeup community.</li>
            <li> I totally luv this mascara! Mary Kay products really work... Can&#x27;t complain! The mascara came on time also and makes wonders!</li>

The second time It made another mess.But as far as your eyelashes it is fairly decent.I will use it-due to paying for it.As far as a recomendation of ordering this product? I will leave that up to you.BUT I will say this-I have had better mascara.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My niece was a distributor and she quit so I had no where to get it.  I found it here and it is the same wonderful product.  I love the lengthening aspect, it really does a great job.  I would suggest this for anyone who uses mascara.</li>

            <li> I love this mascara.  It makes my lashes look longer and it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
