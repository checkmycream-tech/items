            <li>my hair is Awesome!  </li>

            <li>The wife is happy that makes me happy</li>
            <li>curls always look great...</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s cheaper than any good curling wand</li>
            <li>- I noticed it works best on clean hair.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>A drawstring would be much, much better!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Wearing the cap itself feels amazing</li>
            <li>It isnt damaging and if you use hair rolllers, this is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am really sold on the heat cap - it is great!!!</li>
            <li>and I hope the folks at The Original Microwave Heat Cap co. are happy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The very strong chemical smell that comes from it when it is heated, I&#x27;m hoping this will dissipate with time.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>To boot, the steam coming from the cap seems to be putting more moisture into my hair, which helps create a nice luster over time.   </li>
            <li>So far I get the best results with the perming rods... which you can get a ton of for a couple of bucks at Sally&#x27;s and</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be really happy you have more time in your routine to do other things while still getting a great hairstyle!</li>
            <li>about a minute unrolling it and spraying some hairspray (love L&#x27;Or√©al Elnett).   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to get the volume at the roots with a curling iron like I can with this product.  </li>
            <li>Curling irons used to make my hair noticeably dryer, with more split-ends.</li>
            <li>Overall, just beautiful curls AND volume in no time!</li>
            <li>I ordered the &amp;#34;heat cap&amp;#34; in desperation more than anything else.  </li>
            <li>Love this cap.</li>
            <li>Smells like rice is on my head :)</li>
            <li>the top and sides curl quite well.  </li>
            <li>it is ok not what I thought</li>
            <li>Much better than any electric rollers I have ever owned (and so much better for my hair).  </li>
            <li>If you used another type of roller it might work better.</li>
            <li>It works as advertized, the curls are much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this heat cap.</li>
            <li>I can have them put in and let this heat cap do its magic and take them out, all within 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>I could not recommend this product more.</li>
            <li>It works great, even on relentlessly straight hair.  </li>
            <li>thats more</li>
            <li>these glitches, I love this cap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so happy with how fast this works and how easy it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In order to write a good review, I wanted to try this cap with a good amount of different curlers.</li>
            <li>Using your own rollers, you don&#x27;t have to worry that the set of hot rollers have the size curlers you need.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and medium length.</li>
            <li>I have stick-straight, fine hair, and after two minutes, I had ringlets that lasted for days.</li>
            <li>the fault of my fine hair not holding a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very straight, very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I use foam rod rollers and they fit well under the cap.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product on rachael ray and thought it was a great solution to curl long hair.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that condition of my hair is getting better all the time because I&#x27;m not using hot tools anymore on my hair that cause damage.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to work with more than I did</li>
            <li>The first day she used it she received many compliments on her hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it a lot,mainly because I can&#x27;t get the hang of rolling my very fine straight hair in quick fashion.  </li>
            <li>Using this heat cap has given me true body and curls.  </li>
            <li>You finally get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product; my hair was in good condition BEFORE I purchased it....</li>
            <li>VERY well made with top quality fabric .</li>
            <li>I take it off and let my hair cool off for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>[and I have tried it all] has ever given me more than a tiny bit of body or curl and neither lasted more than a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick....</li>
            <li>But then it occurred to me that I could use those big volume rollers (the velcro kind) and use this cap to give me more height at my roots, and that&#x27;s worked really well.</li>
            <li>(we all know hair style can really make an outfit look a million times better -- it really needs to be worked into the equation even if there seems to be no time!).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healthier, more natural state.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>it is worth buying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun to try all this stuff out and see what works for you.</li>
            <li>Honestly the only problems I&#x27;ve had have been user error...</li>
            <li>It does what I expected and is a good quality product.</li>
            <li>After that it&#x27;s just beautiful curls that last until I wash my hair the next day.</li>
            <li>And I am left with soft, wonderful curls that last.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised how easy and convenient it is to use.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it on my niece, didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what advertising says it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from hot rollers to curling wands to curlformers to a perm to scrunching products... and NOTHING works as well as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can use it with SO MANY different things.</li>
            <li>it did what it said for the most part, the cap proved too small for many curlers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to make sure the sellers send me a different one (the thing is fifty dollars!!!!</li>
            <li>Not only that, it&#x27;s better for her hair .</li>
            <li>She was actually home baby sitting her grand daughter that day.</li>
            <li>And it really works!  </li>
            <li>Take off the cap let the rollers cool off and then wow!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a quick and easy way to curl my hair for a very very VERY long time.</li>
            <li>Now, people make positive comments about my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>I heated the cap and immediately put it on my head over the curlers and set the timer for 5 minutes after which I removed the cap and let my head cool completely before taking the rollers out.  </li>
            <li>It would not work well for someone who used large rollers because the cap is just not that large...</li>
            <li>If you only put 5 or 6 rollers on your head it might work fine</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t large enough to fit over even medium sized rollers.  </li>
            <li>Large rollers will not work as the cap is not very big.&lt;br /&gt;3.curlers close to the nape of the neck do not heat as well as the ones on top and therefore do not curl as well.&lt;br /&gt;Despite</li>
            <li>It takes me literally 5 minutes from start to finish to get a whole head of hair curled.</li>
            <li>It has been my savior when I am frantically trying to get ready for work or a date and have 10 minutes to do my makeup, hair, and choose an outfit</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>not so much...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even give texture to her straight hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I wanted the heat cap so much</li>
            <li>I never thought I would find a fast and comfy way to use my curlformers</li>
            <li>the REAL issue is, is i&#x27;ve had this cap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bad when it comes to styling my own hair and never seem to get it right on my own.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it often but when my hair is feeling a bit dry and brittle, I leave a deep conditioner in my hair, warm up the cap, and leave it on for about 15 minutes then rinse out the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is a great product just not for me...with African American hair the moisture from the microwave can make your hair draw up ...if your hair is wet or even using setting lotion..to lock in a curl.but</li>
            <li>I am thankful I got a full refund, but I had to pay $14.00 to ship it back.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li>A few times I&#x27;ve even hopped in the car with it on to save more time going somewhere</li>
            <li>My sister bought one of these years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it again, I of course live on Amazon and found one just like the one she had.</li>
            <li>can only reach the top and middle of head not sides and back.</li>
            <li>I have had so many nights of not sleeping due to coarse curlers.</li>
            <li>I had never gotten compliments about my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, it leaves my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried this with foam rollers, flexi rods, curlformers, magnetic rollers, and perming rods.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised when I was experimenting and it worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This heat cap actually saves my wife 1/2 hour getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions including setting my clean, dry hair on very small rollers (&amp;#34;Velcro&amp;#34; covered is essential for my fine, flighty hair).  </li>
            <li>All I have to do is is quickly roll my hair and put this cap on, after a few minutes</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and fine.  </li>
            <li>do my hair in the morning and generally by noon</li>
            <li>Even though instructions don&#x27;t say so, I usually take off the cap, let things cool and repeat.  </li>

            <li> It has been my savior when I am frantically trying to get ready for work or a date and have 10 minutes to do my makeup, hair, and choose an outfit</li>

            <li> not so much...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even give texture to her straight hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wanted the heat cap so much</li>
            <li> I never thought I would find a fast and comfy way to use my curlformers</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t use it often but when my hair is feeling a bit dry and brittle, I leave a deep conditioner in my hair, warm up the cap, and leave it on for about 15 minutes then rinse out the conditioner.</li>

            <li> I am thankful I got a full refund, but I had to pay $14.00 to ship it back.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li> A few times I&#x27;ve even hopped in the car with it on to save more time going somewhere</li>
            <li> My sister bought one of these years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it again, I of course live on Amazon and found one just like the one she had.</li>
            <li> can only reach the top and middle of head not sides and back.</li>
            <li> I have had so many nights of not sleeping due to coarse curlers.</li>
            <li> I had never gotten compliments about my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, it leaves my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried this with foam rollers, flexi rods, curlformers, magnetic rollers, and perming rods.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised when I was experimenting and it worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This heat cap actually saves my wife 1/2 hour getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions including setting my clean, dry hair on very small rollers (&amp;#34;Velcro&amp;#34; covered is essential for my fine, flighty hair).  </li>
            <li> All I have to do is is quickly roll my hair and put this cap on, after a few minutes</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and fine.  </li>
            <li> do my hair in the morning and generally by noon</li>
            <li> Even though instructions don&#x27;t say so, I usually take off the cap, let things cool and repeat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30, have long thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that I have a big head, and I couldn&#x27;t pull the cap down past my ears with rollers under it, so for me, it was always a little uneven, and in the end, I decided I don&#x27;t look good with a lot of curls.</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde hair</li>
            <li> me being clumsy and not putting in rollers very well.</li>
            <li> The curls din&#x27;t stay long but</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this product to other people with different kinds of hair...</li>
            <li> I can not live without it.</li>
            <li> The cap feels really nice on a cold morning too!</li>
            <li> I do wish it were just a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I set my hair then put a heavy weight hair net over the roller and put the cap on for 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I do see how it could work for other people...</li>
            <li> KEEP THE VELCRO CLOSED, LADIES!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BOTHER BUYING ONE, it is not worth the hassle and the let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past trying to get curls to stay throughout the night with curling irons -- it can be hard to get the heat from a curling iron to touch every part of such a long strand of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a portable little steam room for your hair.</li>
            <li> A little tip</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fallen and looks a little matted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No longer using electric curlers that do not fit your hair, I have had mine for over 3 years.</li>
            <li> Having lived my life with limp lifeless hair, I wondered if anything would ever work.  </li>
            <li> too small to go over hair rollers.&lt;br /&gt;heat</li>
            <li> bulky, heavy and not effective</li>
            <li> Everything either takes too long or is way too complicated.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get over brush rollers.</li>
            <li> It sets curls in a very small amount of time.  </li>
            <li> (seriously, you won&#x27;t want to take it off).</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little expensive</li>
            <li> Normally in order for curlformers to work you either have to sit under a hair drying cap for an hour or so or sleep on them... which is very painful and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer, I hate the velcro part.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may seem expensive</li>
            <li> I got the steam cap during the week; been sick</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and if there was any way to give them ZERO stars I would.</li>
            <li> It made the cap (and my house) smell like burnt pop corn and was just horrible.</li>

            <li> too small to go over hair rollers.&lt;br /&gt;heat can only reach the top and middle of head not sides and back.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Nothing I have tried before [and I have tried it all] has ever given me more than a tiny bit of body or curl and neither lasted more than a couple of hours.  Using this heat cap has given me true body and curls.  The curls and the body last all day, even in humid weather.  I had never gotten compliments about my fine, limp hair.  Now, people make positive comments about my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> Awesome product with beautiful, lustrous results!!! I have been using this product for a while now and it&#x27;s my go-to hair product whenever I want extra volume, curls, and body. It takes me literally 5 minutes from start to finish to get a whole head of hair curled. I&#x27;d say I spend about 2 minutes rolling my hair, 2 minutes steaming it in the cap, and about a minute unrolling it and spraying some hairspray (love L&#x27;Or√©al Elnett).   It has been my savior when I am frantically trying to get ready for work or a date and have 10 minutes to do my makeup, hair, and choose an outfit (we all know hair style can really make an outfit look a million times better -- it really needs to be worked into the equation even if there seems to be no time!). I always have time to do my hair now. Sometimes I leave it on while I&#x27;m doing the dishes or the laundry. A few times I&#x27;ve even hopped in the car with it on to save more time going somewhere (this means I only spend time inside rolling it). Curling hair has never been easier for me.  I have very long blonde hair and this still curls my hair from root to tip. I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past trying to get curls to stay throughout the night with curling irons -- it can be hard to get the heat from a curling iron to touch every part of such a long strand of hair. I&#x27;ve never been able to get the volume at the roots with a curling iron like I can with this product.  Wearing the cap itself feels amazing (seriously, you won&#x27;t want to take it off). It&#x27;s like a portable little steam room for your hair. Curling irons used to make my hair noticeably dryer, with more split-ends. Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my hair has been restored to it&#x27;s healthier, more natural state. To boot, the steam coming from the cap seems to be putting more moisture into my hair, which helps create a nice luster over time.   A little tip - I noticed it works best on clean hair. Don&#x27;t load up on the conditioner or serums (try adding a bit of gel though when hair is damp to hold the curls) before using. You can use any type of curlers with the cap -- I have and they all work well.   Overall, just beautiful curls AND volume in no time! Can&#x27;t believe I was using curling irons before. You&#x27;ll be really happy you have more time in your routine to do other things while still getting a great hairstyle!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t large enough to fit over even medium sized rollers.  If you only put 5 or 6 rollers on your head it might work fine</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and fine.  It will not hold a curl for any length of time -- curl just falls out. Also, my bangs were stringy and just layed there.  I ordered the &amp;#34;heat cap&amp;#34; in desperation more than anything else.  Well, I used it and my hair stayed in curls until shampooing.  I am really sold on the heat cap - it is great!!!</li>
            <li> It is a great product just not for me...with African American hair the moisture from the microwave can make your hair draw up ...if your hair is wet or even using setting lotion..to lock in a curl.but I do see how it could work for other people... Shipping was quick....I do believe it is a great product and I would recommend this product to other people with different kinds of hair...it just was not for me....</li>
            <li> Love this cap. Don&#x27;t use it often but when my hair is feeling a bit dry and brittle, I leave a deep conditioner in my hair, warm up the cap, and leave it on for about 15 minutes then rinse out the conditioner. Smells like rice is on my head :)</li>
            <li> It is the best. You finally get a good night&#x27;s sleep. I have thick,coarse hair. I have had so many nights of not sleeping due to coarse curlers. Now with in 4 minutes I am done. Just set your hair , put the cap in the microwave for 2 minutes and wait 2 minutes, and you are on your way. It really works. I can not live without it. You will have curls all day. No longer using electric curlers that do not fit your hair, I have had mine for over 3 years.</li>
            <li> I got the steam cap during the week; been sick so I have LOTS of time to play around with my hair.  It&#x27;s shoulder length in the back, below chin length on sides; short-ish on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO the top and sides curl quite well.  The back....not so much...I get curves rather than curls.  I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing smaller rollers for the back and see if roller size isn&#x27;t the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product; my hair was in good condition BEFORE I purchased it....now, it&#x27;s in GREAT condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER...what&#x27;s the purpose of the velcro?  It&#x27;s not like when it&#x27;s open the cap&#x27;s any larger....I don&#x27;t bother with it....otherwise I tangles in the hair.  KEEP THE VELCRO CLOSED, LADIES! (or gentlemen)</li>
            <li> I saw this product on rachael ray and thought it was a great solution to curl long hair. I first tried it on my niece, didn&#x27;t work at all. Didn&#x27;t even give texture to her straight hair. Then I tried it on my daughter with a different style of curlers. Same result. No curl. Big hassle.  I returned it. I am thankful I got a full refund, but I had to pay $14.00 to ship it back.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cap in the hopes that it would work with my existing curlers.  When I received it and found out that it wasn&#x27;t the product for me, I contacted the seller in order to facilitate a return.  They NEVER returned my emails or my calls.  I then contacted an Amazon representative who said that she would contact the seller on my behalf, but I never heard back from the Amazon Representative either. Now I am stuck with a merchandise that I can do nothing with.  I am very disappointed and if there was any way to give them ZERO stars I would.</li>
            <li> it is ok not what I thought</li>
            <li> This heat-curling cap works.  I have very straight, very fine hair.  I followed the instructions including setting my clean, dry hair on very small rollers (&amp;#34;Velcro&amp;#34; covered is essential for my fine, flighty hair).  I heated the cap and immediately put it on my head over the curlers and set the timer for 5 minutes after which I removed the cap and let my head cool completely before taking the rollers out.  My hair curls.... It works exactly as advertised.  It would not work well for someone who used large rollers because the cap is just not that large... but it works perfectly for me.  My hair does not do well with perms; so this is the best way to get curls is a very short period of time without sitting under a hair dryer.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Use it ever day and I LOVE IT!!!!  I set my hair then put a heavy weight hair net over the roller and put the cap on for 2 minutes.  No damage to your hair, set stays in. REPEAT! Worth every penny.  VERY well made with top quality fabric .</li>
            <li> I recently bought this heat cap although my sister has owned one for years.  I was so surprised how easy and convenient it is to use.  Much better than any electric rollers I have ever owned (and so much better for my hair).  Using your own rollers, you don&#x27;t have to worry that the set of hot rollers have the size curlers you need.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love it!  I just roll up my hair in rollers put the heat cap in the microwave for 2 min. and then put the heat cap on over the rollers, and while waiting I put on my makeup. Take off the cap let the rollers cool off and then wow! my hair is Awesome!  Another plus is that condition of my hair is getting better all the time because I&#x27;m not using hot tools anymore on my hair that cause damage.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does exactly what advertising says it does. I do wish it were just a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> This product did not give me the curls I wanted. It was hard to get over brush rollers. If you used another type of roller it might work better. I was hoping that this would replace the use of a curling iron. My hair is fine and medium length. If you are willing to work with more than I did it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Have had this heat cap for years.  It works as advertized, the curls are much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  Like the other reviewer, I hate the velcro part.  A drawstring would be much, much better!  I haven&#x27;t used it a lot,mainly because I can&#x27;t get the hang of rolling my very fine straight hair in quick fashion.  But I&#x27;m working on it.  The cap feels really nice on a cold morning too!</li>
            <li> I love this heat cap. It isnt damaging and if you use hair rolllers, this is amazing. All I have to do is is quickly roll my hair and put this cap on, after a few minutes I take it off and let my hair cool off for a minute or two. After that it&#x27;s just beautiful curls that last until I wash my hair the next day. I even curl my sisters and moms hair. I included some photos. My hair is the blonde and my sister&#x27;s is the brown.</li>
            <li> This thing worked almost too well. I have stick-straight, fine hair, and after two minutes, I had ringlets that lasted for days. The only issue is that I have a big head, and I couldn&#x27;t pull the cap down past my ears with rollers under it, so for me, it was always a little uneven, and in the end, I decided I don&#x27;t look good with a lot of curls. But then it occurred to me that I could use those big volume rollers (the velcro kind) and use this cap to give me more height at my roots, and that&#x27;s worked really well. Also, it leaves my hair really soft and shiny. I look like a goofball when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this three months ago and it hasn&#x27;t even shipped, so I requested a cancellation and yet still no answers back. Don&#x27;t bother messaging them because they DON&#x27;T ANSWER BACK might as well talk to yourself. I wanted the heat cap so much I went to the official website and ordered again and nothing they took my $50 and never gave me my heat cap, and they also don&#x27;t listen when I called and asked them (also their email doesn&#x27;t work). BTW I am starting to wonder if the hole thing is just a big SCAM. DON&#x27;T BOTHER BUYING ONE, it is not worth the hassle and the let down.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a quick and easy way to curl my hair for a very very VERY long time. I&#x27;m 30, have long thin, fine hair. I&#x27;m really bad when it comes to styling my own hair and never seem to get it right on my own. Everything either takes too long or is way too complicated. I&#x27;ve tried everything from hot rollers to curling wands to curlformers to a perm to scrunching products... and NOTHING works as well as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to write a good review, I wanted to try this cap with a good amount of different curlers. So far I&#x27;ve tried this with foam rollers, flexi rods, curlformers, magnetic rollers, and perming rods. So far I get the best results with the perming rods... which you can get a ton of for a couple of bucks at Sally&#x27;s and in whatever size you please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with how fast this works and how easy it is. Although it works well with any roller, my favorites are the perm rods as I said before and curlformers, yes curlformers. Normally in order for curlformers to work you either have to sit under a hair drying cap for an hour or so or sleep on them... which is very painful and uncomfortable. I never thought I would find a fast and comfy way to use my curlformers and now I have. I can have them put in and let this heat cap do its magic and take them out, all within 25 minutes. It&#x27;s incredible. And I am left with soft, wonderful curls that last. I didn&#x27;t even get this to use with the curlformers so I was surprised when I was experimenting and it worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem expensive but I think it&#x27;s cheaper than any good curling wand and you can use it with SO MANY different things. It&#x27;s so fun to try all this stuff out and see what works for you. Honestly the only problems I&#x27;ve had have been user error... me being clumsy and not putting in rollers very well. I could not recommend this product more.</li>
            <li> I just place an order for a third one!  It works great, even on relentlessly straight hair.  Holds the set with no damage to the hair.</li>
            <li> bulky, heavy and not effective</li>
            <li> it did what it said for the most part, the cap proved too small for many curlers. The curls din&#x27;t stay long but thats more the fault of my fine hair not holding a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the REAL issue is, is i&#x27;ve had this cap all of a week and never put it in the microwave for longer that a minute and forty five seconds and the last time I did it there was a burned patch on the inside!  It made the cap (and my house) smell like burnt pop corn and was just horrible. I&#x27;m going to make sure the sellers send me a different one (the thing is fifty dollars!!!! and it broke in a week!)</li>
            <li> This cap works great. It curls your hair perfectly. The only complaints I have are:&lt;br /&gt;1. The very strong chemical smell that comes from it when it is heated, I&#x27;m hoping this will dissipate with time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Large rollers will not work as the cap is not very big.&lt;br /&gt;3.curlers close to the nape of the neck do not heat as well as the ones on top and therefore do not curl as well.&lt;br /&gt;Despite these glitches, I love this cap. It sets curls in a very small amount of time.  I wrap my hair around a headband to keep the curls close to my head so that it fits within the cap. You can see this technique on YouTube... I find it works best with this cap.</li>
            <li> This heat cap actually saves my wife 1/2 hour getting ready for work. Not only that, it&#x27;s better for her hair . The first day she used it she received many compliments on her hair. Now I&#x27;m her hero for ordering the Heat Cap. I actually called the company and spoke to the lady who invented it. It&#x27;s a family owned business started from home. These are real American people with a real American idea making it work. She was actually home baby sitting her grand daughter that day. We talked about 45 minutes about the cap, politic family and religion. Now I advertise tis cap to all who will listen. The wife is happy that makes me happy and I hope the folks at The Original Microwave Heat Cap co. are happy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003Z3MKH0 Heat Cap]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this by putting in rollers and twisting my hair (for beachy waves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls always look great...at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my hair in the morning and generally by noon it&#x27;s fallen and looks a little matted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep experimenting with different ways to curl my hair with it though.  It definitely saves time in the morning!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!  Having lived my life with limp lifeless hair, I wondered if anything would ever work.  This cap made a LOT of promises.  And it really works!  I use foam rod rollers and they fit well under the cap.  I microwave the cap for 2 minutes, put over the rollers and do some work.  Even though instructions don&#x27;t say so, I usually take off the cap, let things cool and repeat.  I can get a lot done while my hair is up. My curls and body last for DAYS.</li>
            <li> My sister bought one of these years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it again, I of course live on Amazon and found one just like the one she had. bought it for her and she loves it. I thought it was a little expensive but her last one lasted years.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It does what I expected and is a good quality product.</li>
