            <li>Don&#x27;t know if these are ok since I have had to wait for weeks to receive the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>Be sure to lightly moisturize after!</li>
            <li>They are just what I needed and will buy more when needed</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the micro pedi .  </li>
            <li>I really love the emoji micro-pedi.</li>
            <li>My wife uses these all the time and love them.</li>
            <li>Received very fast and price point more then fair much better price then from unit itself.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I ordered!!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>Best investment I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>More for fine smoothing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my enjoy.</li>
            <li>Happy so far.</li>
            <li>These rollers along with the emjoi product is the perfect combination for soft, pretty feet.</li>
            <li>but so far they work great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine.</li>
            <li>Good product, very satisfy with it.</li>
            <li>Price is better than original brand.  </li>
            <li>Received very quickly.</li>
            <li>Works wonders and the machine is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and I can reduce the calluses</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you buy the corded Emjoi Micro Pedi device as the battery operated ones tend to stop too easily when applying pressure.</li>
            <li>Easily beautifies feet inbetween pedicures.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>although I liked these rollers very much</li>
            <li>very satisfied, just as advertised, received very promptly</li>
            <li>After 4 to 5 uses per roller, a new one needs to be placed in the device in order to maintain optimum outcome in the exfoliating efforts.  </li>
            <li>Everything arrived fine.  </li>
            <li>The rollers work fine.  </li>
            <li>I just got my roller refills they look fine</li>
            <li>This item is an Emjoi compatible item, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Easy way to smooth your feet without the need for a pedicurist.</li>
            <li>They are what they are and work fine</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>They do the job quick with smooth results!</li>
            <li>great make sure your feet are dry</li>
            <li>They fit on the dishwasher prongs and by washing, you can use them over and over.</li>
            <li>Works great for feet that aren&#x27;t like an armadillo&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>Cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>They fit my Emjoii and work like the originals...</li>
            <li>My feet were so smooth.  </li>
            <li>i really enjoy the use-age of my course</li>
            <li>Not baby smooth,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.</li>
            <li>Takes quite a while to get feet smooth but it does work.</li>
            <li>After using scrapers, stones and everything available on the market, these rollers were a welcomed relief.  </li>
            <li>These refill fit as if they were made for my Emjoi</li>
            <li>Great to have extra ones when needed.</li>
            <li>They are cheap &#x27;compatible&#x27; rollers.  </li>
            <li>so I can keep on using them every day to keep my smooth feet..</li>
            <li>These refills will help me get my feet smooth until spring when i can get pedicures again.</li>
            <li>Yup they fit and will do the job when I need them.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit the machine.  </li>
            <li>Goes great with the product above...</li>
            <li>So far so good....</li>
            <li>Price was right, haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet, as the originals are still working OK.</li>
            <li>Item as described, fast shipping, thank you !!!</li>
            <li>Works like the original.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I needed :)</li>
            <li>Even as an off-brand product, they seem to work as well as the original rollers.</li>
            <li>The Original Foot Callus Remover as implied on your listing and the way it is sold as a bundle.</li>
            <li>Seems to work as well as the original rollers</li>
            <li>It would be helpful if the rolls were washable or easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Between all, my feet a are clean.</li>
            <li>These rollers are NOT as good as the Genuine Emjoi roller and will not last.</li>
            <li>You will go through these pretty quick if you use your emjoi often (weekly or more in summer)</li>
            <li>Right in time for summer exposure !</li>
            <li>Really great for rough feet.</li>
            <li>Everything was great as expected</li>
            <li>I do run a full cycle after.</li>
            <li>They work well, good for finishing, they also need to be cleaned regularly.</li>
            <li>They do a good job and in a very short time.  </li>
            <li>These work really well would be ordering more when needed.</li>
            <li>there ok but seem to wear out fast and they made a flapping noise.</li>
            <li>This is much safer and does a better job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to have some extra refill rollers around.</li>
            <li>Like that you can get extra ones at a good price</li>
            <li>So far, pretty good.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the extra coarse rollers are perfect after first using the super coarse rollers.  </li>
            <li>Great little item and refills rollers - keeping my feet really smooth.</li>
            <li>If you have calluses (and I can&#x27;t imagine why you would purchase an Emjoi if you don&#x27;t) you will probably be better off with the more coarse rollers.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>I have used these refills exclusively and they work well but do wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It loads up fast but easy to clean out.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>received quick and is what is advertized</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>These fit exactly</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase &amp; will be shopping with them next time I need replacement rollers.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Exact replacement for the original.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Not too coarse, but perfect for exfoliating dry skin from feet....</li>
            <li>These little gems are great for your Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>Great little device</li>
            <li>Thanks for having these available.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and makes heels so smooth</li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>The refill rollers create an economical and practical option.</li>
            <li>Nice to have back up refills with these !</li>
            <li>, this did not remove them completely,  I wish there was a more rounded as those used for fingernails. .</li>
            <li>Nice to have extra rollers.</li>
            <li>but worth it</li>
            <li>It can get rather warm before you will actually feel it through callus and by then you have a &amp;#34;Hot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the original (blue) rollers.</li>
            <li>I have used several other things and this works best.</li>
            <li>were not the right rollers</li>
            <li>I have a callous on my right foot.  </li>
            <li>Works fine if there is not thick calluses.</li>
            <li>I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came</li>
            <li>I find that a large coarse file works better!</li>
            <li>My feet are so smooth and soft now!!</li>
            <li>My gift was received by my son and his better half, they love it.  </li>
            <li>these should work good as long as the main machine does its job</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected, but otherwise very good</li>
            <li>It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34; (#1), followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34; (#2),</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast delivery and keep up the fantastic work.</li>
            <li>I really like how quickly and efficiently this product works.</li>
            <li>The Amazon description was very clear and accurate.</li>
            <li>Very gentle sanding.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in excellent brand new condition.</li>
            <li>You would think that &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34; is close to the most coarse product they make.</li>
            <li>And these refills are not expensive.</li>
            <li>Works great for somewhat thick calluses.  </li>
            <li>Functions exactly as described in the product description.</li>
            <li>Will order more from same place when this order wears out</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I ordered the extra course and that works better for me.</li>
            <li>He loves the coarse rollers and says they work much better.</li>
            <li>exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>At last, making taking care of your hooves easier and safe to groom.</li>
            <li>They are exactly I needed.  </li>
            <li>I am barefoot most of the time, even to go outside at get the mail in rain, sleet and snow</li>
            <li>Last for many cycles.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast it work!  </li>
            <li>Most of my callous pain was totally gone after using this.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>only thing better would be a table sander but that might be over kill.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Emjoi Micro-Pedi refill rollers arrived on time, works great, but does not last long.</li>
            <li>Shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li>By the term extra course I assumed it was course which is not the case at all, it&#x27;s more like a buffer than course.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT AS ADVERTISED, FAST SHIPPER !</li>
            <li>These wor fine to smooth rough skin.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove a large callus on the bottom side of my foot below the big toe</li>
            <li>Really this review is more for the Emjoi than the rollers -- but I do want to say that I think these blue extra coarse are a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Will be nice to have back ups when the old when gets used up.</li>
            <li>These extra course rollers really work, I love the Emjoi Micro and have recommended it to friends that also purchased</li>
            <li>Love these but the &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34; Rollers are more for Finishing and Smoothing not for thick callus removal.</li>
            <li>The rollers seem to be a little more aggressive than the original.</li>
            <li>Okay for minor calluses.</li>
            <li>This really gets the job done, gently but leaves soft, smooth feet and elbows.</li>
            <li>I pretty much have the &amp;#34;just got a pedicure&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have highly roughed up feet, but daily wear and tear needs a bit more grit.</li>
            <li>With the powerful NEW model of Emjoi......</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on, they last well.</li>
            <li>took off the dry skin, my feet felt fabulous!</li>
            <li>The coarseness was perfect for removal of hard skin when applied lightly..  Will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Only good for maintenance of dry feet!</li>
            <li>Good for those hard calluses.</li>
            <li>Work very well .</li>
            <li>Arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Really like my emoji and these are part of using it.</li>
            <li>I like the product because it takes away all the feet and a softness that makes you reuse thanks</li>
            <li>my heels must be much harder than most.</li>
            <li>They are the course grain and work very well</li>
            <li>Very well.  </li>
            <li>I like the whole emoji micro-pedi exfoliator system.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>These are very efficient, I received the Emjoi Pedi for my birthday, and ordered the refills.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>This works for me really well.</li>
            <li>I found these for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>it really work.</li>
            <li>THESE ROLLERS WORK VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Received fast and as described.</li>
            <li>Works very well for my wife&#x27;s calloused heels and the sides of her toes/feet.  </li>
            <li>I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare</li>
            <li>These are working really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for post on Amazon or Ebay but Thank God for that...</li>
            <li>These rollers worked very well with the Emjoi device.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>++  THEY REALLY DO WORK - VERY WELL - ORDERING EXTRAS  </li>
            <li>Works very Well.</li>
            <li>My feet are beach ready</li>
            <li>Foot.&amp;#34; Please click if this review was helpful, Thanks.</li>
            <li>Come warmer weather, when you are bare foot more they are just a little too light weight in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I wish I could get something much more course because these seem to wear down way too fast.</li>
            <li>Why pay that high price when you can get these much cheaper</li>
            <li>The Extra Coarse Rollers are good for winter when your feet are protected by socks and shoes constantly.</li>
            <li>Just ordered eight of the Super Coarse refills to see how they perform.    </li>
            <li>Overall I have been quite satisfied with my numerous purchases from Amazon and will continue to shop on their site.</li>
            <li>The extra coarse seem to work better for my needs.</li>
            <li>Plus, there is instant satisfaction instead of waiting for days and weeks to see if a foot cream actually works :)</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that they are now offered in several different textures.</li>
            <li>these little rollers are amazing, you use them, and then if you rinse them and let then dry, put then on the little machine and they are good as new.</li>
            <li>and while I have not used them consistently/regularly enough to remove all of it entirely, they remove so much and definitely make my feet look better!  </li>
            <li>I use my Emjoi Refill rollers and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, will buy again.</li>
            <li>AND MADE THE PURCHASE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Love this little gadget.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was worried about ordering these oon Amazon because they are so much cheaper than on the website.</li>
            <li>I have no negative comment.</li>
            <li>so I expect similar results using an economical roller</li>
            <li>they did not come packaged in the normal way</li>
            <li>No complaint with these.  </li>
            <li>These are refills for me and the other one I have seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>New rollers fit and work as expected.</li>
            <li>The extra coarse rollers work well; easy to load into the Emjoi Micro-Pedi device</li>
            <li>Easy and effortless to use, it really takes off the dead skin without any pain.</li>
            <li>easy way to keep calluses down</li>
            <li>Just like new when you pop in one of these replacement &amp;#34;grinders.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I live in the north east -</li>
            <li>Just what I need for my new summer sandals.</li>
            <li>Soft feet forever now!</li>
            <li>I am going to try using the more coarse refills next time to see if they last longer.</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft!</li>
            <li>but they are same exact thing.</li>
            <li>Extra coarse is just right!</li>
            <li>Received in timely manor as described giving four stars because even tho they work and get the job done the actual name brand works marginally better for me the added expense of name brand was not worth it....</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the genuine Emjoi micro pedi rollers do.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want anything less abrasive, but more abrasive might actually</li>
            <li>I wish they would label them by grit # like sand paper, then I would&#x27;ve known there wasn&#x27;t enough difference from course, extra course and super course to bother buying each.</li>
            <li>AS THE ORIGINAL WEARS DOWN.</li>
            <li>Gotta have these, as they don&#x27;t last forever- they come in a set of 4, for way less $$ than the standard ones, fit and last fine-</li>
            <li>Love my little callous killer!!</li>
            <li>These are simply refills and fit as expected.</li>
            <li>Feet are really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>These are the lightest as far as coarseness.</li>
            <li>Bought these because I was giving the Emjoi Micro-Pedi to a guy friend who has considerable callus build- up on his feet.</li>
            <li>These refills do work and are not a harsh remover.</li>
            <li>What was a timely process is now something I can do myself and have smooth feet in a few moments.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>It takes longer than the old fashioned way</li>
            <li>WHEN I BOUGHT IT SINCE MY FEET ARE NOW SO SOFT</li>
            <li>, just drop in after removing old roller.</li>
            <li>and so far have lasted pretty long.</li>
            <li>If the product didn&#x27;t work so darn good, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these expensive replacement rollers.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover but says the rollers wear down quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Will be using these rollers in the future with my new Emjoi!</li>
            <li>But not sure they make ones more coarse</li>
            <li>Extra Coarse is really &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;, Super Course is &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, Extreme Course is &amp;#34;course&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>not much difference between course, extra course and super course.</li>
            <li>Really gets the dry skin off.</li>
            <li>They are gentle even though they say they are extra coarse.  </li>
            <li>The replacement is hard too fine  </li>
            <li>I was surprised because it is advertised as actual &amp;#34;EMJOI&amp;#34; refills.</li>
            <li>Received all blue, no green</li>
            <li>These little devils are a must for the lady who pampers her feet like my Better Half does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little more efficient at smoothing the heel than the less course rollers.</li>
            <li>They work very well but individually they do not last very long.</li>
            <li>You will certainly want the refill set to have on hand and reorder when you get down to two.  </li>
            <li>Love it, too bad it wears out very fast</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it was my bad thou</li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; a bunion on the lateral aspect of each foot near my baby toe, heels get dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>Goes into Micro-pedi and has left me nearly free of dead bottom of foot syndrome, highly reccomended, just use with caution and little bit every other day with lotion and in short time</li>

            <li> I believe these rollers are for the EMJOI NANO.&lt;br /&gt;The product needs to be relabeled or a better description.</li>
            <li> Love this machine and refills</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if these are ok since I have had to wait for weeks to receive the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Be sure to lightly moisturize after!</li>
            <li> They are just what I needed and will buy more when needed</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love the micro pedi .  </li>
            <li> I really love the emoji micro-pedi.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these all the time and love them.</li>
            <li> Received very fast and price point more then fair much better price then from unit itself.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I ordered!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> Best investment I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> More for fine smoothing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my enjoy.</li>
            <li> Happy so far.</li>
            <li> These rollers along with the emjoi product is the perfect combination for soft, pretty feet.</li>
            <li> but so far they work great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine.</li>
            <li> Good product, very satisfy with it.</li>
            <li> Price is better than original brand.  </li>
            <li> Received very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works wonders and the machine is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and I can reduce the calluses</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you buy the corded Emjoi Micro Pedi device as the battery operated ones tend to stop too easily when applying pressure.</li>
            <li> Easily beautifies feet inbetween pedicures.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Would strongly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> although I liked these rollers very much</li>
            <li> very satisfied, just as advertised, received very promptly</li>
            <li> After 4 to 5 uses per roller, a new one needs to be placed in the device in order to maintain optimum outcome in the exfoliating efforts.  </li>
            <li> Everything arrived fine.  </li>
            <li> The rollers work fine.  </li>
            <li> I just got my roller refills they look fine</li>
            <li> This item is an Emjoi compatible item, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Easy way to smooth your feet without the need for a pedicurist.</li>
            <li> They are what they are and work fine</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> They do the job quick with smooth results!</li>
            <li> great make sure your feet are dry</li>
            <li> They fit on the dishwasher prongs and by washing, you can use them over and over.</li>
            <li> Works great for feet that aren&#x27;t like an armadillo&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> Cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> They fit my Emjoii and work like the originals...</li>
            <li> My feet were so smooth.  </li>
            <li> i really enjoy the use-age of my course</li>
            <li> Not baby smooth,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.</li>
            <li> Takes quite a while to get feet smooth but it does work.</li>
            <li> After using scrapers, stones and everything available on the market, these rollers were a welcomed relief.  </li>
            <li> These refill fit as if they were made for my Emjoi</li>
            <li> Great to have extra ones when needed.</li>
            <li> They are cheap &#x27;compatible&#x27; rollers.  </li>
            <li> so I can keep on using them every day to keep my smooth feet..</li>
            <li> These refills will help me get my feet smooth until spring when i can get pedicures again.</li>
            <li> Yup they fit and will do the job when I need them.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit the machine.  </li>
            <li> Goes great with the product above...</li>
            <li> So far so good....</li>
            <li> Price was right, haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet, as the originals are still working OK.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipping, thank you !!!</li>
            <li> Works like the original.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed :)</li>
            <li> Even as an off-brand product, they seem to work as well as the original rollers.</li>
            <li> The Original Foot Callus Remover as implied on your listing and the way it is sold as a bundle.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the original rollers</li>
            <li> It would be helpful if the rolls were washable or easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Between all, my feet a are clean.</li>
            <li> These rollers are NOT as good as the Genuine Emjoi roller and will not last.</li>
            <li> You will go through these pretty quick if you use your emjoi often (weekly or more in summer)</li>
            <li> Right in time for summer exposure !</li>
            <li> Really great for rough feet.</li>
            <li> Everything was great as expected</li>
            <li> I do run a full cycle after.</li>
            <li> They work well, good for finishing, they also need to be cleaned regularly.</li>
            <li> They do a good job and in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> These work really well would be ordering more when needed.</li>
            <li> there ok but seem to wear out fast and they made a flapping noise.</li>
            <li> This is much safer and does a better job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to have some extra refill rollers around.</li>
            <li> Like that you can get extra ones at a good price</li>
            <li> So far, pretty good.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the extra coarse rollers are perfect after first using the super coarse rollers.  </li>
            <li> Great little item and refills rollers - keeping my feet really smooth.</li>
            <li> If you have calluses (and I can&#x27;t imagine why you would purchase an Emjoi if you don&#x27;t) you will probably be better off with the more coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping</li>
            <li> I have used these refills exclusively and they work well but do wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It loads up fast but easy to clean out.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> received quick and is what is advertized</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> These fit exactly</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase &amp; will be shopping with them next time I need replacement rollers.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for the original.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Not too coarse, but perfect for exfoliating dry skin from feet....</li>
            <li> These little gems are great for your Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> Great little device</li>
            <li> Thanks for having these available.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and makes heels so smooth</li>
            <li> Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> The refill rollers create an economical and practical option.</li>
            <li> Nice to have back up refills with these !</li>
            <li> , this did not remove them completely,  I wish there was a more rounded as those used for fingernails. .</li>
            <li> Nice to have extra rollers.</li>
            <li> but worth it</li>
            <li> It can get rather warm before you will actually feel it through callus and by then you have a &amp;#34;Hot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the original (blue) rollers.</li>
            <li> I have used several other things and this works best.</li>
            <li> were not the right rollers</li>
            <li> I have a callous on my right foot.  </li>
            <li> Works fine if there is not thick calluses.</li>
            <li> I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came</li>
            <li> I find that a large coarse file works better!</li>
            <li> My feet are so smooth and soft now!!</li>
            <li> My gift was received by my son and his better half, they love it.  </li>
            <li> these should work good as long as the main machine does its job</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, but otherwise very good</li>
            <li> It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34; (#1), followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34; (#2),</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast delivery and keep up the fantastic work.</li>
            <li> I really like how quickly and efficiently this product works.</li>
            <li> The Amazon description was very clear and accurate.</li>
            <li> Very gentle sanding.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in excellent brand new condition.</li>
            <li> You would think that &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34; is close to the most coarse product they make.</li>
            <li> And these refills are not expensive.</li>
            <li> Works great for somewhat thick calluses.  </li>
            <li> Functions exactly as described in the product description.</li>
            <li> Will order more from same place when this order wears out</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the extra course and that works better for me.</li>
            <li> He loves the coarse rollers and says they work much better.</li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> At last, making taking care of your hooves easier and safe to groom.</li>
            <li> They are exactly I needed.  </li>
            <li> I am barefoot most of the time, even to go outside at get the mail in rain, sleet and snow</li>
            <li> Last for many cycles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast it work!  </li>
            <li> Most of my callous pain was totally gone after using this.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> only thing better would be a table sander but that might be over kill.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Emjoi Micro-Pedi refill rollers arrived on time, works great, but does not last long.</li>
            <li> Shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li> By the term extra course I assumed it was course which is not the case at all, it&#x27;s more like a buffer than course.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT AS ADVERTISED, FAST SHIPPER !</li>
            <li> These wor fine to smooth rough skin.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove a large callus on the bottom side of my foot below the big toe</li>
            <li> Really this review is more for the Emjoi than the rollers -- but I do want to say that I think these blue extra coarse are a good choice.  </li>
            <li> Will be nice to have back ups when the old when gets used up.</li>
            <li> These extra course rollers really work, I love the Emjoi Micro and have recommended it to friends that also purchased</li>
            <li> Love these but the &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34; Rollers are more for Finishing and Smoothing not for thick callus removal.</li>
            <li> The rollers seem to be a little more aggressive than the original.</li>
            <li> Okay for minor calluses.</li>
            <li> This really gets the job done, gently but leaves soft, smooth feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> I pretty much have the &amp;#34;just got a pedicure&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have highly roughed up feet, but daily wear and tear needs a bit more grit.</li>
            <li> With the powerful NEW model of Emjoi......</li>
            <li> It is easy to put on, they last well.</li>
            <li> took off the dry skin, my feet felt fabulous!</li>
            <li> The coarseness was perfect for removal of hard skin when applied lightly..  Will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Only good for maintenance of dry feet!</li>
            <li> Good for those hard calluses.</li>
            <li> Work very well .</li>
            <li> Arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Really like my emoji and these are part of using it.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it takes away all the feet and a softness that makes you reuse thanks</li>
            <li> my heels must be much harder than most.</li>
            <li> They are the course grain and work very well</li>
            <li> Very well.  </li>
            <li> I like the whole emoji micro-pedi exfoliator system.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> These are very efficient, I received the Emjoi Pedi for my birthday, and ordered the refills.</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> This works for me really well.</li>
            <li> I found these for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> it really work.</li>
            <li> THESE ROLLERS WORK VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Received fast and as described.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my wife&#x27;s calloused heels and the sides of her toes/feet.  </li>
            <li> I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare</li>
            <li> These are working really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for post on Amazon or Ebay but Thank God for that...</li>
            <li> These rollers worked very well with the Emjoi device.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> ++  THEY REALLY DO WORK - VERY WELL - ORDERING EXTRAS  </li>
            <li> Works very Well.</li>
            <li> My feet are beach ready</li>
            <li> Foot.&amp;#34; Please click if this review was helpful, Thanks.</li>
            <li> Come warmer weather, when you are bare foot more they are just a little too light weight in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get something much more course because these seem to wear down way too fast.</li>
            <li> Why pay that high price when you can get these much cheaper</li>
            <li> The Extra Coarse Rollers are good for winter when your feet are protected by socks and shoes constantly.</li>
            <li> Just ordered eight of the Super Coarse refills to see how they perform.    </li>
            <li> Overall I have been quite satisfied with my numerous purchases from Amazon and will continue to shop on their site.</li>
            <li> The extra coarse seem to work better for my needs.</li>
            <li> Plus, there is instant satisfaction instead of waiting for days and weeks to see if a foot cream actually works :)</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that they are now offered in several different textures.</li>
            <li> these little rollers are amazing, you use them, and then if you rinse them and let then dry, put then on the little machine and they are good as new.</li>
            <li> and while I have not used them consistently/regularly enough to remove all of it entirely, they remove so much and definitely make my feet look better!  </li>
            <li> I use my Emjoi Refill rollers and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, will buy again.</li>
            <li> AND MADE THE PURCHASE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Love this little gadget.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was worried about ordering these oon Amazon because they are so much cheaper than on the website.</li>
            <li> I have no negative comment.</li>
            <li> so I expect similar results using an economical roller</li>
            <li> they did not come packaged in the normal way</li>
            <li> No complaint with these.  </li>
            <li> These are refills for me and the other one I have seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> New rollers fit and work as expected.</li>
            <li> The extra coarse rollers work well; easy to load into the Emjoi Micro-Pedi device</li>
            <li> Easy and effortless to use, it really takes off the dead skin without any pain.</li>
            <li> easy way to keep calluses down</li>
            <li> Just like new when you pop in one of these replacement &amp;#34;grinders.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I live in the north east -</li>
            <li> Just what I need for my new summer sandals.</li>
            <li> Soft feet forever now!</li>
            <li> I am going to try using the more coarse refills next time to see if they last longer.</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> but they are same exact thing.</li>
            <li> Extra coarse is just right!</li>
            <li> Received in timely manor as described giving four stars because even tho they work and get the job done the actual name brand works marginally better for me the added expense of name brand was not worth it....</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the genuine Emjoi micro pedi rollers do.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want anything less abrasive, but more abrasive might actually</li>
            <li> I wish they would label them by grit # like sand paper, then I would&#x27;ve known there wasn&#x27;t enough difference from course, extra course and super course to bother buying each.</li>
            <li> AS THE ORIGINAL WEARS DOWN.</li>
            <li> Gotta have these, as they don&#x27;t last forever- they come in a set of 4, for way less $$ than the standard ones, fit and last fine-</li>
            <li> Love my little callous killer!!</li>
            <li> These are simply refills and fit as expected.</li>
            <li> Feet are really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> These are the lightest as far as coarseness.</li>
            <li> Bought these because I was giving the Emjoi Micro-Pedi to a guy friend who has considerable callus build- up on his feet.</li>
            <li> These refills do work and are not a harsh remover.</li>
            <li> What was a timely process is now something I can do myself and have smooth feet in a few moments.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> It takes longer than the old fashioned way</li>
            <li> WHEN I BOUGHT IT SINCE MY FEET ARE NOW SO SOFT</li>
            <li> , just drop in after removing old roller.</li>
            <li> and so far have lasted pretty long.</li>
            <li> If the product didn&#x27;t work so darn good, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these expensive replacement rollers.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover but says the rollers wear down quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Will be using these rollers in the future with my new Emjoi!</li>
            <li> But not sure they make ones more coarse</li>
            <li> Extra Coarse is really &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;, Super Course is &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, Extreme Course is &amp;#34;course&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> not much difference between course, extra course and super course.</li>
            <li> Really gets the dry skin off.</li>
            <li> They are gentle even though they say they are extra coarse.  </li>
            <li> The replacement is hard too fine  </li>
            <li> I was surprised because it is advertised as actual &amp;#34;EMJOI&amp;#34; refills.</li>
            <li> Received all blue, no green</li>
            <li> These little devils are a must for the lady who pampers her feet like my Better Half does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little more efficient at smoothing the heel than the less course rollers.</li>
            <li> They work very well but individually they do not last very long.</li>
            <li> You will certainly want the refill set to have on hand and reorder when you get down to two.  </li>
            <li> Love it, too bad it wears out very fast</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it was my bad thou</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; a bunion on the lateral aspect of each foot near my baby toe, heels get dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> Goes into Micro-pedi and has left me nearly free of dead bottom of foot syndrome, highly reccomended, just use with caution and little bit every other day with lotion and in short time</li>
            <li> I needed a more coarse roller for thick callused skin (Green or Grey).</li>
            <li> They take only a few seconds to put into the main unit.</li>
            <li> Actually, I am kind of disappointed , because these rollers don&#x27;t work as original rollers , which came with  emjoi, I used to spent only 5 minutes to do the job, and now I do it much longer time-at least half an hour, I might order the stronger rollers to see how it will work, these set is so-so</li>
            <li> Perform as described and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long one roller will last yet.</li>
            <li> But only time will tell on how long each roller lasts</li>
            <li> Hopefully these last a long time.</li>
            <li> my feet are horrible, these rollers with the main unit (I got the corded one) are amazing!</li>
            <li> This is not very clear when purchasing these.  </li>
            <li> So strange,</li>
            <li> It does the job of removing calluses but not with bigger and harder calluses.</li>
            <li> Last longer than expected</li>
            <li> received earlier than expected delivery date</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I took so long to.</li>
            <li> The rollers don&#x27;t seem to long.</li>
            <li> This lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> I have very rough, coarse calluses and cracks</li>
            <li> I had struggled with dry cracked heels for years.</li>
            <li> DRY FEET.</li>
            <li> In between pedis this device is a life saver for dry feet.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts at first if anything could remove years of Rhino skin skin from my always painful calluses, well this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I EXPECT THESE TO LAST A LITTLE LONGER THAN THE ONE THAT WAS IN MY ROLLER</li>
            <li> My feet are not that bad, as I get pedicures every 4-5 weeks, and just wanted this for touching up between pedicures.</li>
            <li> She likes the machine because it is small and compact and the rollers last a long time.</li>
            <li> Arrive when expected.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to look at the descriptions of all the rollers before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I spent an hour tuning up my bear claw feet.  </li>
            <li> What I expected.  </li>
            <li> Purchased Micro Pedi at Costco and had no idea where or if I could get replacements when the sandpaper dulls.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money paying for name brand when these will do the same job and hold up as the name brand.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had those rough callouses that wake you up at night when they drag across the sheets --</li>
            <li> These refills do not fit the Personal Pedi</li>
            <li> just what was expected</li>
            <li> It was just what  I expected.  </li>
            <li> next time I will got with the courser green ones.</li>
            <li> What I expected</li>
            <li> Replacements are just as expected for the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Was returned, did not fit Personal Pedi</li>
            <li> Item as expected.</li>
            <li> Will last a few months if you use every other day or so.</li>
            <li> But Amazon has the cheapest price over other websites.</li>
            <li> Should have purchased Extreme Course</li>
            <li> cause mine are on the extreme side...</li>
            <li> Cannot believe the difference in price from other sites.</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are generic or Emjoi</li>
            <li> This has resulted in big, hard, rough callouses on both</li>
            <li> The brand is Pedi Active.</li>
            <li> Not effective enough&#x27;</li>
            <li> My wife uses the micropedi to remove dead skin and rough spots on her feet.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have to look down at my feet in sandals and cringe at the sight of calloused heels.  </li>
            <li> so I replace the rollers every 1 month during sandal wearing weather and I&#x27;ll probably go every 2 months once weather cools down.</li>
            <li> try these in due &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> and once it was gone, I discovered it was hiding the fact that I have a slight bunion on this foot.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations and for a lot less $$$</li>
            <li> The rollers that came with the callus shaver lasted me a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some folks were unhappy with their rollers - either they are not using them properly or they have way super worse feet than mine</li>
            <li> Smoothes out rough edges, files down thick nails.  </li>
            <li> ,leaving them silly soft!</li>
            <li> These DO NOT fit all rollers as they claim.</li>
            <li> no getting into positions that are not comfortable</li>
            <li> then green ones called &amp;#34;Xtreme Coarse&amp;#34; (#3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Extra coarse sounds nasty but it really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t peel dead skin as shown on tv</li>
            <li> wasted money.</li>
            <li> I also bought the green ones that seem to be coarser than these.  </li>
            <li> I was worried they might not fit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed, I thought the OEM replacements were finally affordable but this is just someone doing false advertising.  </li>
            <li> The product description is not accurate.</li>
            <li> These interchangeble rollers makes sanding down calluses and dead skin on your feet  with files or  planing devices a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Micro-Pedi system and wanted a few extra rollers, but they were very expensive through the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> These little things are feet savers!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little confusing.</li>
            <li> No more wasteful monies on a pedi I can do myself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a pedi!</li>
            <li> I use 1 of regular brand multiple times, so was extremely disappointed in these.  </li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s a 4-star is they still seem expensive for sandpaper on a roll..</li>
            <li> In the past I used a razor to shave off the crust on my heels.  </li>
            <li> Arrives on time, works well Just a little messy!!!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s hard to imagine</li>
            <li> Hard to rate.  </li>
            <li> If you calluses for quite thick, consider getting the Xtreme Course.  </li>
            <li> Very small.  </li>
            <li> I have serious calluses.  </li>
            <li> I have just received it and I am angry the pack was opened and one roller is missing.</li>
            <li> before I found it very hard to work on my feet</li>
            <li> tough work</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ll expect you to pay for shipping for THEIR false advertising.</li>
            <li> Battery operated micro-pedi is weak!</li>
            <li> Wrong size, even though it showed it with the product I bought.</li>
            <li> I wish these replacement rollers weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> They are now useless to me as I cannot return them as the return period has expired.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi micro pedi machine is the ONLY thing that has worked on my terrible feet.</li>
            <li> I got a Micor Pedi as a gift and have cringed at how expensive the replacement cartridges can be.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing in comparison to the rollers that came with the Emjoi itself.</li>
            <li> so my feet are bad.</li>
            <li> They give them stupid names.</li>
            <li> Refills are very expensive!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.....  Does the job....</li>
            <li> excellent value. Feet are really soft afterwards. One trick is kind of discusting, but I will share anyway. They fit on the dishwasher prongs and by washing, you can use them over and over. Discusting yes. I do run a full cycle after.</li>
            <li> was a gift and have not heard any negatives.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers! They work great in my emjoi. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> The item was great n worked good n the price of them was great</li>
            <li> Great price. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my enjoy. New rollers fit and work as expected.</li>
            <li> Arrive when expected.  Work very well .</li>
            <li> Okay for minor calluses. Need coarser rollers for thicker ones.</li>
            <li> The micro-pedi works SO well - needed replacements.</li>
            <li> More for fine smoothing.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to refill micro-pedi.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was worried about ordering these oon Amazon because they are so much cheaper than on the website. Turns out they are the same ones and work great, score!</li>
            <li> Arrived very promptly. Refills for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Love the Emjoi. My only issue is the description of this product. You would think that &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34; is close to the most coarse product they make. That is not the case. These are the lightest as far as coarseness. They give them stupid names. Be careful to look at the descriptions of all the rollers before purchasing. In my opinion - these are more like buffing rollers. If you have calluses (and I can&#x27;t imagine why you would purchase an Emjoi if you don&#x27;t) you will probably be better off with the more coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> Works great for feet that aren&#x27;t like an armadillo&#x27;s back. They have 3 different grades to choose from. They do the trick.</li>
            <li> I spent an hour tuning up my bear claw feet.  These work great! Save yourself some cash and buy em! :)</li>
            <li> They are my replacements</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Product as advertised.  Happy so far.</li>
            <li> Good product, very satisfy with it.</li>
            <li> These wor fine to smooth rough skin.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT DESIGN WORKS WELL</li>
            <li> keeps my feet like a baby;s foot</li>
            <li> Cheap stuff. Very small.  Only good for maintenance of dry feet! Battery operated micro-pedi is weak!</li>
            <li> The problem is they last only two times then need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I use my Emjoi Refill rollers and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> My feet have never felt better!</li>
            <li> I received the refills promply. I will reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> My feet never felt so good, I only get my feet done at a nail salon just for the nail polish change. I really made a great purchase thank you. The delivery was faster then it said it would be</li>
            <li> need to keep using these or you cannot keep ahead of the issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all the tools eggs creams etc my feet are horrible, these rollers with the main unit (I got the corded one) are amazing!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover but says the rollers wear down quite quickly. Just ordered eight of the Super Coarse refills to see how they perform.    Overall I have been quite satisfied with my numerous purchases from Amazon and will continue to shop on their site.</li>
            <li> It seems like this product is a bit overpriced. But Amazon has the cheapest price over other websites. If the product didn&#x27;t work so darn good, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these expensive replacement rollers.  But it does work great!  Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> i have a section of my drawer set aside for all my micro pedi things at this point but im saving about 80 bucks a month from being on my feet all day</li>
            <li> Awesome product ,well worth the money</li>
            <li> Gave the Emjoy for a gift and the refill rollers.  She loves them</li>
            <li> Does the job - what more could you ask for in a product</li>
            <li> not sure&lt;br /&gt; ..it was a gift</li>
            <li> Love my Emjoi Micro-Pedi, so I know I will use these refills.  Don&#x27;t regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great price and,effective!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> These are great to remove caluses</li>
            <li> works well for a nice look with summer shoes</li>
            <li> These little gems are great for your Emjoi.  They are gentle even though they say they are extra coarse.  The fit perfectly and are very easy to use.  They take only a few seconds to put into the main unit.</li>
            <li> Perform as described and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s Happy, I&#x27;m Happy.</li>
            <li> good to have on hand.  I use the pedi a lot.</li>
            <li> Fit my Emjoi perfect - works great.. Quick shipping</li>
            <li> They work but i would have liked the roughr ones for my bf, together we went thru one on one use. Pretty sure it was my bad thou</li>
            <li> the emjoi pedi is a great product. And these refills are not expensive.</li>
            <li> Really like my emoji and these are part of using it.</li>
            <li> Wife loves her Emjoi  Micro-Pedi, refills.</li>
            <li> Love these, they do a perfect job.</li>
            <li> They work well, good for finishing, they also need to be cleaned regularly.</li>
            <li> I had struggled with dry cracked heels for years. I had been to several doctors- nothing seemed to work. After one week using the Mini-Pedi- my heels look and feel great! I have recommended this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Really good price for these refills.</li>
            <li> work great, just as the originals</li>
            <li> These worked wonderfully....</li>
            <li> works great, good price</li>
            <li> Works great for somewhat thick calluses.  If you calluses for quite thick, consider getting the Xtreme Course.  These worked perfect for me, but my husband had to use the Xtreme.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  The fact that it is electric makes it more effective than battery operated models.</li>
            <li> Wrong size, even though it showed it with the product I bought.</li>
            <li> I have just received it and I am angry the pack was opened and one roller is missing. although I liked these rollers very much</li>
            <li> easy way to keep calluses down</li>
            <li> Yes they were just what I wanted and they work as well as the ones I got with my emoji</li>
            <li> Product as described and received on time!</li>
            <li> Good product. It does what it is supposed to do. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to spend $$$$ on salon pedicure!!!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Havent changed the rollers yet, but the original ones that were on the remover have worked great</li>
            <li> Not effective enough&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love these.  The go with my foot scrubber/exfoliator and its great.</li>
            <li> These refill rollers are great.  Why pay that high price when you can get these much cheaper and they work GREAT!! Thanks for having these available.  I will reorder when these run out. :)</li>
            <li> Not that extra course</li>
            <li> Spare parts returned with defective Micropedi</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK AS CLAIMED.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived fine.  I have no negative comment.</li>
            <li> Bought these because I was giving the Emjoi Micro-Pedi to a guy friend who has considerable callus build- up on his feet.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it takes away all the feet and a softness that makes you reuse thanks</li>
            <li> Good quality for price</li>
            <li> Just what my heels needed!</li>
            <li> Really great for rough feet.</li>
            <li> This should make my wife happy....  good stuff good price....</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Functions exactly as described in the product description.</li>
            <li> Its okay for the product but I thought I was getting a stronger product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, will buy again. Item came as described.</li>
            <li> Very nice product and they work too</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipping, thank you !!!</li>
            <li> They fit my Emjoii and work like the originals... So far so good....</li>
            <li> Love the refill package for my Emoji Micro-Pedi.  After 4 to 5 uses per roller, a new one needs to be placed in the device in order to maintain optimum outcome in the exfoliating efforts.  The refill rollers create an economical and practical option.</li>
            <li> Will last a few months if you use every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Love it. MY feet are softer</li>
            <li> not much difference between course, extra course and super course. I wish I could get something much more course because these seem to wear down way too fast. my heels must be much harder than most. I wish they would label them by grit # like sand paper, then I would&#x27;ve known there wasn&#x27;t enough difference from course, extra course and super course to bother buying each. why can&#x27;t they actually make something EXTRA COURSE???</li>
            <li> Good product, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Great product - just as described!!</li>
            <li> Price was right, haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet, as the originals are still working OK.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The coarseness was perfect for removal of hard skin when applied lightly..  Will last a long time.  Will order more from same place when this order wears out</li>
            <li> Very nice product and price.</li>
            <li> Works like the original.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove a large callus on the bottom side of my foot below the big toe and once it was gone, I discovered it was hiding the fact that I have a slight bunion on this foot. So strange,</li>
            <li> Extra Coarse is really &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;, Super Course is &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, Extreme Course is &amp;#34;course&amp;#34;.  This is not very clear when purchasing these.  I didn&#x27;t need these at all.  Should have purchased Extreme Course, then, Extra Course.  It&#x27;s a little confusing.</li>
            <li> These are extras for when I need replacements for my Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy and use.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Work well with our Emjoi Nano.</li>
            <li> Very good, I recommended it</li>
            <li> Emjoi where have you been all my life?  This really gets the job done, gently but leaves soft, smooth feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> extra coarse is the same one that comes with the Emjoi. It works pretty well. It would be helpful if the rolls were washable or easier to clean. But love the product.</li>
            <li> Works amazing!!! Soft feet forever now! Love it</li>
            <li> I love these pedi-rollers.  They are the course grain and work very well</li>
            <li> my wife very happy with this item</li>
            <li> What I expected.  Received very quickly.</li>
            <li> My wife love this product</li>
            <li> It does the job of removing calluses but not with bigger and harder calluses. I ordered the extra course and that works better for me.</li>
            <li> Everything was great as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Emjoi and love it.  These replacement rollers are a great value and I am very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Very gentle sanding.  Does a great job.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent !</li>
            <li> Purchased Micro Pedi at Costco and had no idea where or if I could get replacements when the sandpaper dulls.  These fit exactly and so far have lasted pretty long.</li>
            <li> Love my little callous killer!!</li>
            <li> I have used these refills exclusively and they work well but do wear out quickly. I am going to try using the more coarse refills next time to see if they last longer. These refills do work and are not a harsh remover.</li>
            <li> These work.  Very well.  I like the whole emoji micro-pedi exfoliator system.</li>
            <li> These were refills for a gift I had bought my brother in law. He loves the coarse rollers and says they work much better.</li>
            <li> Awesome I use it for my gel nails I do at home it works way better then the $$ drills</li>
            <li> Love the emjoi Machine,,,,have not used to refills as of yet.</li>
            <li> Wife loves, obviously for her. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations and for a lot less $$$</li>
            <li> These are a life saver for &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; pedicure times. One of the greatest things is that my husband will use them!</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM IS WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li> They work just great.</li>
            <li> perfect. exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> These do an amazing job on my husbands feet.</li>
            <li> Great product. It arrived as the seller described it</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Product was as listed.</li>
            <li> I wish these replacement rollers weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Works wonders and the machine is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi has refill rollers for both the Elbows and Feet and this product works great.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations. My feet were so smooth.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love these things!  They work great!</li>
            <li> Nice to have back up refills with these !</li>
            <li> Received in timely manor as described giving four stars because even tho they work and get the job done the actual name brand works marginally better for me the added expense of name brand was not worth it....this worked perfect for me!</li>
            <li> The rollers work fine.  They were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> perfect for the callus remover!!</li>
            <li> These rollers work great and are perfect for use in between pedis! I have very rough, coarse calluses and cracks and while I have not used them consistently/regularly enough to remove all of it entirely, they remove so much and definitely make my feet look better!  I&#x27;m not sure why some folks were unhappy with their rollers - either they are not using them properly or they have way super worse feet than mine and that&#x27;s hard to imagine cause mine are on the extreme side...</li>
            <li> Great price will order again</li>
            <li> They work great as a substitute for the name brand.  Don&#x27;t waste your money paying for name brand when these will do the same job and hold up as the name brand.  Seller was excellent too.</li>
            <li> Good for those hard calluses.</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase. Give as gifts as well as personal use. Great price and item. will buy again. yes, yes, yes.</li>
            <li> were not the right rollers</li>
            <li> These DO NOT fit all rollers as they claim. DO NOT BE FOOLED. and they&#x27;ll expect you to pay for shipping for THEIR false advertising. They sold me something I have no use for and expect me to pay to send it back.  HORRIBLE PRODUCT.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> Works great, additional cartridges for your sanding machine. Exact replacement for the original.</li>
            <li> All good, this is what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I love my Emjoi Micro-Pedi. The Extra Coarse Rollers are good for winter when your feet are protected by socks and shoes constantly. Come warmer weather, when you are bare foot more they are just a little too light weight in my opinion. I don&#x27;t have highly roughed up feet, but daily wear and tear needs a bit more grit.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for these rollers.  The price is great.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed :)</li>
            <li> I bought these as refills for the Emoji I bought my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  The price was great and the extra coarse rollers are perfect after first using the super coarse rollers.  My feet are so smooth and soft now!!</li>
            <li> My wife uses the micropedi to remove dead skin and rough spots on her feet. These are the refills for the micropedi. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. It was well packaged and arrived on schedule.</li>
            <li> Geat accessory for the micro-pedi</li>
            <li> works great. love it!</li>
            <li> i really enjoy the use-age of my course pedi rollers, i gave it a rating of 3 because I wish it was coarse enough for my deep callouses. therefore nothing is perfect.,THX</li>
            <li> These are great. The extra coarse seem to work better for my needs. Arrived on time and in good shape. Would definitely use this product and provider again.</li>
            <li> Good refills but I find I needed the coarser ones to do the job better. Works fine if there is not thick calluses.</li>
            <li> I love love my Micro Oedi and the re fills are awesome!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Co. gave me many choices of rollers and combos.  Received very fast and price point more then fair much better price then from unit itself.  Very pleased with this purchase &amp; will be shopping with them next time I need replacement rollers.  Very impressed with price ^ selection.</li>
            <li> What was a timely process is now something I can do myself and have smooth feet in a few moments.&lt;br /&gt;Such a great product I had to order refills ASAP. Right in time for summer exposure !</li>
            <li> These little devils are a must for the lady who pampers her feet like my Better Half does. She threw away the scraper she had used for years and now uses this all the time. She likes the machine because it is small and compact and the rollers last a long time. I would recommend this to anyone who loves their feet.  Thanks for the fast delivery and keep up the fantastic work.</li>
            <li> These little things are feet savers!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> These are not actual Emjoi rollers. I was surprised because it is advertised as actual &amp;#34;EMJOI&amp;#34; refills. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> just what I needed ... good value, excellent service and now pretty feet, just in time for summer!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the authentic rollers. I would order these again. Great price!</li>
            <li> I use this for my micro-pedi refill. It is easy to put on, they last well. I am sure will be buying more</li>
            <li> Even as an off-brand product, they seem to work as well as the original rollers. Very pleased with the combination of the price of these and the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I have the softest feet, maybe softer than a babies feet.  Best investment I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> At last, making taking care of your hooves easier and safe to groom.</li>
            <li> Really this review is more for the Emjoi than the rollers -- but I do want to say that I think these blue extra coarse are a good choice.  I wouldn&#x27;t want anything less abrasive, but more abrasive might actually to unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Emjoi, I can only say that I use it about 2 x a month and my feet are smoother than they have been in years!  Not baby smooth, but I haven&#x27;t had those rough callouses that wake you up at night when they drag across the sheets -- yuck!  I also don&#x27;t have to look down at my feet in sandals and cringe at the sight of calloused heels.  All gone!  By using this 2 x a month I pretty much have the &amp;#34;just got a pedicure&amp;#34; look and feel.  Plus, there is instant satisfaction instead of waiting for days and weeks to see if a foot cream actually works :)</li>
            <li> works well and a good value</li>
            <li> great product to be used with an Emjoi micro-pedi device.  It really works. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it. I can backpedal my  going to get a pedicure to points of time that I want to go.  These interchangeble rollers makes sanding down calluses and dead skin on your feet  with files or  planing devices a thing of the past. The Emjoi makes it easy, cost effective and time efficient.</li>
            <li> The trick is to use the Emjoi every night...and keep a good set of batteries in the Emjoi.  ALso keep :&amp;#34;he egg&amp;#34; handy just in case. Between all, my feet a are clean.</li>
            <li> So grateful I purchased these.  I couldn&#x27;t find them and my emjoi just sat there under my bathroom sink waiting for me to find these.. My feet feel grate again.  No more wasteful monies on a pedi I can do myself.</li>
            <li> Refills are very expensive!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Don&#x27;t waste your money on a pedi! You can do home pedicures and have way better results!</li>
            <li> I call them my nail sanders. I like the product.</li>
            <li> Awesome this product works great</li>
            <li> Awesome and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This just works ok. I find that a large coarse file works better!</li>
            <li> Takes quite a while to get feet smooth but it does work.</li>
            <li> After using scrapers, stones and everything available on the market, these rollers were a welcomed relief.  They are exactly I needed.  They do a good job and in a very short time.  I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My husband and I use it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> Used 4 at one time and had just used the regular brand one 2 weeks prior.  I use 1 of regular brand multiple times, so was extremely disappointed in these.  I won&#x27;t try substitutes again!</li>
            <li> ok- want more exfoliation</li>
            <li> LOVE EM! Best brand I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> These are refills for me and the other one I have seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> Works great and I love it!</li>
            <li> I just got my roller refills they look fine I think the product is great . It takes longer than the old fashioned way but it&#x27;s way easier and as  before I found it very hard to work on my feet this makes it very easy no getting into positions that are not comfortable so I  like it a lot .</li>
            <li> Not as course as I would&#x27;ve liked.  But not sure they make ones more coarse</li>
            <li> These are very efficient, I received the Emjoi Pedi for my birthday, and ordered the refills. They work very well.</li>
            <li> easily to refill the rollers, no problems with delivery great porduct</li>
            <li> My gift was received by my son and his better half, they love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> These work just perfectly in my micro pedi.  Not a single problem, which is great because the price is awesome and these really keep your tootsies looking good!</li>
            <li> Just like I have and they work just as well as the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name</li>
            <li> This item is an Emjoi compatible item, and it works just fine.  The rollers seem to be a little more aggressive than the original.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have an Emjoi, get one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are refills and they do an amazing job.  Love my feet again.  Save money on pedicures, too, since I no longer need to have the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;callous removal&amp;#34; done on my heels.</li>
            <li> They work well, but the &amp;#34;super course&amp;#34; works even better.</li>
            <li> THEY DID NOT WORK AT ALL</li>
            <li> These are simply refills and fit as expected.</li>
            <li> Good, get courser ones for feet that need more care :)</li>
            <li> Quick delivery! Great product!</li>
            <li> Looks good, but haven&#x27;t tried the refills yet.  Price is better than original brand.  The micro-pedi works well so I expect similar results using an economical roller</li>
            <li> These refills do not fit the Personal Pedi The Original Foot Callus Remover as implied on your listing and the way it is sold as a bundle. They are now useless to me as I cannot return them as the return period has expired.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where these were manufactured.  They work but they aren&#x27;t quite as good as the ones I got elsewhere.</li>
            <li> They work very well but individually they do not last very long.</li>
            <li> I have callus some deep ones, this did not remove them completely,  I wish there was a more rounded as those used for fingernails. .</li>
            <li> These rollers are NOT as good as the Genuine Emjoi roller and will not last. I am very disappointed. They are inexpensive and there is a reason.The Genuine Emjoi replacement is superior in every way.</li>
            <li> Just like new when you pop in one of these replacement &amp;#34;grinders.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This were just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Just what my wife ordered and they work well.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and they are what I needed for my Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  These work well.</li>
            <li> Great Product A+++++ I did a lot of research before making this purchase and I am very happy with the product.  No need to look any further you will be happy as well.</li>
            <li> Love it, too bad it wears out very fast</li>
            <li> This product makes your feet look great and your heels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> The rollers that came with the callus shaver lasted me a year and a half.  I have serious calluses.  This is easy to use and I can reduce the calluses so I don&#x27;t have to do it so often.  I love it, bought 3 more and gave them as gifts.</li>
            <li> These work really well would be ordering more when needed. Thank you!</li>
            <li> my wife loves it for removing her calluses</li>
            <li> These refills are the same coarseness that comes with the Nano. Not too coarse, but perfect for exfoliating dry skin from feet....,leaving them silly soft!</li>
            <li> these little rollers are amazing, you use them, and then if you rinse them and let then dry, put then on the little machine and they are good as new. This works for me really well.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Micro-Pedi system and wanted a few extra rollers, but they were very expensive through the manufacturer.  I found these for a reasonable price.  They are identical to the originals and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> love it!!! it really work.</li>
            <li> Love my micro-pedi - think it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve use for smooth feet.  These are great replacements for not paying for OEM.  The only reason it&#x27;s a 4-star is they still seem expensive for sandpaper on a roll..</li>
            <li> I love the four-pack! Great value!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet but I love the Emjoi and I&#x27;m sure these will be great.</li>
            <li> I have the Emjoi and bought these refills to have on hand. The Emjoi micro pedi machine is the ONLY thing that has worked on my terrible feet. I am barefoot most of the time, even to go outside at get the mail in rain, sleet and snow so my feet are bad. THIS WORKS!!! I finish off with a nice soothing creme. Follow directions - DO NOT USE on FACE!!!</li>
            <li> My feet will never be the same again.  These rollers along with the emjoi product is the perfect combination for soft, pretty feet.</li>
            <li> good product, works great for my moms feet..</li>
            <li> there ok but seem to wear out fast and they made a flapping noise. but i will still buy them again.</li>
            <li> These refill fit as if they were made for my Emjoi, just awesome</li>
            <li> THESE ROLLERS WORK VERY WELL. I EXPECT THESE TO LAST A LITTLE LONGER THAN THE ONE THAT WAS IN MY ROLLER WHEN I BOUGHT IT SINCE MY FEET ARE NOW SO SOFT AND THEY WERE NOT BEFORE I BOUGHT THE EMJOI ROLLER. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! I AM SO GLAD I LISTENED TO MY SISTER AND MADE THE PURCHASE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE WHO HAS DRY FEET. THANKS</li>
            <li> Love this little gadget.</li>
            <li> Great to have extra ones when needed.</li>
            <li> It still surprises me how well my emjoi works! You will go through these pretty quick if you use your emjoi often (weekly or more in summer) so I replace the rollers every 1 month during sandal wearing weather and I&#x27;ll probably go every 2 months once weather cools down.</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Great for my feet without hurting them,  can use every day with great results.</li>
            <li> does a great job but you might want to do it in the garage or out on the porch as it does create dust</li>
            <li> Love them. Cannot believe the difference in price from other sites.</li>
            <li> With the powerful NEW model of Emjoi......I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the original (blue) rollers.</li>
            <li> Good price and convenient way to order them.</li>
            <li> The price meet my budget, deliver on time and the product excellent</li>
            <li> Gotta have these, as they don&#x27;t last forever- they come in a set of 4, for way less $$ than the standard ones, fit and last fine-</li>
            <li> Not the best i&#x27;ve used...xo</li>
            <li> Easy way to smooth your feet without the need for a pedicurist.</li>
            <li> Received fast and as described. Fits Emjoi perfectly and works well for me on feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my wife&#x27;s calloused heels and the sides of her toes/feet.  Provides much-needed relief from cracking of callouses.  If you suffer from dry/calloused feet this IS the solution.</li>
            <li> I love these Rollers......</li>
            <li> no issues with this item</li>
            <li> Nice to have extra rollers.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  Not sure if these are generic or Emjoi they did not come packaged in the normal way but so far they work great.</li>
            <li> Since childhood, I&#x27;ve always worn thongs daily; in adulthood, 12 months a year. (Don&#x27;t get all excited--moderns call these flip-flops!) This has resulted in big, hard, rough callouses on both feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine. (Yes, it does require a bit of cleaning as its sandpaper gets clogged with callous dust. I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came with.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d like coarser rollers to make lighter work. It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34; (#1), followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34; (#2), then green ones called &amp;#34;Xtreme Coarse&amp;#34; (#3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try these in due &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Last for many cycles. Excellent product</li>
            <li> These are the best.  I have a callous on my right foot.  It gets rid of it almost immediately.  I can&#x27;t believe how fast it work!  Most of my callous pain was totally gone after using this.  My feet feel great.</li>
            <li> Actually, I am kind of disappointed , because these rollers don&#x27;t work as original rollers , which came with  emjoi, I used to spent only 5 minutes to do the job, and now I do it much longer time-at least half an hour, I might order the stronger rollers to see how it will work, these set is so-so</li>
            <li> So far, pretty good. I don&#x27;t know how long one roller will last yet. I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay for the brand name item refills.</li>
            <li> These work great and are a great price!</li>
            <li> These are working really well.  Sure beats a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> These are not Emjoi brand.  They are cheap &#x27;compatible&#x27; rollers.  I returned mine.  I&#x27;m bummed, I thought the OEM replacements were finally affordable but this is just someone doing false advertising.  The brand is Pedi Active.</li>
            <li> Extra coarse sounds nasty but it really isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s just a little more efficient at smoothing the heel than the less course rollers.</li>
            <li> just what was expected</li>
            <li> Very happy! Like this product a lot!!! 👍</li>
            <li> Best ever for your feet .</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, but otherwise very good</li>
            <li> Disappointing in comparison to the rollers that came with the Emjoi itself.</li>
            <li> Best product for at home pedicures!</li>
            <li> BEST ITEM, NOW I HAVE TO ORDER THE 8 PACK TO SHARE.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Works great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works well</li>
            <li> The replacement is hard too fine  I bought it because I need it and it does nice job on  your feet</li>
            <li> tough work great make sure your feet are dry</li>
            <li> Can quickly, great price. Was exactly what I ordered!!! Very happy and satisfied customer!!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well and makes heels so smooth</li>
            <li> This product simply works. I had my doubts at first if anything could remove years of Rhino skin skin from my always painful calluses, well this is the real deal. Goes into Micro-pedi and has left me nearly free of dead bottom of foot syndrome, highly reccomended, just use with caution and little bit every other day with lotion and in short time u gonna have happy dancin foots!</li>
            <li> put a towel under neath your feet when u use this, cuz it sure does work good! took off the dry skin, my feet felt fabulous!</li>
            <li> In the past I used a razor to shave off the crust on my heels.  This is much safer and does a better job.</li>
            <li> I am so glad there is refill so I can keep on using them every day to keep my smooth feet.. Thanks for post on Amazon or Ebay but Thank God for that... I am happy customer :)</li>
            <li> very satisfied, just as advertised, received very promptly</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It was just what  I expected.  I like it very much.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Last longer than expected</li>
            <li> only thing better would be a table sander but that might be over kill. lol</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.  Will be nice to have back ups when the old when gets used up.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised and I am perfectly happy with it.  This is my 3rd or 4th order of this product.  Ideal for home pedicures.  Smoothes out rough edges, files down thick nails.  Does the job perfectly!  Totally satisfied!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I love the electric plug-in.  No changing batteries constantly!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t peel dead skin as shown on tv</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my Emjoi pedi - and as soon as i discovered Amazon had refills i had to get them. I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; a bunion on the lateral aspect of each foot near my baby toe, heels get dry in the winter. These refills will help me get my feet smooth until spring when i can get pedicures again. I live in the north east - i do my own in the winter.</li>
            <li> great for maintenance on feet that just need a quick buffing.</li>
            <li> These work well.&lt;br /&gt;But next time I will got with the courser green ones.</li>
            <li> Will be using these rollers in the future with my new Emjoi!</li>
            <li> love these.  I have used several other things and this works best.</li>
            <li> Very good price and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the original rollers</li>
            <li> This product is really good. Easy and effortless to use, it really takes off the dead skin without any pain. I recommended it to my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
            <li> Great little item and refills rollers - keeping my feet really smooth.</li>
            <li> Great little device and i am very impressed with shipping time line from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Yup they fit and will do the job when I need them. I suggest you buy the corded Emjoi Micro Pedi device as the battery operated ones tend to stop too easily when applying pressure.</li>
            <li> good price for replacement rollers for my Emjoi.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered the coarser micro pedis. These do not work as well.</li>
            <li> No complaint with these.  They do the job quick with smooth results!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit the machine.  wasted money.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will order again</li>
            <li> great deal with pedii.cure solutions.  received earlier than expected delivery date</li>
            <li> Good price for this maintenance item for you Emjoi</li>
            <li> Really gets the dry skin off. Great product</li>
            <li> Works good. It loads up fast but easy to clean out. As soon as these wear out I&#x27;ll try the more aggresive roolers.</li>
            <li> This lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> I got a Micor Pedi as a gift and have cringed at how expensive the replacement cartridges can be.  This proved to be an excellent value.  Exactly what I was expecting. Works beautifully. Delivered in an outstanding time period. Would strongly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Used by wife once a week</li>
            <li> Refills are great. But only time will tell on how long each roller lasts</li>
            <li> Works great. Not lots of power but does the job as promised.</li>
            <li> Does what is advertised.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> great price fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> These rollers worked very well with the Emjoi device.  I also bought the green ones that seem to be coarser than these.  The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro-pedi is the best!  You will certainly want the refill set to have on hand and reorder when you get down to two.  I don&#x27;t know why I took so long to. Order the product!!  I&#x27;m going to order about a dozed more micro-pedis for Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. A must have.</li>
            <li> these should work good as long as the main machine does its job</li>
            <li> Thanks for the &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;....course product!....Good job and the rollers and sanders hold up on my feet!....I have feet that will put this to the test too!</li>
            <li> Great product, really works!</li>
            <li> love these because I love the micro pedi</li>
            <li> In between pedis this device is a life saver for dry feet.</li>
            <li> these rollers are perfect</li>
            <li> Received all blue, no green</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Replacement rollers perfect, and price was great</li>
            <li> I love this product! My feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done at a discounted price.  Next time I&#x27;ll order a pack of 8.</li>
            <li> Work just fine do a great job.</li>
            <li> I love my micro-pedi.  I was concerned that these refills were going to be a bit too coarse, but they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet smooth as baby feet!</li>
            <li> +++++  THEY REALLY DO WORK - VERY WELL - ORDERING EXTRAS  +++++</li>
            <li> Great.  What I expected</li>
            <li> These work great bought the unit from qvc but much better price on refills here. I was worried they might not fit but they are same exact thing.</li>
            <li> Replacements are just as expected for the Emjoi. But I am now thinking I may next order a roller with a coarser roller to do the job faster.</li>
            <li> I really love the micro-Pedi refill rollers.</li>
            <li> extras for pedi machine great</li>
            <li> Does a good job on feet.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal, excellent device (Emoji Micro Pedi)</li>
            <li> These work great with my Emjoi Micro Pedi callus Remover. They are great for lighter exfoliation and polishing the skin. (On my feet, anyway.) These are not the &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; rollers but they work just as well. I get a lot of use out of each roller. They are a tad spendy for what they are, but they are good.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, great deal, ty.</li>
            <li> These work so well to remove peeling skin on the feet.</li>
            <li> Emjoi Micro-Pedi refill rollers arrived on time, works great, but does not last long. My feet are not that bad, as I get pedicures every 4-5 weeks, and just wanted this for touching up between pedicures.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve struggled with calluses and cracked heels for years. The Emjoi and replacement rollers changed all that! Cheaper than a pedicure and I can do it in my own home. This is a woman&#x27;s best friend for sandal ready feet with ease!</li>
            <li> Works great.  It&#x27;s the best my feet have looked in years.</li>
            <li> Love this tool. Easily beautifies feet inbetween pedicures.</li>
            <li> These replacement work great!</li>
            <li> The product description is not accurate. The rollers are a miniature version of the&lt;br /&gt;rollers by the same name. I believe these rollers are for the EMJOI NANO.&lt;br /&gt;The product needs to be relabeled or a better description.</li>
            <li> Loved them!  I also love the fact that they are now offered in several different textures.</li>
            <li> Love this machine and refills</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if these are ok since I have had to wait for weeks to receive the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Emjoi are just perfect. Just what I need for my new summer sandals.</li>
            <li> Was returned, did not fit Personal Pedi</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, good price</li>
            <li> Extra coarse is just right! Be sure to lightly moisturize after!</li>
            <li> They do last a while, but with several different sets of feet under one roof it&#x27;s good to have some extra refill rollers around. If you are ordering the Micro-Pedi, you should definitely order these too.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and a great price.  So happy I found this site.  Shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li> Hard to rate.  They are what they are and work fine</li>
            <li> The emjoi micro-pedi is easy to use and just as good as going to the salon.</li>
            <li> These are great, but I should have just gone with the supercoarse.</li>
            <li> These are great. Will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> They work great and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Works very Well. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> They get the job done. My feet are beach ready</li>
            <li> The rollers don&#x27;t seem to long.</li>
            <li> These ate great well worth the value.</li>
            <li> By the term extra course I assumed it was course which is not the case at all, it&#x27;s more like a buffer than course.</li>
            <li> Love the micro pedi!! Works great on cracked feet!!!!!! Quick shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone should have this in your home</li>
            <li> They are just what I needed and will buy more when needed</li>
            <li> GREAT!! - my feet feel amazing</li>
            <li> Another great refill!</li>
            <li> Affordable refills, no problems</li>
            <li> Wife loves these, works perfectly!</li>
            <li> They get the job done</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Nice unit.  Hopefully these last a long time.</li>
            <li> WILL BE  USING THESE AS SOON AS THE ORIGINAL WEARS DOWN.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and great price</li>

            <li> this is a good product</li>
            <li> Works great and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> The extra coarse rollers work well; easy to load into the Emjoi Micro-Pedi device, just drop in after removing old roller.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My feet have never looked this good or felt this great.  I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;the Emjoi Micro-Pedi to anyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> received quick and is what is advertized</li>
            <li> Does a great job.  Love the micro pedi .  I would buy a case of refills if I had the money.</li>
            <li> The refills work just as well as the originals.</li>
            <li> Great price on refills!!!</li>
            <li> These extra course rollers really work, I love the Emjoi Micro and have recommended it to friends that also purchased&lt;br /&gt;It..</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is incredible! I just got these as a replacement, because I am not giving up my Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Great product.  A terrific value.</li>

            <li> Great service and product!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the genuine Emjoi micro pedi rollers do.</li>
            <li> As described!  Quick delivery</li>
            <li> I really love the emoji micro-pedi. The best product ever!</li>

            <li> Great sanding product</li>
            <li> Just the same as the one that came with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> Arrives on time, works well Just a little messy!!! but worth it</li>
            <li> These are the refills for my Emjoi callus remover. Work great.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT AS ADVERTISED, FAST SHIPPER !</li>
            <li> got the emjoi feet one now I can by my refill on amazon now thank you</li>
            <li> Came very quickly. Item as expected.</li>
            <li> Goes great with the product above...recommend getting it when you order the micro-pedi.</li>
            <li> It polishes the feet very good I like them</li>
            <li> Like that you can get extra ones at a good price</li>
            <li> BOught the Pedi remover also and these are the refills for it, my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Great experience. My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in excellent brand new condition. The refill works wonderfully and made my feet smooth. I really like how quickly and efficiently this product works. I would definitely recommend these refills as well as I would definitely transact business with this seller again.</li>
            <li> The wife says they are great and I am out of the doghouse!!!</li>
            <li> Love these but the &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34; Rollers are more for Finishing and Smoothing not for thick callus removal. I needed a more coarse roller for thick callused skin (Green or Grey). By the way, don&#x27;t grind in one spot continually without moving. It can get rather warm before you will actually feel it through callus and by then you have a &amp;#34;Hot Foot.&amp;#34; Please click if this review was helpful, Thanks.</li>
