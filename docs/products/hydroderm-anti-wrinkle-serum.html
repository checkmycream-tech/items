            <li>I will continue to use it as I have seen great results.  </li>
            <li>Great product and good service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, a great product at a better price.</li>
            <li>Hmmm.this wasnt effective at all for me.</li>

            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love the results.</li>
            <li>I was soo excited to get this and that a company would have it affordable.</li>
            <li>It absolutely doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re 5 star worth</li>
            <li>Absolutely top notch-on time, proper package and</li>
            <li>unfortunately, not the same effects as Hydorderm original anti-age wrinkle serum.  </li>
            <li>get the real stuff..</li>
            <li>Comparatively, this is a five star as it is much more viscous than other brands</li>
            <li>and I assume it has a greater concentration than the other brand I was using.  </li>
            <li>Works fine has a funny smell though, so I put a little perfume in it enhance smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a watered down version of the original age defying serum</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s old....</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I poured this into the old bottle I had</li>
            <li>This product is very watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference as the other does.  </li>
            <li>Watered down version it seems of the real product.</li>

            <li> not happy with this one , did not much same product as I had ordered before</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money</li>
            <li> to save a few dollars and got pooched.....</li>
            <li> Hard to apply without wasting a lot.</li>
            <li> Do not be duped by this fake knock-off!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Hydroderm for years . . this &amp;#34;Hollywood Collection&amp;#34; is NOT the same thing.  Thin, watery, and after putting it on my skin felt just as dry as before putting it on - totally the opposite of the real-deal.  Do not be duped by this fake knock-off!  Am returning for a refund . .</li>
            <li> great speedy service; excellent value</li>
            <li> Compared to the other anti wrinkle serum they make, this is like water.  I think it&#x27;s old....</li>
            <li> OK.  A bit too watery for my taste.  Hard to apply without wasting a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used Hydroderm products for some time, and always go back to the product.&lt;br /&gt;It is now over ten years that I have used it.</li>
            <li> Just got this a couple days ago don&#x27;t know what the results will be hopefully I&#x27;ll be back for what they say.</li>
            <li> not happy with this one , did not much same product as I had ordered before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, a great product at a better price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a rip off it&#x27;s just a watered down version of the original age defying serum</li>
            <li> Watered down version it seems of the real product. Results are non-existent feel like I was robbed..</li>
            <li> unfortunately, not the same effects as Hydorderm original anti-age wrinkle serum.  This product is very watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference as the other does.  I will not be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> Comparatively, this is a five star as it is much more viscous than other brands and I assume it has a greater concentration than the other brand I was using.  Four star is just on the product itself which is what I would rate as very good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money this is not a miracle product. It sits heavy on your skin and only causes breakouts. Complete waste.</li>
            <li> Great product and good service.</li>
            <li> This is not the same color or consistency of Hydroderm...don&#x27;t buy it ...total rip off&lt;br /&gt;Tried to save a few dollars and got pooched.....get the real stuff..&lt;br /&gt;I poured this into the old bottle I had and you can actually see the separation  this is not as advertised....</li>
            <li> This works well on your skin prior to moisturizer application.  I will continue to use it as I have seen great results.  Especially in the neck area.</li>
            <li> Hmmm.this wasnt effective at all for me. I am forever trying to do all I can to take care of my skin and improve it daily. I was soo excited to get this and that a company would have it affordable. After using it and getting zero results, I was saddened once again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely top notch-on time, proper package and this is my 4th purchase - can&#x27;t beat price-wrinkle cream and they&#x27;re 5 star worth Co.  It absolutely doesn&#x27;t get any better than this. Nick Mascis, Ca</li>
            <li> Works fine has a funny smell though, so I put a little perfume in it enhance smell. Still it works well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. I GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Love the results.</li>
