    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it stops the skin on my lips from peeling - a problem</li>
            <li>This is the best!!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; lip.  </li>

            <li>This is the best lip balm ever.</li>
            <li>lol this is the best.</li>
            <li>Product feels great on, but when your lips are hurting, this will not provide immediate pain relief and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great even in winter.</li>
            <li>happy</li>
            <li>It has a great consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to find that, even with Weleda Everon, as good as it</li>
            <li>The packaging is fairly gender neutral, another bonus since the lip balm comes in a pack of three.</li>
            <li>But this is good stuff; it lasts.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant and taste fine.  </li>
            <li>I find the rose scent pleasant, soothing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Great stuff and more frugal to buy three.</li>

            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li>i use to love this lip balm it would make my lips stay moist for hours and has pleasant rose smell, however they changed the ingredients in it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips moisturized and supple and gives them a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff.</li>
            <li>but Weleda is the most effective.  </li>
            <li>I liked this better than Burt&#x27;s Bees because it doesn&#x27;t make my lips tingle.</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm, and Amazon has by far the best price I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, and stays on the lips.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy too.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this healthy, non-chemical lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>More lux.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Plus, you won&#x27;t be able to apply it while driving as it takes two hands to get into it.</li>
            <li>, it is more of a salve consistency.  </li>
            <li>I love this lip balm, have been using it for about a year.  </li>
            <li>Perfect, lasting, nourishing, smoothing!</li>
            <li>So glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm for years and do like it most of all on market.  </li>
            <li>whatever else out of it, as that was one of my favorite things about it.  </li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>I am ordering more</li>
            <li>I also like that I can put lipstick on top of it without any problems.  </li>
            <li>The product looked okay as the picture.</li>
            <li>I love to use this lip balm before bed because it is very rich.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life -long best buy!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love everything about it, but what I love is the most important</li>
            <li>Weleda wild rose facial lotion has literally saved my skin and after having a friend that was a rep of the products I can honestly say Weleda is the BEST.</li>
            <li>The best product for dry and chapped lips you can buy!</li>
            <li>- RICH- love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for under any other balm or lipstick you may use.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Weleda seems to be the best in preventing the wintertime super dry lips that peel.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best lip balm I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Lipstick/lip color over it is just fine.</li>
            <li>Happy to find a 3-pack here, because I use this lip balm daily.</li>
            <li>, my lips would just swell up after use, this happens alot to great products they change ingredients to try to cut cost and its just not the same</li>
            <li>I cant seem to be completely free from it</li>
            <li>Light scent.  </li>
            <li>But I really dislike the rose scent from this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this purchase due to the great reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>The snap fit of the cover is satisfying like a high end lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, but it isnt a moisturizer, it&#x27;s really just a coating of wax.</li>
            <li>Put it on before bed and wake up with nice soft lips.</li>
            <li>I discovered these last year and really loved them.</li>
            <li>It is a very effective lip balm to keep my lips soft and smooth even through the most dry and coldest Winters ever.  </li>
            <li>It is mildly addicting.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li>It smells like roses, which is not my favorite scent, but I pretty much don&#x27;t notice that anymore.</li>
            <li>Weleda is still one of my favorite &#x27;natural&#x27; companies.</li>
            <li>To you it might not smell that way but for me I prefer something fruity and fresh or nothing at all.</li>
            <li>So luxurious - Worth</li>
            <li>This lip balm healed my chapped lips and has prevented all bleeding and most of the peeling so far this winter.</li>
            <li>I am a professional trumpet player and have tried many products over the years.  </li>
            <li>I always carried a tube of Mentholatum lip balm in my right pocket.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm!</li>
            <li>pretty nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason I have tried so many is even though they may be a simple ingredient list and even organic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, it works so much better than standard lip balms.</li>
            <li>I have tried practically every natural chemical free non sunscreen lip balm that is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am partial to the rose-vanilla scent, which is gentle and long-lasting (just like the lip balm!), but folks who don&#x27;t like a light, sweet floral scent under their nose should steer clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Favorite.  and less toxic than my last favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>Reasonable &#x3D; under $10.</li>
            <li>You can develop toxicity from zinc and titanium dioxide if too much is ingested.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves it and always wants to use it when I have it out.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m in search of a natural solution that brings the same relief Blistex gives me, but in a healthy formula.  </li>
            <li>New in package fast shipping!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty useless and doesn&#x27;t feel very nice.</li>
            <li>I received these three lip balms promptly, but when I opened them, they were too soft and crumbly, so much so that they fell apart when applying, and then they did not retract!</li>
            <li>I usually like rose scents and that&#x27;s why I bought these lip balms.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>There is really not much scent (a big plus for me), but the ingredients themselves carry their own scents which I do not find to be bothersome.</li>
            <li>However, after not using it for a while, I decided that although seemingly expensive, it was a better value and product than most others, and have ordered it again.</li>
            <li>but really miss the old consistency!  </li>
            <li>While I would recommend this product highly for prevention, you&#x27;ll have to reapply it often if your lip is already hurt, peeling or split.  </li>
            <li>recommend this product highly for prevention</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am aware that the original Blistex is the white and red tube contains ingredients that have been linked to cancer, and the menthol, etc.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all but this product is the only one that works for me consistently and reliably!</li>
            <li>Weleda never disappoints, most of my bath products are Weleda, and I use Little Twig too.</li>
            <li>This stuff is long-lasting, doesn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;stale\\&quot; smell as quickly as many natural products and, although it soothes and absorbs fairly rapidly, it doesn&#x27;t have the painful mentholated sting that you find in the Burt&#x27;s Bees classic lip balm.  </li>
            <li>It was very mushy and soft.</li>
            <li>my only caveat is the scent, which is a bit like roses, but it&#x27;s worth it for the protection it gives your lips.</li>
            <li>This is like putting a super moisturizer on your lips and it lasts long.  </li>
            <li>and now i am allergic to this new formulation</li>
            <li>The yes to Blueberries is good but more expensive and dr bronners does not moisturize as well but for guys it looks less like lipstick than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is scented with rose and vanilla and is clear but goes on thick.</li>
            <li>I worry that it will break off if I twist it up too high, but so far that has not happened.</li>
            <li>This keeps my lips moist on top of an oil (although not for long), but on dry lips</li>
            <li>I am disappointed, however, that they have taken the wonderful scent of vanilla and</li>
            <li>delicate, fresh , barely sweet-</li>
            <li>When I came across this one, I said why not and it is made of all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>but my search continues for an all natural, urgent care treatment to replace the Blistex.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found nothing herbal or natural that stops the pain, or smooths on and feels weightless.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local Earthfare or Whole Foods stores, so I came to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my lips soft and protected and lasts through the night into the morning.  </li>
            <li>It stays on without being too thick and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>long- wearing , lightweight , barely -there lip balm moisturizes all day/ night long, keeps my lips soft &amp; serves as a primer / preps lips for smooth, long-wearing gloss, lip color, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have tried at least 30 lip balms in the past, and this one is the best, hands down!  </li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t really feel anything other than soft lips.  </li>
            <li>Tried to get a replacement or a refund, but apparently the request did not go through.</li>
            <li>Its not great but its not horrible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4/5 stars only because I prefer a lightweight lip balm; this isn&#x27;t super heavy or anything but just my preference.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I found this to be exactly the same as it&#x27;s been since I&#x27;ve been using it (4 years or so).  </li>
            <li>While Weleda is pretty pricey, you won&#x27;t find yourself needing to reapply it as often as other brands (the last one I tried was Badger balm).</li>
            <li>Most of what I found does nothing for the pain and those that help with it a little feel heavy, waxy and plastered on my lips.</li>
            <li>less waxy/ heavy than Burt&#x27;s bees - just incredibly lightweight , delicate, long- wearing, moisturizing formula  </li>
            <li>I will not use one with any sunscreens synthetic or natural unless I am going to be outside for a long time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only curing solution I found so far for dry lips.</li>
            <li>Made with good ingredients and leaves out the ones bad for the body.</li>

            <li> That said, I&#x27;m in search of a natural solution that brings the same relief Blistex gives me, but in a healthy formula.  </li>
            <li> New in package fast shipping!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty useless and doesn&#x27;t feel very nice.</li>
            <li> I received these three lip balms promptly, but when I opened them, they were too soft and crumbly, so much so that they fell apart when applying, and then they did not retract!</li>
            <li> I usually like rose scents and that&#x27;s why I bought these lip balms.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> There is really not much scent (a big plus for me), but the ingredients themselves carry their own scents which I do not find to be bothersome.</li>
            <li> However, after not using it for a while, I decided that although seemingly expensive, it was a better value and product than most others, and have ordered it again.</li>
            <li> but really miss the old consistency!  </li>
            <li> While I would recommend this product highly for prevention, you&#x27;ll have to reapply it often if your lip is already hurt, peeling or split.  </li>
            <li> recommend this product highly for prevention</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am aware that the original Blistex is the white and red tube contains ingredients that have been linked to cancer, and the menthol, etc.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all but this product is the only one that works for me consistently and reliably!</li>
            <li> Weleda never disappoints, most of my bath products are Weleda, and I use Little Twig too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is long-lasting, doesn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;stale\\&quot; smell as quickly as many natural products and, although it soothes and absorbs fairly rapidly, it doesn&#x27;t have the painful mentholated sting that you find in the Burt&#x27;s Bees classic lip balm.  </li>
            <li> It was very mushy and soft.</li>
            <li> my only caveat is the scent, which is a bit like roses, but it&#x27;s worth it for the protection it gives your lips.</li>
            <li> This is like putting a super moisturizer on your lips and it lasts long.  </li>
            <li> and now i am allergic to this new formulation</li>
            <li> The yes to Blueberries is good but more expensive and dr bronners does not moisturize as well but for guys it looks less like lipstick than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is scented with rose and vanilla and is clear but goes on thick.</li>
            <li> I worry that it will break off if I twist it up too high, but so far that has not happened.</li>
            <li> This keeps my lips moist on top of an oil (although not for long), but on dry lips</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, however, that they have taken the wonderful scent of vanilla and</li>
            <li> delicate, fresh , barely sweet-</li>
            <li> When I came across this one, I said why not and it is made of all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but my search continues for an all natural, urgent care treatment to replace the Blistex.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found nothing herbal or natural that stops the pain, or smooths on and feels weightless.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local Earthfare or Whole Foods stores, so I came to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my lips soft and protected and lasts through the night into the morning.  </li>
            <li> It stays on without being too thick and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> long- wearing , lightweight , barely -there lip balm moisturizes all day/ night long, keeps my lips soft &amp; serves as a primer / preps lips for smooth, long-wearing gloss, lip color, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have tried at least 30 lip balms in the past, and this one is the best, hands down!  </li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t really feel anything other than soft lips.  </li>
            <li> Tried to get a replacement or a refund, but apparently the request did not go through.</li>
            <li> Its not great but its not horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4/5 stars only because I prefer a lightweight lip balm; this isn&#x27;t super heavy or anything but just my preference.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I found this to be exactly the same as it&#x27;s been since I&#x27;ve been using it (4 years or so).  </li>
            <li> While Weleda is pretty pricey, you won&#x27;t find yourself needing to reapply it as often as other brands (the last one I tried was Badger balm).</li>
            <li> Most of what I found does nothing for the pain and those that help with it a little feel heavy, waxy and plastered on my lips.</li>
            <li> less waxy/ heavy than Burt&#x27;s bees - just incredibly lightweight , delicate, long- wearing, moisturizing formula  </li>
            <li> I will not use one with any sunscreens synthetic or natural unless I am going to be outside for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only curing solution I found so far for dry lips.</li>
            <li> Made with good ingredients and leaves out the ones bad for the body.</li>
            <li> For almost 50 years I&#x27;ve been through a zillion brands of lip balm: big-name brands, Whole Foods brands, and small, internet company brands.</li>
            <li> in the long run is drying to lips.  </li>
            <li> This pack of 3 didn&#x27;t have one package with lip balm that didn&#x27;t have a strange odor.</li>
            <li> (the rose scent I loved is nonexistent, and has been replaced by this weird incense-like smell) and has an awful mushy texture.</li>
            <li> Other pros: It is long lasting on the lip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from the other balms I&#x27;ve tried; it&#x27;s thicker and has the consistency of a cocoa butter stick.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with dry lips for years and have used just about every chapstick and lip balm out there.</li>
            <li> I had this dry winter when using Carmex and Baby Lips.</li>
            <li> Every winter I get a dry patch on one side of my lower lip that peels and bleeds.</li>
            <li> It moisturiser my dry chapped lips without leaving them greasy or waxy.  </li>
            <li> My lips are never really dry, I always put a little oil on them after a shower and then a lip balm like this or vaseline.</li>
            <li> (Multi-use-&lt;br /&gt;Apply anywhere skin is dry / irritated !)</li>
            <li> It seemed &amp;#34;spoiled&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t have the same texture or smell as previous ones I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 7 years and recently ordered a 3-pack via Amazon because I&#x27;ve relocated to a remote small town where I can&#x27;t find it at any local retailer.  </li>
            <li> Fresh gentle cent, not overwhelming or artificial.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find that my latest purchase is so soft that I can&#x27;t apply it like a regular chapstick</li>
            <li> In this summer it&#x27;s not as bad because it&#x27;s a bit melty, but for the money the formula should be better.</li>
            <li> Everon Lip Balm is one of the few that I can use having multiple allergies.</li>
            <li> When I strictly use only this balm I end up using less and less with time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using only this lip balm this past year</li>
            <li> Yes its a little pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Which means I am less dependent on it.</li>
            <li> I do not like to have a heavily scented lip product while eating or drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the Weleda lip balm for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Some of the synthetic sunscreens are just scary especially on children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what the scent is</li>
            <li> It is a firmer product, Im not sure if that is</li>
            <li> I live in a very cold climate so it certainly isn&#x27;t due to temperature.  </li>
            <li> The single stick I bought last year never went bad.  </li>
            <li> Really luxurious , lightweight application but softens, moisturizes, &amp; soothes like crazy!  </li>
            <li> have complained about the scent.</li>
            <li> This is a thick balm, so you might find that you have to dab it on rather than smear it on.</li>
            <li> It is thick and clings to your lips.  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt it will hold up in the cold and dry Alaska winter!</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and can still feel a thin layer coating my lips when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> The worse is the texture.</li>
            <li> I was living in the Arizona desert and my skin and hair hated the dry heat.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because it does contain a plasticy-rose smell, which can be unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Some scents make me sick to my stomach and this one does not bother me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste weird or have nasty stuff in it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t be buying these again. :(</li>
            <li> Feeling disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bonus--no nasty chemicals, either.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a very effective lip balm to keep my lips soft and smooth even through the most dry and coldest Winters ever.  It&#x27;s healthy too.  Made with good ingredients and leaves out the ones bad for the body.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm, and Amazon has by far the best price I have ever seen.  Unlike other reviewers, I found this to be exactly the same as it&#x27;s been since I&#x27;ve been using it (4 years or so).  This is one of the few lip balms I have used that doesn&#x27;t create a dependency - it just really works well without being sticky or too glossy or causing breakouts around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with dry lips for years and have used just about every chapstick and lip balm out there. When I came across this one, I said why not and it is made of all natural ingredients.  It worked wonders for me and its longlasting. Not only is it soothing but you don&#x27;t really feel anything other than soft lips.  Lipstick/lip color over it is just fine.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Happy to find a 3-pack here, because I use this lip balm daily. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is long-lasting, doesn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;stale\\&quot; smell as quickly as many natural products and, although it soothes and absorbs fairly rapidly, it doesn&#x27;t have the painful mentholated sting that you find in the Burt&#x27;s Bees classic lip balm.  I am partial to the rose-vanilla scent, which is gentle and long-lasting (just like the lip balm!), but folks who don&#x27;t like a light, sweet floral scent under their nose should steer clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep one in my jacket, one in my messenger bag, one in my desk and one by my bed.  It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Mm love this lip balm!</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It works.  And I consider myself something of a lip balm connaisseur. Bonus--no nasty chemicals, either.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm! It&#x27;s different from the other balms I&#x27;ve tried; it&#x27;s thicker and has the consistency of a cocoa butter stick. It keeps my lips moisturized and supple and gives them a nice sheen. The best part is that it stops the skin on my lips from peeling - a problem I had this dry winter when using Carmex and Baby Lips. All in all, it should make your lips feel pretty nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars only because I prefer a lightweight lip balm; this isn&#x27;t super heavy or anything but just my preference. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Weleda is still one of my favorite &#x27;natural&#x27; companies. I love to use this lip balm before bed because it is very rich. So, it is on my night stand. This supplier sent me a three pack from France. The price per was so inexpensive!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, but it isnt a moisturizer, it&#x27;s really just a coating of wax. My lips are never really dry, I always put a little oil on them after a shower and then a lip balm like this or vaseline. This keeps my lips moist on top of an oil (although not for long), but on dry lips it&#x27;s pretty useless and doesn&#x27;t feel very nice. In this summer it&#x27;s not as bad because it&#x27;s a bit melty, but for the money the formula should be better.</li>
            <li> i use to love this lip balm it would make my lips stay moist for hours and has pleasant rose smell, however they changed the ingredients in it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well and now i am allergic to this new formulation, my lips would just swell up after use, this happens alot to great products they change ingredients to try to cut cost and its just not the same</li>
            <li> While I would recommend this product highly for prevention, you&#x27;ll have to reapply it often if your lip is already hurt, peeling or split.  Product feels great on, but when your lips are hurting, this will not provide immediate pain relief and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am aware that the original Blistex is the white and red tube contains ingredients that have been linked to cancer, and the menthol, etc. in the long run is drying to lips.  That said, I&#x27;m in search of a natural solution that brings the same relief Blistex gives me, but in a healthy formula.  I&#x27;ve yet to find that, even with Weleda Everon, as good as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly for prevention but my search continues for an all natural, urgent care treatment to replace the Blistex.  I&#x27;ve found nothing herbal or natural that stops the pain, or smooths on and feels weightless.  Most of what I found does nothing for the pain and those that help with it a little feel heavy, waxy and plastered on my lips.</li>
            <li> LOVE this healthy, non-chemical lip balm.  I&#x27;ve tried every chap stick and lip balm under the sun because my lips always seem chapped.  This is the best!!  I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local Earthfare or Whole Foods stores, so I came to Amazon.  Thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;Love the Weleda Everon Lip Balm!</li>
            <li> Outperforms Burt&#x27;s Bees as well as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lip Balms! Put it on before bed and wake up with nice soft lips. Works great even in winter.</li>
            <li> I have tried practically every natural chemical free non sunscreen lip balm that is a reasonable price. Reasonable &#x3D; under $10. The reason I have tried so many is even though they may be a simple ingredient list and even organic I seem to be allergic to something in them that causes my lips to feel like they are burning. I will not use one with any sunscreens synthetic or natural unless I am going to be outside for a long time. You can develop toxicity from zinc and titanium dioxide if too much is ingested. Some of the synthetic sunscreens are just scary especially on children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go to lip balms are in this order Weleda Everon, Yes to Blueberries lip line reducer (not the chapsticks) and Dr Bronners lip balms in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weleda seems to be the best in preventing the wintertime super dry lips that peel. I cant seem to be completely free from it but Weleda is the most effective.  Im sure there are chemical laden alternatives but those wont touch my lips. The yes to Blueberries is good but more expensive and dr bronners does not moisturize as well but for guys it looks less like lipstick than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained about the scent. Its not great but its not horrible. Not sure what the scent is but it doesnt stick around after application. Some scents make me sick to my stomach and this one does not bother me. I do not like to have a heavily scented lip product while eating or drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I would change. The lipstick type holder, the men in my family prefer not to use it. It is a firmer product, Im not sure if that is why its in the lipstick type dispenser. I have not had a problem with it melting in my pocket, I have not left it in the car.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, it works so much better than standard lip balms. my only caveat is the scent, which is a bit like roses, but it&#x27;s worth it for the protection it gives your lips.</li>
            <li> Keeps your lip moisturized with bee&#x27;s wax, jojoba seed oil, shea butter, etc. and doesn&#x27;t contain petroleum. Yay! I liked this better than Burt&#x27;s Bees because it doesn&#x27;t make my lips tingle. I also felt that it stayed on my lips longer which helps lock in moisture. I took off one star because it does contain a plasticy-rose smell, which can be unpleasant. To you it might not smell that way but for me I prefer something fruity and fresh or nothing at all. The packaging is fairly gender neutral, another bonus since the lip balm comes in a pack of three.</li>
            <li> Yay !!!&lt;br /&gt;Weleda Everon Lip Balm in 3-packs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very long- wearing , lightweight , barely -there lip balm moisturizes all day/ night long, keeps my lips soft &amp; serves as a primer / preps lips for smooth, long-wearing gloss, lip color, etc.  Perfect for &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; lip.  Smells &amp; tastes delicate, fresh , barely sweet- yum!  Really luxurious , lightweight application but softens, moisturizes, &amp; soothes like crazy!  More lux. Application tube vs. various Chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much less waxy/ heavy than Burt&#x27;s bees - just incredibly lightweight , delicate, long- wearing, moisturizing formula  - RICH- love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 in handbag, 1 on vanity, 1 in bathroom,  + extra&#x27;s - Yay!  So luxurious - Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy I bought several 3-packs!  (Multi-use-&lt;br /&gt;Apply anywhere skin is dry / irritated !)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life -long best buy!</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 30 lip balms in the past, and this one is the best, hands down!  Moist, but not so greasy that it&#x27;s gone in 5 minutes.  Light scent.  Can&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It keeps my lips soft and protected and lasts through the night into the morning.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I reorder it all the time! I have used every lip balm pit there (almost) lol this is the best. Doesn&#x27;t taste weird or have nasty stuff in it!</li>
            <li> Favorite.  and less toxic than my last favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> New in package fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The best product for dry and chapped lips you can buy! I have tried them all but this product is the only one that works for me consistently and reliably!</li>
            <li> It started in college, and that was back in the 60&#x27;s. I always carried a tube of Mentholatum lip balm in my right pocket. For almost 50 years I&#x27;ve been through a zillion brands of lip balm: big-name brands, Whole Foods brands, and small, internet company brands. While Weleda is pretty pricey, you won&#x27;t find yourself needing to reapply it as often as other brands (the last one I tried was Badger balm). There is really not much scent (a big plus for me), but the ingredients themselves carry their own scents which I do not find to be bothersome. This is a thick balm, so you might find that you have to dab it on rather than smear it on. Plus, you won&#x27;t be able to apply it while driving as it takes two hands to get into it. But this is good stuff; it lasts.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. I keep one everywhere. At work, the purse, nightstand. Weleda wild rose facial lotion has literally saved my skin and after having a friend that was a rep of the products I can honestly say Weleda is the BEST. Yes its a little pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I received these three lip balms promptly, but when I opened them, they were too soft and crumbly, so much so that they fell apart when applying, and then they did not retract! Tried to get a replacement or a refund, but apparently the request did not go through. Very disappointed with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm that was ever invented.  I can&#x27;t go through a winter without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 7 years and recently ordered a 3-pack via Amazon because I&#x27;ve relocated to a remote small town where I can&#x27;t find it at any local retailer.  I was very disappointed to find that my latest purchase is so soft that I can&#x27;t apply it like a regular chapstick, it is more of a salve consistency.  I live in a very cold climate so it certainly isn&#x27;t due to temperature.  I&#x27;ve resorted to applying it with my fingers instead but really miss the old consistency!  Feeling disappointed!</li>
            <li> I discovered these last year and really loved them. However, they have changed something about the recipe so now it smells different (the rose scent I loved is nonexistent, and has been replaced by this weird incense-like smell) and has an awful mushy texture. I&#x27;m really disappointed and I won&#x27;t be buying these again. :(</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm, have been using it for about a year.  It&#x27;s very smooth, and stays on the lips.  The scent is mild and pleasant. The single stick I bought last year never went bad.  I recently bought this pack of three to keep one at home, work, and purse.  Weleda never disappoints, most of my bath products are Weleda, and I use Little Twig too.</li>
            <li> Perfect, lasting, nourishing, smoothing! LOVE this stuff! So glad I ordered it. I put it on at night and it&#x27;s like I just put it on when I wake up. I put it on once in the morning and it lasts practically all day! Perfect for under any other balm or lipstick you may use. I have no doubt it will hold up in the cold and dry Alaska winter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm for years and do like it most of all on market.  I am disappointed, however, that they have taken the wonderful scent of vanilla and whatever else out of it, as that was one of my favorite things about it.  However, after not using it for a while, I decided that although seemingly expensive, it was a better value and product than most others, and have ordered it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm! I&#x27;ve been using only this lip balm this past year and it&#x27;s the only curing solution I found so far for dry lips. When I strictly use only this balm I end up using less and less with time. Which means I am less dependent on it. Fresh gentle cent, not overwhelming or artificial.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff! It stays on without being too thick and I love the scent. I don&#x27;t have to overuse this product because it actually works.</li>
            <li> I used Chapstick for years, then Burt&#x27;s Bees, Aveda products, Alba products, locally made products.... When I found Everon by Weleda, I was converted immediately!! I was living in the Arizona desert and my skin and hair hated the dry heat. Everon saved my lips!! Now it&#x27;s all I buy. It is scented with rose and vanilla and is clear but goes on thick. I put it on at night and can still feel a thin layer coating my lips when I wake up in the morning. Best lip moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best lip balm I have ever tried.  It is thick and clings to your lips.  You feel like you are putting shea butter on your lips.  The scent is very pleasant and taste fine.  This is like putting a super moisturizer on your lips and it lasts long.  I have a tube everywhere.  It is mildly addicting.</li>
            <li> Everon Lip Balm is one of the few that I can use having multiple allergies. I find the rose scent pleasant, soothing and not overpowering. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite lip balm. I don&#x27;t love everything about it, but what I love is the most important: it works. Every winter I get a dry patch on one side of my lower lip that peels and bleeds. I always look like someone punched me there. This lip balm healed my chapped lips and has prevented all bleeding and most of the peeling so far this winter. Other pros: It is long lasting on the lip. It has a great consistency. The snap fit of the cover is satisfying like a high end lipstick. Cons: My boyfriend loves it and always wants to use it when I have it out. It smells like roses, which is not my favorite scent, but I pretty much don&#x27;t notice that anymore. I worry that it will break off if I twist it up too high, but so far that has not happened. I am ordering more so I have one for my purse, one for my desk at work, and one for my bedside table.</li>
            <li> I used the Weleda lip balm for a few weeks.  I started breaking at the edge of my lips.  Finally, it occurred to me that the lip balm was causing the problem.  I switched back to John Master&#x27;s Organics and I stopped breaking out.</li>
            <li> This pack of 3 didn&#x27;t have one package with lip balm that didn&#x27;t have a strange odor. It seemed &amp;#34;spoiled&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t have the same texture or smell as previous ones I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I never leave home without this and always extra on hand. I have used this balm exclusively for probably 15 years now, and have never found another lip balm that works as well.</li>
            <li> I am a professional trumpet player and have tried many products over the years.  This is the best lip balm ever.</li>
            <li> This lip balm works well for me.  It moisturiser my dry chapped lips without leaving them greasy or waxy.  I also like that I can put lipstick on top of it without any problems.  It has improve both the appearance and feel of my lips.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and more frugal to buy three. This is a waxier feeling balm, but it seems to insulate my lips from the elements.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this purchase due to the great reviews on amazon. The product looked okay as the picture. I usually like rose scents and that&#x27;s why I bought these lip balms. But I really dislike the rose scent from this lip balm. The worse is the texture. It was very mushy and soft. I can&#x27;t even extend the stick to use it because the stick softens. My purchase was for a pack of 3 and now i don&#x27;t know what to do with all 3 sticks.</li>
