            <li>My favorite lotion and non toxic!</li>

            <li>It holds scent well and feels really nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just spectacular.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent value and works for me as well as any high priced competitor.</li>
            <li>Very light and silky.</li>
            <li>and I liked it but didn&#x27;t like the rather strong scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought 1 bottle to try and ended buying 3 more</li>
            <li>I love the unscented one</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my body</li>
            <li>I did notice that it does seem to sit on top of the skin even though it doesn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is unscented.</li>
            <li>great smell but very liquid</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more</li>
            <li>Maybe the scented versions are better.</li>
            <li>It is a lighter, more watery consistency.</li>
            <li>Even without the ingredients in consideration, this is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>It could be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>my favorite lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>They seem high quality and great that its unscented.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin and love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>Never disappointed with this company&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>There is no smell to this at all, which is great for all those sensitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to rub in</li>
            <li>Easy pump.</li>
            <li>All are easy to rub in, keep skin moist all day and do not leave a sticky layer on skin.</li>
            <li>THanks for the lovely lotion, the smooth, no bad flower smell - so nice to feel on my skin - all over my body - all day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s s great consistency not greasy or heavy, soaks right in and is an amazing price!</li>
            <li>Cheap for amount of product</li>
            <li>goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Although, it&#x27;s light I needed a lot of pumps to fully cover my body</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great price on a big bottle of odorless lotion.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a organic and paraben free lotion for a while and found this brand.</li>
            <li>I was about to finish my 32 ounce bottle of fragrance free Nature’s Gate lotion and spotted this in the health store.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good moisturizer made of natural ingredients for a while.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion right now.  </li>
            <li>(lavender goes on strong, but the smell quickly fades, so it&#x27;s not overpowering).</li>
            <li>this formula is more natural than Curel fragrance-free, and at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probablyw wouldn&#x27;t have ordered if I knew about the dimethicone, BUT sorta secretly glad, because it really does make a difference in</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good deal price-wise for someone who needs an unscented lotion.</li>
            <li>no bad smell</li>
            <li>Not a bad lotion, I just wish they didn&#x27;t have to screw it up w/unnatural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s gluten free and natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly unscented, and it&#x27;s very gentle on my super-sensitive skin, even on my face!</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer for dry skin in the spring and summer.  </li>
            <li>I like that the lotion goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly, but to tell the truth, I much prefer the Nature’s Gate lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is super light which is nice but does not leave skin as moisturized as other products.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth, but dries fast.</li>
            <li>Take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Nice basic lotion.</li>
            <li>I add my own essential oils to it.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the amount is useful, since I would go through an 8 oz tube</li>
            <li>The non-scented has a slight chamomile sent, which I find pleasant.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hands soft, without a greasy feeling, &amp; I usually put on lotion ,after I bathe or wash my hands, for the best results!</li>
            <li>Very little scent, which is great.</li>
            <li>but it also lasts a long time and is nice and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels good going on and it dries quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy or watery.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s on the natural side and scent free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this lotion is exactly for &amp;#34;everybody&amp;#34; but I decided to go ahead and use it since it&#x27;s just one bottle.</li>
            <li>which i like because it&#x27;s hot as balls here in Fl.</li>
            <li>I use it but am currently looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li>The health store only had the unscented, but I buy unscented more often than not, so</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent!</li>
            <li>I searched for Organic body lotion and this came up, it had a few good reviews, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>&amp; Last but not least, it doesn&#x60;t have a strong fragrance!</li>
            <li>leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>I needed a lotion that wasn&#x27;t full of harmful ingredients for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The large size makes me feel like I don&#x27;t have to skimp.</li>
            <li>Certain ingredients like the reviews say:ie:dimethicone are not disclosed on amazon.</li>
            <li>love this lotion very good price for it being nearly organic and love that it doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell</li>
            <li>THe whole reason I bought this was to replace some Nature&#x27;s gate brand hemp lotion that also has phenoxyethanol.</li>
            <li>This lotion performs better than I expected and doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy like a lot of them do and from the ingredient list</li>
            <li>Although I do agree that the dimethicone in it should be disclosed, it is otherwise natural and this lotion has been useful.</li>
            <li>I did get it fast but to the bottle was busted</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much like Aveeno but without the petrochemicals.</li>
            <li>Nice everyday lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice unscented lotion for everyday use.</li>
            <li>My skin is somewhat sensitive, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>As good as more expensive brands, and very low in harmful substances.</li>
            <li>pretty natural.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that absorbs so quickly (contains a lot of water) that I sometimes need to apply twice after my shower.</li>
            <li>Environmental Working Group (EWG) lists dimethicone as low-to-moderate toxicity, from limited data available.</li>
            <li>: DIMETHICONE COPOLYOL; DIMETHYL SILICONE; HIGHLY POLYMERIZED METHYL POLYSILOXANE; METHYL POLYSILOXANE; SILICONE L-45; DC 1664; DIMETHICONE 350; DIMETICONE; DOW CORNING 1664; MIRASIL DM 20; VISCASIL 5M&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------</li>
            <li>This is a real bargain and the ingredients are mostly natural.</li>
            <li>Product is not thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>Nice texture for an all over lotion, as it isn&#x27;t too thick, but does moisturize well.</li>
            <li>I like that it has no irritating essential oils that can irritate my skin while leaving on a nice, faint smell that I can enjoy while rubbing this all over my body.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this as an all natural unscented carrier for using essential oils topically but love it so much it is now the only lotion I use in my house.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, unscented, but a little light.</li>
            <li>My new staple.</li>
            <li>I live in Alaska and it&#x27;s super dry.</li>
            <li>Very economical bottle, used to make a variety of scented body lotions with various essential oils (grapefruit, lavender)</li>
            <li>I love that it has a light texture and not the greasy, thick texture that I despise!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a more natural body lotion that isn&#x27;t overpriced</li>
            <li>Need to reapply often to keep the skin soft.</li>
            <li>Plus the product is organic and natural.</li>
            <li>The description of the lotion and the list of ingredients on the web page leads one to believe that the lotion is completely natural, which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unscemted and has mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>it seems mostly natural.  </li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>Five stars if it were completely natural.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smell&#x27;s in lotion.</li>
            <li>Unscented lotion can have a strange smell at first.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time on everyone in my family even my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin at all.  </li>
            <li>the Nature’s Gate is the only one that really seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying a bit more for quality.</li>
            <li>That said, it is farther down the list of ingredients (which  are normally listed in order of volume) and from other hand cremes I know that the ones with dimethicone are the ones that leave me feeling smooth without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>My husband always gets dry and itchy spots on his legs in the winter and this really helped.</li>
            <li>soaks in quickly and relatively scentless, this lotion is affordable for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin with tons of allergies - this is by far</li>
            <li>I was looking at bulk unscented lotion to make my own scented lotion for personal use, figuring it would save money compared to buying expensive body lotions.</li>
            <li>Truly unscented, does not irritate sensitive skin, and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Second, it is not long lasting.</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I have found are smaller more expensive bottles which is not ideal for a daily body lotion.</li>

            <li> I add my own essential oils to it.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the amount is useful, since I would go through an 8 oz tube</li>
            <li> The non-scented has a slight chamomile sent, which I find pleasant.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hands soft, without a greasy feeling, &amp; I usually put on lotion ,after I bathe or wash my hands, for the best results!</li>
            <li> Very little scent, which is great.</li>
            <li> but it also lasts a long time and is nice and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels good going on and it dries quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy or watery.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s on the natural side and scent free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this lotion is exactly for &amp;#34;everybody&amp;#34; but I decided to go ahead and use it since it&#x27;s just one bottle.</li>
            <li> which i like because it&#x27;s hot as balls here in Fl.</li>
            <li> I use it but am currently looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li> The health store only had the unscented, but I buy unscented more often than not, so</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent!</li>
            <li> I searched for Organic body lotion and this came up, it had a few good reviews, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> &amp; Last but not least, it doesn&#x60;t have a strong fragrance!</li>
            <li> leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> I needed a lotion that wasn&#x27;t full of harmful ingredients for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The large size makes me feel like I don&#x27;t have to skimp.</li>
            <li> Certain ingredients like the reviews say:ie:dimethicone are not disclosed on amazon.</li>
            <li> love this lotion very good price for it being nearly organic and love that it doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell</li>
            <li> THe whole reason I bought this was to replace some Nature&#x27;s gate brand hemp lotion that also has phenoxyethanol.</li>
            <li> This lotion performs better than I expected and doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy like a lot of them do and from the ingredient list</li>
            <li> Although I do agree that the dimethicone in it should be disclosed, it is otherwise natural and this lotion has been useful.</li>
            <li> I did get it fast but to the bottle was busted</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much like Aveeno but without the petrochemicals.</li>
            <li> Nice everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice unscented lotion for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My skin is somewhat sensitive, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> As good as more expensive brands, and very low in harmful substances.</li>
            <li> pretty natural.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that absorbs so quickly (contains a lot of water) that I sometimes need to apply twice after my shower.</li>
            <li> Environmental Working Group (EWG) lists dimethicone as low-to-moderate toxicity, from limited data available.</li>
            <li> : DIMETHICONE COPOLYOL; DIMETHYL SILICONE; HIGHLY POLYMERIZED METHYL POLYSILOXANE; METHYL POLYSILOXANE; SILICONE L-45; DC 1664; DIMETHICONE 350; DIMETICONE; DOW CORNING 1664; MIRASIL DM 20; VISCASIL 5M&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------</li>
            <li> This is a real bargain and the ingredients are mostly natural.</li>
            <li> Product is not thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Nice texture for an all over lotion, as it isn&#x27;t too thick, but does moisturize well.</li>
            <li> I like that it has no irritating essential oils that can irritate my skin while leaving on a nice, faint smell that I can enjoy while rubbing this all over my body.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this as an all natural unscented carrier for using essential oils topically but love it so much it is now the only lotion I use in my house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, unscented, but a little light.</li>
            <li> My new staple.</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and it&#x27;s super dry.</li>
            <li> Very economical bottle, used to make a variety of scented body lotions with various essential oils (grapefruit, lavender)</li>
            <li> I love that it has a light texture and not the greasy, thick texture that I despise!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a more natural body lotion that isn&#x27;t overpriced</li>
            <li> Need to reapply often to keep the skin soft.</li>
            <li> Plus the product is organic and natural.</li>
            <li> The description of the lotion and the list of ingredients on the web page leads one to believe that the lotion is completely natural, which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unscemted and has mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> it seems mostly natural.  </li>
            <li> Natural.</li>
            <li> Five stars if it were completely natural.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smell&#x27;s in lotion.</li>
            <li> Unscented lotion can have a strange smell at first.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time on everyone in my family even my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin at all.  </li>
            <li> the Nature’s Gate is the only one that really seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying a bit more for quality.</li>
            <li> That said, it is farther down the list of ingredients (which  are normally listed in order of volume) and from other hand cremes I know that the ones with dimethicone are the ones that leave me feeling smooth without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> My husband always gets dry and itchy spots on his legs in the winter and this really helped.</li>
            <li> soaks in quickly and relatively scentless, this lotion is affordable for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin with tons of allergies - this is by far</li>
            <li> I was looking at bulk unscented lotion to make my own scented lotion for personal use, figuring it would save money compared to buying expensive body lotions.</li>
            <li> Truly unscented, does not irritate sensitive skin, and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Second, it is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Most of the ones I have found are smaller more expensive bottles which is not ideal for a daily body lotion.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it absorbs fast, and it&#x27;s long-lasting, to boot.</li>
            <li> and I did notice they got very soft and supple within a few days of use.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> I may order a different fragrance fro the company but not reorder this product, it has a sour smell like that left in clothing.</li>
            <li> Other LOW concerns:</li>
            <li> I have used it because my skin is dry and it do replenish.  </li>
            <li> My skin is just too dry and</li>
            <li> It does wear off a little faster than my other brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have some slight organic smell to it though.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix essential oils with to create a cologne lotion that I can use daily instead of spraying on a useless alcohol based product.  </li>
            <li> I have made quite a few scented lotions from this.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is not sticky or greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy either</li>
            <li> It might not be completely natural, but it didn&#x27;t fail to delight me.</li>
            <li> I feel like its a bit thin to use during the winter, especially for the hands and feet.</li>
            <li> However, I usually have to mix coconut oil with it in the winter and fall.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the smell is.</li>
            <li> Dimethicone is an artificial chemical and was left off the list of ingredients on the web page.</li>
            <li> lotion is not too thick</li>
            <li> Not as thick as the Jergen&#x27;s I was using, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Goes on thin and even.</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy or oily- which I hate in lotions.</li>
            <li> I am very ill and smells make me nausea</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!  Very light and silky.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I even use it on my face with tea tree oil and I don&#x27;t breakout. It&#x27;s great for everywhere on your body that it says it does. I bought 1 bottle to try and ended buying 3 more so I have plenty on reserve. I love the unscented one cause it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.</li>
            <li> I have made quite a few scented lotions from this.  The lotion is not sticky or greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy either but it does moisturize nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice everyday lotion. Consistency is on the thinner side. Cheap for amount of product</li>
            <li> As good as more expensive brands, and very low in harmful substances. Just enough to keep it from deteriorating, I think.</li>
            <li> Very economical bottle, used to make a variety of scented body lotions with various essential oils (grapefruit, lavender)</li>
            <li> Goes on thin and even. Very little scent, which is great.</li>
            <li> I will not order again.  It states it has no order but it does.  I am very ill and smells make me nausea I have used it because my skin is dry and it do replenish.  I may order a different fragrance fro the company but not reorder this product, it has a sour smell like that left in clothing.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion! I can use it on my body and face and on my kids as well. I mainly use this as an all natural unscented carrier for using essential oils topically but love it so much it is now the only lotion I use in my house. I have looked around and found nothing that comes close to the quality for any price.</li>
            <li> This is really good lotion. My husband always gets dry and itchy spots on his legs in the winter and this really helped. I like it too.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin and love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin! Best of all it&#x27;s affordable &amp; I like supporting a company that cares about the environment and it&#x27;s customers!</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion.  My boyfriend has the Lavender one and I liked it but didn&#x27;t like the rather strong scent.  The unscented is just as good and no smell (no bad smell either).&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is not too thick so it&#x27;s easy to rub in but it also lasts a long time and is nice and moisturizing.  I use it mostly for my body but I&#x27;ve also used it some on my face with good results.  A great all around lotion!</li>
            <li> soaks in quickly and relatively scentless, this lotion is affordable for everyday use. I did notice that it does seem to sit on top of the skin even though it doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion. It is not smelly. goes on smooth. pretty natural. and you get alot for your money.</li>
            <li> Great bulk size lotion container that can be used all over. It is super light which is nice but does not leave skin as moisturized as other products. Need to reapply often to keep the skin soft. Still, a great lotion for light use and does not aggravate acne prone skin. Plus the product is organic and natural.</li>
            <li> This is a real bargain and the ingredients are mostly natural. I love the fact that it is unscented. The large size makes me feel like I don&#x27;t have to skimp. Pump works great. Only problem is that absorbs so quickly (contains a lot of water) that I sometimes need to apply twice after my shower.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion after taking a shower and oh boy I love it! I love that it has a light texture and not the greasy, thick texture that I despise!!! Although, it&#x27;s light I needed a lot of pumps to fully cover my body but that&#x27;s alright because I think that it&#x27;s a great value for this kind of lotion. I like that it has no irritating essential oils that can irritate my skin while leaving on a nice, faint smell that I can enjoy while rubbing this all over my body. Oh I can feel the moisture coming into my skin after using this lotion after a nice, lukewarm shower.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good moisturizer made of natural ingredients for a while. Most of the ones I have found are smaller more expensive bottles which is not ideal for a daily body lotion. I prefer the unscented lotion for me and my baby. It&#x27;s a great alternative to petroleum-based baby oil.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion right now.  It is a good moisturizer for dry skin in the spring and summer.  However, I usually have to mix coconut oil with it in the winter and fall.</li>
            <li> Feels great, not too greasy.  There is no smell to this at all, which is great for all those sensitive to fragrance.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The non-scented has a slight chamomile sent, which I find pleasant. Works well on children and adults alike. Have also tried the Lavender which I find a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion and non toxic!</li>
            <li> THanks for the lovely lotion, the smooth, no bad flower smell - so nice to feel on my skin - all over my body - all day</li>
            <li> I was looking at bulk unscented lotion to make my own scented lotion for personal use, figuring it would save money compared to buying expensive body lotions. I found this one here was cheaper than those I was looking at elsewhere so picked it up. It holds scent well and feels really nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have some slight organic smell to it though.</li>
            <li> I searched for Organic body lotion and this came up, it had a few good reviews, so I gave it a try. The price was right and the amount is useful, since I would go through an 8 oz tube quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s not 100% organic so if that&#x27;s a problem be forewarned. Second, it is not long lasting. It does wear off a little faster than my other brand but it&#x27;s also a third the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good going on and it dries quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy or watery. I like the texture and when it dries I don&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy. I use it every day on my body, not my face.</li>
            <li> Dimethicone is an artificial chemical and was left off the list of ingredients on the web page. The description of the lotion and the list of ingredients on the web page leads one to believe that the lotion is completely natural, which is why I purchased it. This is not acceptable.</li>
            <li> The dimethicone is the only drawback to this lotion. It might not be completely natural, but it didn&#x27;t fail to delight me. It&#x27;s truly unscented, and it&#x27;s very gentle on my super-sensitive skin, even on my face! A little goes a long way, it absorbs fast, and it&#x27;s long-lasting, to boot.</li>
            <li> This lotion ranks really low on the EWG skindeep toxicity scale, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and goes on without greasy afterfeel. I bought the unscented and lavender and like them both (lavender goes on strong, but the smell quickly fades, so it&#x27;s not overpowering). My new staple.</li>
            <li> great smell but very liquid, I like thicker lotions</li>
            <li> Best lotion i ever used. Will be ordering more</li>
            <li> This lotion  doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well. I like that it&#x27;s unscemted and has mostly natural ingredients. Good price.Easy pump.</li>
            <li> It smells rancid. I am not sure what the smell is. Maybe the scented versions are better.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and no complaints.</li>
            <li> love this lotion very good price for it being nearly organic and love that it doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell</li>
            <li> leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Nice basic lotion. I feel like its a bit thin to use during the winter, especially for the hands and feet. But I like that it&#x27;s on the natural side and scent free.</li>
            <li> Certain ingredients like the reviews say:ie:dimethicone are not disclosed on amazon. I didn&#x27;t know this &#x27;till after the order was on its way. It also has phenoxyethanol. THe whole reason I bought this was to replace some Nature&#x27;s gate brand hemp lotion that also has phenoxyethanol. I think Dr Bronner&#x27;s is the only way to go as they are known to sue supposed &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; companies. I don&#x27;t think this lotion is exactly for &amp;#34;everybody&amp;#34; but I decided to go ahead and use it since it&#x27;s just one bottle. It&#x27;s a lot thinner than the Nature&#x27;s gate; which i like because it&#x27;s hot as balls here in Fl. I use this on my feet and I did notice they got very soft and supple within a few days of use. Not a bad lotion, I just wish they didn&#x27;t have to screw it up w/unnatural ingredients. Seriously, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying a bit more for quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix essential oils with to create a cologne lotion that I can use daily instead of spraying on a useless alcohol based product.  This lotion performs better than I expected and doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy like a lot of them do and from the ingredient list it seems mostly natural.  For the price you can&#x27;t miss with this product.</li>
            <li> A rather big oversight to leave the ingredient &amp;#34;dimethicone&amp;#34; out of the list here!  That said, it is farther down the list of ingredients (which  are normally listed in order of volume) and from other hand cremes I know that the ones with dimethicone are the ones that leave me feeling smooth without feeling greasy.  In the winter it is the only ingredient that works for my chapped skin on hands (no amount of organic olive oil based salves will do the trick.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a really great price on a big bottle of odorless lotion.  I have MCS (multiple chem sensitivities) and it&#x27;s not bothering me.  Probablyw wouldn&#x27;t have ordered if I knew about the dimethicone, BUT sorta secretly glad, because it really does make a difference in how well it works...this formula is more natural than Curel fragrance-free, and at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Environmental Working Group (EWG) lists dimethicone as low-to-moderate toxicity, from limited data available. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other MODERATE concerns: Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive); Other LOW concerns: Data gaps, Ecotoxicology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About DIMETHICONE: Dimethicone (also called polymethylsiloxane) is a silicon-based polymer used as a lubricant and conditioning agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function(s): Antifoaming Agent; Skin-Conditioning Agent - Occlusive; Skin Protectant; EMOLLIENT; SKIN CONDITIONING; SKIN PROTECTING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synoym(s): DIMETHICONE COPOLYOL; DIMETHYL SILICONE; HIGHLY POLYMERIZED METHYL POLYSILOXANE; METHYL POLYSILOXANE; SILICONE L-45; DC 1664; DIMETHICONE 350; DIMETICONE; DOW CORNING 1664; MIRASIL DM 20; VISCASIL 5M&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------</li>
            <li> Nice unscented lotion for everyday use. Product is not thick and creamy. It is a lighter, more watery consistency. I use it but am currently looking for a better alternative. Overall, it is a good deal price-wise for someone who needs an unscented lotion.</li>
            <li> I like their products. They seem high quality and great that its unscented.</li>
            <li> Good lotion. Natural. Helps for eczema. Smells like glue.</li>
            <li> Although I do agree that the dimethicone in it should be disclosed, it is otherwise natural and this lotion has been useful. It absorbs well, isn&#x27;t greasy, creates longlasting hydration. Five stars if it were completely natural.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smell&#x27;s in lotion. I used to use Nivea but it never worked quite as well as this lotion. I live in Alaska and it&#x27;s super dry. I needed only apply this once a day and it kept me moisturized all day. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the lightness of this lotion it packs a punch of moister.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Good value. Never disappointed with this company&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had cracked and bleeding knuckles. I got mixed results from lotions at Bath &amp; Body Works and The Body Shop. Got this because it has no added colors or scents. It also has the best value. My hands are amazing now.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion! It keeps your hands soft, without a greasy feeling, &amp; I usually put on lotion ,after I bathe or wash my hands, for the best results!&amp; Last but not least, it doesn&#x60;t have a strong fragrance!</li>
            <li> Just spectacular.  Truly unscented, does not irritate sensitive skin, and it lasts a long time.  Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My skin is somewhat sensitive, I like it very much. It is an excellent value and works for me as well as any high priced competitor.</li>
            <li> Excellent product if you don&#x27;t like all the chemical garbage in your products. Non-greasy, absorbs well and great quantity for the dollar.</li>
            <li> good product, put in office bathroom and everyone of the men like it. 6 men, im the only lady.</li>
            <li> I needed a lotion that wasn&#x27;t full of harmful ingredients for sensitive skin. Even without the ingredients in consideration, this is my favorite lotion. It goes on silky smooth, but dries fast. It does not feel heavy or oily- which I hate in lotions.</li>
            <li> Unscented lotion can have a strange smell at first.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a organic and paraben free lotion for a while and found this brand. I purchased the lavender, lemon and unsented. All are easy to rub in, keep skin moist all day and do not leave a sticky layer on skin. The price for the amount you get is awesome. I use it for my children as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my project!</li>
            <li> I did get it fast but to the bottle was busted so I rated on delivery not on product itself</li>
            <li> I use this all the time on everyone in my family even my 2 yr old. I add my own essential oils to it. It&#x27;s s great consistency not greasy or heavy, soaks right in and is an amazing price! I buy one every couple of months</li>
            <li> Great medium weight lotion with no scent.  Hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin at all.  Good price and quantity.  Nice texture for an all over lotion, as it isn&#x27;t too thick, but does moisturize well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a more natural body lotion that isn&#x27;t overpriced and so I&#x27;m happy to have found this! It&#x27;s gentle, unscented, but a little light. It could be more moisturizing. It&#x27;s much like Aveeno but without the petrochemicals.</li>
            <li> I was about to finish my 32 ounce bottle of fragrance free Nature’s Gate lotion and spotted this in the health store.  I recognized it from the reviews I’d read on Amazon for one of the brand’s scented lotions.  The health store only had the unscented, but I buy unscented more often than not, so I thought I’d try it.  I like that the lotion goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly, but to tell the truth, I much prefer the Nature’s Gate lotion.  My skin is just too dry and the Nature’s Gate is the only one that really seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin with tons of allergies - this is by far my favorite lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  It lasts a long time, it&#x27;s not greasy and it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent!</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s gluten free and natural. Not as thick as the Jergen&#x27;s I was using, but it works well.</li>
    </ol>
