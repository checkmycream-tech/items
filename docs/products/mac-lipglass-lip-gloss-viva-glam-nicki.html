            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little over played in my opinion, it&#x27;s for someone who might be a little desperate for eyes on her</li>
            <li> I can wear it both ways and it doesn&#x27;t look weird or barbie-ish.</li>

            <li> What a fun lipgloss! I would recommend this shade to anyone! Thank you so much.  Enjoy the Nikki Minaj lipgloss</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s good to use as a gloss over lip stick or liner not by itself  thought I&#x27;d be able to use it by itself</li>
            <li> Add a maroon eye liner and you have a perfect color! It lasts about 3 to 4 hours give or take.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!!!!! Its very nice very nice for a pop of color...my boyfriend says it compliments me very well...get this...youll love it too...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the color (I have pale skin, blonde hair and green eyes). The only problem is that this lip gloss is very sticky, but maybe that&#x27;s why it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Also, coverage is not very even.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and she clearly appreciated it. That&#x27;s about all that I can say. Sorry my review isn&#x27;t more... of a review I guess. Young women appear to like this product, that&#x27;s all I got!</li>
            <li> Im a deep caramel black woman and this color is gorgeous. Its not too much. Goes on nicely with a brush, not sticky, doesnt feel chappy, my lips feel moisturized. I feel pretty when i wear it. Love it in the sunshine! It looks great no matter the makeup you wear or the outfit. Make it a part of your lip colors for sure</li>
            <li> The best lipgloss ever, if you love the color pink this a must get! I get compliments on it all day</li>
            <li> Thick rich color a little goes a long way. If your darker in skin color stay away from this color it contrasts a lot</li>
            <li> I love Mac and everything and I like this lipgloss but to me it&#x27;s to thick on my lips, I had only use it two times and it&#x27;s just sitting up in makeup bag, but I will be using it again maybe with a lipstick I guess but I like it ...</li>
            <li> My favorite lipgloss (glass) from mac, you don&#x27;t even need an under color, so vibrant and beautiful and no longer sold in stores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;vd had a hard time finding a pink lipstick or gloss to go with the tone of my skin. I&#x27;m tan with yellow/pale undertones and have trouble even finding a good foundation. The color of this Lipglass can look scary and deter you from purchasing but it&#x27;s perfect. I read a review where someone posted it worked with a lot of skin tones and was very hesitant. With trying it now, I couldn&#x27;t agree more! It can be worn sheer or more can be worn for a pinker more vibrant color. I can wear it both ways and it doesn&#x27;t look weird or barbie-ish. Give it a try. It&#x27;s well worth the money and great quality lipgloss. Thanks MAC!</li>
            <li> Superr good! Love it so much! The Pinkish color works perfectly with my tone! Love this more than anything but I only use it in occasions.</li>
            <li> Hard to find. Was excited I was able to locate it. My favorite.</li>
            <li> Great price! Received super fast! Love it! Will definitely buy again and again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing special&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t be overly pale with this one though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little over played in my opinion, it&#x27;s for someone who might be a little desperate for eyes on her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll save this one for special occasions, lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my eyes to be the focus of my face and this would be almost clownish, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy the gloss and lipstick along with a complimentary liner and blush.  Def will be wearing this with brown mascara and not much else on my face</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t like how it feathers my lips.  It makes my lips look crackled.  Works better with the lipstick.</li>
            <li> love the color, the gloss lasts for a long time. I wear it all the time and look forward to purchasing more ... I love mac anyway :)</li>
