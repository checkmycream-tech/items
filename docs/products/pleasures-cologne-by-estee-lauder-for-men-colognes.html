            <li>Love the scent, get asked by MANY women what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>They love to hug me and linger smelling me.</li>
            <li>Great price, much lower than any of those department stores and same great quality.  </li>
            <li>Its not to strong</li>
            <li>fast delivery all around very satisfied</li>
            <li>A good old school smell like this one from backin the day and</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that the ultimate justification for choosing this very nice product?</li>
            <li>It is exciting, and never fails to impress a woman, however sophisticated and sexy</li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorite smelling colognes on him.</li>
            <li>Have always enjoyed it, price was better than local buy.</li>
            <li>Delivery time was adequate.</li>
            <li>the price is right if you want a light fresh smelling cologne</li>
            <li>First time buying this through Amazon.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s first time I bought it online.</li>
            <li>it was the first time I ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>verified by several compliments:)</li>
            <li>The bottle inside was exactly like described on line.</li>
            <li>all positive...</li>
            <li>May not be original because liquid is yellowish instead of clear and the smell doesn&#x27;t last a full day.</li>
            <li>The price was very competitive and I didn&#x27;t have to make a trip to the mall to pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Tis fragrance feels like a very diluted version.</li>
            <li>However this one felt very diluted.</li>
            <li>Will DEFINITELY come back for more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic, a must.</li>
            <li>This cologne arrived in new  packaging with the plastic film intact in its customary box.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised when it was delivered before Christmas.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised when I ordered it 4 days from Father&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li>It works well with my natural scent.</li>
            <li>I usually get this from Macy&#x27;s or duty free</li>
            <li>Proper retail packing, brand new.</li>
            <li>Although the box and the bottle look real but the scent and color are different and it does not last for a day.</li>
            <li>will only order directly from Lauder or a major distributor like Nordstrom.</li>
            <li>You can barely smell it an hour after you use it.</li>

            <li> I too noticed that it did not seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of it last all day long (and I live in a tropical country).</li>
            <li> Fake , different smell from the original</li>
            <li> He said it did not have the same scent as usual and wondered if it was old.  </li>
            <li> Been using this cologne for a long time!</li>
            <li> This is the cologne my husband has used for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> The time opened up the box, I knew this is not real.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product from Macys and try this one and its not the same perfume.  </li>
            <li> [i cant say that about other colognes].</li>
            <li> cologne arrived yesterday and the actual packaging did not seem as usually robust.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He then told me there was something about it that was not right.  </li>
            <li> ordered this less than a week before Christmas knowing it was scheduled to arrive after Christmas.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t typically think of Estee Lauder when you think of Mens&#x27; cologne, but this is a winner.</li>
            <li> This is not original.</li>
            <li> a few days he asked me where I had gotten it.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the bottle my husband misplaced while on vacation.</li>
            <li> saved a few bucks in the past, but today I got burned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all.</li>
            <li> it and it was very weak.</li>
            <li> It smells expensive.</li>
            <li> I am so mad</li>

            <li> Good price and like the smell.</li>
            <li> Exceptional value! My husband wanted some of this and I was surprised when I ordered it 4 days from Father&#x27;s Day and it came in 3. The scent is mmmm.. Stays all day and women in a line will actually move closer and literally \\&quot;sniff\\&quot; him. Pleasure \\&quot;pleases\\&quot; the ladies, he says. It periodically releases throughout the day too. Will DEFINITELY come back for more. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product from Macys and try this one and its not the same perfume.  I was not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Fake , different smell from the original</li>
            <li> This cologne arrived in new  packaging with the plastic film intact in its customary box.  This is the cologne my husband has used for the last few years.  There was nothing about the packaging or bottle that was remiss.  The price was very competitive and I didn&#x27;t have to make a trip to the mall to pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  When my husband opened this and had used it a few days he asked me where I had gotten it. He then told me there was something about it that was not right.  He said it did not have the same scent as usual and wondered if it was old.  I too noticed that it did not seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the bottle my husband misplaced while on vacation. This is one of my absolute favorite smelling colognes on him. Can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> i always get compliments when i wear this cologne.  [i cant say that about other colognes].</li>
            <li> This  bottle of Pleasures was a gift for my brother.  He was very happy to receive this because his current bottle was almost empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this less than a week before Christmas knowing it was scheduled to arrive after Christmas.  I was very surprised when it was delivered before Christmas. Great service!</li>
            <li> Have always enjoyed it, price was better than local buy.</li>
            <li> Product I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> A good old school smell like this one from backin the day and the price is right if you want a light fresh smelling cologne</li>
            <li> Very sexy scent for day/night.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; I have ordered Pleasures for Men here before with great success.&lt;br /&gt;But this time I feel I got sold some &amp;#34;gray market&amp;#34; goods.&lt;br /&gt;The cologne arrived yesterday and the actual packaging did not seem as usually robust.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it and it was very weak. Smelled almost as if it had been cut with rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I saved a few bucks in the past, but today I got burned.&lt;br /&gt;I will only order directly from Lauder or a major distributor like Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> First time buying this through Amazon. May not be original because liquid is yellowish instead of clear and the smell doesn&#x27;t last a full day.</li>
            <li> Great price, much lower than any of those department stores and same great quality.  Now my wife will be all over me telling me I smell great.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love how my husband smells with perfume. HMMM</li>
            <li> Still outstanding after all these years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t smell the same as if buying it at macy&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve always used this cologne and it&#x27;s first time I bought it online.</li>
            <li> This is not original. I usually get this from Macy&#x27;s or duty free (I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 years) and it was the first time I ordered it from Amazon. The time opened up the box, I knew this is not real. Although the box and the bottle look real but the scent and color are different and it does not last for a day. I am so mad and I wish I can return this. F!</li>
            <li> Love this scent, have used it for years. It works well with my natural scent.</li>
            <li> Been using this cologne for a long time! Makes me smell oh so sexy...verified by several compliments:)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied wit the estee lauder pleasures for men colone one of my favorites of all time ...fast delivery all around very satisfied ..5 stars from me ..</li>
            <li> my husband has used this fragrance for years. Just a little bit of it last all day long (and I live in a tropical country). Very fresh, ideal for all ages. It&#x27;s a classic, a must. Can&#x27;t stop kissing my husband!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this cologne and love the perfume too. It was a gift for my dad for christmas and he loves it. Its not to strong but it makes it presence known. My dad is a refined man who is always well dressed. It smells expensive. However, it will not suit my husband who is a stone mason and is a manly man.</li>
            <li> This item came perfectly in its original packaging with no damage at all.  The bottle inside was exactly like described on line.</li>
            <li> This has been my cologne for years. It is exciting, and never fails to impress a woman, however sophisticated and sexy she may be. Isn&#x27;t that the ultimate justification for choosing this very nice product? Proper retail packing, brand new. Spot on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often that I get questions or comments about the cologne I am wearing...unless of course, they come from my wife.  Pleasures however, is a different story...I get questions and comments...all positive...almost every time I wear it.  You don&#x27;t typically think of Estee Lauder when you think of Mens&#x27; cologne, but this is a winner.</li>
            <li> My hubby love this cologne. He refuses to wear anything else. Great price so I buy 2x a year</li>
            <li> Tis fragrance feels like a very diluted version. I did get this one before as a gift from another vendor and loved it. It stayed longer on my clothes and even after washing the clothes once. However this one felt very diluted. You can barely smell it an hour after you use it. I will not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my brother because he had told me it is his favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> A great fragrance from Estee Lauder for men.  This seller had a great selection and price for men&#x27;s fragrances. Great</li>
            <li> Love the scent, get asked by MANY women what I&#x27;m wearing. They love to hug me and linger smelling me. I&#x27;m always going to have a bottle! LOL</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. Delivery time was adequate.</li>
