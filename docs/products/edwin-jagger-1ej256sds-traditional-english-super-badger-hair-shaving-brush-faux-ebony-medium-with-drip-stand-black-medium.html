            <li>I am a fan of Edwin Jagger quality, and had a best badger brush from them that performed well for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>awesome, just awesome.</li>
            <li>But, in this price point, this is an excellent brush!</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful on face and whips up cream like a fat kid in an ice cream shop.</li>
            <li>Excellent brush.</li>
            <li>I know I got one of my best</li>
            <li>my opinion, a Jagger brush, along with Simpson and Trumper&#x27;s, are the best brushes you can buy.  </li>
            <li>- As I said before, I am a fan of Simpson brushes, which are known to be incredibly dense.</li>
            <li>/high dollar brushes aren&#x27;t incredibly dense either.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did!</li>
            <li>Great build quality.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Looks great in the stand....</li>
            <li>I find that it is a great balance between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also felt great on the face and seems to exfoliate well.  </li>
            <li>Great for exfoliation as well.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>An artisan website like Etsy is a great place to find them.</li>
            <li>Very nice Shaving brush and stand.  </li>
            <li>But after having this brush, I realized that every morning became a pleasure and an elegant start for a perfect day.</li>
            <li>Very happy :-)</li>
            <li>Good at the start, but longevity problems</li>
            <li>Works well, seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li>The Faux ebony handle is a good size (see size</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lather - This thing is a great balance between a nice and hearty lather while not hogging the lather.</li>
            <li>The brush has produced helped produce a good amount of lather  and feels good.</li>
            <li>It is superior to boar.  </li>
            <li>You can buy two of these for what you pay for a good silver tip.</li>
            <li>great size, glad i got the medium brush.</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of scritch which exfoliates nicely when lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are wanting a great brush at a great price, check out this Edwin Jagger Super Badger.</li>
            <li>The Edwin Jagger Super Badger isn&#x27;t incredibly dense...</li>
            <li>The handle is kind of medium-small size.  </li>
            <li>the handle is plastic of course but nice.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice stand to help with the drying process, therefore keeping the brush in pristine condition.</li>
            <li>really nice.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality product at a great price!</li>
            <li>Very soft brush with excellent lathering capabilities.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very comfortable size for my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush makes an exquisite lather, far superior to my pure badger, yet not a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>when traveling since it has a screw top lid.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like a travel size.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the bristles is better than any lower quality badger hair.</li>
            <li>Just about anything made in England is top notch....</li>
            <li>This brush lathers better than the boar brush.</li>
            <li>I also make sure to hang it up on the holder that it came with.</li>
            <li>This brush is significantly better than my cheaper brush, and by better</li>
            <li>yes, it&#x27;s an excellent brush, but you may wish to get a cheaper one to start with and upgrade later.</li>
            <li>Very much enjoying using it.</li>
            <li>but, seen better days...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different softness than my Simpson Best Duke 3.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, this brush.</li>
            <li>Hair packing is really dense and works up a great lather.</li>
            <li>Needed a heavier handle with a better grip.</li>
            <li>and i have enjoyed my adventure into this type of shaving.</li>
            <li>discernable difference from the most expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better value than a silver tip.</li>
            <li>Considering this isn&#x27;t much more expensive than their best badger, but WAY cheaper than the silvertip I&#x27;d say this is a very good buy if you would like a quality badger brush.  </li>
            <li>it builds a great lather and 2 months is still like new</li>
            <li>It is very soft and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very good.</li>
            <li>Badger - the cheapest and most readily available hair.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, the&lt;br /&gt;  best choice for the committed wet shaver.  </li>
            <li>It easily whips up a lather, as well, and as reported by others, holds a boatload of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it work great on shave soaps in a bowl, but it works just a</li>
            <li>Comes with a free stand.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaving brush, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Synthetic bristles are available for those who object to the use of animals  </li>
            <li>you really want to spoil yourself, keep your lather warm in a shaving scuttle.</li>
            <li>I liked the look of my Parker rosewood handled pure badger brush better, but that one was just too scritchy for my face which is much more sensitive than I&#x27;d like to be the case.</li>
            <li>I own three brushes: pure grade, super, and silvertip badger.  </li>
            <li>One more tip, just be very gentle with this brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush creates swirls of rich lather and seems to exfoliate well.  </li>
            <li>This works great, really good lather, soft, firm massage on my face....</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>I bought a cheap $10 brush first, and learned the hard,way once again, that it is better to buy quality the first time around.  </li>
            <li>like good quality and functional products that work...if you have a similar appetite then this brush will work for you...</li>
            <li>If you do a web search and compare prices, you will find that Edwin Jagger is the most reasonably priced of the three.  </li>
            <li>Quick response by seller.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush to anyone considering a silvertip grade but wants a more economical option.</li>
            <li>how well this Super Badger Shaving brush performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush on soaps and creams alike as well as super lathers, and with everything I throw</li>
            <li>Well made and lathers quickly</li>
            <li>I have been using the Edwin Jagger Super Badger Brush for about a month</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush so I have nothing to compare to but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The holder is also good quality and easily holds the brush to dry without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It holds a lot of water, which is good for wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>The one that I use more frequently (and</li>
            <li>Economical prices r a brush of &amp;#34;super</li>
            <li>This is a great quality brush, but it is rather small for a medium.  </li>
            <li>The Badger hair is beautifully soft, works up a great lather using minimal soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Softness - This is a very soft and comfortable brush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend purchacing the large Edwin Jagger super bAdger for only $12 more.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My first badger hair brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush to see what Edwin Jagger had to offer in the world of higher end shaving brushes.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was that making the lather was virtually effortless.  </li>
            <li>Like many of their products, the EJ shaving brush is on the smaller side when compared to competitors offerings (Art of Shaving, Old Original Shaving Company).   </li>
            <li>Soft tips, yet a firm stand, may even make this a better brush as far as feel and performance wise.  </li>
            <li>On top of this, after only having used this brush a good 2 dozen times, I am starting to lose several hairs per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to use, I wet the brush in warm water and shake off access, dip just the tip in the soap, then cupping my left hand to act as a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li>Whether I&#x27;m face lathering, bowl lathering (most common for me), or hand lathering, this brush creates a nice soft feel when I apply the lather.</li>
            <li>I mean that the hairs are finer, the brush holds more lather and water, and is better built, but I would question whether it is worth 4-5 times the price to someone new to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it is not as large as my Simpson Chubby 2 or 3, it&#x27;s a good size that doesn&#x27;t feel too small in my hands.</li>
            <li>I make sure that I don&#x27;t get the handle end wet with extremely hot water.</li>
            <li>but I think this will be purely for show in the bathroom...</li>
            <li>I have two Savile Row pure badger brushes, one is a travel brush.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really tell that much of a difference between the super and silvertip, although the silvertip does hold more water and is a little softer.  </li>
            <li>I had a much cheaper brush that wore out (Escali?)</li>
            <li>Both of my sons really like this shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>But it really isn&#x27;t a problem since I face lather.  </li>
            <li>they are cheap enough!</li>
            <li>like so much I have visited the EJ wesbite and plan to purchase some items for my brother and brothe-in-law this Christmas (2012)...</li>
            <li>Hold water really well and creates an nice rich thick lather!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Floppiness - I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a very floppy brush.</li>
            <li>Badger is used because of its water absorbing capability.  </li>
            <li>Still a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li>Still reasonable compared to the highest grade with little&lt;br</li>
            <li>- will not last long, as good reviews are reflections on the relatively new brushes.</li>
            <li>Good compromise between stiff &amp; soft means it works well with soaps &amp; creams.</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean your brush every few months or more often if you have extremely hard water</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>A high quality badger brush.</li>
            <li>High quality brush, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li>yes, I take the proper care after each shave, as well as prep it before shaves), after about two years of twice-a-week use, started shedding tremendously, being now about half of the original diameter.  </li>
            <li>Very soft on your face.</li>
            <li>As far as performance, it does a heck of a job!  </li>
            <li>I purchased two, exactly the same Edwin Jagger (1ej256sds) brushes.  </li>
            <li>this is the first time shaving with a double edge blade</li>
            <li>Holds moisture very well, to the point of actually needing quite a bit squeezed out in order to not have too high of a water to soap/cream ratio.</li>
            <li>The brush tends to slip off with the light handle, especially if you have lather on your fingers, so take care to keep the handle dry when using.</li>
            <li>Less coarse, better water absorption.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase but do wish that both the handle and the brush itself were just a little bit larger.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too soft if you are worried about it being too mushy.    </li>
            <li>It is soft and had no odor.</li>
            <li>purchased the Taylor of Old Bond Street \\&quot;Sandalwood Shaving</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at</li>
            <li>The shape and ridges of the handle really make the smaller size a non-issue for me.</li>
            <li>Dense, soft, luxurious feel.</li>
            <li>Jagger&#x27;s super badger (this brush) is just as soft to me as a silver tip brush, with a lot less expense and fragility.  </li>
            <li>It made much more quantity, and took quite a bit less time and effort to get to the &amp;#34;Sweet Spot&amp;#34; than my other synthetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brand new, has only shed two hairs or so in a week.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it is worth not being a tight a</li>
            <li>Just recently got into wet shaving, but I was very fond of this brush.  </li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than I thought it would be from the picture, but the size is just right for my face.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to shaving and have a limited budget, I would suggest going for a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; badger hair brush in the lower price range just to get started.</li>
            <li>Give it two shakes, dab it on a clean towel a few times, and HANG DRY!      </li>
            <li>but all of my other high end</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I liked the look of my Parker rosewood handled pure badger brush better, but that one was just too scritchy for my face which is much more sensitive than I&#x27;d like to be the case.</li>
            <li> I own three brushes: pure grade, super, and silvertip badger.  </li>
            <li> One more tip, just be very gentle with this brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush creates swirls of rich lather and seems to exfoliate well.  </li>
            <li> This works great, really good lather, soft, firm massage on my face....</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> I bought a cheap $10 brush first, and learned the hard,way once again, that it is better to buy quality the first time around.  </li>
            <li> like good quality and functional products that work...if you have a similar appetite then this brush will work for you...</li>
            <li> If you do a web search and compare prices, you will find that Edwin Jagger is the most reasonably priced of the three.  </li>
            <li> Quick response by seller.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone considering a silvertip grade but wants a more economical option.</li>
            <li> how well this Super Badger Shaving brush performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush on soaps and creams alike as well as super lathers, and with everything I throw</li>
            <li> Well made and lathers quickly</li>
            <li> I have been using the Edwin Jagger Super Badger Brush for about a month</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush so I have nothing to compare to but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The holder is also good quality and easily holds the brush to dry without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It holds a lot of water, which is good for wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> The one that I use more frequently (and</li>
            <li> Economical prices r a brush of &amp;#34;super</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush, but it is rather small for a medium.  </li>
            <li> The Badger hair is beautifully soft, works up a great lather using minimal soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Softness - This is a very soft and comfortable brush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend purchacing the large Edwin Jagger super bAdger for only $12 more.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My first badger hair brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to see what Edwin Jagger had to offer in the world of higher end shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was that making the lather was virtually effortless.  </li>
            <li> Like many of their products, the EJ shaving brush is on the smaller side when compared to competitors offerings (Art of Shaving, Old Original Shaving Company).   </li>
            <li> Soft tips, yet a firm stand, may even make this a better brush as far as feel and performance wise.  </li>
            <li> On top of this, after only having used this brush a good 2 dozen times, I am starting to lose several hairs per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to use, I wet the brush in warm water and shake off access, dip just the tip in the soap, then cupping my left hand to act as a shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> Whether I&#x27;m face lathering, bowl lathering (most common for me), or hand lathering, this brush creates a nice soft feel when I apply the lather.</li>
            <li> I mean that the hairs are finer, the brush holds more lather and water, and is better built, but I would question whether it is worth 4-5 times the price to someone new to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it is not as large as my Simpson Chubby 2 or 3, it&#x27;s a good size that doesn&#x27;t feel too small in my hands.</li>
            <li> I make sure that I don&#x27;t get the handle end wet with extremely hot water.</li>
            <li> but I think this will be purely for show in the bathroom...</li>
            <li> I have two Savile Row pure badger brushes, one is a travel brush.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really tell that much of a difference between the super and silvertip, although the silvertip does hold more water and is a little softer.  </li>
            <li> I had a much cheaper brush that wore out (Escali?)</li>
            <li> Both of my sons really like this shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> But it really isn&#x27;t a problem since I face lather.  </li>
            <li> they are cheap enough!</li>
            <li> like so much I have visited the EJ wesbite and plan to purchase some items for my brother and brothe-in-law this Christmas (2012)...</li>
            <li> Hold water really well and creates an nice rich thick lather!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Floppiness - I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a very floppy brush.</li>
            <li> Badger is used because of its water absorbing capability.  </li>
            <li> Still a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li> Still reasonable compared to the highest grade with little&lt;br</li>
            <li> - will not last long, as good reviews are reflections on the relatively new brushes.</li>
            <li> Good compromise between stiff &amp; soft means it works well with soaps &amp; creams.</li>
            <li> Make sure you clean your brush every few months or more often if you have extremely hard water</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A high quality badger brush.</li>
            <li> High quality brush, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> yes, I take the proper care after each shave, as well as prep it before shaves), after about two years of twice-a-week use, started shedding tremendously, being now about half of the original diameter.  </li>
            <li> Very soft on your face.</li>
            <li> As far as performance, it does a heck of a job!  </li>
            <li> I purchased two, exactly the same Edwin Jagger (1ej256sds) brushes.  </li>
            <li> this is the first time shaving with a double edge blade</li>
            <li> Holds moisture very well, to the point of actually needing quite a bit squeezed out in order to not have too high of a water to soap/cream ratio.</li>
            <li> The brush tends to slip off with the light handle, especially if you have lather on your fingers, so take care to keep the handle dry when using.</li>
            <li> Less coarse, better water absorption.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase but do wish that both the handle and the brush itself were just a little bit larger.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft if you are worried about it being too mushy.    </li>
            <li> It is soft and had no odor.</li>
            <li> purchased the Taylor of Old Bond Street \\&quot;Sandalwood Shaving</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at</li>
            <li> The shape and ridges of the handle really make the smaller size a non-issue for me.</li>
            <li> Dense, soft, luxurious feel.</li>
            <li> Jagger&#x27;s super badger (this brush) is just as soft to me as a silver tip brush, with a lot less expense and fragility.  </li>
            <li> It made much more quantity, and took quite a bit less time and effort to get to the &amp;#34;Sweet Spot&amp;#34; than my other synthetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brand new, has only shed two hairs or so in a week.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is worth not being a tight a</li>
            <li> Just recently got into wet shaving, but I was very fond of this brush.  </li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than I thought it would be from the picture, but the size is just right for my face.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to shaving and have a limited budget, I would suggest going for a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; badger hair brush in the lower price range just to get started.</li>
            <li> Give it two shakes, dab it on a clean towel a few times, and HANG DRY!      </li>
            <li> but all of my other high end</li>
            <li> On reading other reviewers reporting that the whole wad of hair fell out of the handle, I am being careful of how I treat it.</li>
            <li> The badgers killed in this process are mainly from Asia, especially China, where the animal is plentiful and considered a pest.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Simpson brushes, as well as Thater, Vie Long, Morris &amp; Forndran, and Kent.</li>
            <li> The bloom, wet or dry, is not tight.  </li>
            <li> Just got the brush in and used it last night, immediately could tell it was a big improvement over my other brush.  </li>
            <li> - When I purchased this brush, I noticed that some folks were a little surprised by the size of the brush.</li>
            <li> From a brush that is supposed to compete with other brands&#x27; high end brush, I would expect a tight bloom.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;plume&amp;#34; is a bit loose, but that is only a minor aesthetic issue when it is dry and on the stand.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid getting the handle end wet at all if possible.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement brush for gift I received a long time ago that has served me well</li>
            <li> Use a few tablespoons of borax and soak your brush in hot water for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it every morning for just short of 1 month now, and thought I would send some feedback that may help and assist other buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If youhave a little bit bigger budget, and can spring on a brush in the $100-$175 range, I would recommend Simpson, Thater, Vie Long, or Morris &amp; Forndran.</li>
            <li> On the down side, it has seemed to lose a few hairs so far.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that is only a few that were already loose and not my brush is already falling apart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a little over a month and have only lost one hair.  </li>
            <li> ** and spending a little extra money for quality.</li>
            <li> With the EJ Super Badger, on the other hand, I have stray hairs seeming to randomly pop out from the sides.  </li>
            <li> know you like wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> As the other reviewer stated it doesn&#x27;t have the weight that one would like to feel from a product like this.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that I expected something a little bit softer, but the quality of this brush met my expectations.</li>
            <li> a bush tied by some guy on his first day at the factory, fighting a hangover, and maybe even still a little drunk from the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> am pondering on whether to purchase the EJ black porcelain shaving bowl...</li>
            <li> I was missing.</li>
            <li> Fits very tightly in the supplied stand at the knot &amp; requires two hands to remove.</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft and firm, yet delicate, so you don&#x27;t need to shake the brush like crazy to try to get water out.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  A bit on the small side.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice Shaving brush and stand.  It is a little smaller than I thought it would be from the picture, but the size is just right for my face.  It is very soft and feels great.  I had a much cheaper brush that wore out (Escali?) and the differences are sizable.  The cheaper one started to lose bristles constantly, so I upgraded.  I am very glad I did!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush.  Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush so I have nothing to compare to but it is fantastic. Exactly as described. Quick response by seller. 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Both of my sons really like this shaving brush.  It is a high quality product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I own three brushes: pure grade, super, and silvertip badger.  You can&#x27;t really tell that much of a difference between the super and silvertip, although the silvertip does hold more water and is a little softer.  I&#x27;ve had this brush for a little over a month and have only lost one hair.  It holds a lot of water, which is good for wet shaving.  Make sure you clean your brush every few months or more often if you have extremely hard water like I do.  Use a few tablespoons of borax and soak your brush in hot water for a few hours.  One more tip, just be very gentle with this brush.  The hairs are soft and firm, yet delicate, so you don&#x27;t need to shake the brush like crazy to try to get water out.  Give it two shakes, dab it on a clean towel a few times, and HANG DRY!      As far as performance, it does a heck of a job!  I exclusively use [[ASIN:B00110OL0I L&#x27;Occitane en Provence Cade Shaving Soap]] and finish up with [[ASIN:B001G60EGW L&#x27;Occitane Baume Après Rasage, Cade (After Shave Balm for Men), 2.5-Ounce Tube]].  I use [[ASIN:B0026DWB7Y Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Shave Soap in Tin - 5.25 oz.]] when traveling since it has a screw top lid.  This brush creates swirls of rich lather and seems to exfoliate well.  It&#x27;s not too soft if you are worried about it being too mushy.    If you have big hands like I do, then, you may have a problem with this brush.  The handle is kind of medium-small size.  Let&#x27;s put it this way, I can palm a basketball.  But it really isn&#x27;t a problem since I face lather.  You may have issues if you lather in a bowl.    I would recommend this brush to anyone considering a silvertip grade but wants a more economical option.</li>
            <li> Just got this brush.  I am a fan of Edwin Jagger quality, and had a best badger brush from them that performed well for over 10 years.  This is a great quality brush, but it is rather small for a medium.  It feels more like a travel size.  I would recommend purchacing the large Edwin Jagger super bAdger for only $12 more.</li>
            <li> The quality of the bristles is better than any lower quality badger hair. It is soft and had no odor.</li>
            <li> This is pro-line all the way. Great build quality. Just about anything made in England is top notch....did you know that? Very soft on your face. You do NOT need to buy silvertip badger. Not only does it work great on shave soaps in a bowl, but it works just a s well for shaving creams in a tube.</li>
            <li> I purchased two, exactly the same Edwin Jagger (1ej256sds) brushes.  The one that I use more frequently (and yes, I take the proper care after each shave, as well as prep it before shaves), after about two years of twice-a-week use, started shedding tremendously, being now about half of the original diameter.  Good at the start, but longevity problems - will not last long, as good reviews are reflections on the relatively new brushes.</li>
            <li> Like many of their products, the EJ shaving brush is on the smaller side when compared to competitors offerings (Art of Shaving, Old Original Shaving Company).   I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase but do wish that both the handle and the brush itself were just a little bit larger.  Pros:  Attractive design.  Comes with a free stand.  Cons:  A bit on the small side.  As the other reviewer stated it doesn&#x27;t have the weight that one would like to feel from a product like this.</li>
            <li> My first badger hair brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others. Works well, seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of shaving brushes before and in fact did not care about the quality. But after having this brush, I realized that every morning became a pleasure and an elegant start for a perfect day.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s true.  The reports are no hype.  This brush feels as close as you can get, or even equal to, a silver tip...  at a fraction of the price. Soft tips, yet a firm stand, may even make this a better brush as far as feel and performance wise.  It easily whips up a lather, as well, and as reported by others, holds a boatload of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have some concerns with this brush.  The bloom, wet or dry, is not tight.  From a brush that is supposed to compete with other brands&#x27; high end brush, I would expect a tight bloom.  With the EJ Super Badger, on the other hand, I have stray hairs seeming to randomly pop out from the sides.  On top of this, after only having used this brush a good 2 dozen times, I am starting to lose several hairs per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that I got a fluke... a bush tied by some guy on his first day at the factory, fighting a hangover, and maybe even still a little drunk from the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were it not for that, the brush would get 5 stars from me... and I would be getting another to replace my &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; travel brush.  Heck, I still might... they are cheap enough!</li>
            <li> awesome, just awesome. great size, glad i got the medium brush. it builds a great lather and 2 months is still like new</li>
            <li> This brush does a great job at holding water. My previous brush, a boar brush, held a lot less. This brush lathers better than the boar brush. On the down side, it has seemed to lose a few hairs so far. I am hoping that is only a few that were already loose and not my brush is already falling apart. On reading other reviewers reporting that the whole wad of hair fell out of the handle, I am being careful of how I treat it. I try to avoid getting the handle end wet at all if possible. I make sure that I don&#x27;t get the handle end wet with extremely hot water. I also make sure to hang it up on the holder that it came with. If anything happens, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, another thought. My face appreciates the softer badger hairs.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. Economical prices r a brush of &amp;#34;super badger&amp;#34; quality. the handle is plastic of course but nice. The Badger hair is beautifully soft, works up a great lather using minimal soap. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have two brushes. This one and a cheaper ($12) badger hair brush. If you&#x27;re new to shaving and have a limited budget, I would suggest going for a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; badger hair brush in the lower price range just to get started. This brush is significantly better than my cheaper brush, and by better I mean that the hairs are finer, the brush holds more lather and water, and is better built, but I would question whether it is worth 4-5 times the price to someone new to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it&#x27;s an excellent brush, but you may wish to get a cheaper one to start with and upgrade later. That way you&#x27;ll get a &amp;#34;travel brush&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;good brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap $10 brush first, and learned the hard,way once again, that it is better to buy quality the first time around.  It holds together well and lathers great.  I do have to say that I expected something a little bit softer, but the quality of this brush met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I liked the look of my Parker rosewood handled pure badger brush better, but that one was just too scritchy for my face which is much more sensitive than I&#x27;d like to be the case. This one felt like heaven comparatively speaking. Very much enjoying using it. Par of what makes me look forward to my double edged razor shaves.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement brush for gift I received a long time ago that has served me well but, seen better days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research on shaving brushes, I took the plunge with this one. I have been using it every morning for just short of 1 month now, and thought I would send some feedback that may help and assist other buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to the brush in hand...it&#x27;s great. I look forward to shaving with this brush. It comes with a nice stand to help with the drying process, therefore keeping the brush in pristine condition. The Faux ebony handle is a good size (see size below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, I wet the brush in warm water and shake off access, dip just the tip in the soap, then cupping my left hand to act as a shaving bowl. This works great, really good lather, soft, firm massage on my face....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like so much I have visited the EJ wesbite and plan to purchase some items for my brother and brothe-in-law this Christmas (2012)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like good quality and functional products that work...if you have a similar appetite then this brush will work for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Taylor of Old Bond Street \\&quot;Sandalwood Shaving Cream\\&quot; with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pondering on whether to purchase the EJ black porcelain shaving bowl...but I think this will be purely for show in the bathroom...not sure yet!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE:&lt;br /&gt;Handle - Length 48 mm, Diameter 30 mm,&lt;br /&gt;Brush - Length 50 mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks great in the stand....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Buy! Very happy :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush, especially for the price.  Hold water really well and creates an nice rich thick lather!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Simpson brushes, as well as Thater, Vie Long, Morris &amp; Forndran, and Kent. I purchased this brush to see what Edwin Jagger had to offer in the world of higher end shaving brushes. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this Super Badger Shaving brush performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Density - As I said before, I am a fan of Simpson brushes, which are known to be incredibly dense. The Edwin Jagger Super Badger isn&#x27;t incredibly dense...but all of my other high end/high dollar brushes aren&#x27;t incredibly dense either. This brush has just enough density to give it a solid backbone for soaps and creams alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floppiness - I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a very floppy brush. It&#x27;s not floppy, but it&#x27;s not rigid. I find that it is a great balance between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Softness - This is a very soft and comfortable brush. Whether I&#x27;m face lathering, bowl lathering (most common for me), or hand lathering, this brush creates a nice soft feel when I apply the lather. It&#x27;s a different softness than my Simpson Best Duke 3. It has a good amount of scritch which exfoliates nicely when lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather - This thing is a great balance between a nice and hearty lather while not hogging the lather. It creates enough lather for a 3 pass shave with enough left over for a touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size - When I purchased this brush, I noticed that some folks were a little surprised by the size of the brush. Some have even commented that it is on the small side of brushes. While it is not as large as my Simpson Chubby 2 or 3, it&#x27;s a good size that doesn&#x27;t feel too small in my hands. And I have XL hands. The shape and ridges of the handle really make the smaller size a non-issue for me. It&#x27;s a very comfortable size for my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush on soaps and creams alike as well as super lathers, and with everything I throw it&#x27;s way, this EJ Brush excels! If you are wanting a great brush at a great price, check out this Edwin Jagger Super Badger. If youhave a little bit bigger budget, and can spring on a brush in the $100-$175 range, I would recommend Simpson, Thater, Vie Long, or Morris &amp; Forndran. But, in this price point, this is an excellent brush!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, this brush. It feels wonderful on face and whips up cream like a fat kid in an ice cream shop. I had a VDH brush prior to this and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. Sometimes it is worth not being a tight a** and spending a little extra money for quality.</li>
            <li> Well made and lathers quickly</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. Almost 100% facial coverage in a couple of swipes. I have used it for about a month and lost 2-3 hairs. Hair packing is really dense and works up a great lather. Needed a heavier handle with a better grip. The brush tends to slip off with the light handle, especially if you have lather on your fingers, so take care to keep the handle dry when using.</li>
            <li> really nice. I know it wasn&#x27;t  the softest I could buy but I knew that .</li>
            <li> Just got the brush in and used it last night, immediately could tell it was a big improvement over my other brush.  Just recently got into wet shaving, but I was very fond of this brush.  First thing I noticed was that making the lather was virtually effortless.  It made much more quantity, and took quite a bit less time and effort to get to the &amp;#34;Sweet Spot&amp;#34; than my other synthetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also felt great on the face and seems to exfoliate well.  I know I got one of my best shaves yet using this brush, so I have no complaints.  I took the liberty of adding some pictures of the ACTUAL brush instead of just the box.  Figured some of you would like to see what it looks like.  Considering this isn&#x27;t much more expensive than their best badger, but WAY cheaper than the silvertip I&#x27;d say this is a very good buy if you would like a quality badger brush.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This brush has met all my expectations. I have been using the Edwin Jagger Super Badger Brush for about a month this is the first time shaving with a double edge blade and i have enjoyed my adventure into this type of shaving. The brush has produced helped produce a good amount of lather  and feels good.</li>
            <li> This brush is my third shaving brush.  I have two Savile Row pure badger brushes, one is a travel brush.  I should back up and explain the grades of badger brushes.  Badger is used because of its water absorbing capability.  It is superior to boar.  The badgers killed in this process are mainly from Asia, especially China, where the animal is plentiful and considered a pest.  Synthetic bristles are available for those who object to the use of animals  There are 4 grades of badger brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Badger - the cheapest and most readily available hair.  If you are a beginner, start here.  Don&#x27;t spend money until you&lt;br /&gt;  know you like wet shaving.  It is the coarsest in texture of all grades. Great for exfoliation as well.&lt;br /&gt;Best Badger - a definite step up.  Less coarse, better water absorption. Still a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Super Badger - finer, no scratchiness on the face. Dense, soft, luxurious feel. Of course, more expensive.  In my opinion, the&lt;br /&gt;  best choice for the committed wet shaver.  Still reasonable compared to the highest grade with little&lt;br /&gt;  discernable difference from the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Silvertip - rarest and highest grade.  Thus, most expensive.However here, you must take care of the brush to avoid bristles&lt;br /&gt;  breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, a Jagger brush, along with Simpson and Trumper&#x27;s, are the best brushes you can buy.  If you do a web search and compare prices, you will find that Edwin Jagger is the most reasonably priced of the three.  Jagger&#x27;s super badger (this brush) is just as soft to me as a silver tip brush, with a lot less expense and fragility.  This brush makes an exquisite lather, far superior to my pure badger, yet not a lot more money.  The holder is also good quality and easily holds the brush to dry without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to spoil yourself, keep your lather warm in a shaving scuttle. An artisan website like Etsy is a great place to find them.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush with excellent lathering capabilities. Holds moisture very well, to the point of actually needing quite a bit squeezed out in order to not have too high of a water to soap/cream ratio. Brand new, has only shed two hairs or so in a week. The &amp;#34;plume&amp;#34; is a bit loose, but that is only a minor aesthetic issue when it is dry and on the stand. Overall, very good.</li>
            <li> A high quality badger brush. Doesn&#x27;t seem to shed. Much better value than a silver tip. You can buy two of these for what you pay for a good silver tip. Retains water well. Good compromise between stiff &amp; soft means it works well with soaps &amp; creams. Stray bristles on the outside stick out. It affects how it displays but doesn&#x27;t affect the shaving experience. Fits very tightly in the supplied stand at the knot &amp; requires two hands to remove.</li>
            <li> High quality brush, my husband loves it.</li>
