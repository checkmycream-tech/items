            <li>It is very pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell very good at all.  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers thought it smelled great.  </li>
            <li>great moisturizer for your skin</li>
            <li>the price is great also</li>
            <li>I am so happy that St. Ives has started making this product.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more!!</li>
            <li>very nice smell, not like others I&#x27;ve tried that smelled medicinal, would buy again.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell good at all</li>
            <li>And it smells good too.</li>
            <li>Every body said this lotion smelt good</li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about this lotion -</li>
            <li>I did not see what percentage of AHA it has anywhere on the bottle, but it does have lactic acid in it which is supposed to be wonderful for your skin and mild.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Nice price for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually kind of aggravating.  </li>
            <li>I pH tested it - 3.5, which is the pH needed for the lactic acid to be effective.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely into the skin, and does not feel greasy to me.</li>
            <li>Good price, ok product, but</li>
            <li>fragrance is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Light and nongreasy with a pleasant fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>However, most stores don&#x27;t carry this one for some reason.  </li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be buying any more lotion out of this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I thought it was more like chemical smell covered up with perfumey smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but can&#x27;t beat the Emlactin stuff my dermatologist told me to get instead.</li>
            <li>While it being better than nothing</li>
            <li>I used this lotion on my arms and legs mostly.</li>
            <li>great cream, really moisturises</li>
            <li>I love St Ives lotions, and the fact the this one had AHA for cellular renewal and increased turnover rate makes it all the better.</li>
            <li>it smells wonderful, dries quickly, goes on smoothly, and is safe for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I hope the product is still OK, seems fine...</li>
            <li>it was light and it does moisturize and smell ok.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and works well as a moisturizer and good for sensitive skin especially good for those who live in hot and humid climates like me.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as the AlphyGlycolic and Alpha Hydrox creams in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>cannot yet comment on its smoothing ability since I haven&#x27;t used it for very long, but its moisturizing ability seems to be very good.</li>
            <li>the density isn&#x27;t watery and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>There is another lotion that is slightly acidic out on the market for the body that has excellent reviews..</li>
            <li>This stuff made have worked fine</li>
            <li>I have pretty severe keratosis pilaris all over my body, so I&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing to help improve my condition a</li>
            <li>this lotion is lighter and absorbs relatively quickly, and leaves my legs feeling much more moisturized.</li>
            <li>But at the end of day if I use this every day, my skin has a firmer smooth feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>My chest acne has been greatly reduced, as has the bumps on my upper arms, in a matter of 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However!!</li>
            <li>So this lotion does not leave you sticky, it smells good, and it smooths skin, reminds me of the way my skin felt when I was in my early 20&#x27;s/late teens.  </li>
            <li>The Naturally Smooth lotion smells nice, goes on smooth and keeps skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Probably would not get again, but I am more sensitive to smells than most people.</li>
            <li>This is a nice lotion for frequent use.</li>
            <li>use it after bath, good body lotion, but not enough for elbows and heels, I have to put something thicker to those area.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The thing about this lotion is it is not very expensive, it has a pleasant smell which dissipated within an hour, and it is fast absorbing and light and truly does make your skin feel smoother.  </li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s just super inefficient.  </li>
            <li>It is not as effective as the 10% stuff and does not have the strong odor characteristic of the 10% lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells nice (light fruity smell) but doesn&#x27;t linger too long, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Right away my skin seemed brighter and mildly exfoliated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would spend the extra money to get amlactin honestly.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying a St. Ives lotion, I used the apricot scrubs and loved them and thought of course this lotion would be just as good, I was wrong.</li>
            <li>i have mild dermatitis and eczema, and have tried many different lotions.</li>
            <li>It does smell funny, but not too strong, so I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I added lavender and orange extract to it and at the time I was pregnant and the smell was too much for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good summer lotion but is probably not heavy enough for winter.</li>
            <li>This is more lighter, and it helps my chest and back acne and bumps on my arms.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite lotion - feels light &amp; fresh, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy or like a heavy residue is on skin.</li>
            <li>The first lotion I don&#x27;t mind using because it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>lactic acid and fruit acids are listed on the label, although the exact percentages are not given.</li>
            <li>lotion is nice and light on the skin, not heavy and greasy like some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Love that it exfoliates as well because when you have a lot of dry skin, lotion alone isn&#x27;t going to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Luckily there are plenty of web-sites online where you can check the expiration of cosmetic products according to their batch code, and I was surprised to see that my cream delivered today was produced on August 8, 2010 and expired a month ago...</li>
            <li>I would even say my skin was even more dry after using this product than it was before.</li>
            <li>in it buffered to a certain acid level.  </li>
            <li>that lactic acid is important thing on the skin in order to maintain its slightly acidic healthy nature and that it is a proven natural exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>Does smooth skin out and helps with red bumps on skin.  </li>
            <li>For under $4, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much out of this body lotion, but ordered it based on the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for my KP</li>
            <li>It makes my skin softer and is non greasy and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>it is non greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but bought it on the basis of another review.</li>
            <li>while it may also have to do with warmer summer temperatures (the more humid conditions means less drying and itching for my skin), i think that this stuff is doing its job pretty well.</li>
            <li>Smells very fruity (albeit a little artificially sweet), applies smoothly, does its job and hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other St. Ives products before (who doesn&#x27;t love their apricot scrub?)</li>
            <li>It seems to work almost as well as the much more expensive Amlactin, but because it is cheaper I do a much better job of slathering it on generously.</li>
            <li>The cheek areas especially had a nice pinky glow after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>I have keratosis pilaris and heavy scarring from dermatillomania, and it really helped smooth out bumps and reduced the appearance of old scars!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely thinner than many other lotions of its sort that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to fine out.  </li>
            <li>However with the lower price I could use if more frequently and is not any more expensive than a regular body lotion.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong, but other than that it&#x27;s just as expected.</li>
            <li>Yes, it soaks up quickly and is definitely non greasy, but those are the only two benefits I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It mildly softened my skin, but then again so do other moisturizers</li>
            <li>As a result, the chicken skin is greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>(I am 36).lt when I was in my early 20&#x27;s/late teens.  </li>
            <li>did not like the smell - smells a bit old</li>
            <li>I put it on directly after my shower.</li>
            <li>The St. Ives lotion is too thin, doesn&#x27;t really hydrate my skin , it was okay</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin naturally, and I&#x27;m 20 years old</li>
            <li>I generally buy St. Ives because I am vegan and they claim to not use animal ingredients.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a good price and the smell isn&#x27;t so bad, I also gave it to a friend of mine who hates lotion because she says lotions that she had used in the past made her skin felt heavy, but she loved this one,</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to buying this lotion regularly as an alternative to the more expensive AHA lotions like Amlactin.</li>
            <li>(I was hoping it would be a little less noticeable) and tends to stick around for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>do not like the smell as it seems kind of perfume-y to me, but when fighting a problem as ridiculously persistent as KP, I&#x27;m really not going to look a gift horse in the mouth!</li>
            <li>Sadly the scent is very strong</li>
            <li>I usually use Jergens lotion , which is thick and keeps my skin hydrated for a long time; St. Ives is not as good compared to Jergens , not in my opinion.</li>

            <li> Yes, it soaks up quickly and is definitely non greasy, but those are the only two benefits I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It mildly softened my skin, but then again so do other moisturizers</li>
            <li> As a result, the chicken skin is greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> (I am 36).lt when I was in my early 20&#x27;s/late teens.  </li>
            <li> did not like the smell - smells a bit old</li>
            <li> I put it on directly after my shower.</li>
            <li> The St. Ives lotion is too thin, doesn&#x27;t really hydrate my skin , it was okay</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin naturally, and I&#x27;m 20 years old</li>
            <li> I generally buy St. Ives because I am vegan and they claim to not use animal ingredients.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a good price and the smell isn&#x27;t so bad, I also gave it to a friend of mine who hates lotion because she says lotions that she had used in the past made her skin felt heavy, but she loved this one,</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to buying this lotion regularly as an alternative to the more expensive AHA lotions like Amlactin.</li>
            <li> (I was hoping it would be a little less noticeable) and tends to stick around for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> do not like the smell as it seems kind of perfume-y to me, but when fighting a problem as ridiculously persistent as KP, I&#x27;m really not going to look a gift horse in the mouth!</li>
            <li> Sadly the scent is very strong</li>
            <li> I usually use Jergens lotion , which is thick and keeps my skin hydrated for a long time; St. Ives is not as good compared to Jergens , not in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it nearly enough to see results because I really cannot get past the weird smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion in particular smelled a little funny/pungent when I used it</li>
            <li> furtunately the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The AHA causes your skin to replenish itself much more rapidly, so you&#x27;re a lot more susceptible to sunburn and sun damage (which means dark spots, pre-mature aging, and all sorts of terrible things).</li>
            <li> St Ives do not have an expiration date indicated on their products, but there is a long batch code that no one understands.</li>
            <li> It softens and restores my dry, cracked, sore hands.  </li>
            <li> At least this product has ingredients that are proven, smells decent, and you can use every day, and it does what it says.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It left my skin slightly sticky, and afterwards when I would wash it would come off my skin like a film or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This just goes to show you have to read the ingredients carefully even if the bottle states they do not use animal ingredients.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch or a really old bottle but the one I received smelled very plastic-y and just had a strange lingering scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is decent in the bottle... a little bit fruity but mostly a medicated scent (not very pretty at all) but combined with my skin&#x27;s chemistry this stuff was downright rank!</li>
            <li> : Just read the other review that claimed that their bottle was expired!</li>
            <li> A very similar product by Jergens was reformulated about 5 years ago (to something with weird blue beads in it)</li>
            <li> I got this bottle for a little over a dollar plus the shipping had made it less then five.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible though luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little scared off by the AHA products now, with the increased sun sensitivity warnings and everything.</li>
            <li> you might not enjoy this</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a heavy cream/oily lotion/greasy lotion you don&#x27;t want this.  </li>
            <li> The other St.Ives lotion i have used in the past was thick</li>
            <li> I do worry they will discontinue this lotion as I have been searching literally for at least 6 months for a product that is slightly acidic and that has lactic acid in it.  </li>
            <li> Well, the small faded a little bit after 20 minutes, but so did the softness of my skin!</li>
            <li> I am thinking of trying the stronger products (I have used the 12%Alpha Hydrox on my face before) but am not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed and wished I didn&#x27;t buy it in the first place.</li>
            <li> the thick ones usually are too greasy and leave my legs feelings sticky and gross all day, and disturb my sleep (i sleep without pajama pants, and i hate the feeling of my inner legs sticking together).</li>
            <li> This stuff is much less expensive (less than $5 for 21 ounces vs $10 to $20 for 8 ounces of 10% lotions.)</li>
            <li> I had been using various AHA lotions once a week to help with \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; issue.</li>
            <li> but this lotion was thin and felt weird on my skin</li>
            <li> the smell is weird to me.</li>
            <li> but mine smelt really weird.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris (otherwise known as \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot;) all over my thighs, buttocks, and arms.</li>
            <li> but, boy is it expensive!</li>
            <li> Cannot bear it :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good at all.  I threw it away!</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion for frequent use. It is not the best lotion out there. It is the one I keep by the sink for after my frequent hand washing and dish rinsing (during which my hands get wet).</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing yet it&#x27;s still definitely fast-absorbing. Love that it exfoliates as well because when you have a lot of dry skin, lotion alone isn&#x27;t going to get the job done. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Came on time, no damages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price. Plan to getting some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;saves me a trip to CVS.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Started using it after they discontinued the Whipped Silk.  However, most stores don&#x27;t carry this one for some reason.  Very happy it&#x27;s on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing to receive an expired product. St Ives do not have an expiration date indicated on their products, but there is a long batch code that no one understands. Luckily there are plenty of web-sites online where you can check the expiration of cosmetic products according to their batch code, and I was surprised to see that my cream delivered today was produced on August 8, 2010 and expired a month ago...Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> It does smell funny, but not too strong, so I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after bath, good body lotion, but not enough for elbows and heels, I have to put something thicker to those area.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Does smooth skin out and helps with red bumps on skin.  Smells horrible though luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> For under $4, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much out of this body lotion, but ordered it based on the reviews I read. Yes, it soaks up quickly and is definitely non greasy, but those are the only two benefits I&#x27;ve found. The aspects I didn&#x27;t like are 1) the scent and 2) the way my skin felt 20 minutes after applying this lotion. The scent is decent in the bottle... a little bit fruity but mostly a medicated scent (not very pretty at all) but combined with my skin&#x27;s chemistry this stuff was downright rank! I considered showering immediately to get the smell off of me, but decided to see if it would fade instead because I wanted to see how well it moisturized. Well, the small faded a little bit after 20 minutes, but so did the softness of my skin! I would even say my skin was even more dry after using this product than it was before. I have normal to dry skin naturally, and I&#x27;m 20 years old so I can&#x27;t speak as to the \\&quot;age defying benefits\\&quot; but I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath on that one. I&#x27;ve used other St. Ives products before (who doesn&#x27;t love their apricot scrub?) but I won&#x27;t be buying any more lotion out of this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Just read the other review that claimed that their bottle was expired! I will have to check mine now too an see if that&#x27;s the problem here.</li>
            <li> its a citrus sent. the density isn&#x27;t watery and it works just fine. if you do not like citrus smells you might not enjoy this</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion because it said it has AHA&#x27;s.  I did not see what percentage of AHA it has anywhere on the bottle, but it does have lactic acid in it which is supposed to be wonderful for your skin and mild.  I have bought tons of lotions and things before.  The thing about this lotion is it is not very expensive, it has a pleasant smell which dissipated within an hour, and it is fast absorbing and light and truly does make your skin feel smoother.  If you are looking for a heavy cream/oily lotion/greasy lotion you don&#x27;t want this.  This is more lighter, and it helps my chest and back acne and bumps on my arms.  It is not as strong as the AlphyGlycolic and Alpha Hydrox creams in my opinion.  But at the end of day if I use this every day, my skin has a firmer smooth feel to it.  It is very pleasant to use.  I am thinking of trying the stronger products (I have used the 12%Alpha Hydrox on my face before) but am not sure yet.  I have read before that lactic acid is important thing on the skin in order to maintain its slightly acidic healthy nature and that it is a proven natural exfoliant.  At least this product has ingredients that are proven, smells decent, and you can use every day, and it does what it says.  I do worry they will discontinue this lotion as I have been searching literally for at least 6 months for a product that is slightly acidic and that has lactic acid in it.  There is another lotion that is slightly acidic out on the market for the body that has excellent reviews..I can&#x27;t remember what it is called but something about ammonium (Amlactin I think) in it buffered to a certain acid level.  It also doesn&#x27;t smell good at all and I didn&#x27;t like that about it so I added lavender and orange extract to it and at the time I was pregnant and the smell was too much for me even then (I would throw up at anything then), and it left my skin sticky.  So this lotion does not leave you sticky, it smells good, and it smooths skin, reminds me of the way my skin felt when I was in my early 20&#x27;s/late teens.  (I am 36).lt when I was in my early 20&#x27;s/late teens.  (I am 36).</li>
            <li> Smells very fruity (albeit a little artificially sweet), applies smoothly, does its job and hydrates your skin. The bottle is huge and will last a long time. I purchased this because it was so cheap. I</li>
            <li> It works the best of any lotion I have used!  It absorbs well so it&#x27;s not greasy.  It softens and restores my dry, cracked, sore hands.  Love it!  And it smells good too.</li>
            <li> This stuff made have worked fine but I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to fine out.  Some reviewers thought it smelled great.  I thought it was more like chemical smell covered up with perfumey smell.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite lotion - feels light &amp; fresh, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy or like a heavy residue is on skin.</li>
            <li> Light and nongreasy with a pleasant fruity scent.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer for your skin, It&#x27;s a good price and the smell isn&#x27;t so bad, I also gave it to a friend of mine who hates lotion because she says lotions that she had used in the past made her skin felt heavy, but she loved this one, it was light and it does moisturize and smell ok.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion, but I do not like how it feels against my skin and the blackheads that produce afterwards.  I guess its the cell renewal process doing so.  I will stick to Eucerin&#x27;s Glyco-Glycerol lotion.  It does the same, but without the adverse effect.</li>
            <li> The best feature of this lotion is the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rate it&#x27;s moisturizing ability as 3/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin slightly sticky, and afterwards when I would wash it would come off my skin like a film or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It mildly softened my skin, but then again so do other moisturizers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but can&#x27;t beat the Emlactin stuff my dermatologist told me to get instead. I thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> did not like the smell - smells a bit old</li>
            <li> It seems to be the only lotion fragrance that my husband likes!  My only wish is that it were thicker.</li>
            <li> The first lotion I don&#x27;t mind using because it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. Nice price for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> While it being better than nothing it&#x27;s actually kind of aggravating.  It literally dries up your skin after a period of time so you have to re-apply that.. or it&#x27;s just super inefficient.  I would spend the extra money to get amlactin honestly.</li>
            <li> The smell if awful. Cannot bear it :(</li>
            <li> The bottle looks like it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for a year...I hope the product is still OK, seems fine...</li>
            <li> very nice smell, not like others I&#x27;ve tried that smelled medicinal, would buy again. the price is great also</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a St. Ives lotion, I used the apricot scrubs and loved them and thought of course this lotion would be just as good, I was wrong. I usually use Jergens lotion , which is thick and keeps my skin hydrated for a long time; St. Ives is not as good compared to Jergens , not in my opinion. So this will be the last time I try a St. Ives lotion, I&#x27;ll stick with Jergens. The St. Ives lotion is too thin, doesn&#x27;t really hydrate my skin , it was okay but I was disappointed and wished I didn&#x27;t buy it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to buying this lotion regularly as an alternative to the more expensive AHA lotions like Amlactin. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it nearly enough to see results because I really cannot get past the weird smell. Maybe I got a bad batch or a really old bottle but the one I received smelled very plastic-y and just had a strange lingering scent. Would not buy again, and probably going to end up throw out the rest of the bottle I purchased...</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice (light fruity smell) but doesn&#x27;t linger too long, and is not greasy. It&#x27;s a good summer lotion but is probably not heavy enough for winter. Best of all it contains lactic acid at the correct pH. I pH tested it - 3.5, which is the pH needed for the lactic acid to be effective.</li>
            <li> I generally buy St. Ives because I am vegan and they claim to not use animal ingredients. This product contains lactic acid which is derived from milk. This just goes to show you have to read the ingredients carefully even if the bottle states they do not use animal ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had been using various AHA lotions once a week to help with \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; issue. This stuff is much less expensive (less than $5 for 21 ounces vs $10 to $20 for 8 ounces of 10% lotions.) It does not give the percent of AHA but if I were to guess it would be around 3-5% based on my experience with the standard 10% AHA lotion. It is not as effective as the 10% stuff and does not have the strong odor characteristic of the 10% lotion. The smell is weaker and disguised with a citrusy odor. However with the lower price I could use if more frequently and is not any more expensive than a regular body lotion.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle for a little over a dollar plus the shipping had made it less then five. It is non greasy and works well as a moisturizer and good for sensitive skin especially good for those who live in hot and humid climates like me.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty strong, but other than that it&#x27;s just as expected. Probably would not get again, but I am more sensitive to smells than most people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little scared off by the AHA products now, with the increased sun sensitivity warnings and everything. This lotion in particular smelled a little funny/pungent when I used it and it&#x27;s definitely thinner than many other lotions of its sort that I&#x27;ve used. Didn&#x27;t really do much for my KP but I did notice my skin softening.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris (otherwise known as \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot;) all over my thighs, buttocks, and arms. That&#x27;s about 1/3 of my body! I have used Amlactin (12% alpha hydroxy acid) which does indeed help with the KP but, boy is it expensive! Then I tried this lotion. It seems to work almost as well as the much more expensive Amlactin, but because it is cheaper I do a much better job of slathering it on generously. As a result, the chicken skin is greatly reduced. Not cured, mind you, but then the Amlactin wasn&#x27;t a cure either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the smell as it seems kind of perfume-y to me, but when fighting a problem as ridiculously persistent as KP, I&#x27;m really not going to look a gift horse in the mouth! It absorbs nicely into the skin, and does not feel greasy to me. I put it on directly after my shower. The pump bottle is convenient to use too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both lactic acid and fruit acids are listed on the label, although the exact percentages are not given. No parabens or phthalates.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion on my arms and legs mostly. It makes my skin softer and is non greasy and fast absorbing. But the smell keeps me from using it daily, like a mix of fruity and chemically smell that lessen after 15 min. Good price, ok product, but the smell is weird to me.</li>
            <li> great cream, really moisturises</li>
            <li> I love St Ives lotions, and the fact the this one had AHA for cellular renewal and increased turnover rate makes it all the better. it is non greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but bought it on the basis of another review. Right away my skin seemed brighter and mildly exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice and not overpowering. The cheek areas especially had a nice pinky glow after just a few uses. Awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> It greatly improved the quality of my skin! I have keratosis pilaris and heavy scarring from dermatillomania, and it really helped smooth out bumps and reduced the appearance of old scars!</li>
            <li> I like it, but I hate the fragrance.  furtunately the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> i have mild dermatitis and eczema, and have tried many different lotions. the thick ones usually are too greasy and leave my legs feelings sticky and gross all day, and disturb my sleep (i sleep without pajama pants, and i hate the feeling of my inner legs sticking together). this lotion is lighter and absorbs relatively quickly, and leaves my legs feeling much more moisturized. while it may also have to do with warmer summer temperatures (the more humid conditions means less drying and itching for my skin), i think that this stuff is doing its job pretty well. and you can&#x27;t beat the price! st. ives always impresses me with the quality of their products.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe keratosis pilaris all over my body, so I&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing to help improve my condition a bit.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is nice and light on the skin, not heavy and greasy like some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  Sadly the scent is very strong (I was hoping it would be a little less noticeable) and tends to stick around for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot yet comment on its smoothing ability since I haven&#x27;t used it for very long, but its moisturizing ability seems to be very good.</li>
            <li> Every body said this lotion smelt good but mine smelt really weird. The other St.Ives lotion i have used in the past was thick which i like but this lotion was thin and felt weird on my skin I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! My chest acne has been greatly reduced, as has the bumps on my upper arms, in a matter of 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However!! Very important!!! WEAR SUNSCREEN IF YOU ARE REGULARLY PUTTING THIS ON. The AHA causes your skin to replenish itself much more rapidly, so you&#x27;re a lot more susceptible to sunburn and sun damage (which means dark spots, pre-mature aging, and all sorts of terrible things).</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this lotion - it smells wonderful, dries quickly, goes on smoothly, and is safe for sensitive skin!  Can&#x27;t ask for more!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that St. Ives has started making this product.  A very similar product by Jergens was reformulated about 5 years ago (to something with weird blue beads in it) and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a lotion with AHA like this ever since.  The Naturally Smooth lotion smells nice, goes on smooth and keeps skin soft and smooth.  The AHA makes all the difference in the quality of the lotion.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue or reformulate.</li>
