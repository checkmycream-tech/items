            <li> The wife looked gorgeous with it !</li>
            <li> I love this color. I had been looking for this color for several months. Actually I went to MAC because this was the color I wanted to wear for my wedding, they didn&#x27;t have it. Well I guess better late than never.</li>
            <li> 1; the lipstick is overpriced. 2; This isnt the real shade of Ruby woo.&lt;br /&gt;#Dont Buy</li>
            <li> FAKE LIPSTICK!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the color</li>
            <li> Long lasting . Just what I want</li>
            <li> This product is FAKE!!! I have never regretted purchasing something like I do with this product. It&#x27;s not a true Ruby Woo color. Also the lipstick is so thin that it slipped out of the lipstick bottle!! I will NEVER EVER purchase this product again...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would call the product fake but it isn&#x27;t was I believed I was ordering. The lipstick I received was more of an orangey color than the kind of plum color pictured. But I still liked it. It hasn&#x27;t fallen out on me as others mentioned. And it stayed on all day (which is crazy considering I bus tables all day and sweat a lot). I would be apprehensive purchasing from this seller though.</li>
            <li> Love it. Stays all day and is very soft too.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this color; it&#x27;s very, very hard to find and it stays on all day pretty much until you wipe it off.....It came just in time for the holidays..</li>
            <li> Pretty scarlet red color. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it, sad to say I only use it once ..an someone stole it out my van...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color super sexy and every time I wear it I always get compliments:) I usually don&#x27;t like spending too much on one make up item but to me this is totally worth it;)</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick. Is sooo hot. I really like it and so does my husband ;)</li>
            <li> I love the color and does not dry my lips, I recommend it</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! The perfect matte red ever!!!</li>
            <li> Not packaged as advertised.</li>
            <li> this product is a bit runny which is not consistent with genuine MAC</li>
            <li> Love this color it fits all skin types!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted.  Is it possible to return?</li>
