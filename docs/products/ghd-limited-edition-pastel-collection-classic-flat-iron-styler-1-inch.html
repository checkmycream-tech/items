            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get a $50 model like the HSI, instead of this for 140-190, but for those willing to pay this price, it works wonderfully</li>
            <li>i love this product!</li>
            <li>(e.g. I took it to Australia) and the beep to let you know that it&#x27;s hot is awesome.</li>

            <li>Best part of this product is that it heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>Decided to get her one of her own for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift and the reciever was thrilled with the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really it is the best in the market.</li>
            <li>So guess what, I had to return it and purchase a REAL ghd that works wonderful from my salon.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and works great!</li>
            <li>so it would make a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get perfect hairstyles with very proffessional finishing touchs.</li>
            <li>Nice lil &amp;#34;hello&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Nice quality</li>
            <li>It does heat up within seconds which is really nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use it!!</li>
            <li>and i thought the cheaper price was too good to be true, but i was able to do some research and was delighted to discover that the GHD i was sent was a genuine product, it works great.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and works great at straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I Love the GHD&#x27;s and they are not wrong - I always have Good Hair Day&#x27;s!!!:)</li>
            <li>great for the price... totally worth getting.</li>
            <li>far, so great!</li>
            <li>But as far as the function of the iron goes, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>It offers a all-day straightening power and works wonderfully when I use it to curl the ends of my hair</li>
            <li>:) It is absolutely amazing and I am defintiely buying another.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended the Ghd and it is amazing and so much better.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best straighteners for my wild hair.  </li>
            <li>Glides through the hair smoothly with a good feel.</li>
            <li>Perfect, durable, gets super hot in seconds!</li>
            <li>It heats up quick and works great though, and I love that I can curl or straighten, and it has an auto shut off in case</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it and worth every cent!!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine curly hair that requires washing or wetting every day to get the curls out.</li>
            <li>It straightens so easily and doesn&#x27;t snag at all like the CHI does!</li>
            <li>Even though I have beyond shoulder length hair, it is very fine in texture.  </li>
            <li>Since everyone raves over how much better ghd is than Chi I decided to get this miraculous straightener and truly have the \\&quot;best of the best\\&quot; for my busy work trips.</li>
            <li>have had many hair straighteners in my time, this one is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>Bought these at a very reasonable price and they are great.</li>
            <li>Always ask questions before buying and remember, if it looks too good to be true</li>
            <li>Always ask questions before buying and remember, if it looks too good to be true</li>
            <li>Everything was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>too good to be true</li>
            <li>I have now found an excellent straightener that straightens, smooths, and does not dry out my hair, and lasts without putting product in my hair.</li>
            <li>inadvertently.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy-to-use, built-to-last, and built safe, this heats up quickly and does a good job.</li>
            <li>The timer is great, it shuts itself off if it is not being used for a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li>how many holes on the cord because both of my stylers have 2 holes.</li>
            <li>Heats up so fast and does a great job straightening my hair-</li>
            <li>I am not the most coordinated person and even I can use this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this styler.  </li>
            <li>I ask my hairdresser if my hair appears healthy every time I get a cut.</li>
            <li>so make sure to look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have wavy hair and this tool does a great job of making it absolutely straight.</li>
            <li>This one works much better, faster  &amp; gets my hair nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Buy it you will love it ... and then start receiving amazing compliments about your gorgeous straight hair</li>
            <li>I have lots of friends with GHDs who love them, so</li>
            <li>It works okay</li>
            <li>- - - it gets the job done, but it takes a lot more time and effort.  </li>
            <li>I have had this straightener for months now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to buy one also.</li>
            <li>im glad she did.</li>
            <li>I totally love my GHD.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Mine was purchased from Amazon and registered as authentic at the ghd website.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast, and has the great option to use for curls/waves.  </li>
            <li>Mine was verified by GHD as authentic when I registered it.</li>
            <li>I was worried with some of the reviews that it wouldn&#x27;t be a ghd product, but before I even used it I made sure I could register it...</li>
            <li>and I was able to.</li>
            <li>It was so much better than the cheap-o Conair I had been using that I immediately ordered one for</li>
            <li>The box does say it was manufactured in P.R.C., but I was able to register my straightener on the ghd website using the codes on the straightener&#x27;s hologram and label.  </li>
            <li>Okay so to begin</li>
            <li>I wanted a GHD being the top of the line hair straightener in competition with the sudo</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many brands over the years</li>
            <li>Some reviewers claim is not an authentic styler if it&#x27;s not \\&quot;Made in Korea\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I was able to register it on the ghd website.  </li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>I expect it to work better for that price.</li>
            <li>I was able to register the GHD on the website (hologram and date code are on the arm, not the tag).</li>
            <li>My hair always looks healthy</li>
            <li>but I ordered the &amp;#34;sold by Amazon&amp;#34; one and I was able to register it at GHD&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>Love that they can be used when travelling abroad with dual voltage.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 99% sure this is NOT an authorized re-sale from GHD.</li>
            <li>Even though this says it is a GHD, it sure doesn&#x27;t work like one.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but nonetheless i love this piece of a styler</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It made my hair silky. : )</li>
            <li>Mine just arrived and I was able to register it on the GHD website.  </li>
            <li>The auto off feature really makes me a happy camper too.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>it totally works its awesome</li>
            <li>thank you :)</li>
            <li>Love love love this styler.</li>
            <li>Never before had so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love the product but felt for the price it should have worked for longer that 1 year.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair look silky and stylish  </li>
            <li>I do not believe it&#x27;s authentic.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to register the warranty for the product with GHD (pamphlet in box).</li>
            <li>She has been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>for many years.</li>
            <li>and I love the ceramic plates on it.</li>
            <li>Awesome straightener, very efficient and fast to warm up.</li>
            <li>Before ordering this item, I read the reviews and saw that many folks who purchased through the third-party option ended up with counterfeit versions.</li>
            <li>for the product itself, it does not get any better.</li>
            <li>But, this GHD is even more outstanding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I almost think that it would be better to shut off after 15 minutes inactive.</li>
            <li>there are better straighteners out there.</li>
            <li>It worked much better than my Chi</li>
            <li>do think this works better than the Chi, but not so much better as to warrant the price for this</li>
            <li>i love this straighter, its the Mercedes of all straighteners.  </li>
            <li>Really good purchase and well worth it.</li>
            <li>I actually love having the piece of mind knowing that it shuts off after 30 mins.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the straightener very often but it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE you select the one that&#x27;s shipped from AND sold by Amazon -</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to register mine with GHD&#x27;s website, and everything looks/</li>
            <li>I like this straightener, but I definitely don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I was given this free for an honest review.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size for my hair as it is short and medium in thickness.</li>
            <li>and it rolls on my counter top.</li>
            <li>She Googled the issue and learned that there are many counterfeit versions of this product.  </li>
            <li>I was able to register my GHD on the website and it comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>I was able to register my straightener online at GHD...</li>
            <li>but I received my product and was able to register it on GHD website and that it is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy with GHD but felt I should have been advised that the powerpoint connection would be for a US powerpoint and not Australian.</li>
            <li>Love this straightener.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and shinney!</li>
            <li>Be sure to register with manufacturer to ensure authenticity.</li>
            <li>I ordered one again from the Official GHD website and was able to register.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>What do you want more?</li>
            <li>I was able to register mine with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE GHD -</li>
            <li>this is simple to use and best purchase/investment ever!!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair straightener ever.  </li>

            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Original Ghd Stylers, registered them on the official website to make sure they were Ghd!</li>
            <li>As a sidenote - It was an authentic GHD - I was able to verify &amp; register it with GHD with no problems.</li>
            <li>Its authentic.</li>
            <li>my favorite feature is the no tangle swivel cord</li>
            <li>WILL JUST PURCHASE FROM GHD TO GUARANTEE I GET AN AUTHENTIC STRAIGHTENER PERIOD.</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT FAKE!!!!  </li>
            <li>just as described, love it</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>Works well- checked the serial number on GHD&#x27;s website and was authentic.</li>
            <li>This was an okay flatiron.  </li>
            <li>Its just smoother and easier, and the price is so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>This narrower styler worked better for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a knock off iron - not an authentic GHD iron.  </li>
            <li>It takes at most two passes to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I truely LOVE them...</li>
            <li>weather permitting...! : )&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is not an authentic styler and is a knock off.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be authentic.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t checked to see if its registered and original, but it is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I think I like the Chi more...</li>
            <li>I received an authentic straightener.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received it, I went on line and was able to register it with GHD  with no problems.</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>Also, I did buy this iron from Amazon itself and was able to register it without any problems.</li>
            <li>the shipping was quick and painless I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron that I have owned.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality flat iron.</li>
            <li>but now that I own it, it is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Best flat iron ever.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Literally the best flat iron I have used to date.</li>
            <li>either way it is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I knew then that I had to look for that perfect flat iron that I&#x27;ve been used to.</li>
            <li>Awesome flat iron!</li>
            <li>Best flat iron ever!</li>
            <li>Best Flat Iron I have ever owned and there have been a lot!  </li>
            <li>I did the research and was looking for a great deal on a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Yes, my Chi is over 3 years old and still works as beautifully as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>READ THIS:  Many people have written reviews that they love this product, and it might very well be a good styler.  </li>
            <li>She has been trying to convince me to buy one for a long time, claiming it was the best straightener on the market, but I hesitated because of the price.  </li>
            <li>Smooth easy to use!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be deceived by the price, they are definitely original!</li>
            <li>It curls easily as well (but I mostly just used it for straightening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I got that I was able to look through the models available on Amazon and buy one that is authentic.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working great so far!</li>
            <li>which a) means more damage to hair--especially if it&#x27;s fine, and</li>
            <li>Great price for a fabulous new flatiron!</li>
            <li>The ghd Classic 1-inch styler heats up fast and maintains the perfect temperature while styling my hair.</li>
            <li>It is a very good one , but what i didnt like that it doesn&#x27;t have any bag to put in , and it is only one heat degree !</li>
            <li>they are amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>they are amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So if you thought this was too cheap to be an authentic product, don&#x27;t worry.  </li>
            <li>So far it is still working great for me.</li>
            <li>I emailed GHD directly asking if I successfully registered the product on the site that the product was guaranteed to be authentic.</li>
            <li>It would heat up really fast and did a good job for both straightening and curling.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>it got fried when I went to Paris due to Voltage so the converter on this one is great!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and would not trade it for any other straightener.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had many high end straighteners, very many.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair which straightens easily but will often gain wave as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>Very quick to heat up</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>Registration was easy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my Babylis, but it still works amazingly.</li>
            <li>However, I bought directly from amazon/ghdprofessional, and I can register mine successfully.</li>
            <li>Heats up almost instantly, works beautifully.</li>
            <li>However, my hair was warm and perfectly straight, so it did the trick!</li>
            <li>Nice and hot.</li>
            <li>This straightener is pretty nice....</li>
            <li>Great deal on an authentic ghd flat iron as this costs $180 at the salon!</li>
            <li>and it still works good as new.</li>
            <li>Mine is till working perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>It went through fine.</li>
            <li>It does a great job and does not dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>I think it works fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It works fine but the packaging was all ripped and messed up.</li>
            <li>I have had many, many, many straighteners, from cheap $30 ones, to pricey $100 ones and this ghd is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Works great- gets hot fast</li>
            <li>There is only one heat setting, hot, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The registration worked fine although the registration numbers were not on the cord as GHD site suggests.</li>
            <li>I just got done registering it on GHD&#x27;s website and everything went through just fine.</li>
            <li>Not only does it heat up SUPER quick, but it gives me a perfect do in no time!  </li>
            <li>GHD is huge in Australia, the creme dela creme of hair straighteners.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price by far and the quality and durablility is great.</li>
            <li>Mine registered as genuine on the official website, however, the box says \\&quot;made in China\\&quot;and</li>
            <li>The cheap ones I had to go over and over my hair.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, as I found, GHD has a verification tool on their site.</li>
            <li>Does a fabulous job straightening my hair...</li>
            <li>but they were absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I found that the Ghd sold on Amazon had such a great price I just had to get it.</li>
            <li>It made my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous</li>
            <li>i try diffetent power adaptors, just not power adaptor will fit, what can i do?</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as cheap</li>
            <li>Using it in Australia, so dual voltage was important.</li>
            <li>After a couple CHI&#x27;s this was confirmed case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to GHD and am just as happy as before -</li>
            <li>(kept sliding out when I got towards the bottom of the strand), and didn&#x27;t give a smooth, glossy effect I wanted.  </li>
            <li>its that cheap</li>
            <li>It also has a flashing LED light.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It runs through smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Used it this morning, and it works fabulously.  </li>
            <li>I registered it on the GHD website and the registration was confirmed.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon price is fantastic and I successfully registered it on the GHD website, so it must be the real thing (not a fake).</li>
            <li>I was also impressed that it stayed completely straight after spending time outside in 90% humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, this one in particular looks very nice not that it matters for functionality, but it is a pretty iron.</li>
            <li>Bought these after hearing so much about GHD and I am glad I did, best straighteners I have ever used, I bought them of Amazon as I was unsure from reading other reviews that they couldn&#x27;t register there product, I had no problem registering with GHD.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my daughter in law for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li>so very useful for traveling (</li>
            <li>After entering the 2 required codes (located on the hologram tag attached to the product), I was happy to discover that it IS a genuine ghd flat iron!</li>
            <li>Heats up within seconds, great and easy use, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair.</li>
            <li>Read great reviews on this flat iron and it was on a sale.</li>
            <li>Really a great flat iron that works well.  </li>
            <li>Great Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>I especially love the 30 minute, automatic shut-off feature, a must for forgetful people like me ;)</li>
            <li>so easy and quick to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;the plates are rounded, making it super easy to curl even for a novice like me</li>
            <li>its so easy and quick to use  </li>
            <li>the plates are rounded, making it super easy to curl even for a novice like me  </li>
            <li>* Super-long cord means you&#x27;re not tethered to the outlet (super useful when the mirror isn&#x27;t ideally placed relative to the outlet!)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The iron heats up really quickly and easy to use.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d read some reviews in several places saying that their quality had dropped off, and I still remembered how wonderful the GHD I&#x27;d tried had been (and that was when my CHI was still in its prime!), so in looking to replace my straightener, I really wanted to see if I could find an authentic GHD at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>gets very hot, very quickly and does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>loving it so far !!</li>
            <li>Very nice and does not burn my hair like prev flat iron</li>
            <li>Both are quality products, but the Sedu edged out the GHD and if it lasts as long as my first one, I&#x27;m happy to pay a bit more for it than the cheaper straighteners for what I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li>Both are quality products, but the Sedu edged out the GHD and if it lasts as long as my first one, I&#x27;m happy to pay a bit more for it than the cheaper straighteners for what I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li>Take the time to register your iron there to make sure it&#x27;s not a fake [...]</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is just because the photo is older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Appears to be authentic but it is extremely hot and smells like burnt rubber</li>
            <li>Recommended by my hairstylists and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased my GHD styler 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Also the styler is NOT a fake and I was able to register it on GHD&#x27;s website with no problem.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>By entering the halogram sticker unique code and date code of your product, you will be emailed to let you know if your product is genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and hopefully you love the results as much as I do!</li>
            <li>It does a much better job than my Chi ever did and my hair stays straight for longer!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this straightener for my birthday.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this was a counterfeit or faulty product.</li>
            <li>Worth the price for something you use on your hair every day!</li>
            <li>I checked the product the minute I got it and went online and found out I got the original..</li>
            <li>It is still working great, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I love that this one shuts off, maybe a little too soon, but still not complaining, it&#x27;s a great feature and</li>
            <li>love, love, love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>super smooth</li>
            <li>super smooth</li>
            <li>It also stays clean.</li>
            <li>Apparently the styler worked great for the first couple weeks and not no longer worked.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and has LED light indicator, easy to see.  </li>
            <li>And so far, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>They honestly are amazing, and I think they will just be so huge in a year or two unless the other brands pick up their act!</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and then glides evenly and smoothly for perfectly straight smooth hair.</li>
            <li>By far, this is the best flat iron I have owned.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this flat iron, but it is really amazing.</li>
            <li>price is also special in Amazon,,&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>and it straightens it right out!</li>
            <li>But my favorite straightener by fair is my gold n hot ceramic flat iron that I got for like 30 bucks.</li>
            <li>but given the price - I expected this to work great.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t received both and tried them at the same time, I would probably be pretty happy with this flatiron.  </li>
            <li>I have since bought the same exact time from a Sephora and it works great.</li>
            <li>(It also came in a really cool box.)</li>
            <li>My hair would also be wavy later in the day because it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job I guess.</li>
            <li>SURE IF IT IS REAL</li>
            <li>love it heat up fast and</li>
            <li>I have had my Australian GHD for almost 5 years now and it works as good as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>GHD have a authentication tool on their website to make sure you got a real legit straightener.</li>
            <li>However, this straightener was not as good (although the same model that my friend purchased 2+ years ago).  </li>
            <li>I bought this as s gift for my wife, who recently tried a family member&#x27;s GHD straightener and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to LOVE it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved my last ghd straightener!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much it was a pleasure dealing with you :)</li>
            <li>, however the real one is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Fair enough with price I got for this item.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and love the auto turn off</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and these are wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also dual voltage, which is fantastic when I travel (you just need to provide a plug adapter for the outlet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I had it registered on the official site of GHD and its the real deal :)</li>
            <li>I love how it heats up and beeps as soon as its ready in 30 seconds or so.</li>
            <li>I had the HSI Professional which i thought was pretty good</li>
            <li>Anyway it&#x27;s great hits up quickly and leaves my hair straight and smooth with only a couple passes.</li>
            <li>that right there kind of made the final decision for me. :)</li>
            <li>that right there kind of made the final decision for me. :)</li>
            <li>The first time I turned it on I was sure something wasn&#x27;t working quite right because it gave me the &amp;#34;all</li>
            <li>The other great feature of this styler is its automatic shut-off.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other flat irons for a lot more money and am really impressed with this one.  </li>
            <li>and my wife loves it and swears its better than her Remington one even though I can&#x27;t understand how much tech can be in a couple of hot plates!</li>
            <li>My GHDs finally broke after over 10 years so bought a new set, still as good as they always have been!</li>
            <li>I love this one, had one before, it broke, used another for about a year, glad to be back.</li>
            <li>I have wavy frizzy hair and it helps tremendously with the friz and it straightens so effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick.</li>
            <li>when ever I need a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>up super fast&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>and I only had 10-15 minutes or even 5 for a real quick top layer straightening as apposed to 40-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was able to plug it in, turn it on and within seconds it was HOT and ready to go!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and does the job.  </li>
            <li>straightener heats quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>and I was a loyal chi person.</li>
            <li>Classic 1-inch Styler / Straightener today and was able to register it on the ghd site with no problem.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick too.</li>
            <li>/styles my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>This styler heats quickly.</li>
            <li>This styler straightens hair adequately.</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats up QUICK.</li>
            <li>I received the classic styler by GHD today and it is 100% authentic.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how quick it heats up, plug it in and 10 seconds</li>
            <li>gets hot very quickly and it double beeps to tell you when it&#x27;s ready, which is very nice.  </li>
            <li>So I just wanted a cheaper but still good straightener for the year, or even one that I could take home and still use (I&#x27;ve read America to Aus is fine but not the other way).</li>
            <li>, I was so excited I used it right away.</li>
            <li>Authentic and really high up in the hair straightener choices.</li>
            <li>I was replacing this with my previous ghd which I got for full price and worked great for years..</li>
            <li>Very good styler and much cheaper than in the store.always difficult to find good quality(not</li>
            <li>The ghd Classic 1-inch styler is the bomb!!!  </li>
            <li>I was happy the moment i got this, its so smooth when you use it, was abit caught off guard by the different power cord but that was quickly fixed</li>
            <li>i hope its not a fake, probably is.. since its so cheap.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Flat iron does damage the hair so keeping it to a minimum is the best thing to do and don&#x27;t think that paying extra for temp.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for at a cheaper price!</li>
            <li>It really is an outstanding and superior product compared to the stuff sold at your corner pharmacy, or other large nearby retailer.</li>
            <li>This product came in brand new as if i had just bought it from the store myself, love it.</li>
            <li>Loves how fast it heats up and great on long hair</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and beeps when its ready for use.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it, the right size and high quality item.  </li>
            <li>This one stays hot!</li>
            <li>HOT immediately!</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend noticed the difference the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>but I took a chance anyway and its real!!</li>
            <li>It was real !!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is very curly/wavy.  </li>
            <li>This means means far more less damage by locking in your hairs own moisture and minimizing frizz, static electricity and flyaways.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive the REAL GHD classic styler, successfully registered it on the GHD website, and have loved it every single time I used</li>
            <li>They are not taken care of very well like a genuine GHD</li>
            <li>Gets my hair straight a lot faster than the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>Based on some of the reviews, I was concerned whether the product that would show up would be the real deal or a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>If you are really aching to get this please do not go with the Free Shipping (FedEx Smartpost), it took two days for Amazon to send out, and</li>
            <li>One pass of the iron and my locks are smooth, straight, and shiny.</li>
            <li>It may be pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>If it has the shiny sticker inside the clasps of the straightener it is most likely the real deal but to make sure you should sign up for again, its warranty.</li>
            <li>Worth the $</li>
            <li>so I left the seller a feedback message that was not too nice (which I do apologize for)</li>
            <li>My friend recommend this flat iron and I am so glad she did!</li>
            <li>This straightenr is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This one by far is the most well thought out, designed.  </li>
            <li>But, the investment is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>honestly believe that once you get a GHD you will never (happily) go back to another brand.</li>
            <li>I honestly believe that once you get a GHD you will never (happily) go back to another brand.</li>
            <li>The GHD 1 inch styler I recently purchased from the vendor Platinum Home Delivery (order fulfilled via Amazon) was far from what you consider a great item.</li>
            <li>The straightener I got is completely legit and I was able to register it on the ghd website with no</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am extremely pleased with this and it completely exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li>Foremost, rest assured that if you purchase this item directly through Amazon, it is guaranteed authentic.</li>
            <li>Read reviews on Amazon and made sure to purchase the iron direct from AMAZON.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every dollar</li>
            <li>I spend a good hour examining them, tried them out, and concluded they were definitely not the real thing.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, my 13-year old daughter will borrow my hair iron and I have to double-check to make sure she didn&#x27;t leave it on.  </li>
            <li>totally worth it</li>
            <li>but if you want something better, I would choose the professional or the eclipse version of it.</li>
            <li>Though I would recommend to buy it from your hair stylist as they get it from their local beauty supply store for a better prize, plus some of the stores offer free return and exchange for the warranty period of 2 years in store, taking away the hassle of calling customer service or waiting for the replacement to arrive.</li>
            <li>It put my flatiron to shame and was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>While I like it, it is not any better than my old Paul Mitchell one.</li>
            <li>MY CHEAP FLAT IRON WORKS BETTER THAN THIS.</li>
            <li>Product gets hot quick and turns off after about 30 minutes of no use.  </li>
            <li>it gets hot really quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long for me to get the hang of it, and soon I had loose waves and curls that looked and felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>It heats up super quick and is very east to use.  </li>
            <li>It smooths the hair far and easily and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>As long as it continues to work for at least a year or more I will be very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I could tell right away.  </li>
            <li>, i tried to cancel my order right away</li>
            <li>they will resolve the issue and the third-party vendor will lose the right to sell at Amazon.</li>
            <li>ghd Classic styler that I received is genuine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other flat irons and this one seems to work best for my wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has an on off switch and a LED light to indicate when it&#x27;s ready to use (which is about 30 seconds - it&#x27;s super fast).  </li>
            <li>For hair that doesn&#x27;t need too much heat this is perfect, but if you need that steam and pin straight hair you should opt for a more expensive GHD.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine blonde hair, and this straightener helps me get so much more sleekness and volume.</li>
            <li>This award-winning elegant, stylish 1-inch curler can do it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sleek black look and features an extra-long 9-foot swivel extension cord.</li>
            <li>Great styler, but I was not able to register it with Ghd.</li>
            <li>I read a ton of reviews, watched some cute little teenagers trying to do comparisons for their 10 YouTube followers (I think those are hilarious...</li>
            <li>and it is of exactly the same wonderful quality that my previous ghd straightener was.</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates come together perfectly and there&#x27;s even a little extra give when I squeeze them over my hair.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new one in which the code did work so these are genuine ghd stylers.</li>
            <li>Heats up almost instantaneously with a quick beep to let you know it is ready.  </li>
            <li>The result is a long lasting, shiny beautiful hair do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its lightweight  heats up super fast  </li>
            <li>I have previously used a Ghd straightener and loved it.  </li>
            <li>heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>My plates were old and I loved the iron, but wanted to try something different!</li>
            <li>It heats really quickly and beeps to let you know it&#x27;s ready.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and takes just one quick swipe to straighten my curly hair.</li>
            <li>The extra long cord (9-feet) is something that I&#x27;m going to have to get used to, but I do see how it would be perfect for professional stylists to use in salons.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, the opening spring is not to strong as to cause fatigue under long use.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the cord is super long and swivels.  </li>
            <li>But both of them give me very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>a very, very appreciated feature!&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>It is VERY real.  </li>
            <li>But honestly, it was well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>Just choose your vendor wisely, and make sure to check authenticity on their website!I use cheaper straighteners, and I can get pretty substantial waves out in a single pass with minimal styling product.</li>
            <li>She told me more or less what it would cost and that I could easily find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really hard to straighten, and it works great every time.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing, and i truly think it is the real GHD it heats up quick and my hair straight lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, it seems much more comparable to the Conair infiniti I had before my Chi.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, ghd makes some that are higher quality than others???</li>
            <li>so I know its not fake</li>
            <li>Not my first ghd.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll just have to move fast!</li>
            <li>, the warranty will most likely be voided if you buy from Amazon, but you should still sign up for it to check for its authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine says manufactured in China, but I guess it is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>so I know it&#x27;s better for my hair overall.  </li>
            <li>and this makes my hair soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s REAL!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I did</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot, I have to use it on smaller/thinner sections so it takes me a bit longer.</li>
            <li>I have pretty curly hair</li>
            <li>this hot tool makes my hair salon</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of straightening my long hair and it lasts until my next wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>I would advise to curl you hair first and then apply oil.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the staple beauty tool!</li>
            <li>This broke before it&#x27;s first use.  </li>
            <li>This styler really works!</li>
            <li>The first once I&#x27;ve had about 8 years.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I worried all day at work because I thought I might have left my hair straightener that heats up over 350 degrees on.</li>
            <li>there are so many different ones on amazon</li>
            <li>there are so many different ones on amazon</li>
            <li>Was totally satisfied, then it broke 2 years later after the warranty had expired.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for for a gift.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t attempt this for the first time, say, on prom night&lt;</li>
            <li>It gets hot</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I decided at the last minute I needed to straighten</li>
            <li>The plates are hot, but doesn&#x27;t damage my hair or the ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally bit the bullet and purchased the ghd straightener!</li>
            <li>I had tried a CHI first, returned it.  </li>
            <li>One side of the straightner is not getting hot anymore</li>
            <li>Better than the Chi and has lasted for several years now.</li>
            <li>From Hot Tools, FHI, CHI, HAI, Chameleon to Sedu.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ghd brand</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and heats up so fast!</li>
            <li>It gets hot in seconds and holds the heat from start to finish.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>It heats up in 30 seconds and straightens on the first swipe.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to and is a GHD.</li>
            <li>But man am I glad i finally did!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many over the last 15 years.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re pretty satisfied with your existing hair tools, this won&#x27;t change your life, but it&#x27;s a solid tool and works well.</li>
            <li>thanks ghd!</li>
            <li>You will thank me for this review later:)</li>
            <li>I am very upset and would NOT recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>Does not get as hot as I thought.</li>
            <li>and I got an email back saying its authentic.</li>
            <li>I love that fact that it has a universal voltage converter (I travel to Europe a lot).  </li>
            <li>The first I ordered didn&#x27;t even turn on..</li>
            <li>but it turned up with the holographic sticker and registered on GHD&#x27;s website first time</li>
            <li>The GHD heats up within seconds and is ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>My sister has had her ghd for many years and she uses her daily.  </li>
            <li>It has an automatic shutoff, and I just feel like it is better quality and safer than my last one.  </li>
            <li>This product is the real deal!</li>
            <li>(I ordered from this exact listing as well).</li>
            <li>Oh, an mine seems to be authentic, I checked for all the red flags and didn&#x27;t find any.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to order from Amazon and not a third party.</li>
            <li>It was working good for few months.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of fun playing with it, and was surprised by how well and how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty positive</li>
            <li>It works better than this flat</li>
            <li>My favorite GHD flat iron.  </li>
            <li>The product I purchased was not an authentic GHD Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron .</li>
            <li>I had tried a cheaper version of a flat iron before and it had done a much better job.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun flat Iron  for 8 years that had done a much better job.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the drugstore-purchased flat iron that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it heats up almost instantly and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Instead, I&#x27;m left with shiny, silky, and healthy straight hair.</li>
            <li>When I looked for it, sure enough I found it and at a much lower price than what she stated.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd GHD flat iron, and I don&#x27;t feel the quality is as good as my first one.</li>
            <li>High quality, reasonable price and quick arrival.</li>
            <li>I got a real product, works very fast, do not damage hair</li>
            <li>I have just purchased crappy fake products online (not amazon) before and was more confident in folica.com this time round.hin, fine, coloured and highlighted, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I had read a lot of the positive reviews of this product, so I thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>First, I like it that it beeps to let you know that it&#x27;s ready to be used after plugged in.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a two year warranty, which is twice as long as most.</li>
            <li>It took me 30 minutes to straighten my whole head of head the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a Sedu flat iron for the last 7 years and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>Also, after comparing with my old genuine styler, I know the new one is not fake.</li>
            <li>Many went on to talk about holes on the cord and the prong and where it is made, but actually those are old posts on the internet and the only sure way is by going to ghd website and registering your product.  </li>
            <li>The grip is easy to hold, and it springs open when you aren&#x27;t clamping it.</li>
            <li>That makes it easy to maneuver, especially for styling someone else&#x27;s hair if you need to walk around them and go at it from all sides.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and fast to run it through your hair one tiny section at a time, and you pretty much never have to repeat any sections</li>
            <li>I have had a Chi for many years, and I actually think this flat iron works better on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I did pretty much the same thing as my chi but maybe slightly less static and a tad bit more shine.</li>
            <li>Other people&#x27;s reviews had convinced me to make sure I was getting an authentic GHD flat iron.</li>
            <li>I feel like the new one is to smooth, but that could be because the old one is very old and has a different feel and the plates are more used.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used GHD it blew me away with how much better it worked than other irons.</li>
            <li>I suspect Amazon&#x27;s prices are low to compete with all of the vendors selling fakes on here, which is a shame for them but worked out just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Cost a little more than others, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>This styler makes my hair straight, smooth, sleek and shinny and it lasts until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>HUGE different...</li>
            <li>my hair legit gets all the time very frizzy and never gets straight.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and straightness hair as promised.  </li>
            <li>everyone insists real ghd&#x27;s are made in Korea.</li>
            <li>I am a flight attendant and a hair straightener</li>
            <li>She really loves the auto off function.  </li>
            <li>and when I was watching videos and reading reviews of this straightener, it seemed like one I would want, but I couldn&#x27;t find it for a really reasonable price.</li>
            <li>So, I bought it and it came really fast.</li>
            <li>Real GHD stylers have plugs with reset buttons, like you would find on a hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Real GHD stylers have one hole on the cord where it meets the body of the iron.  </li>
            <li>Real GHD stylers say &amp;#34;Made in P.R.C.&amp;#34; on them or Korea.  </li>
            <li>Real GHD stylers will NOT have a hook on the cord to hang up your styler.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Real GHD stylers have a date code on the inside of the body of the styler.  </li>
            <li>but he really shipped from China.  </li>
            <li>If it is REAL it will ALWAYS have a plug with a reset button, like a hair dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but he really shipped from China.  </li>
            <li>If it is REAL it will ALWAYS have a plug with a reset button, like a hair dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ordered straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much time</li>
            <li>: They both straighten really well...</li>
            <li>I did not purchase mine straight from amazon just one of the sellers on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and this works wonders to make my hair straight</li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS: heats up incredibly fast; beeps to tell you when it&#x27;s ready, doesn&#x27;t fry your hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>and I purchased it straight from</li>
            <li>That is how you know whether you are getting the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it goes through, congrats you have a REAL GHD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over my hair to get it straight</li>
            <li>I also have really curly hair</li>
            <li>Thanks to my sister for recommending this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product it works very well with me</li>
            <li>I had read some reviews after purchasing the styler and people were saying it might not be real</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li>I do not believe this is a real GHD flatiron, but regardless, even if it is knock off, this flatiron does not straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>So turns out the straightener was real.</li>
            <li>I turn it on and in about 5 minuets am ready to start making passes.</li>
            <li>I believe that the products you use, including shampoo and conditioner, really impact a) the way you hair looks and feels after being styled, and b) the way the straightener works and reacts to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe that the products you use, including shampoo and conditioner, really impact a) the way you hair looks and feels after being styled, and b) the way the straightener works and reacts to your hair.  </li>
            <li>Everything on the iron looked like a real one.  </li>
            <li>* Heats up super-quickly (15-30 seconds, depending on room temperature), beeps gently when it&#x27;s ready, then blinks</li>
            <li>I have very think hair and the Revlon and Conair brands just weren&#x27;t cuttin&#x27; it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I am a very trusting person, so am I with products I purchase online.</li>
            <li>A REAL GHD HAS ONE HOLOGRAPHIC CODE AND</li>
            <li>I had been eying it for years on Sephora, but could never shell out that much money.</li>
            <li>They take this very seriously.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received mine and registered it on the ghd site and it was real.</li>
            <li>and I wish I had spent the full amount on the real deal because I know from past experience how great the GHD products are.</li>
            <li>My hair also felt very silky and not damaged.  </li>
            <li>(I somehow doubt anything will ever compete with its predecessor on that front anyway), but it works like an absolute dream.</li>
            <li>Ready to go.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but seems to take a lot of time to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li>It does indeed work, so that really is all that matters.</li>
            <li>and it seems also I am not using nearly as much heat.</li>
            <li>hope my sister likes this just as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I have gone through 3 chi straighteners my whole life</li>
            <li>but this is so much smoother.</li>
            <li>whereas everything else I&#x27;ve read says the real ones are made in South Korea.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t stay straight.  </li>
            <li>Based on the comments here, I immediately went to the ghd website and registered it, and verified that it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>so I just returned it and had to pony up for the real deal</li>
            <li>I like soo much</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I used the blow dryer with a heat protectant and this iron got my hair bone straight AND shiny.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy the Sultra, but it seemed too much like the others.</li>
            <li>I have always owned cheap hair straighteners as i only straighten my bangs.</li>
            <li>It works very well, heat up so fast</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>It looks real, but since I couldn&#x27;t register it, I will return it.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, and straightens hair without a problem.</li>
            <li>how much I&#x27;d payed and was told &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>the hair very well..leaves a crease in the hair.  </li>
            <li>I will start by admitting that I really don&#x27;t do much with my hair.  </li>
            <li>after using the ghd styler, I think the reason I never did much with my hair is because I was always using substandard products.  </li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up so fast, doesn&#x27;t damage hair and straightens like a dream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Seems like it could be a legal issue.</li>
            <li>, I decided that not much had changed over the last 7 years in the technology, but I thought I&#x27;d give the GHD and Sedu both a fair shot and compare them myself.</li>
            <li>As much as the GHD cost, I expected better results.</li>
            <li>But I chose to purchase one direct from amazon.com not one of the 3rd parties and it is authentic.  </li>
            <li>pay an extra $50 and get a real one!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll personally stick with this because it&#x27;s much healthier ok my hair than standard heat hot irons.</li>
            <li>I initially thought this was a copy, but it seems to be 100% original.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always use a cheap conair flat iron ..</li>
            <li>It works better than any other my wife has used.</li>
            <li>I was worried per the other reviews, but I received my GHD and was able to register it on the GHD website.</li>
            <li>Better than any other iron I have used before.</li>
            <li>Much better than other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>and it gets dry, tangled, and damaged easily..</li>
            <li>so now&lt;br /&gt;she can have both with minimal fuss and without destroying her beautiful locks.</li>
            <li>In fact, I left it on too long (as my own one takes forever to heat up) and it shut itself off.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend spending a little bit more for a stellar product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this because it makes my styling time next to nothing now instead of constantly going over the same area repeatedly like with a cheap iron.</li>
            <li>and I liked it, but it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>The 90 degree cord swivels and makes use really easy not only for home but also for professional use.  </li>
            <li>On one hand I love it because it&#x27;s so amazingly fast (10 seconds to heat, and less than 5 minutes between plugging it in and unplugging), but it flat-out damages my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, so most of the time I let it air dry</li>
            <li>The other thing that makes this extremely useful is how quickly it heats up and is ready to go.</li>
            <li>Also, it did not get near as hot as my Chi</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s naturally curly...and not in a pretty way...</li>
            <li>and I felt like I was going over my hair a lot more times than I do my Chi to get the desired end results (I have fine, thin, short-bobbed hair too.)</li>
            <li>it was brand new!</li>
            <li>Hopefully the new one will work!</li>
            <li>Was excited to try out my new ghd straightener last night, but as I took it out of the (admittedly flimsy and scratched) box</li>
            <li>will just make my bangs stiff and more dry, but the ghd has its way of making my hair look and feel even more hydrated than it is and very naturally silky.</li>
            <li>but this ghd flat iron definitely beats it in all aspect (which it better be since the price is 3x as much).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say my previous hair straightener was a Solia which is also one of the top hair straightener</li>
            <li>I love the Ghd Brand (I had a previous one)</li>
            <li>the irons gives a better curl on less greasy hair.</li>
            <li>I am able to straighten my hair in half the time it used to take me</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m replacing a real ghd (which only died when I used it abroad and the converter fried it), I decided the &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>Older models do not.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the classic GHD stylers, the box should be matte, not shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Style/Options: Both 1&amp;#34; (Sedu has more curved edges, which I find easier for curling the ends of my hair under); both heat up quickly (GHD was seriously 5 seconds</li>
            <li>I ordered it gift wrapped and so pleased i did, not only was the box and wrapping suburb, but disguised the contents resulting in a big surprise on  Christmas day.</li>
            <li>I decided to take my chances with this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; of the GHD Classic Styler.</li>
            <li>just received my ghd classic I-inch iron, looooooooove it.</li>
            <li>Classic Styler, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li>I just received my GHD classic sytler yesterday, and registered it on GHD&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>The ghd Classic 1-inch Styler uses ceramic plate technology which helps reduce breakage and damage to the hair because the ceramic can glide through your hair without pulling it.  </li>
            <li>They were the main vendor for this page when I ordered, but they&#x27;re not now, so it looks like it changes out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an older Chi styler that is wider</li>
            <li>Well, I found it with this GHD Classic Styler.</li>
            <li>The GHD iron is far superior to any other flat iron out there.  </li>
            <li>But the most Amazingly reduced the total time to half of the time which used to take with other straightener i have to straighten My Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cheap straighteners tend to loose their heat as you use them.  </li>
            <li>For now, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the GHD.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and will buy again if need be.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it very long so far, but this straightener has proved to be so much better than my old Con-Air Infiniti.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if long-term quality is important, save the $125 and purchase a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>I love how I only need to flat iron a section once</li>
            <li>Pay a little more and buy the straightener through GHD or one of its resellers.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much more I can say about this tragic hair straightener other than it, never turned on and must have been a fluke because GHD is normally awesome.</li>
            <li>(The models available in the U.S. after the Pure and Dark models came out include holograms.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The GHD Dark and Pure stylers are now available in the US and there are a ton of fakes on ebay now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The GHD Dark and Pure stylers are now available in the US and there are a ton of fakes on ebay now.  </li>
            <li>Real GHD stylers have very strong, thick boxes.  </li>
            <li>i was really nervous in buying a new ghd (previous one broke on me after using it for a good 3+ years and treating it not very caringly)</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy a new one if the older one would \\&quot;die\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s old and ready to be replaced.</li>
            <li>As far as the iron itself, it is a sturdy, quality iron that heats up lightning fast.</li>
            <li>lot of complaints for the GHD was that people kept getting FAKE non legit ones, I am happy to say I received a legit GHD and you can too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I bought this knowing that it had great reviews and hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t receive a fake like some others had reported in their reviews.</li>
            <li>It heats up so fast and leaves hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Real GHD&#x27;s sensor lights are clear but will flash red when ready to use and make a funny beep.  </li>
            <li>is only about an inch long; however, I am sure my wife will use it after she gets it as a Christmas present.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are worth the price, cheaper than in Aus, and they last forever.</li>
            <li>healthy hair is your priority, choose this over any low-end, unevenly heated, bare-metal straightener.</li>
            <li>Most of them costed as much, if not more as this did.</li>
            <li>I am definitely hooked - definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will last long.</li>
            <li>Normal wear and tear prompted to replace my GHD.  </li>
            <li>After a lot of advice from friends I decided to buy a GHD style as opposed to other (cheaper) brands, it was definitely the right decision - it heats up super fast and works really well.</li>
            <li>Although, they are selling a red version on their own website today for slightly less.  </li>
            <li>The weight is amazingly light, it&#x27;s thin, easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t fatigue my wrist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first GHD, when first using it my hair was 80 percent dry</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure their other products are good, but fake GHDs are just everywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend getting a heat pouch (so you can put it away in, for example, a suitcase right after using it)</li>
            <li>although to be clear, this is a full sized flat iron, so it will take up space in your bag).  </li>
            <li>Given how quickly it heats up, that wouldn&#x27;t be a bother if you happened to step away too long</li>
            <li>Except maybe for professionals, I&#x27;m not sure that the significant cost difference (over $100) is worth the additional safety features.</li>
            <li>They said the hologram and other numbers have been copied and even if their website accepts the product code it done NOT indicate that the product is genuine.  </li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new straightener</li>
            <li>I decided to take the plunge and try something new.</li>
            <li>Just bought a new GHD straightener.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying the new one</li>
            <li>(I live in the South-</li>
            <li>I will continue to cry on the inside until my new GHD comes in.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really live up to the hype but the hype was overinflated</li>
            <li>and it was time for a new flatiron.</li>
            <li>I bought a new BabyLiss</li>
            <li>/&gt;We returned this and ordered a new from the manufacturer’s website</li>
            <li>Definitely thought it was genuine for a week till I did further digging.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased this item from a salon for 2x the price and loved it before it finally died 2 years later.</li>
            <li>you will never go back to any other brand, they are so fine!</li>
            <li>It is not as big yet in America, which I found strange, but I think its because of all the other brands that were so good that are now not</li>
            <li>I registered the flat iron right away</li>
            <li>hair is the softest it has ever been, and it feels very natural and flowy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use once you practice and only 15 minutes for really long hair.</li>
            <li>Curling is easy too, whether you go for tight curls or wavy</li>
            <li>This straightener did not have a reset button on the plug, and had many more of the &#x27;give-aways&#x27; that it was a fake!</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with it is that it does not have a temperature control on it, so it was too hot to use on color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have read other reviews about whether it is an original product because of where it was made.  </li>
            <li>Heats up in an instant and stays hot until I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Be aware that an adaptor may be required for use outside of United Kingdom.\\</li>
            <li>I purchased this GHD Styler as a gift for my wife, replacing a pretty generic model.</li>
            <li>Maybe that is why so many people have received fakes, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li>They last about 2 years before they start getting glitchy or getting too hot</li>
            <li>The GHD and Sedu are the exact same thing to me.</li>
            <li>the Iron:&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING, Night and day with the old one!</li>
            <li>Never seemed to get hot enough.</li>
            <li>and I had hear from a few people that GHD makes a really nice flat iron.</li>
            <li>The GHD styler DVD should have a number code and barcode on the back (compare it to the back of a DVD movie you own, they should look the same on the back).  </li>
            <li>I replaced my old herstyler with my new ghd</li>
            <li>it must be a knockoff&amp;#34; as they are nearly three times the price here in New Zealand</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I love this flat iron, which seems to work extremely well.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews about people not getting an authentic GHD flat iron; I contacted my niece who bought one for my sister at the retail outlet Sephora, and asked her to send me the sku number off the box.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used a flat iron.</li>
            <li>There is a much more conistent temperature across the plates which means you are going over the same area fewer times causing less damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A quick run through You Tube and you can see all of the different styling options easily enough anyway.</li>
            <li>I received it and used it a few times and it was taking me twice as long to straighten my hair because I had to go over it so many times because it didn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the CHI apparently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a different pro straightener, and was certain nothing could compare.</li>
            <li>Real GHD stylers have domed screws, not flat headed screws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is an amazing iron without any unnecessary frills.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s held up well, clearly, and still works, but it just doesn&#x27;t heat like it used to, and its time has been up for a while now.</li>
            <li>Saving $50 off retail may seem like a great bargain, but it&#x27;s a total ripoff if you&#x27;re paying for a fake that won&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li>In fact, when i went to register my iron, I clicked the help link for the date code and the example label had \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; clear as day on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many people gave negative reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>So just go from amazon/ghdprofessional directly</li>
            <li>A real GHD should be sealed from the outside.  </li>
            <li>only wanted to post this review to say I had a concern that the product might be a knockoff (even though it was coming straight from Amazon), but I registered it with ghd</li>
            <li>I got my GHD directly from Sephora</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both SO much better than the cheaper brands I&#x27;ve tried (recently also tried the HSI which got terrific reviews, but there&#x27;s really no comparison to these two...</li>
            <li>Just like my old one.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair stay straight, through the night and into the next day.  </li>
            <li>Amazon should do a better job of screening 3rd party sellers especially after numerous complaints such as this.  </li>
            <li>complaints so far.</li>
            <li>now it is completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the cord.</li>
            <li>Review done by a 25+ year professional hair stylist (my wife).  </li>
            <li>In a word, wow. I didn&#x27;t think it would, but this ghd straightener blew away.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had nothing negative to say about the styler &amp; is pleased with its handling &amp; durability.</li>
            <li>Literally only takes seconds to heat up and beeps when ready.</li>
            <li>It takes longer to straighten my hair and it does not stay as straight later into the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Returned them, and ordered a pair direct from the GHDs website</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the excess moisture completely evaporates and leaves the natural oil&#x27;s in my hair.</li>
            <li>After reading all the cautionary tales about fakes I ordered this gift for my wife directly from Amazon to avoid the problem of unscrupulous sellers.</li>
            <li>It takes several passes to achieve any straightening and even then my hair doesn&#x27;t get that straight</li>
            <li>It heated almost instantly, sounding a chime when it was ready to use.</li>
            <li>did not order directly from Amazon b/c</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that about my old one ...  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to purchase it directly from Amazon.com (sold and ships by).  </li>
            <li>i called GHD directly and they told me there was NO WAY TO AUTHENTICATE this product unless i mailed it directly to them for inspection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally curly</li>
            <li>Both times I took the advice to go to &#x27;buying options&#x27; and to ensure you are getting it direct from Amazon...  </li>
            <li>but it just did not feel like my old CHI.</li>
            <li>love that it takes only a few seconds to heat up.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>absolutely worth what i spent on it.</li>
            <li>Plus I love how it sleeps if you leave it on too long so that it won&#x27;t burn your house down.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t cool down.  </li>
            <li>After 30 minutes it starts to cool down.  </li>
            <li>Last but not least, it straightens just in 1-2 strokes and it lasts!</li>
            <li>I purchased the ghd flat iron more than a month ago and used a few times.</li>
            <li>, a real GHD styler will have two microchips, one on each side by each flat iron plate.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair much shinier than my lower end flat iron (about $30 range).  </li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long curly hair and of coarse wants straight hair -</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how it glided so easily throughout my hair and left my thick, wavy hair pin straight after 1 pass, instead of 3 or 4 (or 5) like my old straightener.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hard to straighten and curl hair and it works perfect on me plus on my mom with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>It was fine for a month or two, then I got lazy about straightening out my hair and took a break.</li>
            <li>The iron does not get hot enough to straighten even my short hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the GHD classic styler at Costco, but it is the same model as this one.</li>
            <li>Main Reason to Buy this Straighter is to use it In India while traveling as it supports international Voltage.</li>
            <li>Australian hairdresser first recommended GHD to me, and now my American hairdresser also recommended it to me - as it is what she uses in the salon and at home</li>
            <li>It took me less time to straighten my hair with this GHD than with my T3 (since my T3 often needs some quick touch-ups).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It features universal voltage so that it provides consistent heat even when traveling (you must provide the international adaptor).</li>
            <li>I recently just had a funeral for my GHD classic 1 inch hair straightener after one of the blades stopped heating.</li>
            <li>The price was so good, I was really doubtful it would be a true GHD.  </li>
            <li>Dry or damaged hair has positive ions.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my older chi flat iron...which finally gave out after 6 years of daily use.</li>
            <li>and it is a litle bit different, seems to weigh a litle bit less and has a sound effect when it is turned on.  </li>
            <li>I tried it once and while it heats up super fast, I had to run it through my hair 5 times to straighten my shoulder length, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>took my wife twice as long to get ready and fix her hair with this one</li>
            <li>so I could use it to curl my long a** hair without using a straight iron and a curling iron..</li>
            <li>I have purchased cheap straighteners in the past when i sued to straighten all my hair and they lasted a couple of years.</li>
            <li>It is in working order but I am not sure if it is genuine.</li>
            <li>FOR THE HOT PINK GHD STYLER:  </li>
            <li>HOT PINK GHD STYLERS should come with a card inside of the wrap and roll bag that says &amp;</li>
            <li>recently got fringe bangs and normal drugstore straighteners</li>
            <li>I have just purchased crappy fake products online (not amazon) before and was more confident in folica.com this time round.</li>
            <li>Not that this flat iron is a bad choice, but my Sedu is my all time favorite and rated 5+++++++ stars and more.zz, static electricity and flyaways.</li>
            <li>Not that this flat iron is a bad choice, but my Sedu is my all time favorite and rated 5+++++++ stars and more.</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten my hair in far less time than my previous straightener</li>
            <li>The big difference is that the GHD would catch and pull on my hair a bit...not much, but enough to where I have to think about it.  </li>
            <li>The big difference is that the GHD would catch and pull on my hair a bit...not much, but enough to where I have to think about it.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, my father african american and my mother is hispanic...</li>
            <li>With my old straightener (a Remington Wet 2 Straight) I&#x27;d have to put it on the highest setting to get any results.</li>
            <li>It also maintains an even temperature throughout the plates with no cold spots which means less passing on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I love this styler, and my only complaint is that it is a bit clunky to hold.</li>
            <li>I finally bought this after my old hair straightener nearly caused an electrical fire when the wires frayed.  </li>
            <li>We knew how good Amazon&#x27;s return policy was so, we ordered it knowing that we may possibly be buying a fake.</li>
            <li>the main page for this product seems to rotate between several vendors, not all of them trustworthy, and right now I have to check the little &amp;#34;More Buying Choices&amp;#34; sidebar to find the one sold by Amazon itself.</li>
            <li>First off, I have no idea what other people are talking about on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have had mine for a year now, and I have no regrets!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t straightened my hair in years, so I finally decided it was time to buck up the necessary cash for a decent one.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking for a simple but high quality straightener.</li>
            <li>Apparently they don&#x27;t use spell</li>
            <li>With naturally curly (read frizzy) hair this miracle device is now my daily companion.</li>
            <li>: GHD has a rougher feeling exterior, the same as my old Sedu, which would attract dirt and hairspray like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li>The ghd offers only one option and that is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It worked for a year then developed a short in the swivel cord.  </li>
            <li>There were numerous times when she&#x27;d forget to turn off her old styler, but with this GHD, there&#x27;s never a worry, since it turns itself off.</li>
            <li>I leave the hair straightener on?&amp;#34; is my personal equivalent of the old &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li>I leave the hair straightener on?&amp;#34; is my personal equivalent of the old &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li>But, it was coming directly from Amazon, not just fulfilled or a third party, so</li>
            <li>I just retired my 6 year old CHI and initially got a CHI replacement</li>
            <li>hair looks so healthy after I straighten with the GHD, rather than all broken with flyaways like cheaper straighteners</li>
            <li>my hair looks so healthy after I straighten with the GHD, rather than all broken with flyaways like cheaper straighteners  </li>
            <li>i have curly/wavy medium thick hair and it makes my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had $20.00 flat irons that have lasted longer, so for this price and the short life that it had, I would not recommend the GHD Classic styler.</li>
            <li>The GHD Classic is a basic home use flat iron.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot really fast and straightens my crazy curly har.</li>
            <li>I thought all flat iron are the same $30 vs $200, both has ironic place and same size..</li>
            <li>I love their appliances and have never had a single complaint.</li>
            <li>One of the fake GHD stylers that I received (a hot pink one) had two different shades of hot pink on the top of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18.  </li>
            <li>Had a problem registering it on the website the first time, only due to their site being temporarily under maintenance.</li>
            <li>so it is most likely fake, making the price tag way too high.</li>
            <li>and they are much hotter than any other styler I have used.  </li>
            <li>I replaced my GHD flat iron that was 4 years old.  </li>
            <li>have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and this flattening iron did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick with a slight wave, especially in the back, I was pleasantly surprised at what a good job this straightener does on my hair, I don&#x27;t have to go back and</li>
            <li>When the electrical element finally started getting a little spotty (it would still turn on, I just had to mess with the On button a bit), I decided to see what else was out there after so many years.  </li>
            <li>Second, it&#x27;s very light so for a person with thick hair like me &amp; usually takes forever to smooth out all my hair, it&#x27;s less tiring.</li>
            <li>The only thing is you might want to buy a separate heatproof bag for this as it didn&#x27;t come with one, and ensure you aren&#x27;t buying it from a third party but from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>I used my GHD every day and I dropped it religiously and it has lasted much longer than expected.</li>
            <li>(Some of the newer models after the Pure and Dark have two holes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Does not apply to Dark or Pure since they have not been released in the US yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20.  </li>
            <li>It was a little tricky at first, because I was using it a way that I never used a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it has recently started making a hissing, crackling sound when I move it a certain way, which causes it to turn on and off by itself.</li>
            <li>The heat is always consistent no matter if my hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li>GHDs are not exactly the same as my previous (genuine) ones</li>
            <li>My ends don&#x27;t feel all frazzled like they do when I use cheaper straighteners, and I can get pretty substantial waves out in a single pass with minimal styling product.</li>
            <li>It was obvious that the product has been used before, the packaging of the product was ripped, the box old and used and the procuct codes on the GHD flat iron were not matching.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My mother and younger sister have the same GHD that I used and is currently four years old too and is still working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big supporter of what isn&#x27;t broken doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced, but with how well this one worked, and how silky smooth my hair feels now compared to my old straightener, I am now shopping around to replace it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think there would be that much difference between the ghb and my other pricier straightener, but there is and I am not a ghb girl all the way!</li>
            <li>I bought it about a year and a half ago and it had been working really well.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair dry, but soft.</li>
            <li>It is ready really quickly (less than 20 seconds) and straightens</li>
            <li>She told me that she feels this only works a little better than the $20 ones I have bought her in the past.  </li>
            <li>- it has no temperature controls, so apparently it&#x27;s BAKING my hair in no time flat.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair and have so many issues with my previous CHI pulling my hair out.  </li>
            <li>Real GHD stylers (applies to Hot Pink only) have a solid pink cord, the cord does NOT have a black ring where it meets the back of the styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>I was little concerned as some people mentioned getting fakes, but this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The customer service representative said that registration was \\&quot;just for marketing purposes.\\&quot; Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was, spend a little bit of extra money to get the real thing.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and I can style my long, thick hair in less time than I could with a curling iron or the CHI that I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were plenty of good reviews too, but the bad reviews scared me.</li>
            <li>Sure the less expensive ones work, just not as quickly and typically others do not work anywhere in the world: this one does.</li>

            <li> Great straightener to use overseas too on my trip all I needed was a adapter</li>
            <li> The heat computer intelligently senses and heats the ceramic pads as not to damage the hair.  </li>
            <li> Automatic shut off is great.  </li>
            <li> They have lots of videos and how to&#x27;s as well, which is great for those who have no idea what they are doing, which is what I started off</li>
            <li> Works great, heats up with in a minute.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great quality</li>
            <li> but it has great bones</li>
            <li> They arrived within the week of ordering them which was also great.</li>
            <li> one works great.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a great all-purpose styler that feels great in your hands and delivers the look you desire for your hair.</li>

            <li> and I just love it!</li>
            <li> i was able to register in GHD site successfully.</li>

            <li> Still have my GHD to this day and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Was able to register the product with no problem!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so healthy!  </li>
            <li> Glad I did!  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s an authentic one!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get a $50 model like the HSI, instead of this for 140-190, but for those willing to pay this price, it works wonderfully</li>
            <li> i love this product!</li>
            <li> (e.g. I took it to Australia) and the beep to let you know that it&#x27;s hot is awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this one after using a friend&#x27;s GHD styler and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased I got this straightener for 90 dollars!</li>
            <li> I am also in love with this styler!  </li>
            <li> Now I am joining my sister in convincing everyone to buy one too!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell it is authentic, was able to register the product with serial number on GHD website- works wonderfully and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this GHD, does a very good job and heats up VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> All of them have the smart ship sensor in it to heat up evenly to 365 degrees, which is the perfect temperature for your hair not to be burned and the shine come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My amazing hair stylist recommended this to me and</li>
            <li> Amazing product and</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> This straightener is amazing.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> amazing</li>
            <li> The hair straightener is amazing when it works.</li>
            <li> They heat up within 15 seconds and give amazing results.</li>
            <li> Best part of this product is that it heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> Decided to get her one of her own for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift and the reciever was thrilled with the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really it is the best in the market.</li>
            <li> So guess what, I had to return it and purchase a REAL ghd that works wonderful from my salon.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and works great!</li>
            <li> so it would make a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get perfect hairstyles with very proffessional finishing touchs.</li>
            <li> Nice lil &amp;#34;hello&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Nice quality</li>
            <li> It does heat up within seconds which is really nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use it!!</li>
            <li> and i thought the cheaper price was too good to be true, but i was able to do some research and was delighted to discover that the GHD i was sent was a genuine product, it works great.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works great at straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I Love the GHD&#x27;s and they are not wrong - I always have Good Hair Day&#x27;s!!!:)</li>
            <li> great for the price... totally worth getting.</li>
            <li> far, so great!</li>
            <li> But as far as the function of the iron goes, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> It offers a all-day straightening power and works wonderfully when I use it to curl the ends of my hair</li>
            <li> :) It is absolutely amazing and I am defintiely buying another.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended the Ghd and it is amazing and so much better.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best straighteners for my wild hair.  </li>
            <li> Glides through the hair smoothly with a good feel.</li>
            <li> Perfect, durable, gets super hot in seconds!</li>
            <li> It heats up quick and works great though, and I love that I can curl or straighten, and it has an auto shut off in case</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it and worth every cent!!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine curly hair that requires washing or wetting every day to get the curls out.</li>
            <li> It straightens so easily and doesn&#x27;t snag at all like the CHI does!</li>
            <li> Even though I have beyond shoulder length hair, it is very fine in texture.  </li>
            <li> Since everyone raves over how much better ghd is than Chi I decided to get this miraculous straightener and truly have the \\&quot;best of the best\\&quot; for my busy work trips.</li>
            <li> have had many hair straighteners in my time, this one is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> Bought these at a very reasonable price and they are great.</li>
            <li> Always ask questions before buying and remember, if it looks too good to be true</li>
            <li> Always ask questions before buying and remember, if it looks too good to be true</li>
            <li> Everything was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> too good to be true</li>
            <li> I have now found an excellent straightener that straightens, smooths, and does not dry out my hair, and lasts without putting product in my hair.</li>
            <li> inadvertently.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy-to-use, built-to-last, and built safe, this heats up quickly and does a good job.</li>
            <li> The timer is great, it shuts itself off if it is not being used for a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li> how many holes on the cord because both of my stylers have 2 holes.</li>
            <li> Heats up so fast and does a great job straightening my hair-</li>
            <li> I am not the most coordinated person and even I can use this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this styler.  </li>
            <li> I ask my hairdresser if my hair appears healthy every time I get a cut.</li>
            <li> so make sure to look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have wavy hair and this tool does a great job of making it absolutely straight.</li>
            <li> This one works much better, faster  &amp; gets my hair nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Buy it you will love it ... and then start receiving amazing compliments about your gorgeous straight hair</li>
            <li> I have lots of friends with GHDs who love them, so</li>
            <li> It works okay</li>
            <li> - - - it gets the job done, but it takes a lot more time and effort.  </li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for months now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to buy one also.</li>
            <li> im glad she did.</li>
            <li> I totally love my GHD.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Mine was purchased from Amazon and registered as authentic at the ghd website.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast, and has the great option to use for curls/waves.  </li>
            <li> Mine was verified by GHD as authentic when I registered it.</li>
            <li> I was worried with some of the reviews that it wouldn&#x27;t be a ghd product, but before I even used it I made sure I could register it...</li>
            <li> and I was able to.</li>
            <li> It was so much better than the cheap-o Conair I had been using that I immediately ordered one for</li>
            <li> The box does say it was manufactured in P.R.C., but I was able to register my straightener on the ghd website using the codes on the straightener&#x27;s hologram and label.  </li>
            <li> Okay so to begin</li>
            <li> I wanted a GHD being the top of the line hair straightener in competition with the sudo</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many brands over the years</li>
            <li> Some reviewers claim is not an authentic styler if it&#x27;s not \\&quot;Made in Korea\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I was able to register it on the ghd website.  </li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> I expect it to work better for that price.</li>
            <li> I was able to register the GHD on the website (hologram and date code are on the arm, not the tag).</li>
            <li> My hair always looks healthy</li>
            <li> but I ordered the &amp;#34;sold by Amazon&amp;#34; one and I was able to register it at GHD&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> Love that they can be used when travelling abroad with dual voltage.  </li>
            <li> Simply the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 99% sure this is NOT an authorized re-sale from GHD.</li>
            <li> Even though this says it is a GHD, it sure doesn&#x27;t work like one.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but nonetheless i love this piece of a styler</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It made my hair silky. : )</li>
            <li> Mine just arrived and I was able to register it on the GHD website.  </li>
            <li> The auto off feature really makes me a happy camper too.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> it totally works its awesome</li>
            <li> thank you :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this styler.</li>
            <li> Never before had so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love the product but felt for the price it should have worked for longer that 1 year.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair look silky and stylish  </li>
            <li> I do not believe it&#x27;s authentic.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to register the warranty for the product with GHD (pamphlet in box).</li>
            <li> She has been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> for many years.</li>
            <li> and I love the ceramic plates on it.</li>
            <li> Awesome straightener, very efficient and fast to warm up.</li>
            <li> Before ordering this item, I read the reviews and saw that many folks who purchased through the third-party option ended up with counterfeit versions.</li>
            <li> for the product itself, it does not get any better.</li>
            <li> But, this GHD is even more outstanding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I almost think that it would be better to shut off after 15 minutes inactive.</li>
            <li> there are better straighteners out there.</li>
            <li> It worked much better than my Chi</li>
            <li> do think this works better than the Chi, but not so much better as to warrant the price for this</li>
            <li> i love this straighter, its the Mercedes of all straighteners.  </li>
            <li> Really good purchase and well worth it.</li>
            <li> I actually love having the piece of mind knowing that it shuts off after 30 mins.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the straightener very often but it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE you select the one that&#x27;s shipped from AND sold by Amazon -</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to register mine with GHD&#x27;s website, and everything looks/</li>
            <li> I like this straightener, but I definitely don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I was given this free for an honest review.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size for my hair as it is short and medium in thickness.</li>
            <li> and it rolls on my counter top.</li>
            <li> She Googled the issue and learned that there are many counterfeit versions of this product.  </li>
            <li> I was able to register my GHD on the website and it comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I was able to register my straightener online at GHD...</li>
            <li> but I received my product and was able to register it on GHD website and that it is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very happy with GHD but felt I should have been advised that the powerpoint connection would be for a US powerpoint and not Australian.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and shinney!</li>
            <li> Be sure to register with manufacturer to ensure authenticity.</li>

            <li> Original Ghd Stylers, registered them on the official website to make sure they were Ghd!</li>
            <li> As a sidenote - It was an authentic GHD - I was able to verify &amp; register it with GHD with no problems.</li>
            <li> Its authentic.</li>
            <li> my favorite feature is the no tangle swivel cord</li>
            <li> WILL JUST PURCHASE FROM GHD TO GUARANTEE I GET AN AUTHENTIC STRAIGHTENER PERIOD.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT FAKE!!!!  </li>
            <li> just as described, love it</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> Works well- checked the serial number on GHD&#x27;s website and was authentic.</li>
            <li> This was an okay flatiron.  </li>
            <li> Its just smoother and easier, and the price is so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> This narrower styler worked better for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a knock off iron - not an authentic GHD iron.  </li>
            <li> It takes at most two passes to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I truely LOVE them...</li>
            <li> weather permitting...! : )&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is not an authentic styler and is a knock off.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be authentic.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t checked to see if its registered and original, but it is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I think I like the Chi more...</li>
            <li> I received an authentic straightener.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received it, I went on line and was able to register it with GHD  with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this iron.</li>
            <li> Also, I did buy this iron from Amazon itself and was able to register it without any problems.</li>
            <li> the shipping was quick and painless I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron that I have owned.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality flat iron.</li>
            <li> but now that I own it, it is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Literally the best flat iron I have used to date.</li>
            <li> either way it is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I knew then that I had to look for that perfect flat iron that I&#x27;ve been used to.</li>
            <li> Awesome flat iron!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever!</li>
            <li> Best Flat Iron I have ever owned and there have been a lot!  </li>
            <li> I did the research and was looking for a great deal on a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Yes, my Chi is over 3 years old and still works as beautifully as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> READ THIS:  Many people have written reviews that they love this product, and it might very well be a good styler.  </li>
            <li> She has been trying to convince me to buy one for a long time, claiming it was the best straightener on the market, but I hesitated because of the price.  </li>
            <li> Smooth easy to use!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be deceived by the price, they are definitely original!</li>
            <li> It curls easily as well (but I mostly just used it for straightening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I got that I was able to look through the models available on Amazon and buy one that is authentic.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working great so far!</li>
            <li> which a) means more damage to hair--especially if it&#x27;s fine, and</li>
            <li> Great price for a fabulous new flatiron!</li>
            <li> The ghd Classic 1-inch styler heats up fast and maintains the perfect temperature while styling my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a very good one , but what i didnt like that it doesn&#x27;t have any bag to put in , and it is only one heat degree !</li>
            <li> they are amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> they are amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So if you thought this was too cheap to be an authentic product, don&#x27;t worry.  </li>
            <li> So far it is still working great for me.</li>
            <li> I emailed GHD directly asking if I successfully registered the product on the site that the product was guaranteed to be authentic.</li>
            <li> It would heat up really fast and did a good job for both straightening and curling.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> it got fried when I went to Paris due to Voltage so the converter on this one is great!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and would not trade it for any other straightener.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many high end straighteners, very many.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair which straightens easily but will often gain wave as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li> Very quick to heat up</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> Registration was easy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my Babylis, but it still works amazingly.</li>
            <li> However, I bought directly from amazon/ghdprofessional, and I can register mine successfully.</li>
            <li> Heats up almost instantly, works beautifully.</li>
            <li> However, my hair was warm and perfectly straight, so it did the trick!</li>
            <li> Nice and hot.</li>
            <li> This straightener is pretty nice....</li>
            <li> Great deal on an authentic ghd flat iron as this costs $180 at the salon!</li>
            <li> and it still works good as new.</li>
            <li> Mine is till working perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> It went through fine.</li>
            <li> It does a great job and does not dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> I think it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It works fine but the packaging was all ripped and messed up.</li>
            <li> I have had many, many, many straighteners, from cheap $30 ones, to pricey $100 ones and this ghd is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Works great- gets hot fast</li>
            <li> There is only one heat setting, hot, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The registration worked fine although the registration numbers were not on the cord as GHD site suggests.</li>
            <li> I just got done registering it on GHD&#x27;s website and everything went through just fine.</li>
            <li> Not only does it heat up SUPER quick, but it gives me a perfect do in no time!  </li>
            <li> GHD is huge in Australia, the creme dela creme of hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price by far and the quality and durablility is great.</li>
            <li> Mine registered as genuine on the official website, however, the box says \\&quot;made in China\\&quot;and</li>
            <li> The cheap ones I had to go over and over my hair.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, as I found, GHD has a verification tool on their site.</li>
            <li> Does a fabulous job straightening my hair...</li>
            <li> but they were absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I found that the Ghd sold on Amazon had such a great price I just had to get it.</li>
            <li> It made my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous</li>
            <li> i try diffetent power adaptors, just not power adaptor will fit, what can i do?</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as cheap</li>
            <li> Using it in Australia, so dual voltage was important.</li>
            <li> After a couple CHI&#x27;s this was confirmed case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to GHD and am just as happy as before -</li>
            <li> (kept sliding out when I got towards the bottom of the strand), and didn&#x27;t give a smooth, glossy effect I wanted.  </li>
            <li> its that cheap</li>
            <li> It also has a flashing LED light.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It runs through smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Used it this morning, and it works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> I registered it on the GHD website and the registration was confirmed.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon price is fantastic and I successfully registered it on the GHD website, so it must be the real thing (not a fake).</li>
            <li> I was also impressed that it stayed completely straight after spending time outside in 90% humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, this one in particular looks very nice not that it matters for functionality, but it is a pretty iron.</li>
            <li> Bought these after hearing so much about GHD and I am glad I did, best straighteners I have ever used, I bought them of Amazon as I was unsure from reading other reviews that they couldn&#x27;t register there product, I had no problem registering with GHD.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter in law for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li> so very useful for traveling (</li>
            <li> After entering the 2 required codes (located on the hologram tag attached to the product), I was happy to discover that it IS a genuine ghd flat iron!</li>
            <li> Heats up within seconds, great and easy use, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair.</li>
            <li> Read great reviews on this flat iron and it was on a sale.</li>
            <li> Really a great flat iron that works well.  </li>
            <li> Great Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> I especially love the 30 minute, automatic shut-off feature, a must for forgetful people like me ;)</li>
            <li> so easy and quick to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;the plates are rounded, making it super easy to curl even for a novice like me</li>
            <li> its so easy and quick to use  </li>
            <li> the plates are rounded, making it super easy to curl even for a novice like me  </li>
            <li> * Super-long cord means you&#x27;re not tethered to the outlet (super useful when the mirror isn&#x27;t ideally placed relative to the outlet!)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The iron heats up really quickly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d read some reviews in several places saying that their quality had dropped off, and I still remembered how wonderful the GHD I&#x27;d tried had been (and that was when my CHI was still in its prime!), so in looking to replace my straightener, I really wanted to see if I could find an authentic GHD at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> gets very hot, very quickly and does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> loving it so far !!</li>
            <li> Very nice and does not burn my hair like prev flat iron</li>
            <li> Both are quality products, but the Sedu edged out the GHD and if it lasts as long as my first one, I&#x27;m happy to pay a bit more for it than the cheaper straighteners for what I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li> Both are quality products, but the Sedu edged out the GHD and if it lasts as long as my first one, I&#x27;m happy to pay a bit more for it than the cheaper straighteners for what I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li> Take the time to register your iron there to make sure it&#x27;s not a fake [...]</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is just because the photo is older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Appears to be authentic but it is extremely hot and smells like burnt rubber</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairstylists and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased my GHD styler 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Also the styler is NOT a fake and I was able to register it on GHD&#x27;s website with no problem.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> By entering the halogram sticker unique code and date code of your product, you will be emailed to let you know if your product is genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and hopefully you love the results as much as I do!</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than my Chi ever did and my hair stays straight for longer!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this straightener for my birthday.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this was a counterfeit or faulty product.</li>
            <li> Worth the price for something you use on your hair every day!</li>
            <li> I checked the product the minute I got it and went online and found out I got the original..</li>
            <li> It is still working great, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love that this one shuts off, maybe a little too soon, but still not complaining, it&#x27;s a great feature and</li>
            <li> love, love, love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> super smooth</li>
            <li> super smooth</li>
            <li> It also stays clean.</li>
            <li> Apparently the styler worked great for the first couple weeks and not no longer worked.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and has LED light indicator, easy to see.  </li>
            <li> And so far, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> They honestly are amazing, and I think they will just be so huge in a year or two unless the other brands pick up their act!</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and then glides evenly and smoothly for perfectly straight smooth hair.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best flat iron I have owned.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this flat iron, but it is really amazing.</li>
            <li> price is also special in Amazon,,&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> and it straightens it right out!</li>
            <li> But my favorite straightener by fair is my gold n hot ceramic flat iron that I got for like 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> but given the price - I expected this to work great.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t received both and tried them at the same time, I would probably be pretty happy with this flatiron.  </li>
            <li> I have since bought the same exact time from a Sephora and it works great.</li>
            <li> (It also came in a really cool box.)</li>
            <li> My hair would also be wavy later in the day because it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job I guess.</li>
            <li> SURE IF IT IS REAL</li>
            <li> love it heat up fast and</li>
            <li> I have had my Australian GHD for almost 5 years now and it works as good as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> GHD have a authentication tool on their website to make sure you got a real legit straightener.</li>
            <li> However, this straightener was not as good (although the same model that my friend purchased 2+ years ago).  </li>
            <li> I bought this as s gift for my wife, who recently tried a family member&#x27;s GHD straightener and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to LOVE it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved my last ghd straightener!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much it was a pleasure dealing with you :)</li>
            <li> , however the real one is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Fair enough with price I got for this item.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and love the auto turn off</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these are wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also dual voltage, which is fantastic when I travel (you just need to provide a plug adapter for the outlet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I had it registered on the official site of GHD and its the real deal :)</li>
            <li> I love how it heats up and beeps as soon as its ready in 30 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> I had the HSI Professional which i thought was pretty good</li>
            <li> Anyway it&#x27;s great hits up quickly and leaves my hair straight and smooth with only a couple passes.</li>
            <li> that right there kind of made the final decision for me. :)</li>
            <li> that right there kind of made the final decision for me. :)</li>
            <li> The first time I turned it on I was sure something wasn&#x27;t working quite right because it gave me the &amp;#34;all</li>
            <li> The other great feature of this styler is its automatic shut-off.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other flat irons for a lot more money and am really impressed with this one.  </li>
            <li> and my wife loves it and swears its better than her Remington one even though I can&#x27;t understand how much tech can be in a couple of hot plates!</li>
            <li> My GHDs finally broke after over 10 years so bought a new set, still as good as they always have been!</li>
            <li> I love this one, had one before, it broke, used another for about a year, glad to be back.</li>
            <li> I have wavy frizzy hair and it helps tremendously with the friz and it straightens so effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick.</li>
            <li> when ever I need a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> up super fast&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> and I only had 10-15 minutes or even 5 for a real quick top layer straightening as apposed to 40-60 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was able to plug it in, turn it on and within seconds it was HOT and ready to go!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and does the job.  </li>
            <li> straightener heats quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> and I was a loyal chi person.</li>
            <li> Classic 1-inch Styler / Straightener today and was able to register it on the ghd site with no problem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick too.</li>
            <li> /styles my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> This styler heats quickly.</li>
            <li> This styler straightens hair adequately.</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heats up QUICK.</li>
            <li> I received the classic styler by GHD today and it is 100% authentic.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how quick it heats up, plug it in and 10 seconds</li>
            <li> gets hot very quickly and it double beeps to tell you when it&#x27;s ready, which is very nice.  </li>
            <li> So I just wanted a cheaper but still good straightener for the year, or even one that I could take home and still use (I&#x27;ve read America to Aus is fine but not the other way).</li>
            <li> , I was so excited I used it right away.</li>
            <li> Authentic and really high up in the hair straightener choices.</li>
            <li> I was replacing this with my previous ghd which I got for full price and worked great for years..</li>
            <li> Very good styler and much cheaper than in the store.always difficult to find good quality(not</li>
            <li> The ghd Classic 1-inch styler is the bomb!!!  </li>
            <li> I was happy the moment i got this, its so smooth when you use it, was abit caught off guard by the different power cord but that was quickly fixed</li>
            <li> i hope its not a fake, probably is.. since its so cheap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li> Flat iron does damage the hair so keeping it to a minimum is the best thing to do and don&#x27;t think that paying extra for temp.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for at a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> It really is an outstanding and superior product compared to the stuff sold at your corner pharmacy, or other large nearby retailer.</li>
            <li> This product came in brand new as if i had just bought it from the store myself, love it.</li>
            <li> Loves how fast it heats up and great on long hair</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and beeps when its ready for use.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it, the right size and high quality item.  </li>
            <li> This one stays hot!</li>
            <li> HOT immediately!</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend noticed the difference the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> but I took a chance anyway and its real!!</li>
            <li> It was real !!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is very curly/wavy.  </li>
            <li> This means means far more less damage by locking in your hairs own moisture and minimizing frizz, static electricity and flyaways.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive the REAL GHD classic styler, successfully registered it on the GHD website, and have loved it every single time I used</li>
            <li> They are not taken care of very well like a genuine GHD</li>
            <li> Gets my hair straight a lot faster than the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> Based on some of the reviews, I was concerned whether the product that would show up would be the real deal or a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> If you are really aching to get this please do not go with the Free Shipping (FedEx Smartpost), it took two days for Amazon to send out, and</li>
            <li> One pass of the iron and my locks are smooth, straight, and shiny.</li>
            <li> It may be pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li> If it has the shiny sticker inside the clasps of the straightener it is most likely the real deal but to make sure you should sign up for again, its warranty.</li>
            <li> Worth the $</li>
            <li> so I left the seller a feedback message that was not too nice (which I do apologize for)</li>
            <li> My friend recommend this flat iron and I am so glad she did!</li>
            <li> This straightenr is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This one by far is the most well thought out, designed.  </li>
            <li> But, the investment is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> honestly believe that once you get a GHD you will never (happily) go back to another brand.</li>
            <li> I honestly believe that once you get a GHD you will never (happily) go back to another brand.</li>
            <li> The GHD 1 inch styler I recently purchased from the vendor Platinum Home Delivery (order fulfilled via Amazon) was far from what you consider a great item.</li>
            <li> The straightener I got is completely legit and I was able to register it on the ghd website with no</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this and it completely exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> Foremost, rest assured that if you purchase this item directly through Amazon, it is guaranteed authentic.</li>
            <li> Read reviews on Amazon and made sure to purchase the iron direct from AMAZON.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every dollar</li>
            <li> I spend a good hour examining them, tried them out, and concluded they were definitely not the real thing.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, my 13-year old daughter will borrow my hair iron and I have to double-check to make sure she didn&#x27;t leave it on.  </li>
            <li> totally worth it</li>
            <li> but if you want something better, I would choose the professional or the eclipse version of it.</li>
            <li> Though I would recommend to buy it from your hair stylist as they get it from their local beauty supply store for a better prize, plus some of the stores offer free return and exchange for the warranty period of 2 years in store, taking away the hassle of calling customer service or waiting for the replacement to arrive.</li>
            <li> It put my flatiron to shame and was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> While I like it, it is not any better than my old Paul Mitchell one.</li>
            <li> MY CHEAP FLAT IRON WORKS BETTER THAN THIS.</li>
            <li> Product gets hot quick and turns off after about 30 minutes of no use.  </li>
            <li> it gets hot really quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for me to get the hang of it, and soon I had loose waves and curls that looked and felt wonderful.</li>
            <li> It heats up super quick and is very east to use.  </li>
            <li> It smooths the hair far and easily and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> As long as it continues to work for at least a year or more I will be very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I could tell right away.  </li>
            <li> , i tried to cancel my order right away</li>
            <li> they will resolve the issue and the third-party vendor will lose the right to sell at Amazon.</li>
            <li> ghd Classic styler that I received is genuine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other flat irons and this one seems to work best for my wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an on off switch and a LED light to indicate when it&#x27;s ready to use (which is about 30 seconds - it&#x27;s super fast).  </li>
            <li> For hair that doesn&#x27;t need too much heat this is perfect, but if you need that steam and pin straight hair you should opt for a more expensive GHD.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine blonde hair, and this straightener helps me get so much more sleekness and volume.</li>
            <li> This award-winning elegant, stylish 1-inch curler can do it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sleek black look and features an extra-long 9-foot swivel extension cord.</li>
            <li> Great styler, but I was not able to register it with Ghd.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews, watched some cute little teenagers trying to do comparisons for their 10 YouTube followers (I think those are hilarious...</li>
            <li> and it is of exactly the same wonderful quality that my previous ghd straightener was.</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates come together perfectly and there&#x27;s even a little extra give when I squeeze them over my hair.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new one in which the code did work so these are genuine ghd stylers.</li>
            <li> Heats up almost instantaneously with a quick beep to let you know it is ready.  </li>
            <li> The result is a long lasting, shiny beautiful hair do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its lightweight  heats up super fast  </li>
            <li> I have previously used a Ghd straightener and loved it.  </li>
            <li> heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> My plates were old and I loved the iron, but wanted to try something different!</li>
            <li> It heats really quickly and beeps to let you know it&#x27;s ready.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and takes just one quick swipe to straighten my curly hair.</li>
            <li> The extra long cord (9-feet) is something that I&#x27;m going to have to get used to, but I do see how it would be perfect for professional stylists to use in salons.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, the opening spring is not to strong as to cause fatigue under long use.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the cord is super long and swivels.  </li>
            <li> But both of them give me very straight hair.  </li>
            <li> a very, very appreciated feature!&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> It is VERY real.  </li>
            <li> But honestly, it was well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> Just choose your vendor wisely, and make sure to check authenticity on their website!I use cheaper straighteners, and I can get pretty substantial waves out in a single pass with minimal styling product.</li>
            <li> She told me more or less what it would cost and that I could easily find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really hard to straighten, and it works great every time.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, and i truly think it is the real GHD it heats up quick and my hair straight lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, it seems much more comparable to the Conair infiniti I had before my Chi.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, ghd makes some that are higher quality than others???</li>
            <li> so I know its not fake</li>
            <li> Not my first ghd.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll just have to move fast!</li>
            <li> , the warranty will most likely be voided if you buy from Amazon, but you should still sign up for it to check for its authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine says manufactured in China, but I guess it is the real deal!  </li>
            <li> so I know it&#x27;s better for my hair overall.  </li>
            <li> and this makes my hair soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s REAL!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I did</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot, I have to use it on smaller/thinner sections so it takes me a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I have pretty curly hair</li>
            <li> this hot tool makes my hair salon</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of straightening my long hair and it lasts until my next wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> I would advise to curl you hair first and then apply oil.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the staple beauty tool!</li>
            <li> This broke before it&#x27;s first use.  </li>
            <li> This styler really works!</li>
            <li> The first once I&#x27;ve had about 8 years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I worried all day at work because I thought I might have left my hair straightener that heats up over 350 degrees on.</li>
            <li> there are so many different ones on amazon</li>
            <li> there are so many different ones on amazon</li>
            <li> Was totally satisfied, then it broke 2 years later after the warranty had expired.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for for a gift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t attempt this for the first time, say, on prom night&lt;</li>
            <li> It gets hot</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I decided at the last minute I needed to straighten</li>
            <li> The plates are hot, but doesn&#x27;t damage my hair or the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally bit the bullet and purchased the ghd straightener!</li>
            <li> I had tried a CHI first, returned it.  </li>
            <li> One side of the straightner is not getting hot anymore</li>
            <li> Better than the Chi and has lasted for several years now.</li>
            <li> From Hot Tools, FHI, CHI, HAI, Chameleon to Sedu.  </li>
            <li> This is my first ghd brand</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and heats up so fast!</li>
            <li> It gets hot in seconds and holds the heat from start to finish.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> It heats up in 30 seconds and straightens on the first swipe.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to and is a GHD.</li>
            <li> But man am I glad i finally did!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many over the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pretty satisfied with your existing hair tools, this won&#x27;t change your life, but it&#x27;s a solid tool and works well.</li>
            <li> thanks ghd!</li>
            <li> You will thank me for this review later:)</li>
            <li> I am very upset and would NOT recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Does not get as hot as I thought.</li>
            <li> and I got an email back saying its authentic.</li>
            <li> I love that fact that it has a universal voltage converter (I travel to Europe a lot).  </li>
            <li> The first I ordered didn&#x27;t even turn on..</li>
            <li> but it turned up with the holographic sticker and registered on GHD&#x27;s website first time</li>
            <li> The GHD heats up within seconds and is ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> My sister has had her ghd for many years and she uses her daily.  </li>
            <li> It has an automatic shutoff, and I just feel like it is better quality and safer than my last one.  </li>
            <li> This product is the real deal!</li>
            <li> (I ordered from this exact listing as well).</li>
            <li> Oh, an mine seems to be authentic, I checked for all the red flags and didn&#x27;t find any.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to order from Amazon and not a third party.</li>
            <li> It was working good for few months.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of fun playing with it, and was surprised by how well and how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive</li>
            <li> It works better than this flat</li>
            <li> My favorite GHD flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The product I purchased was not an authentic GHD Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron .</li>
            <li> I had tried a cheaper version of a flat iron before and it had done a much better job.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun flat Iron  for 8 years that had done a much better job.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the drugstore-purchased flat iron that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it heats up almost instantly and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;m left with shiny, silky, and healthy straight hair.</li>
            <li> When I looked for it, sure enough I found it and at a much lower price than what she stated.  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd GHD flat iron, and I don&#x27;t feel the quality is as good as my first one.</li>
            <li> High quality, reasonable price and quick arrival.</li>
            <li> I got a real product, works very fast, do not damage hair</li>
            <li> I have just purchased crappy fake products online (not amazon) before and was more confident in folica.com this time round.hin, fine, coloured and highlighted, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of the positive reviews of this product, so I thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> First, I like it that it beeps to let you know that it&#x27;s ready to be used after plugged in.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a two year warranty, which is twice as long as most.</li>
            <li> It took me 30 minutes to straighten my whole head of head the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sedu flat iron for the last 7 years and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> Also, after comparing with my old genuine styler, I know the new one is not fake.</li>
            <li> Many went on to talk about holes on the cord and the prong and where it is made, but actually those are old posts on the internet and the only sure way is by going to ghd website and registering your product.  </li>
            <li> The grip is easy to hold, and it springs open when you aren&#x27;t clamping it.</li>
            <li> That makes it easy to maneuver, especially for styling someone else&#x27;s hair if you need to walk around them and go at it from all sides.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and fast to run it through your hair one tiny section at a time, and you pretty much never have to repeat any sections</li>
            <li> I have had a Chi for many years, and I actually think this flat iron works better on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I did pretty much the same thing as my chi but maybe slightly less static and a tad bit more shine.</li>
            <li> Other people&#x27;s reviews had convinced me to make sure I was getting an authentic GHD flat iron.</li>
            <li> I feel like the new one is to smooth, but that could be because the old one is very old and has a different feel and the plates are more used.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used GHD it blew me away with how much better it worked than other irons.</li>
            <li> I suspect Amazon&#x27;s prices are low to compete with all of the vendors selling fakes on here, which is a shame for them but worked out just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Cost a little more than others, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This styler makes my hair straight, smooth, sleek and shinny and it lasts until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li> HUGE different...</li>
            <li> my hair legit gets all the time very frizzy and never gets straight.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and straightness hair as promised.  </li>
            <li> everyone insists real ghd&#x27;s are made in Korea.</li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant and a hair straightener</li>
            <li> She really loves the auto off function.  </li>
            <li> and when I was watching videos and reading reviews of this straightener, it seemed like one I would want, but I couldn&#x27;t find it for a really reasonable price.</li>
            <li> So, I bought it and it came really fast.</li>
            <li> Real GHD stylers have plugs with reset buttons, like you would find on a hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Real GHD stylers have one hole on the cord where it meets the body of the iron.  </li>
            <li> Real GHD stylers say &amp;#34;Made in P.R.C.&amp;#34; on them or Korea.  </li>
            <li> Real GHD stylers will NOT have a hook on the cord to hang up your styler.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Real GHD stylers have a date code on the inside of the body of the styler.  </li>
            <li> but he really shipped from China.  </li>
            <li> If it is REAL it will ALWAYS have a plug with a reset button, like a hair dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but he really shipped from China.  </li>
            <li> If it is REAL it will ALWAYS have a plug with a reset button, like a hair dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ordered straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much time</li>
            <li> : They both straighten really well...</li>
            <li> I did not purchase mine straight from amazon just one of the sellers on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this works wonders to make my hair straight</li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS: heats up incredibly fast; beeps to tell you when it&#x27;s ready, doesn&#x27;t fry your hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> and I purchased it straight from</li>
            <li> That is how you know whether you are getting the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it goes through, congrats you have a REAL GHD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over my hair to get it straight</li>
            <li> I also have really curly hair</li>
            <li> Thanks to my sister for recommending this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product it works very well with me</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews after purchasing the styler and people were saying it might not be real</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is a real GHD flatiron, but regardless, even if it is knock off, this flatiron does not straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> So turns out the straightener was real.</li>
            <li> I turn it on and in about 5 minuets am ready to start making passes.</li>
            <li> I believe that the products you use, including shampoo and conditioner, really impact a) the way you hair looks and feels after being styled, and b) the way the straightener works and reacts to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe that the products you use, including shampoo and conditioner, really impact a) the way you hair looks and feels after being styled, and b) the way the straightener works and reacts to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Everything on the iron looked like a real one.  </li>
            <li> * Heats up super-quickly (15-30 seconds, depending on room temperature), beeps gently when it&#x27;s ready, then blinks</li>
            <li> I have very think hair and the Revlon and Conair brands just weren&#x27;t cuttin&#x27; it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am a very trusting person, so am I with products I purchase online.</li>
            <li> A REAL GHD HAS ONE HOLOGRAPHIC CODE AND</li>
            <li> I had been eying it for years on Sephora, but could never shell out that much money.</li>
            <li> They take this very seriously.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received mine and registered it on the ghd site and it was real.</li>
            <li> and I wish I had spent the full amount on the real deal because I know from past experience how great the GHD products are.</li>
            <li> My hair also felt very silky and not damaged.  </li>
            <li> (I somehow doubt anything will ever compete with its predecessor on that front anyway), but it works like an absolute dream.</li>
            <li> Ready to go.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but seems to take a lot of time to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> It does indeed work, so that really is all that matters.</li>
            <li> and it seems also I am not using nearly as much heat.</li>
            <li> hope my sister likes this just as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 chi straighteners my whole life</li>
            <li> but this is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> whereas everything else I&#x27;ve read says the real ones are made in South Korea.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t stay straight.  </li>
            <li> Based on the comments here, I immediately went to the ghd website and registered it, and verified that it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> so I just returned it and had to pony up for the real deal</li>
            <li> I like soo much</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I used the blow dryer with a heat protectant and this iron got my hair bone straight AND shiny.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the Sultra, but it seemed too much like the others.</li>
            <li> I have always owned cheap hair straighteners as i only straighten my bangs.</li>
            <li> It works very well, heat up so fast</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> It looks real, but since I couldn&#x27;t register it, I will return it.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, and straightens hair without a problem.</li>
            <li> how much I&#x27;d payed and was told &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li> the hair very well..leaves a crease in the hair.  </li>
            <li> I will start by admitting that I really don&#x27;t do much with my hair.  </li>
            <li> after using the ghd styler, I think the reason I never did much with my hair is because I was always using substandard products.  </li>
            <li> very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up so fast, doesn&#x27;t damage hair and straightens like a dream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Seems like it could be a legal issue.</li>
            <li> , I decided that not much had changed over the last 7 years in the technology, but I thought I&#x27;d give the GHD and Sedu both a fair shot and compare them myself.</li>
            <li> As much as the GHD cost, I expected better results.</li>
            <li> But I chose to purchase one direct from amazon.com not one of the 3rd parties and it is authentic.  </li>
            <li> pay an extra $50 and get a real one!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll personally stick with this because it&#x27;s much healthier ok my hair than standard heat hot irons.</li>
            <li> I initially thought this was a copy, but it seems to be 100% original.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always use a cheap conair flat iron ..</li>
            <li> It works better than any other my wife has used.</li>
            <li> I was worried per the other reviews, but I received my GHD and was able to register it on the GHD website.</li>
            <li> Better than any other iron I have used before.</li>
            <li> Much better than other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> and it gets dry, tangled, and damaged easily..</li>
            <li> so now&lt;br /&gt;she can have both with minimal fuss and without destroying her beautiful locks.</li>
            <li> In fact, I left it on too long (as my own one takes forever to heat up) and it shut itself off.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend spending a little bit more for a stellar product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this because it makes my styling time next to nothing now instead of constantly going over the same area repeatedly like with a cheap iron.</li>
            <li> and I liked it, but it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The 90 degree cord swivels and makes use really easy not only for home but also for professional use.  </li>
            <li> On one hand I love it because it&#x27;s so amazingly fast (10 seconds to heat, and less than 5 minutes between plugging it in and unplugging), but it flat-out damages my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, so most of the time I let it air dry</li>
            <li> The other thing that makes this extremely useful is how quickly it heats up and is ready to go.</li>
            <li> Also, it did not get near as hot as my Chi</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s naturally curly...and not in a pretty way...</li>
            <li> and I felt like I was going over my hair a lot more times than I do my Chi to get the desired end results (I have fine, thin, short-bobbed hair too.)</li>
            <li> it was brand new!</li>
            <li> Hopefully the new one will work!</li>
            <li> Was excited to try out my new ghd straightener last night, but as I took it out of the (admittedly flimsy and scratched) box</li>
            <li> will just make my bangs stiff and more dry, but the ghd has its way of making my hair look and feel even more hydrated than it is and very naturally silky.</li>
            <li> but this ghd flat iron definitely beats it in all aspect (which it better be since the price is 3x as much).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say my previous hair straightener was a Solia which is also one of the top hair straightener</li>
            <li> I love the Ghd Brand (I had a previous one)</li>
            <li> the irons gives a better curl on less greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I am able to straighten my hair in half the time it used to take me</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m replacing a real ghd (which only died when I used it abroad and the converter fried it), I decided the &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> Older models do not.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the classic GHD stylers, the box should be matte, not shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Style/Options: Both 1&amp;#34; (Sedu has more curved edges, which I find easier for curling the ends of my hair under); both heat up quickly (GHD was seriously 5 seconds</li>
            <li> I ordered it gift wrapped and so pleased i did, not only was the box and wrapping suburb, but disguised the contents resulting in a big surprise on  Christmas day.</li>
            <li> I decided to take my chances with this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; of the GHD Classic Styler.</li>
            <li> just received my ghd classic I-inch iron, looooooooove it.</li>
            <li> Classic Styler, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li> I just received my GHD classic sytler yesterday, and registered it on GHD&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> The ghd Classic 1-inch Styler uses ceramic plate technology which helps reduce breakage and damage to the hair because the ceramic can glide through your hair without pulling it.  </li>
            <li> They were the main vendor for this page when I ordered, but they&#x27;re not now, so it looks like it changes out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an older Chi styler that is wider</li>
            <li> Well, I found it with this GHD Classic Styler.</li>
            <li> The GHD iron is far superior to any other flat iron out there.  </li>
            <li> But the most Amazingly reduced the total time to half of the time which used to take with other straightener i have to straighten My Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cheap straighteners tend to loose their heat as you use them.  </li>
            <li> For now, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the GHD.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and will buy again if need be.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long so far, but this straightener has proved to be so much better than my old Con-Air Infiniti.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if long-term quality is important, save the $125 and purchase a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> I love how I only need to flat iron a section once</li>
            <li> Pay a little more and buy the straightener through GHD or one of its resellers.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much more I can say about this tragic hair straightener other than it, never turned on and must have been a fluke because GHD is normally awesome.</li>
            <li> (The models available in the U.S. after the Pure and Dark models came out include holograms.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The GHD Dark and Pure stylers are now available in the US and there are a ton of fakes on ebay now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The GHD Dark and Pure stylers are now available in the US and there are a ton of fakes on ebay now.  </li>
            <li> Real GHD stylers have very strong, thick boxes.  </li>
            <li> i was really nervous in buying a new ghd (previous one broke on me after using it for a good 3+ years and treating it not very caringly)</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy a new one if the older one would \\&quot;die\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s old and ready to be replaced.</li>
            <li> As far as the iron itself, it is a sturdy, quality iron that heats up lightning fast.</li>
            <li> lot of complaints for the GHD was that people kept getting FAKE non legit ones, I am happy to say I received a legit GHD and you can too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing that it had great reviews and hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t receive a fake like some others had reported in their reviews.</li>
            <li> It heats up so fast and leaves hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Real GHD&#x27;s sensor lights are clear but will flash red when ready to use and make a funny beep.  </li>
            <li> is only about an inch long; however, I am sure my wife will use it after she gets it as a Christmas present.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are worth the price, cheaper than in Aus, and they last forever.</li>
            <li> healthy hair is your priority, choose this over any low-end, unevenly heated, bare-metal straightener.</li>
            <li> Most of them costed as much, if not more as this did.</li>
            <li> I am definitely hooked - definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will last long.</li>
            <li> Normal wear and tear prompted to replace my GHD.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of advice from friends I decided to buy a GHD style as opposed to other (cheaper) brands, it was definitely the right decision - it heats up super fast and works really well.</li>
            <li> Although, they are selling a red version on their own website today for slightly less.  </li>
            <li> The weight is amazingly light, it&#x27;s thin, easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t fatigue my wrist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first GHD, when first using it my hair was 80 percent dry</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure their other products are good, but fake GHDs are just everywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend getting a heat pouch (so you can put it away in, for example, a suitcase right after using it)</li>
            <li> although to be clear, this is a full sized flat iron, so it will take up space in your bag).  </li>
            <li> Given how quickly it heats up, that wouldn&#x27;t be a bother if you happened to step away too long</li>
            <li> Except maybe for professionals, I&#x27;m not sure that the significant cost difference (over $100) is worth the additional safety features.</li>
            <li> They said the hologram and other numbers have been copied and even if their website accepts the product code it done NOT indicate that the product is genuine.  </li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new straightener</li>
            <li> I decided to take the plunge and try something new.</li>
            <li> Just bought a new GHD straightener.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying the new one</li>
            <li> (I live in the South-</li>
            <li> I will continue to cry on the inside until my new GHD comes in.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really live up to the hype but the hype was overinflated</li>
            <li> and it was time for a new flatiron.</li>
            <li> I bought a new BabyLiss</li>
            <li> /&gt;We returned this and ordered a new from the manufacturer’s website</li>
            <li> Definitely thought it was genuine for a week till I did further digging.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this item from a salon for 2x the price and loved it before it finally died 2 years later.</li>
            <li> you will never go back to any other brand, they are so fine!</li>
            <li> It is not as big yet in America, which I found strange, but I think its because of all the other brands that were so good that are now not</li>
            <li> I registered the flat iron right away</li>
            <li> hair is the softest it has ever been, and it feels very natural and flowy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use once you practice and only 15 minutes for really long hair.</li>
            <li> Curling is easy too, whether you go for tight curls or wavy</li>
            <li> This straightener did not have a reset button on the plug, and had many more of the &#x27;give-aways&#x27; that it was a fake!</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with it is that it does not have a temperature control on it, so it was too hot to use on color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about whether it is an original product because of where it was made.  </li>
            <li> Heats up in an instant and stays hot until I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Be aware that an adaptor may be required for use outside of United Kingdom.\\</li>
            <li> I purchased this GHD Styler as a gift for my wife, replacing a pretty generic model.</li>
            <li> Maybe that is why so many people have received fakes, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> They last about 2 years before they start getting glitchy or getting too hot</li>
            <li> The GHD and Sedu are the exact same thing to me.</li>
            <li> the Iron:&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING, Night and day with the old one!</li>
            <li> Never seemed to get hot enough.</li>
            <li> and I had hear from a few people that GHD makes a really nice flat iron.</li>
            <li> The GHD styler DVD should have a number code and barcode on the back (compare it to the back of a DVD movie you own, they should look the same on the back).  </li>
            <li> I replaced my old herstyler with my new ghd</li>
            <li> it must be a knockoff&amp;#34; as they are nearly three times the price here in New Zealand</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I love this flat iron, which seems to work extremely well.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about people not getting an authentic GHD flat iron; I contacted my niece who bought one for my sister at the retail outlet Sephora, and asked her to send me the sku number off the box.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used a flat iron.</li>
            <li> There is a much more conistent temperature across the plates which means you are going over the same area fewer times causing less damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A quick run through You Tube and you can see all of the different styling options easily enough anyway.</li>
            <li> I received it and used it a few times and it was taking me twice as long to straighten my hair because I had to go over it so many times because it didn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the CHI apparently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a different pro straightener, and was certain nothing could compare.</li>
            <li> Real GHD stylers have domed screws, not flat headed screws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is an amazing iron without any unnecessary frills.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up well, clearly, and still works, but it just doesn&#x27;t heat like it used to, and its time has been up for a while now.</li>
            <li> Saving $50 off retail may seem like a great bargain, but it&#x27;s a total ripoff if you&#x27;re paying for a fake that won&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> In fact, when i went to register my iron, I clicked the help link for the date code and the example label had \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; clear as day on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many people gave negative reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> So just go from amazon/ghdprofessional directly</li>
            <li> A real GHD should be sealed from the outside.  </li>
            <li> only wanted to post this review to say I had a concern that the product might be a knockoff (even though it was coming straight from Amazon), but I registered it with ghd</li>
            <li> I got my GHD directly from Sephora</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both SO much better than the cheaper brands I&#x27;ve tried (recently also tried the HSI which got terrific reviews, but there&#x27;s really no comparison to these two...</li>
            <li> Just like my old one.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair stay straight, through the night and into the next day.  </li>
            <li> Amazon should do a better job of screening 3rd party sellers especially after numerous complaints such as this.  </li>
            <li> complaints so far.</li>
            <li> now it is completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the cord.</li>
            <li> Review done by a 25+ year professional hair stylist (my wife).  </li>
            <li> In a word, wow. I didn&#x27;t think it would, but this ghd straightener blew away.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had nothing negative to say about the styler &amp; is pleased with its handling &amp; durability.</li>
            <li> Literally only takes seconds to heat up and beeps when ready.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to straighten my hair and it does not stay as straight later into the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Returned them, and ordered a pair direct from the GHDs website</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the excess moisture completely evaporates and leaves the natural oil&#x27;s in my hair.</li>
            <li> After reading all the cautionary tales about fakes I ordered this gift for my wife directly from Amazon to avoid the problem of unscrupulous sellers.</li>
            <li> It takes several passes to achieve any straightening and even then my hair doesn&#x27;t get that straight</li>
            <li> It heated almost instantly, sounding a chime when it was ready to use.</li>
            <li> did not order directly from Amazon b/c</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that about my old one ...  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to purchase it directly from Amazon.com (sold and ships by).  </li>
            <li> i called GHD directly and they told me there was NO WAY TO AUTHENTICATE this product unless i mailed it directly to them for inspection.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally curly</li>
            <li> Both times I took the advice to go to &#x27;buying options&#x27; and to ensure you are getting it direct from Amazon...  </li>
            <li> but it just did not feel like my old CHI.</li>
            <li> love that it takes only a few seconds to heat up.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> absolutely worth what i spent on it.</li>
            <li> Plus I love how it sleeps if you leave it on too long so that it won&#x27;t burn your house down.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t cool down.  </li>
            <li> After 30 minutes it starts to cool down.  </li>
            <li> Last but not least, it straightens just in 1-2 strokes and it lasts!</li>
            <li> I purchased the ghd flat iron more than a month ago and used a few times.</li>
            <li> , a real GHD styler will have two microchips, one on each side by each flat iron plate.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair much shinier than my lower end flat iron (about $30 range).  </li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long curly hair and of coarse wants straight hair -</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how it glided so easily throughout my hair and left my thick, wavy hair pin straight after 1 pass, instead of 3 or 4 (or 5) like my old straightener.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hard to straighten and curl hair and it works perfect on me plus on my mom with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> It was fine for a month or two, then I got lazy about straightening out my hair and took a break.</li>
            <li> The iron does not get hot enough to straighten even my short hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the GHD classic styler at Costco, but it is the same model as this one.</li>
            <li> Main Reason to Buy this Straighter is to use it In India while traveling as it supports international Voltage.</li>
            <li> Australian hairdresser first recommended GHD to me, and now my American hairdresser also recommended it to me - as it is what she uses in the salon and at home</li>
            <li> It took me less time to straighten my hair with this GHD than with my T3 (since my T3 often needs some quick touch-ups).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It features universal voltage so that it provides consistent heat even when traveling (you must provide the international adaptor).</li>
            <li> I recently just had a funeral for my GHD classic 1 inch hair straightener after one of the blades stopped heating.</li>
            <li> The price was so good, I was really doubtful it would be a true GHD.  </li>
            <li> Dry or damaged hair has positive ions.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my older chi flat iron...which finally gave out after 6 years of daily use.</li>
            <li> and it is a litle bit different, seems to weigh a litle bit less and has a sound effect when it is turned on.  </li>
            <li> I tried it once and while it heats up super fast, I had to run it through my hair 5 times to straighten my shoulder length, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> took my wife twice as long to get ready and fix her hair with this one</li>
            <li> so I could use it to curl my long a** hair without using a straight iron and a curling iron..</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheap straighteners in the past when i sued to straighten all my hair and they lasted a couple of years.</li>
            <li> It is in working order but I am not sure if it is genuine.</li>
            <li> FOR THE HOT PINK GHD STYLER:  </li>
            <li> HOT PINK GHD STYLERS should come with a card inside of the wrap and roll bag that says &amp;</li>
            <li> recently got fringe bangs and normal drugstore straighteners</li>
            <li> I have just purchased crappy fake products online (not amazon) before and was more confident in folica.com this time round.</li>
            <li> Not that this flat iron is a bad choice, but my Sedu is my all time favorite and rated 5+++++++ stars and more.zz, static electricity and flyaways.</li>
            <li> Not that this flat iron is a bad choice, but my Sedu is my all time favorite and rated 5+++++++ stars and more.</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten my hair in far less time than my previous straightener</li>
            <li> The big difference is that the GHD would catch and pull on my hair a bit...not much, but enough to where I have to think about it.  </li>
            <li> The big difference is that the GHD would catch and pull on my hair a bit...not much, but enough to where I have to think about it.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, my father african american and my mother is hispanic...</li>
            <li> With my old straightener (a Remington Wet 2 Straight) I&#x27;d have to put it on the highest setting to get any results.</li>
            <li> It also maintains an even temperature throughout the plates with no cold spots which means less passing on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I love this styler, and my only complaint is that it is a bit clunky to hold.</li>
            <li> I finally bought this after my old hair straightener nearly caused an electrical fire when the wires frayed.  </li>
            <li> We knew how good Amazon&#x27;s return policy was so, we ordered it knowing that we may possibly be buying a fake.</li>
            <li> the main page for this product seems to rotate between several vendors, not all of them trustworthy, and right now I have to check the little &amp;#34;More Buying Choices&amp;#34; sidebar to find the one sold by Amazon itself.</li>
            <li> First off, I have no idea what other people are talking about on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have had mine for a year now, and I have no regrets!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t straightened my hair in years, so I finally decided it was time to buck up the necessary cash for a decent one.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking for a simple but high quality straightener.</li>
            <li> Apparently they don&#x27;t use spell</li>
            <li> With naturally curly (read frizzy) hair this miracle device is now my daily companion.</li>
            <li> : GHD has a rougher feeling exterior, the same as my old Sedu, which would attract dirt and hairspray like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li> The ghd offers only one option and that is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It worked for a year then developed a short in the swivel cord.  </li>
            <li> There were numerous times when she&#x27;d forget to turn off her old styler, but with this GHD, there&#x27;s never a worry, since it turns itself off.</li>
            <li> I leave the hair straightener on?&amp;#34; is my personal equivalent of the old &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li> I leave the hair straightener on?&amp;#34; is my personal equivalent of the old &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li> But, it was coming directly from Amazon, not just fulfilled or a third party, so</li>
            <li> I just retired my 6 year old CHI and initially got a CHI replacement</li>
            <li> hair looks so healthy after I straighten with the GHD, rather than all broken with flyaways like cheaper straighteners</li>
            <li> my hair looks so healthy after I straighten with the GHD, rather than all broken with flyaways like cheaper straighteners  </li>
            <li> i have curly/wavy medium thick hair and it makes my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had $20.00 flat irons that have lasted longer, so for this price and the short life that it had, I would not recommend the GHD Classic styler.</li>
            <li> The GHD Classic is a basic home use flat iron.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot really fast and straightens my crazy curly har.</li>
            <li> I thought all flat iron are the same $30 vs $200, both has ironic place and same size..</li>
            <li> I love their appliances and have never had a single complaint.</li>
            <li> One of the fake GHD stylers that I received (a hot pink one) had two different shades of hot pink on the top of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18.  </li>
            <li> Had a problem registering it on the website the first time, only due to their site being temporarily under maintenance.</li>
            <li> so it is most likely fake, making the price tag way too high.</li>
            <li> and they are much hotter than any other styler I have used.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my GHD flat iron that was 4 years old.  </li>
            <li> have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and this flattening iron did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick with a slight wave, especially in the back, I was pleasantly surprised at what a good job this straightener does on my hair, I don&#x27;t have to go back and</li>
            <li> When the electrical element finally started getting a little spotty (it would still turn on, I just had to mess with the On button a bit), I decided to see what else was out there after so many years.  </li>
            <li> Second, it&#x27;s very light so for a person with thick hair like me &amp; usually takes forever to smooth out all my hair, it&#x27;s less tiring.</li>
            <li> The only thing is you might want to buy a separate heatproof bag for this as it didn&#x27;t come with one, and ensure you aren&#x27;t buying it from a third party but from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> I used my GHD every day and I dropped it religiously and it has lasted much longer than expected.</li>
            <li> (Some of the newer models after the Pure and Dark have two holes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Does not apply to Dark or Pure since they have not been released in the US yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20.  </li>
            <li> It was a little tricky at first, because I was using it a way that I never used a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has recently started making a hissing, crackling sound when I move it a certain way, which causes it to turn on and off by itself.</li>
            <li> The heat is always consistent no matter if my hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> GHDs are not exactly the same as my previous (genuine) ones</li>
            <li> My ends don&#x27;t feel all frazzled like they do when I use cheaper straighteners, and I can get pretty substantial waves out in a single pass with minimal styling product.</li>
            <li> It was obvious that the product has been used before, the packaging of the product was ripped, the box old and used and the procuct codes on the GHD flat iron were not matching.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My mother and younger sister have the same GHD that I used and is currently four years old too and is still working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big supporter of what isn&#x27;t broken doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced, but with how well this one worked, and how silky smooth my hair feels now compared to my old straightener, I am now shopping around to replace it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there would be that much difference between the ghb and my other pricier straightener, but there is and I am not a ghb girl all the way!</li>
            <li> I bought it about a year and a half ago and it had been working really well.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair dry, but soft.</li>
            <li> It is ready really quickly (less than 20 seconds) and straightens</li>
            <li> She told me that she feels this only works a little better than the $20 ones I have bought her in the past.  </li>
            <li> - it has no temperature controls, so apparently it&#x27;s BAKING my hair in no time flat.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and have so many issues with my previous CHI pulling my hair out.  </li>
            <li> Real GHD stylers (applies to Hot Pink only) have a solid pink cord, the cord does NOT have a black ring where it meets the back of the styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> I was little concerned as some people mentioned getting fakes, but this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> The customer service representative said that registration was \\&quot;just for marketing purposes.\\&quot; Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was, spend a little bit of extra money to get the real thing.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and I can style my long, thick hair in less time than I could with a curling iron or the CHI that I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were plenty of good reviews too, but the bad reviews scared me.</li>
            <li> Sure the less expensive ones work, just not as quickly and typically others do not work anywhere in the world: this one does.</li>
            <li> It felt so slick and smooth as I pulled it down my hair that I wondered if it even made contact.</li>
            <li> Hot pink GHD&#x27;s should have black writing, not white writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought a CROC, which was better, but still wouldn&#x27;t tame my thick, coarse hair without being on the 450 degree setting, which made me nervous.  </li>
            <li> When tourmaline is heated, it can produce more negative ions than plain ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> live in Australia and the only thing other expence was an adapter!</li>
            <li> We have over 6 different flat iron similar to this.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a GHD flat iron last October for personal use.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moA6I4BBT0VV81]]In the attached video I explain how to register your flat iron and check for authenticity that you are actually receiving an actual ghd product.  </li>
            <li> have long (almost to my elbows) thin, fine, coloured and highlighted, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered it directly from Amzn, not one of the other sellers here.</li>
            <li> not one my other pricey straightener offers.</li>
            <li> I was told by my stylist to get this flat iron because my Chi was totally worn out.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t possible to register my GHD flat iron purchased from an Amazon reseller with the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It produced the same results as my $40.00 flat iron.</li>
            <li> So I cap myself at only 2 uses between haircuts, but for the days I need a flat iron, wow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my third GHD flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous brands of flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these previously for 3 years and it died so I purchased a new one.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy from those who have usually more then 1000 reviews and score at least a 97%.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I am half Puerto Rican with very naturally curly hair and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> The only differences are that the ghd Classic 1-inch Styler has a longer cord with a built-in gfci device and remote test/reset unit and is about an inch and a half longer, which puts your hand further from the heat.</li>
            <li> In summary, this model and brand of hair straightener heats up and straightens no better than a much cheaper model but does seem safer from an electrical/heat standpoint.</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron after my Chi stopped working</li>
            <li> I blew out my GHD flat iron when I was in Europe.  </li>
            <li> so I have to buy another flat iron.</li>
            <li> She has had hers for years so they must last a long time.</li>
            <li> so I need a high-quality flat iron that won&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li> It got my hair flat AND shiny.</li>
            <li> This flat iron blew my mind.  </li>
            <li> After living in Australia and going to a salon there that used a Ghd flat iron on my hair</li>
            <li> I have owned a ghd flat iron for about 3years.  </li>
            <li> and then I flat iron.  </li>
            <li> now just have to see how long this machine would last !!!!  </li>
            <li> The Bentley of Ceramic Flat Irons.  </li>
            <li> I just received my flat iron and went to the GHD site.</li>
            <li> I registered the flat iron with no problem</li>
            <li> NEVER purchasing a GHD flat iron from Amazon or this vendor listed again.</li>
            <li> * Do an internet search and watch the video for &amp;#34;ghd flat iron</li>
            <li> ; This is important--many videos will tell you to start at the end and roll up, but with the super-high temps of this flat iron, it will fry your ends to crisps.</li>
            <li> 7/21/14 - I purchased this flat iron on May 25, 2013.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> It will work well with short or long hair.</li>
            <li> let me discuss about the benefits of the flat iron itself.  </li>
            <li> That is why I give this flat iron four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> I prefer a flat iron that has BOTH ceramic and tourmaline technology like the Sedu Pro Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> That is why I give this flat iron four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> I prefer a flat iron that has BOTH ceramic and tourmaline technology like the Sedu Pro Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> Silky hair and doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat</li>
            <li> Long story short...</li>
            <li> I chase my flat brush with the iron</li>
            <li> I need another suggested flat iron.</li>
            <li> I asked her advise on a flat iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 3.5 years now</li>
            <li> Features automatic shut off and extra long 9 ft cord too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality flat iron all around.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly horse-like hair, and this thing makes it pretty.</li>
            <li> I do not use my flat iron daily and expected it to last a couple of years not a couple of months.</li>
            <li> and I mean HOT</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
            <li> When you use the ghd Ceramic Flat Iron you are applying negative to positive so you counteracting and balancing the condition of your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with natural hair</li>
            <li> There is not a temperature setting and it left my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (recently also tried the HSI which got terrific reviews, but there&#x27;s really no comparison to these two...</li>
            <li> They said that does not mean it&#x27;s not authentic, just that I did not buy it from an approved dealer.</li>
            <li> Now, nine months later, after very little use it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> It just looked &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34; Sadly, my suspicions were confirmed.</li>
            <li> Strangely, it does not come with the box or the DVD, but otherwise matches the descriptions from others.</li>
            <li> So you dont have to let it heat up for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used the old one everyday (sometimes 2x a day) for 12 years</li>
            <li> I have long curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to invest in this product.  </li>
            <li> and I have LONG hair(down to my waist).  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had it that long.  </li>
            <li> I was quite surprised to see so many negative reviews stating that they received a fake product.</li>
            <li> if used for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> and I like the long cord</li>
            <li> And there was a strange beeping that seemed like a faulty electronic problem.</li>
            <li> Straightening my hair goes a long way in avoiding that look.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well for her long &amp; thick hair.</li>
            <li> The straightener that I usually use is manufactured by a popular company (starts with an R) and cost a mere $22.</li>
            <li> I watched the price here and when it dipped down low enough, I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it was much less expensive on Amazon than from an authentic GHD dealer.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a basic Chi for about 4 years until it recently stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It is so slick that it is almost too slick, the hair slide through really quickly.</li>
            <li> This iron heats the plates differently than other irons.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was really excited to find it for a discounted price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I hope this lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works in different countries with other voltage</li>
            <li> cord very long</li>
            <li> So I got them both, let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> and once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> So if you curly or dry hair don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> Now I can just re-straighten it dry</li>
            <li> In turn, I got tons of split ends, and my hair looked dry, frizzy, and damaged.</li>
            <li> and I never even blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> She was immediately disappointed that it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the one she had tried (or even as well as her old, cheap flat iron).  </li>
            <li> I can now style my long hair in half the time it formerly took.</li>
            <li> If you have delicate hair and would normally use a lower temp to straighten, you can&#x27;t with this one.  </li>
            <li> Would not buy any other brand of flat iron.</li>
            <li> Normally I do not write reviews but this time I am so upset...</li>
            <li> No more need for pricey keratin treatments to smooth my thick unruly mane!</li>
            <li> THE HANDLE IS LOOSE AND MAKES ME WONDER</li>
            <li> I have very tightly coiled, african american hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very long (9 foot!)</li>
            <li> I guess that explains the mixed reviews from previous buyers.</li>
            <li> The quality is substantially less than my last GHD</li>
            <li> I think that the differences between this, more expensive brand, and the one I usually use, are insignificant.</li>
            <li> It not only took so long to straighten my hair but also my hair felt always dull and frizzy and the next day it was a a fuzzy ball!!</li>
            <li> Because I have curly hair it usually takes me 40 mins to flat iron my hair but now with the Ghd styler it only takes about 25 mins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the cheaper flat irons and have gotten exactly what I paid for ... NOT what my poor hair deserves!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a fake, and did my hair for the first time this morning with it, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!  </li>
            <li> I finally had to take a picture of it with my phone and enlarge it a little</li>
            <li> Paid much less than other stores that are selling it (over $200 at Sephora), definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Real GHD stylers come with two booklets, some fake stylers only have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The return date is too late, so I&#x27;ll only get part of my money back for a hair straightener I payed over $100 for.</li>
            <li> I spent scraping caked on hairspray off of it.  </li>
            <li> Build quality is solid, but it isn&#x27;t overly heavy.</li>
            <li> it confused me, so I just jumped on over to folica.com and got 20% off - it was more expensive than amazon but definitely cheaper than home or shops here.</li>
            <li> it confused me, so I just jumped on over to folica.com and got 20% off - it was more expensive than amazon but definitely cheaper than home or shops here.</li>
            <li> I should have done that before saving myself shipping cost and trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful with what you can get on this platform.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is the option to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive but, when considering the health of your hair, it is entirely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had my GHD for a few days now, so I can&#x27;t attest to its longevity</li>
            <li> I have naturally fairly straight hair too, so I would think it would be worse for someone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed there wasn&#x27;t one wet patch of hair on my head</li>
            <li> When I received it, the seal was broken and the straightener looked much cheaper than the GHD products I have been used to.</li>
            <li> It was on sale a few weeks ago on the website for almost the same price, and i wish I had gotten it.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few months to report on it&#x27;s durability after regular use.</li>
            <li> If this one is a fake, at least I was able to register it with non problem and will get a guaranteed &amp;#34;from ghd&amp;#34; as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> And, the flat iron beats CHI, Hot Tools and those other crap flat irons that only for last 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have bought my daughter MULTIPLE other straighteners over the years--she is biracial and her hair is a little &amp;#34;poofy.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> (if I had gotten the black Sedu, it would have been $178, but I actually like this dark</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it&#x27;s hard to set it on the counter like it shows in the picture, because the black part is so rounded that it wants to fall over.  </li>
            <li> you can take the risk of possibly getting a fake, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used GHD straighteners for at least 10 years and my previous ones died of old age!</li>
            <li> It does not smooth it out like other flat irons I have used.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about ordering this flat iron due to rumors I had heard that it may be an imitation.</li>
            <li> The GHD did sort of straighten it, but it also left my hair dry, brittle, and dull looking.</li>
            <li> Fake GHD&#x27;s sometimes do not flash red or are solid red, not clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> According to the other viewers, don&#x27;t buy GHD from anyone other than \\&quot;AMAZON LLC\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> looked at CHI, HSI, BaByliss, all the straighteners on Amazon and other websites.</li>
            <li> should have read all the other posts before buying</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because i did my research and knew that fakes wee being sold.</li>
            <li> I spent on it!</li>
            <li> My styler seems to be legitimate and has the shiny sticker and seems to be correct in all other ways.</li>
            <li> and also it doesn&#x27;t seem to create the breakage or damage other straighteners cause.</li>
            <li> However the difference between this one and all the other ones I&#x27;ve had is that I didn&#x27;t have build up in my hair after straightening.</li>
            <li> It heat up in seconds and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair like other irons can.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever consider buying any other brand of hair straighteners.  </li>
            <li> Other people have covered what the ghd styler can do, so I won&#x27;t go into it.  </li>
            <li> I was scared to buy this iron because of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Other sellers....</li>
            <li> The texture of the plastic did not feel like the other HHS stylets I&#x27;ve had, and it did not work as well.</li>
            <li> wife who owns a GHD and refuse to go with any other band looked at this order and said it is fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was happy when I received my GHD but very disappointed that the code to register on the website was missing.</li>
            <li> If the price had been a lot less, I would have expected what I received...</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m back to using my old Chi again.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Chi flat iron for the past 9 years.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was not able to be registered therefore I returned it.  </li>
            <li> poor girls have no idea how to formulate a sentence and flat iron at the same time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> adjustment and other frills will somehow be less damaging.</li>
            <li> The styler it self is a little heavy to hold up for long periods, so just be warned about that</li>
            <li> They are actually on the label inside of the iron by the power switch and hard to read.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I thought it was fake and printed the return label immediately (thanks Amazon!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very well disguised fake.</li>
            <li> I was stung once buying some fake GHDs online, but these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE RISK OF FIRE OR BURNS and the cost of an inferior product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I wrote this review that there was a controversy over fake ghd stylers, but I just registered mine and it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> i have naturally wavy, thin hair</li>
            <li> this helps other buyers!</li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous from what other reviewers said.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through two quality flat irons in the past few years.</li>
            <li> I was worried about this product after reading several reviews stating that this flat iron was a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; or \\&quot;not actually a genuine ghd\\&quot;, but because the price was so much less on Amazon versus Trade Secret, Nordstrom,</li>
            <li> i can not use due to the power plug not fit any power outlet.</li>
            <li> I have course thick hair and this flat iron</li>
            <li> My wife had previously bought this from one of the sellers here, and that turned out to be counterfeit.</li>
            <li> what my CHI did in a half hour.  </li>
            <li> Mine are black (the picture shows cream).</li>
            <li> unfortunately 10 days back all of a sudden whn a i connect to power outlet it started giving me continuous beap sounds and did not heat the iron.</li>
            <li> For styling black hair.</li>
            <li> I had my previous one for 11 years.</li>
            <li> can straighten my hair perfectly in less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;it automatically switches off within thirty minutes if it remains unattended&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair perfectly in less than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Turn it on, and it beeps, and then, in under half a minute, it beeps again twice, signaling it is ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> you leave it sitting and forget to turn it off, it shuts off automatically after half an hour.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this straightener, despite being nervous about the potential of it being fake.</li>
            <li> Purchased from this seller and was a bit concerned from previous reviews about it being &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> (my Chi is slightly flattened)</li>
            <li> There are less expensive stylers, but if you use one everyday, you want one that works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this is that I am wanting to straighten my hair everyday, haha.</li>
            <li> Have loved this product in the past, but am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Save up a little longer and get this instead of HSI (which is also less compact)</li>
            <li> This website makes the irons look very real but its FAKE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fake or real but</li>
            <li> This straightener broke a little after a year, I spoke with GHD and they do have a two year warranty, but won&#x27;t honor it because Amazon and its sellers are not considered certified resellers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, when you receive it, to test its authenticity sign up for its warranty from the little paper they give you included.</li>
            <li> re-do any sections and with a little product my style holds all day.</li>
            <li> It cuts down my hair prep time by half if not more.</li>
            <li> so I do not burn my house down!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough or if it doesn&#x27;t clamp on the hair enough to, but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have had this for quite a few months now</li>
            <li> like in a frizzy, wild, scary way) and then used one on each side.</li>
            <li> Since I use it everyday, it will probably have to be replaced soon.</li>
            <li> , this is not cheap.</li>
            <li> By attempting to do this is how I found out mine was a fake, and by also calling GHD directly after doing so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, what is missing?  </li>
            <li> But when she went to register it, she found that the hologram sticker that was supposed to have the serial number printed on it was missing.  </li>
            <li> I was scared when ordering this product because I read a few reviews about people receiving knock offs of the GHD.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that can be difficult to straighten</li>
            <li> Product received was not genuine, therefore could not be used.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product at all, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Takes less than a minute I swear!</li>
            <li> I have an unhealthy relationship with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> If you have thick long hair like me get the bigger inch flatiron, but I was not impressed at all with the the GHD or the Sedu.</li>
            <li> Some fake GHD stylers have black and white pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> medium length, coarse, thick, dirty blonde with highlights</li>
            <li> Just had my very long, very thick hair cut today, and they finished it with this straightener.</li>
            <li> The female snap on the bag should have little stars, the fake ones DO NOT.  </li>
            <li> (that was my biggest complaint about my previous Solia,)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon doesn&#x27;t have better control over its supply chain.</li>
            <li> The fake GHD DVD&#x27;s say DVD R really small on the back of the DVD towards the center, sometimes it is very hard to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes it a little irritating when I&#x27;m styling and have to put the iron down to straighten out the cord.</li>
            <li> Definitely was a FAKE.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure, so</li>
            <li> The fake ones have a Chinese company</li>
            <li> The fake ones only have one (if it even works!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one run over a section of my scary curls totally smooths them out.</li>
            <li> I crossed my fingers that I wouldn&#x27;t receive a fake, after reading several reviews from people who had received fakes, but no luck.  </li>
            <li> My Husband bought this for me as I was still using my expensive Australian straightener here in the states.</li>
            <li> I am usually an unlucky one with products turning crappy.</li>
            <li> I am not able to register it.</li>
            <li> The next one I bought turned out to be a fake.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical after reading mixed reviews and warnings about receiving fakes.</li>
            <li> I had this small hope that it would be under the straightener, so I took apart the box ...</li>
            <li> feels like the quality you&#x27;d expect from something that usually retails for almost twice what you&#x27;ll pay for one here, so</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> NOT AUTHENTIC ghd&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> In the past I have been ripped off before when trying to buy this straightener</li>
            <li> It heats up in just a few seconds and it smoothes my hair with ease!  </li>
            <li> I guess it doesn&#x27;t hurt for it to lay on its side since there is a small gap between the plate and the edge of the styler</li>
            <li> The GHD straightener is not ideal for course hair, naturally dry hair, or curly hair in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After reading all the stuff about fake ghd flat irons, I panicked and registered mine online.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE FAKE FLAT IRONS</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not very good at it!)&lt;br /&gt;Temperature is automatically controlled so the heat distributes evenly on the surface of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> this product is so much more expensive here than in the USA, so I was afraid of the fake items sold throught the Internet.</li>
            <li> however if you leave it on for awhile, it continuously beeps which is pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> If you order from Amazon, LLC you will not be disappointed, but be careful of “fulfilled” or “third party”.  </li>
            <li> You definitely need PRACTICE if you&#x27;re wanting waves--the first couple of times I tried it, it looked like a bad, bad trailer park perm.</li>
            <li> Fake GHD stylers often come with the seal loose on the inside of the box.  </li>
            <li> so its hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase through Amazon b/c of a few scary reviews that people had received fakes.  </li>
            <li> He always insists it is even though I&#x27;ve used the Chi at least 6 days a week for over 3 years.</li>
            <li> Ceramic produces negative ions.  </li>
            <li> The negative ions will make your hair smoother, silkier and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tourmaline also emits negative but has far-infrared heat.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I typed them in at least 3 times, and they kept saying they were not working.</li>
            <li> I thought just give it a shot, mentally prepared it might be fake.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and it gets the job done</li>
            <li> the way, I have thick, curly, and semi kinky hair.</li>
            <li> If you open up your styler (if all else fails!)</li>
            <li> actually bought her GHD&#x27;s from a salon, and they were still fake!  </li>
            <li> actually bought her GHD&#x27;s from a salon, and they were still fake!  </li>
            <li> This could mean a number of things...</li>
            <li> I mean, the cord was tangled and there weren&#x27;t even instructions in the box.</li>
            <li> I recommend this item to everybody who has a very messy and untameable hair like me!</li>
            <li> Fake GHD stylers often come with black scuffs on the body of the styler.  </li>
            <li> But because of the price I often settled for the less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I also found this product to be overpriced because I found it worked just as well as less expensive brand.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not very good at it!)  </li>
            <li> I had gone for years using mediocre flat irons not wanting to bite the bullet and just buy the expensive type.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical after reading reviews that some were fakes</li>
            <li> (I know, I know it is not good to straighten hair while damp)</li>
            <li> I was weary about buying this flat iron (i was afraid it was a fake).  </li>
            <li> Was not able to register this product on the manufacturer&#x27;s website, leading me to believe it was a fake.</li>
            <li> had high expectations and was disappointed by this product!</li>
            <li> have very thick, wavy, medium-length hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, that&#x27;s the secret.</li>
            <li> I have had it for years and it hasn&#x27;t broken or not heated to the max heat level once.  </li>
            <li> Hi i buy one but the ghd is broken</li>
            <li> This is much much worse than my $30 Walgreens no-name straightener.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I got tired of worrying about burning my hair</li>
            <li> Fake GHD stylers boxes often come beat up, dirty, and are slightly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was scared of all the horrible reviews each of these brands got - that they stopped working after a certain time, that they were fake, the ceramic plates started to chip etc.</li>
            <li> That unit went bad in less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary about buying this because of all the bad reviews about it being counterfeit.</li>
            <li> It is a bad product don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Very mad, I spent a lot of money on this.  </li>
            <li> SO IT MUST BE FAKE AND IM NOT VERY HAPPY!!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it is FAKE.  </li>
            <li> I received mine today and it took about 5 seconds to realize that it was fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After being burned TWICE on ebay on fake GHD stylers, I decided to tell you everything I know about how to spot</li>
            <li> A fake GHD won&#x27;t come with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One way you can always tell a fake is</li>
            <li> One way you can always tell a fake is</li>
            <li> When I was buying it here, I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is how you can tell if your GHD is a FAKE FAKE FAKE!&lt;br /&gt;-if</li>
            <li> is it fake or not.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that this might* be fake..</li>
            <li> With all the reviews, I was concerned about getting a fake.</li>
            <li> but I was weary of the possibility of a fake one.</li>
            <li> Expensive  </li>
            <li> but I was weary of the possibility of a fake one.</li>
            <li> We believe this item is fake and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> The increasing prevalence of fake electronics and clothing on Amazon is concerning.</li>
            <li> I just got my straightener yesterday and could tell it was a fake from the time I opened the box.</li>
            <li> This was a fake GHD.</li>
            <li> it is a fake.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t  twisted.</li>
            <li> Be wary.</li>
            <li> Mine was a fake, the site would not accept its serial number to register.</li>
            <li> Meh... not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Though i was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews, but couldn&#x27;t resist because of the price..</li>
            <li> These are fake, I got these as a Christmas presents, after 3 months theyve stopped working, tried to register them on the Ghd website, it said code wasnt known...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although some people said that this is fake</li>
            <li> I was nervous after reading some of the reviews that this maybe a fake.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else I was really afraid of getting a fake ghd product from here.</li>
            <li> I was in both cases afraid of it being a fake as some reviews stated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always pay through PayPal if you still have doubts so you are protected and don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for pictures from the seller to verify the plug, the DVD, or anything else</li>

            <li> Now it turns off all the time and make an annoying beeping noice and makes my hair look greasey and thin.</li>
            <li> One of the fake GHD stylers that I received had misspellings on the tag!  </li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really difficult to know when it is real or fake - I returned the product, got a refund and ordered from a licenced GHD dealer.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when reading the reviews on amazon....</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying a GHD iron because of the rumors about fakes.</li>
            <li> She said it had really bad heat loss</li>
            <li> and I wanted one so bad</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this has a reset button on the plug to keep the user from getting shocked while using.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I RECEIVED A FAKE.  </li>
            <li> so if you want, you can go to the ghd website and punch in the code to see if it is real or fake.</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPING IS STUPID.</li>
            <li> Even though I can return it (at Amazon&#x27;s expense), it&#x27;s still annoying and takes time out of my day that I could be doing something else.  </li>
            <li> It has a tendency to twist up and get annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m appalled Amazon allows knockoffs to be sold on it&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> i am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that Amazon is not verifying authenticity of the products they sell.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because others have said that it registered.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So many people gave negative reviews for this product. However, I bought directly from amazon/ghdprofessional, and I can register mine successfully. Also, after comparing with my old genuine styler, I know the new one is not fake. Don&#x27;t be bothered about on earth how many holes on the cord because both of my stylers have 2 holes. So just go from amazon/ghdprofessional directly and you can save a lot.</li>
            <li> my hair legit gets all the time very frizzy and never gets straight. this product is amazing, and i truly think it is the real GHD it heats up quick and my hair straight lasts a very long time. great for the price... totally worth getting.</li>
            <li> Heats up so fast and does a great job straightening my hair- I am not the most coordinated person and even I can use this.</li>
            <li> After a lot of advice from friends I decided to buy a GHD style as opposed to other (cheaper) brands, it was definitely the right decision - it heats up super fast and works really well. The Amazon price is fantastic and I successfully registered it on the GHD website, so it must be the real thing (not a fake). The only thing is you might want to buy a separate heatproof bag for this as it didn&#x27;t come with one, and ensure you aren&#x27;t buying it from a third party but from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this styler.  I have extremely thick hair and have so many issues with my previous CHI pulling my hair out.  The GHD does not pull at all.  Not only does it heat up SUPER quick, but it gives me a perfect do in no time!  A must buy!</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of the positive reviews of this product, so I thought I would try it. The iron does not get hot enough to straighten even my short hair. It does not smooth it out like other flat irons I have used. If the price had been a lot less, I would have expected what I received... but given the price - I expected this to work great. I have been using a Chi flat iron for the past 9 years. It&#x27;s old and ready to be replaced. Needless to say, I&#x27;m back to using my old Chi again. It works better than this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend purchasing this product unless you want to throw your money away.</li>
            <li> Definitely thought it was genuine for a week till I did further digging. Definitely was a FAKE. For peace of mind, don&#x27;t risk buying from here.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for at a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She researched the product and said it was the best one.  It heats up fast and straightness hair as promised.  She said it could  be used for curling hair also, although I don&#x27;t think she has figured that out yet</li>
            <li> Mine registered as genuine on the official website, however, the box says \\&quot;made in China\\&quot;and everyone insists real ghd&#x27;s are made in Korea. Also, it did not get near as hot as my Chi and I felt like I was going over my hair a lot more times than I do my Chi to get the desired end results (I have fine, thin, short-bobbed hair too.) I ask my hairdresser if my hair appears healthy every time I get a cut. He always insists it is even though I&#x27;ve used the Chi at least 6 days a week for over 3 years. Yes, my Chi is over 3 years old and still works as beautifully as the day I bought it. I am a flight attendant and a hair straightener is the only thing I didn&#x27;t have in duplicate for my suitcase. Since everyone raves over how much better ghd is than Chi I decided to get this miraculous straightener and truly have the \\&quot;best of the best\\&quot; for my busy work trips. Ultimately, it seems much more comparable to the Conair infiniti I had before my Chi. I&#x27;m confused. Perhaps, ghd makes some that are higher quality than others??? Chi lovers, order the fanciest ghd if you decide to make a switch. Perhaps, that&#x27;s the secret. I&#x27;m going to get another Chi.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter.  She loves it!  Her hair looks great.  She really loves the auto off function.  Amazon was great and had the product to me on time.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new straightener and when I was watching videos and reading reviews of this straightener, it seemed like one I would want, but I couldn&#x27;t find it for a really reasonable price. Then, I looked at Amazon and found it for about 110$! That was a great deal. So, I bought it and it came really fast. (It also came in a really cool box.) I haven&#x27;t been using it very long so far, but this straightener has proved to be so much better than my old Con-Air Infiniti. Best straightener ever!</li>
            <li> Loves how fast it heats up and great on long hair</li>
            <li> READ THIS:  Many people have written reviews that they love this product, and it might very well be a good styler.  Nonetheless, it is FAKE.  I bought mine two days ago, received it today and I could tell right away.  Because I&#x27;m replacing a real ghd (which only died when I used it abroad and the converter fried it), I decided the &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t worth it.  When it arrived, I thought it was fake and printed the return label immediately (thanks Amazon!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to save $50-$60, keep this iron; I hope it works for you.  On the other hand, if long-term quality is important, save the $125 and purchase a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Although the ghd website said to be cautious about buying from Amazon and, I tried to register what I had and received a confirmation email that it was legitimate.  Now I&#x27;m not sure, so good luck to all!!!</li>
            <li> I initially thought this was a copy, but it seems to be 100% original. Strangely, it does not come with the box or the DVD, but otherwise matches the descriptions from others. A quick run through You Tube and you can see all of the different styling options easily enough anyway. Have had this for quite a few months now and it still works good as new.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would allow one of their trusted sellers to sell fakes. I received mine today and it took about 5 seconds to realize that it was fake. I could not register it on the ghd website, and I came across the information below to help identify fakes. This straightener did not have a reset button on the plug, and had many more of the &#x27;give-aways&#x27; that it was a fake! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being burned TWICE on ebay on fake GHD stylers, I decided to tell you everything I know about how to spot a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Real GHD stylers have plugs with reset buttons, like you would find on a hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Real GHD stylers have one hole on the cord where it meets the body of the iron.  (Some of the newer models after the Pure and Dark have two holes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *  One of the fakes I bought had three holes and one didn&#x27;t have any... so make sure to look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Real GHD stylers (applies to Hot Pink only) have a solid pink cord, the cord does NOT have a black ring where it meets the back of the styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  When I contacted GHD of North America, I was told that North American GHD&#x27;s do NOT have holograms at all!  (The models available in the U.S. after the Pure and Dark models came out include holograms.  Older models do not.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Real GHD stylers say &amp;#34;Made in P.R.C.&amp;#34; on them or Korea.  They never say &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Real GHD stylers will NOT have a hook on the cord to hang up your styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  Real GHD stylers have domed screws, not flat headed screws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  The GHD styler DVD should have a number code and barcode on the back (compare it to the back of a DVD movie you own, they should look the same on the back).  The fake GHD DVD&#x27;s say DVD R really small on the back of the DVD towards the center, sometimes it is very hard to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.  The booklets that come with the GHD styler should have colored pictures.  Some fake GHD stylers have black and white pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10.  FOR THE HOT PINK GHD STYLER:  The female snap on the bag should have little stars, the fake ones DO NOT.  The fake ones have a Chinese company name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11.  If you open up your styler (if all else fails!), a real GHD styler will have two microchips, one on each side by each flat iron plate.  The fake ones only have one (if it even works!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12.  Real GHD stylers have very strong, thick boxes.  Fake GHD stylers boxes often come beat up, dirty, and are slightly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13.  Fake GHD stylers often come with black scuffs on the body of the styler.  They are not taken care of very well like a genuine GHD styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14.  Real GHD stylers come with two booklets, some fake stylers only have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15.  CHECK THE BOX AND TAGS!  One of the fake GHD stylers that I received had misspellings on the tag!  Apparently they don&#x27;t use spell check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16.  Real GHD stylers have a date code on the inside of the body of the styler.  It should have the year, month, then day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17. LOOK AT THE BOX:  One of the fake GHD stylers that I received (a hot pink one) had two different shades of hot pink on the top of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18.  HOT PINK GHD STYLERS should come with a card inside of the wrap and roll bag that says &amp;#34;Thou shalt surrender to pink&amp;#34;.  A fake GHD won&#x27;t come with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;19.  Fake GHD stylers often come with the seal loose on the inside of the box.  A real GHD should be sealed from the outside.  (Does not apply to Dark or Pure since they have not been released in the US yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20.  For the classic GHD stylers, the box should be matte, not shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;21.  Hot pink GHD&#x27;s should have black writing, not white writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;22.  Real GHD&#x27;s sensor lights are clear but will flash red when ready to use and make a funny beep.  Fake GHD&#x27;s sometimes do not flash red or are solid red, not clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE of sellers with LOW FEEDBACK!  Ask sellers questions about the 22 things I have pointed out above.  If they do not answer, don&#x27;t buy!  If they make excuses, don&#x27;t buy!  Also, some buyers who have been ripped off are trying to resell their GHD&#x27;s to cut their losses.  Watch for things like &amp;#34;I got it as a gift&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I recently cut my hair&amp;#34;.  One of the seller&#x27;s I purchased from was supposed to be shipping out of Georgia but he really shipped from China.  Don&#x27;t believe everything you read about a seller&#x27;s information.  They can lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the sellers I purchased from actually bought her GHD&#x27;s from a salon, and they were still fake!  If in doubt, only buy from an approved stockist.  You can find a list of approved stockists from GHD&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always pay through PayPal if you still have doubts so you are protected and don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for pictures from the seller to verify the plug, the DVD, or anything else you have questions on.  Always ask questions before buying and remember, if it looks too good to be true, IT PROBABLY IS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GHD Dark and Pure stylers are now available in the US and there are a ton of fakes on ebay now.  Always always ask about the plug.  One way you can always tell a fake is it will have a plug like a lamp.  If it is REAL it will ALWAYS have a plug with a reset button, like a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK!  I hope this keeps someone else from getting burned like I did!K!

            <li> This is the best flat iron that I have owned. I had a CHI and I liked it, but it didn&#x27;t last very long. I asked my stylist and she recommended GHD. This iron heats the plates differently than other irons. There is a much more conistent temperature across the plates which means you are going over the same area fewer times causing less damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair and this tool does a great job of making it absolutely straight. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have not used this item, nor will I given my hair is only about an inch long; however, I am sure my wife will use it after she gets it as a Christmas present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wanted to post this review to say I had a concern that the product might be a knockoff (even though it was coming straight from Amazon), but I registered it with ghd and it is a legit product.  I will update the review later when she uses it.  Hope this helps other buyers!</li>
            <li> Ordered straight from Amazon. Was able to register on ghd site! Love this straightner! Had a chi before but it broke after 5 years of having it and someone told me to try this and im glad i did!</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron after my Chi stopped working and I had hear from a few people that GHD makes a really nice flat iron. I decided to take the plunge and try something new. I received it and used it a few times and it was taking me twice as long to straighten my hair because I had to go over it so many times because it didn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the CHI apparently. My hair would also be wavy later in the day because it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job I guess. I returned it to Amazon for a refund and am getting a CHI that I know will do what is made for and what I pay $125 for!</li>
            <li> Purchased this straightener and I absolutely love it!  Gets my hair straight a lot faster than the cheap ones.  The cheap ones I had to go over and over my hair.  This one works much better, faster  &amp; gets my hair nice and smooth.  It also curls my hair well when I put a wave in it.  It may be pricey but worth it.  It also doesn&#x27;t cool down.  The cheap straighteners tend to loose their heat as you use them.  This one stays hot!</li>
            <li> I love this one, had one before, it broke, used another for about a year, glad to be back. Doesn&#x27;t overheat.</li>
            <li> I got my GHD directly from Sephora so I know its not fake, I wasnt that impressed. It left my hair kinda big. I&#x27;m black with natural hair so its hard to straighten. I did pretty much the same thing as my chi but maybe slightly less static and a tad bit more shine. But my favorite straightener by fair is my gold n hot ceramic flat iron that I got for like 30 bucks. This one is over priced and not that impressive. Took it back and got my $200 back</li>
            <li> With naturally curly (read frizzy) hair this miracle device is now my daily companion. Easy to use once you practice and only 15 minutes for really long hair.Buy it you will love it ... and then start receiving amazing compliments about your gorgeous straight hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sedu flat iron for the last 7 years and absolutely loved it.  Always worked great and never lost heat.  When the electrical element finally started getting a little spotty (it would still turn on, I just had to mess with the On button a bit), I decided to see what else was out there after so many years.  I have lots of friends with GHDs who love them, so I read a ton of reviews, watched some cute little teenagers trying to do comparisons for their 10 YouTube followers (I think those are hilarious...poor girls have no idea how to formulate a sentence and flat iron at the same time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I decided that not much had changed over the last 7 years in the technology, but I thought I&#x27;d give the GHD and Sedu both a fair shot and compare them myself. So I got them both, let my hair air dry (it&#x27;s naturally curly...and not in a pretty way...like in a frizzy, wild, scary way) and then used one on each side. Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  GHD $121, Sedu $100 (if I had gotten the black Sedu, it would have been $178, but I actually like this dark purple)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Material: GHD has a rougher feeling exterior, the same as my old Sedu, which would attract dirt and hairspray like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much time I spent scraping caked on hairspray off of it.  Anyway, the Diamond Sedu has a smoother exterior, which looks like it&#x27;ll be easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style/Options: Both 1&amp;#34; (Sedu has more curved edges, which I find easier for curling the ends of my hair under); both heat up quickly (GHD was seriously 5 seconds, Sedu was about 30...I can handle either of those times); both have an auto shut-off (Sedu just added that to this Diamond version), Sedu has a temp control where GHD doesn&#x27;t (it&#x27;s supposed to adjust to your hair, which seems to work well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: They both straighten really well...one run over a section of my scary curls totally smooths them out. They&#x27;re both SO much better than the cheaper brands I&#x27;ve tried (recently also tried the HSI which got terrific reviews, but there&#x27;s really no comparison to these two...wouldn&#x27;t even put it in the running). The big difference is that the GHD would catch and pull on my hair a bit...not much, but enough to where I have to think about it.  The Sedu doesn&#x27;t catch at all...super smooth and I can go over any amount of hair that I want to. I also found myself going over the GHD side with the Sedu as I was finishing and styling without even thinking about it...that right there kind of made the final decision for me. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I&#x27;m sticking with the Sedu and returning the GHD.  Both are quality products, but the Sedu edged out the GHD and if it lasts as long as my first one, I&#x27;m happy to pay a bit more for it than the cheaper straighteners for what I&#x27;m getting.  Hope this review helps someone else who&#x27;s looking to buy!ands I&#x27;ve tried (recently also tried the HSI which got terrific reviews, but there&#x27;s really no comparison to these two...wouldn&#x27;t even put it in the running).

            <li> I was weary about buying this flat iron (i was afraid it was a fake).  My fingers were crossed while entering my codes and it said \\&quot;You are the chosen one!\\&quot;.  I did not purchase mine straight from amazon just one of the sellers on amazon.</li>
            <li> Based on some of the reviews, I was concerned whether the product that would show up would be the real deal or a cheap knock off. My wife had previously bought this from one of the sellers here, and that turned out to be counterfeit. That unit went bad in less than 3 months. So I decided to get a replacement for her birthday. Ordered it directly from Amzn, not one of the other sellers here. The unit that arrived is 100% authentic and works great. I guess that explains the mixed reviews from previous buyers.</li>
            <li> I blew out my GHD flat iron when I was in Europe.  My favorite GHD flat iron.  So when I got back, I purchased this one on Amazon.  It does not work as well.  It works okay - - - it gets the job done, but it takes a lot more time and effort.  I paid more and bought one at Sephora, and it works PERFECT.  Just like my old one.  So I think the one Amazon is selling has something off about it.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this works wonders to make my hair straight</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for months now, and I love it.  I have really thick hair, and it gets the job done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: heats up incredibly fast; beeps to tell you when it&#x27;s ready, doesn&#x27;t fry your hair&lt;br /&gt;CONS: no ability to adjust temperature, non-movable irons (as opposed to Amika, which I had before)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking for a simple but high quality straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener broke a little after a year, I spoke with GHD and they do have a two year warranty, but won&#x27;t honor it because Amazon and its sellers are not considered certified resellers. Pay a little more and buy the straightener through GHD or one of its resellers.</li>
            <li> Not my first ghd. Very happy with both of them. My last one quit so I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works great at straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I had some concern that this iron was counterfeit. I had purchased knockoff CHI irons (unbeknownst to me) on this site before. Fortunately, as I found, GHD has a verification tool on their site. Take the time to register your iron there to make sure it&#x27;s not a fake [...] As far as the iron itself, it is a sturdy, quality iron that heats up lightning fast. It even has a beep to let you know it&#x27;s ready to go. I especially love the 30 minute, automatic shut-off feature, a must for forgetful people like me ;)</li>
            <li> Bought these after hearing so much about GHD and I am glad I did, best straighteners I have ever used, I bought them of Amazon as I was unsure from reading other reviews that they couldn&#x27;t register there product, I had no problem registering with GHD.</li>
            <li> took my wife twice as long to get ready and fix her hair with this one so we returned it. She said it had really bad heat loss</li>
            <li> I bought the GHD classic styler at Costco, but it is the same model as this one. I bought it about a year and a half ago and it had been working really well. It would heat up really fast and did a good job for both straightening and curling. The only problem I had with it is that it does not have a temperature control on it, so it was too hot to use on color treated hair. Unfortunately, it has recently started making a hissing, crackling sound when I move it a certain way, which causes it to turn on and off by itself. This model only has a 1 year warranty so I have to buy another flat iron. I will not be purchasing another GHD iron, seeing as it did not even last 2 years. I&#x27;ve had $20.00 flat irons that have lasted longer, so for this price and the short life that it had, I would not recommend the GHD Classic styler.</li>
            <li> Great straightener. My daughter has had the same one for several years and loves it. I&#x27;m just happy they still make them and I was able to buy one also.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, my father african american and my mother is hispanic...&lt;br /&gt;I have had many hair straighteners in my time, this one is by far the best one. I always used to but 2in ones but with a 1in you can get a lot closer to the scalp. My amazing hair stylist recommended this to me and im glad she did. Mine is till working perfectly fine. She has had hers for years so they must last a long time. The timer is great, it shuts itself off if it is not being used for a certain amount of time. It also heats up to the max in 20-30 seconds! So you dont have to let it heat up for a long time. Its great, get it.</li>
            <li> I saw this product being used by my sister when I was in London.  She recommended that I use this one instead of the 2&amp;#34; inch that I use since my hair is short.  I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> The product I purchased was not an authentic GHD Flat Iron. Please order through the legitimate website of GHD in order to make sure you do not end up getting a fake one.</li>
            <li> I totally love my GHD. When I was buying it here, I was a bit skeptical. However almost two years now and my thing is doing great. I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality flat iron. Build quality is solid, but it isn&#x27;t overly heavy. Heats up almost instantaneously with a quick beep to let you know it is ready.  Dual voltage, so very useful for traveling (although to be clear, this is a full sized flat iron, so it will take up space in your bag).  Mine was purchased from Amazon and registered as authentic at the ghd website.  I took off one star only because it has no temperature adjustment.  If you have delicate hair and would normally use a lower temp to straighten, you can&#x27;t with this one.  You&#x27;ll just have to move fast!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair much shinier than my lower end flat iron (about $30 range).  I have wavy hair which straightens easily but will often gain wave as the day goes on.  This makes my hair stay straight, through the night and into the next day.  Heats up fast, and has the great option to use for curls/waves.  Mine was verified by GHD as authentic when I registered it.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this flat iron. I have gone through two quality flat irons in the past few years. Both had wiring issues. I did the research and was looking for a great deal on a high quality product. I totally got it with this product. I was worried with some of the reviews that it wouldn&#x27;t be a ghd product, but before I even used it I made sure I could register it... and I was able to. Does a fabulous job straightening my hair... love that it takes only a few seconds to heat up. And puts itself to sleep if its unused for 30 min. (that was my biggest complaint about my previous Solia,)</li>
            <li> I have only owned this product since March 2011 and it quit working - plugged it in this morning and nothing!  I do not use my flat iron daily and expected it to last a couple of years not a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after trying my friend&#x27;s out.  It was so much better than the cheap-o Conair I had been using that I immediately ordered one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came in the beautiful ghd box that is in the picture. The box does say it was manufactured in P.R.C., but I was able to register my straightener on the ghd website using the codes on the straightener&#x27;s hologram and label.  Excited that I got a great straightener for a great price.</li>
            <li> Okay so to begin I wanted a GHD being the top of the line hair straightener in competition with the sudo but I didnt want to pay the $200 price tag so Amazon was my best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say my previous hair straightener was a Solia which is also one of the top hair straightener and I purchased it straight from folica.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the solia the GHD defiantly beats it and I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of complaints for the GHD was that people kept getting FAKE non legit ones, I am happy to say I received a legit GHD and you can too.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to know if it is legit whether it comes from Amazon or not is to check the sellers reviews (always do so). I usually buy from those who have usually more then 1000 reviews and score at least a 97%. That is how you know whether you are getting the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when you receive it, to test its authenticity sign up for its warranty from the little paper they give you included. If it has the shiny sticker inside the clasps of the straightener it is most likely the real deal but to make sure you should sign up for again, its warranty. If it goes through, congrats you have a REAL GHD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how you can tell if your GHD is a FAKE FAKE FAKE!&lt;br /&gt;-if it is made in china (it is manufactured in P.R.C. or South Korea)&lt;br /&gt;-if the warranty does not work&lt;br /&gt;-if you do not have the shiny sticker in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be cautious when buying from a third party seller.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the warranty will most likely be voided if you buy from Amazon, but you should still sign up for it to check for its authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped guys</li>
            <li> Best part of this product is that it heats up really fast. I do not like that there is no heat settings, just an on-off button.</li>
            <li> Just bought a new GHD straightener.  I have an old one (12 years old) and GHD is not available in my country so I decided to buy a new one if the older one would \\&quot;die\\&quot;.  I have used the old one everyday (sometimes 2x a day) for 12 years and I absolutely love it.  I have been trying the new one and it is a litle bit different, seems to weigh a litle bit less and has a sound effect when it is turned on.  I feel like the new one is to smooth, but that could be because the old one is very old and has a different feel and the plates are more used.  But both of them give me very straight hair.  I was very skeptical when reading the reviews on amazon....is it fake or not.  My conclusion is that this is not fake and the best hair straightener ever.  I have long curly frizzy hair and it takes me under 5 minutes to straighten my hair.  I have tried many brands over the years and I have to say that GHD is the best of the best.</li>
            <li> Very nice and does not burn my hair like prev flat iron</li>
            <li> After reading all the stuff about fake ghd flat irons, I panicked and registered mine online. It went through fine. Mine says manufactured in China, but I guess it is the real deal!  I have loved how my hair looks!!</li>
            <li> Authentic! Heats up immediately and straightens in no time. Worth the $</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to invest in this product.  I held off because of the price but now that I own it, it is worth every penny!  I have fine hair that is very curly/wavy.  This styler makes my hair straight, smooth, sleek and shinny and it lasts until the next shampoo.  It heats up super quick and is very east to use.  I have read other reviews about whether it is an original product because of where it was made.  My styler says \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot;. Some reviewers claim is not an authentic styler if it&#x27;s not \\&quot;Made in Korea\\&quot;. My styler had the correct ID label on it and I was able to register it on the ghd website.  For now, I highly recommend this product. As long as it continues to work for at least a year or more I will be very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The item I received was 100% counterfit.  There should be a serial number on the tag, which there wasn&#x27;t.  I crossed my fingers that I wouldn&#x27;t receive a fake, after reading several reviews from people who had received fakes, but no luck.  Amazon should do a better job of screening 3rd party sellers especially after numerous complaints such as this.  Even though I can return it (at Amazon&#x27;s expense), it&#x27;s still annoying and takes time out of my day that I could be doing something else.  I&#x27;d recommend you buy this from an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> It works ok. I expect it to work better for that price. Return it after 1 week of try out</li>
            <li> I have 3A, 3B curls so I need a high-quality flat iron that won&#x27;t burn my hair. I used to have a HAI, then a Babylis. Both were very nice. Then I borrowed my friend&#x27;s GHD on vacation and got spoiled. It got my hair flat AND shiny. I was very impressed. When my daughter knocked our Babylis over and it stopped working, I knew I wanted a GHD to replace it. I watched the price here and when it dipped down low enough, I bought it. I am very happy. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my Babylis, but it still works amazingly. I was able to register the GHD on the website (hologram and date code are on the arm, not the tag). Highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> Heats up in an instant and stays hot until I&#x27;m done. It works like a dream and it was recommended by my hairdresser. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this because it makes my styling time next to nothing now instead of constantly going over the same area repeatedly like with a cheap iron. It also stays clean.</li>
            <li> This brand is A1 the best ever my hair is curly and it&#x27;s the best one I got .i will never change this brand</li>
            <li> This flat iron blew my mind.  It did in 5 minutes what my CHI did in a half hour.  One pass over hair and its done.  Incredible.</li>
            <li> I have used this styler before and absolutely love it! I have wavy frizzy hair and it helps tremendously with the friz and it straightens so effortlessly. I had ordered this and they sent me one within 2 days, I went to register it online and the code did not work even after mutiple times so I left the seller a feedback message that was not too nice (which I do apologize for) but they were absolutely fantastic. They sent me a new one in which the code did work so these are genuine ghd stylers. Amazing product and it makes it even more amazing with great customer service. I highly recommend this product and this seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great, product. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> My second one I bought. It does a great job and does not dry your hair out. My hair always looks healthy</li>
            <li> After living in Australia and going to a salon there that used a Ghd flat iron on my hair I&#x27;ve always wanted one. But because of the price I often settled for the less expensive brands. I had a Sedu but it recently died and I found that the Ghd sold on Amazon had such a great price I just had to get it. It was definitely worth it! I love how I only need to flat iron a section once and it&#x27;s perfect. Because I have curly hair it usually takes me 40 mins to flat iron my hair but now with the Ghd styler it only takes about 25 mins. From now on I&#x27;m only using Ghd stylers.</li>
            <li> I had one of these previously for 3 years and it died so I purchased a new one.  love this brand, works great!</li>
            <li> I was told by my stylist to get this flat iron because my Chi was totally worn out.  I was a little skeptical after reading reviews that some were fakes but I ordered the &amp;#34;sold by Amazon&amp;#34; one and I was able to register it at GHD&#x27;s website.  I am definitely so happy that I chose to get this styler.  It is AWESOME.  It&#x27;s the one and done styler.  I don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over my hair to get it straight so I know it&#x27;s better for my hair overall.  Plus you can&#x27;t beat the fact that it turns itself off after 30 minutes.  It takes away my &amp;#34;did I remember to turn it off&amp;#34; fear EVERY TIME I left the house after straightening my hair. I also have really curly hair and this makes my hair soft, smooth and shiny.  Definitely recommend! !</li>
            <li> Although, they are selling a red version on their own website today for slightly less.  So if you thought this was too cheap to be an authentic product, don&#x27;t worry.  It isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  and very fast shipping. Would not buy any other brand of flat iron.</li>
            <li> FAKE! A very well disguised fake. Everything was too good to be true.  It had a hologram but no hologram code anywhere. Not on the arm or cord label. Returning ASAP.</li>
            <li> Very quick to heat up and they are much hotter than any other styler I have used.  Love that they can be used when travelling abroad with dual voltage.  Thanks to my sister for recommending this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any lady that regularly straightens her hair.  Product gets hot quick and turns off after about 30 minutes of no use.  Simply the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Great price for a fabulous new flatiron! I love the Ghd Brand (I had a previous one) it got fried when I went to Paris due to Voltage so the converter on this one is great!</li>
            <li> My third pair of GHDS quality product</li>
            <li> Very pleased with them</li>
            <li> I have owned a ghd flat iron for about 3years.  My daughter borrowed it on a daily basis.  Decided to get her one of her own for Christmas.  I highly recommend the GHD.</li>
            <li> still waiting for the product. i hope its not a fake, probably is.. since its so cheap. too good to be true</li>
            <li> I was worried that this might* be fake..but it&#x27;s REAL!  I entered the code and said \\&quot;You&#x27;re the chosen ONE\\&quot;.  According to the other viewers, don&#x27;t buy GHD from anyone other than \\&quot;AMAZON LLC\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s exactly what I did and it&#x27;s REAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always use a cheap conair flat iron ..It always snag my hair.  I thought all flat iron are the same $30 vs $200, both has ironic place and same size..why pay more?&lt;br /&gt;After using the GHD the 1st time, I will NEVER go back using my conair.  HUGE different...I wash my hair, spray in leave in conditioner and once it&#x27;s dry I spray heat protectant spray and then I flat iron.  You do NOT need to go over the GHD twice..1 is enough.  Took me 15mins and I have LONG hair(down to my waist).  BTW, no snagging, heat up in seconds and I will never relax my hair again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you soo much..great deal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot. I think it works fine. But it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my older chi flat iron...which finally gave out after 6 years of daily use. Since it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot, I have to use it on smaller/thinner sections so it takes me a bit longer. I don&#x27;t like change. But maybe it&#x27;ll be gentler on my hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  It does a good job and heats up fast.  I have pretty curly hair and it straightens it right out!</li>
            <li> GHD quality is well known in the beauty industry and is reflected in this styler. It works better than any other my wife has used. Sure the less expensive ones work, just not as quickly and typically others do not work anywhere in the world: this one does. I ordered it gift wrapped and so pleased i did, not only was the box and wrapping suburb, but disguised the contents resulting in a big surprise on  Christmas day. It was recommended to us from a close friend and I recommend it to you too.</li>
            <li> I got a real product, works very fast, do not damage hair and I just love it! Very good price!</li>
            <li> My Husband bought this for me as I was still using my expensive Australian straightener here in the states. We knew how good Amazon&#x27;s return policy was so, we ordered it knowing that we may possibly be buying a fake. Had a problem registering it on the website the first time, only due to their site being temporarily under maintenance. No problems the 2nd time. The only difference with my product is the colour of the plates. Mine are black (the picture shows cream). Pretty sure this is just because the photo is older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product it works very well with me and like it ..&lt;br /&gt;The price is also special in Amazon,,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you AMAZON ..</li>
            <li> I got this straightener for Christmas 2 years ago and i don&#x27;t like it. Now it turns off all the time and make an annoying beeping noice and makes my hair look greasey and thin. So if you curly or dry hair don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t possible to register my GHD flat iron purchased from an Amazon reseller with the manufacturer. I&#x27;m 99% sure this is NOT an authorized re-sale from GHD. This could mean a number of things... Nevertheless, I love this flat iron, which seems to work extremely well. I decided to take my chances with this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; of the GHD Classic Styler.</li>
            <li> I tried to register my ghd and it doesnt even have the correct warning label on the straightener . I had read some reviews after purchasing the styler and people were saying it might not be real, i tried to cancel my order right away but it wouldnt allow me. DONT BUY THIS! pay an extra $50 and get a real one!!!</li>
            <li> Even though this says it is a GHD, it sure doesn&#x27;t work like one.  I&#x27;m not sure if it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough or if it doesn&#x27;t clamp on the hair enough to, but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was worried per the other reviews, but I received my GHD and was able to register it on the GHD website. All is well and it&#x27;s working great so far!</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair however it is now frizzy (guess it is with age) and I use this daily (with a heat styling spray protector). I love it and this is the 2nd I bought (the 1st I somehow broke the plug)</li>
            <li> Main Reason to Buy this Straighter is to use it In India while traveling as it supports international Voltage. But the most Amazingly reduced the total time to half of the time which used to take with other straightener i have to straighten My Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know i have given this review when i started using this. i was able to register in GHD site successfully. unfortunately 10 days back all of a sudden whn a i connect to power outlet it started giving me continuous beap sounds and did not heat the iron. now it is completely stopped working. Can anybody help me how to fix this issue. i am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is a real GHD flatiron, but regardless, even if it is knock off, this flatiron does not straighten my hair. I tried it once and while it heats up super fast, I had to run it through my hair 5 times to straighten my shoulder length, thick, curly hair.  It produced the same results as my $40.00 flat iron. As much as the GHD cost, I expected better results. Sending it back.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best straighteners I&#x27;ve ever used. Its lightweight and takes literally 15 seconds to heat up. Works perfectly and would not trade it for any other straightener.</li>
            <li> This is a Great Product at a Great Price It was a gift and the reciever was thrilled with the product</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I have had it for years and it hasn&#x27;t broken or not heated to the max heat level once.  If it ever dies, I&#x27;ll definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> IT DOES WORK GREAT, HOWEVER NOT SURE IF IT IS REAL THE HANDLE IS LOOSE AND MAKES ME WONDER&lt;br /&gt;HAIR WISE, DOES A GREAT JOB, AND YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFRENCE</li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter in law for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!!! That made me feel good.</li>
            <li> Very good hair straightener.</li>
            <li> i received the product in time...&lt;br /&gt;safe and good --- job well done&lt;br /&gt;keep the good work&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> I was stung once buying some fake GHDs online, but these are the real deal. They are perfect. I,ve been using them for years and my last pair gave up after five years of daily use.</li>
            <li> Finaly found a hair tool that works for my curly hair. this hot tool makes my hair salon perfect.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> The ghd Classic 1-inch styler is the bomb!!!  It heats up in seconds after being turned on, feels balanced and streamlined in my hand, has a swivel cord that never gets tangled and safety guards at the tip to prevent accidental burns.  I can now style my long hair in half the time it formerly took.</li>
            <li> I was happy the moment i got this, its so smooth when you use it, was abit caught off guard by the different power cord but that was quickly fixed but nonetheless i love this piece of a styler</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it. I haven&#x27;t straightened my hair in years, so I finally decided it was time to buck up the necessary cash for a decent one.&lt;br /&gt;So far, so great!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron . It&#x27;s my second one. The first one lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My friend recommend this flat iron and I am so glad she did! It works wonderfully. Heats up very quickly and beeps when its ready for use. Does a great job of straightening my long hair and it lasts until my next wash. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> This straightener is amazing. Although it only has one heat setting, it heats up immediately and gets the job done. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s frying my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> Appears to be authentic but it is extremely hot and smells like burnt rubber</li>
            <li> Heats up quick. Yes, I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.  Cost a little more than others, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> My GHDs finally broke after over 10 years so bought a new set, still as good as they always have been!</li>
            <li> heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> For hair that doesn&#x27;t need too much heat this is perfect, but if you need that steam and pin straight hair you should opt for a more expensive GHD. I&#x27;ll personally stick with this because it&#x27;s much healthier ok my hair than standard heat hot irons.</li>
            <li> just received my ghd classic I-inch iron, looooooooove it. love it heat up fast and the LCD light is very good feature. and it gave my hair very nice look after using it. now just have to see how long this machine would last !!!!  loving it so far !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for several years and love it. Also, ghd has a way you can verify before purchasing. http://www.ghdhair.com/us/help/website-checker . It will tell you if the party selling it is an approved seller.</li>
            <li> These flatirons are a great investment. I loved the results. For styling black hair. I would advise to curl you hair first and then apply oil. the irons gives a better curl on less greasy hair. It made my hair silky. : )</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. Apparently the styler worked great for the first couple weeks and not no longer worked. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on or anything. Build quality may be an issue.</li>
            <li> It works fine but the packaging was all ripped and messed up. The iron was out, rolling around in the box.. It looked like a used product even tho it was brand new!</li>
            <li> I was nervous to purchase since some people got fakes, but I risked it anyway.  Mine just arrived and I was able to register it on the GHD website.  I&#x27;m so excited to use it!!</li>
            <li> I had the HSI Professional which i thought was pretty good but this ghd flat iron definitely beats it in all aspect (which it better be since the price is 3x as much). First, I like it that it beeps to let you know that it&#x27;s ready to be used after plugged in. Second, it&#x27;s very light so for a person with thick hair like me &amp; usually takes forever to smooth out all my hair, it&#x27;s less tiring. Last but not least, it straightens just in 1-2 strokes and it lasts! It cuts down my hair prep time by half if not more. Save up a little longer and get this instead of HSI (which is also less compact)</li>
            <li> I bought this almost two years ago and still works well on my hair. Since I use it everyday, it will probably have to be replaced soon. I will buy the same one again!</li>
            <li> I paid priority order to have GHDs delivered within 48 hours. Delivery arrived 5 or 6 days later!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The GHDs are not exactly the same as my previous (genuine) ones so I immediately questioned the authernticity.&lt;br /&gt;Then I plugged them in, switched them on, and they didn&#x27;t even work!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> I read all of the buyer bewares before purchasing. My product did register on the GHD website and quit working after 6 weeks. Have loved this product in the past, but am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So turns out the straightener was real. Thank you so much for the staple beauty tool! :-)&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair so silky and manageable. I use mine strictly for straightening.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this thing.  The auto off feature really makes me a happy camper too.</li>
            <li> This broke before it&#x27;s first use.  There isn&#x27;t much more I can say about this tragic hair straightener other than it, never turned on and must have been a fluke because GHD is normally awesome.</li>
            <li> This styler really works! I can curl or straighten with it and the style holds all day without hairspray.</li>
            <li> I borrowed this straightener from my friend when we were in Vegas and I fell in love with it. I love the fact that it heats up almost instantly and is very lightweight. It made my hair silky and smooth. I had to get the straightener for myself and purchased it at a beauty supply store. This straightenr is well worth the investment. I replaced my old herstyler with my new ghd and I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!! MY CHEAP FLAT IRON WORKS BETTER THAN THIS. MY HAIRDRESSER HAS A GHD AND IT IS AMAZING. I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GHD QUALITY!!!!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever.  I had my previous one for 11 years.</li>
            <li> HOT immediately! Smooth easy to use! Recommended by my hairstylists and well worth the money! Have not owned a Chi so can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> This is my second GHD. The first once I&#x27;ve had about 8 years. It still works great but the cord has become frayed. The first time I used GHD it blew me away with how much better it worked than other irons. I have somewhat curly hair that either has to be curled or flattened to look good. The GHD works for both efforts. It heats up super fast and I can style my long, thick hair in less time than I could with a curling iron or the CHI that I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the cord. It has a tendency to twist up and get annoying. Makes it a little irritating when I&#x27;m styling and have to put the iron down to straighten out the cord. But as far as the function of the iron goes, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Honestly the best straightener I&#x27;ve used. I have had many, many, many straighteners, from cheap $30 ones, to pricey $100 ones and this ghd is my favorite by far. One of the best things is that is has an automatic shut off. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I worried all day at work because I thought I might have left my hair straightener that heats up over 350 degrees on. I love that this one shuts off, maybe a little too soon, but still not complaining, it&#x27;s a great feature and not one my other pricey straightener offers. That being said, this straightener is also works fantastically. It heats up very quickly and then glides evenly and smoothly for perfectly straight smooth hair. My hair is very thick with a slight wave, especially in the back, I was pleasantly surprised at what a good job this straightener does on my hair, I don&#x27;t have to go back and re-do any sections and with a little product my style holds all day. I didn&#x27;t think there would be that much difference between the ghb and my other pricier straightener, but there is and I am not a ghb girl all the way!</li>
            <li> It came on time and was greatly packed. Great straightener to use overseas too on my trip all I needed was a adapter</li>
            <li> Works great- gets hot fast</li>
            <li> The Bentley of Ceramic Flat Irons.  Review done by a 25+ year professional hair stylist (my wife).  We have over 6 different flat iron similar to this.  This one by far is the most well thought out, designed.  It is light weight, the opening spring is not to strong as to cause fatigue under long use.  The heat computer intelligently senses and heats the ceramic pads as not to damage the hair.  Automatic shut off is great.  It heats up very fast and has LED light indicator, easy to see.  The 90 degree cord swivels and makes use really easy not only for home but also for professional use.  The rounded tip design doubles it as curl iron. The result is a long lasting, shiny beautiful hair do.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> In a word, wow. I didn&#x27;t think it would, but this ghd straightener blew away. I turn it on and in about 5 minuets am ready to start making passes. There is only one heat setting, hot, and it&#x27;s perfect. The weight is amazingly light, it&#x27;s thin, easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t fatigue my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a different pro straightener, and was certain nothing could compare. The one I had been using had options, lots and lots of options. The ghd offers only one option and that is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The auto shut off is also a very, very appreciated feature!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is not cheap. But, the investment is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Actually returned this item without using it because it has one heat setting which cannot be changed and I wanted a styler that allowed me to increase and decrease as needed.</li>
            <li> If u straten your hair a lot this is the strainer 4u it totally works its awesome it handles hair good</li>
            <li> i was really nervous in buying a new ghd (previous one broke on me after using it for a good 3+ years and treating it not very caringly) but ive been using this one daily and it is of exactly the same wonderful quality that my previous ghd straightener was. it comes in the box with the authenticity card with a code so if you want, you can go to the ghd website and punch in the code to see if it is real or fake. i have naturally wavy, thin hair and it gets dry, tangled, and damaged easily.. recently got fringe bangs and normal drugstore straighteners will just make my bangs stiff and more dry, but the ghd has its way of making my hair look and feel even more hydrated than it is and very naturally silky. thank you :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this styler. I have very fine curly hair that requires washing or wetting every day to get the curls out. Now I can just re-straighten it dry when ever I need a quick touch up. Never before had so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing that it had great reviews and hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t receive a fake like some others had reported in their reviews. I was fortunate enough to receive the REAL GHD classic styler, successfully registered it on the GHD website, and have loved it every single time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I am half Puerto Rican with very naturally curly hair and this works wonders. It offers a all-day straightening power and works wonderfully when I use it to curl the ends of my hair also.&lt;br /&gt;If you can take the risk of possibly getting a fake, I highly recommend this product. Well-worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I purchased a GHD flat iron last October for personal use.  It worked for a year then developed a short in the swivel cord.  I love the product but felt for the price it should have worked for longer that 1 year.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, GHD&#x27;s in my opinion continue to be the best straighteners on the market.  Absolutely fabulous 5/5.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> With all the reviews, I was concerned about getting a fake. I just received my flat iron and went to the GHD site. I registered the flat iron with no problem and I also verified the link of this seller with the ghd URL validator ([...]). It came back as: \\&quot;This is a valid site. Approved United Kingdom seller. Be aware that an adaptor may be required for use outside of United Kingdom.\\&quot; The one I got does not need an adapter for the US. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> GHD is huge in Australia, the creme dela creme of hair straighteners. It is not as big yet in America, which I found strange, but I think its because of all the other brands that were so good that are now not so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moved to america for a year, and my Australian GHD does not work here (wattage difference or something, it doesnt heat up). So I just wanted a cheaper but still good straightener for the year, or even one that I could take home and still use (I&#x27;ve read America to Aus is fine but not the other way). I have had my Australian GHD for almost 5 years now and it works as good as the day I bought it. 5 years!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at CHI, HSI, BaByliss, all the straighteners on Amazon and other websites. I was scared of all the horrible reviews each of these brands got - that they stopped working after a certain time, that they were fake, the ceramic plates started to chip etc. There were plenty of good reviews too, but the bad reviews scared me. I am usually an unlucky one with products turning crappy. I know I&#x27;m only here for a year, but I dont want a crappy straightener. I want one that makes my hair look and feel fabulous, and that I can use to straighten and create awesome curls. Thats why I decided to buy another GHD. They honestly are amazing, and I think they will just be so huge in a year or two unless the other brands pick up their act! They are worth the price, cheaper than in Aus, and they last forever. GHD have a authentication tool on their website to make sure you got a real legit straightener. They have lots of videos and how to&#x27;s as well, which is great for those who have no idea what they are doing, which is what I started off as.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Australian hairdresser first recommended GHD to me, and now my American hairdresser also recommended it to me - as it is what she uses in the salon and at home (she also happens to be a friend, so I trust her!). The brand truly is the best and will make your hair feel fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (almost to my elbows) thin, fine, coloured and highlighted, damaged hair. The GHD doesnt damage my hair (any further than I already do!) at all. I use their products to style and Eufora shampoo and conditioner. I believe that the products you use, including shampoo and conditioner, really impact a) the way you hair looks and feels after being styled, and b) the way the straightener works and reacts to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;No heat control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair look silky and stylish&lt;br /&gt;no frizz whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;my hair looks so healthy after I straighten with the GHD, rather than all broken with flyaways like cheaper straighteners&lt;br /&gt;it lasts forever!&lt;br /&gt;its so easy and quick to use&lt;br /&gt;doesnt kink or burn my hair&lt;br /&gt;the plates are rounded, making it super easy to curl even for a novice like me&lt;br /&gt;I can straighten my hair perfectly in less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;it automatically switches off within thirty minutes if it remains unattended&lt;br /&gt;I can curl my hair in about 20-25 minutes (I&#x27;m not very good at it!)&lt;br /&gt;Temperature is automatically controlled so the heat distributes evenly on the surface of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;its lightweight&lt;br /&gt;heats up super fast&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt make my hair feel greasy and oily, and I can leave it for a couple of days without retouching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly believe that once you get a GHD you will never (happily) go back to another brand. they are amazing and worth every penny.

            <li> There&#x27;s no hologram included with the ghd styler I received today. I am not able to register it. I do not believe it&#x27;s authentic.  I&#x27;m returning it to Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> When I tried to register this item with GHD, I found out this item is a counterfeit. I&#x27;m returning it immediately. Be sure to register the warranty for the product with GHD (pamphlet in box). By attempting to do this is how I found out mine was a fake, and by also calling GHD directly after doing so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in the mail on the way back... It didn&#x27;t measure up to my expectations! Directions to turn on, heat up did not work; heat source very low. Hopefully the new one will work!</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased my GHD styler 4 years ago.  Was totally satisfied, then it broke 2 years later after the warranty had expired.  The next one I bought turned out to be a fake.  It broke after 16 months (advertisment on Amazon showed a 24 month warranty period).  When I tried to take the warranty up I found out the hologram was invalid and my 24 month warranty is void.  Everything on the iron looked like a real one.  Very mad, I spent a lot of money on this.  NEVER purchasing a GHD flat iron from Amazon or this vendor listed again.</li>
            <li> Received within time promised. Love this iron! Works great, heats up with in a minute. This iron was recommended to me by my hair style list, Its a great product!</li>
            <li> i can not use due to the power plug not fit any power outlet. i try diffetent power adaptors, just not power adaptor will fit, what can i do?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter-in-law loves it.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I have an unhealthy relationship with this flat iron. On one hand I love it because it&#x27;s so amazingly fast (10 seconds to heat, and less than 5 minutes between plugging it in and unplugging), but it flat-out damages my hair. Don&#x27;t get me wrong--it makes my hair look *amazing* and it&#x27;s my go-to for job interviews, but I can only use it twice before split ends pop up everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the above all stems from the same thing - it has no temperature controls, so apparently it&#x27;s BAKING my hair in no time flat. So I cap myself at only 2 uses between haircuts, but for the days I need a flat iron, wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* 1-inch means you can use it both for straightening and for waves&lt;br /&gt;* Heats up super-quickly (15-30 seconds, depending on room temperature), beeps gently when it&#x27;s ready, then blinks so you know it&#x27;s hot&lt;br /&gt;* Ceramic plates distribute heat evenly&lt;br /&gt;* Super-long cord means you&#x27;re not tethered to the outlet (super useful when the mirror isn&#x27;t ideally placed relative to the outlet!)&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s easy and fast to run it through your hair one tiny section at a time, and you pretty much never have to repeat any sections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control, and is super-hot, which a) means more damage to hair--especially if it&#x27;s fine, and b) if you burn yourself it could blister&lt;br /&gt;* You definitely need PRACTICE if you&#x27;re wanting waves--the first couple of times I tried it, it looked like a bad, bad trailer park perm. Don&#x27;t attempt this for the first time, say, on prom night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL&lt;br /&gt;* Do an internet search and watch the video for &amp;#34;ghd flat iron curls&amp;#34;--it will show you a different technique than a search for just &amp;#34;flat iron curls.&amp;#34; This is important--many videos will tell you to start at the end and roll up, but with the super-high temps of this flat iron, it will fry your ends to crisps. You need to watch the &amp;#34;ghd&amp;#34; method with this iron</li>
            <li> It is a bad product don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Perfect, durable, gets super hot in seconds! I throw it in my bag and beat it up daily and it works great. No pulling! Great quality</li>
            <li> I purchased this GHD Styler as a gift for my wife, replacing a pretty generic model. She has been extremely pleased with the results. The styler heats up in just a few seconds &amp; beeps to let you know it&#x27;s ready. It has worked very well for her long &amp; thick hair. The other great feature of this styler is its automatic shut-off. There were numerous times when she&#x27;d forget to turn off her old styler, but with this GHD, there&#x27;s never a worry, since it turns itself off. She&#x27;s had nothing negative to say about the styler &amp; is pleased with its handling &amp; durability.</li>
            <li> This is my third GHD flat iron.  The best, have them all over. Home, vacation home, boat.&lt;br /&gt;Used for many years.</li>
            <li> It is a very good one , but what i didnt like that it doesn&#x27;t have any bag to put in , and it is only one heat degree !</li>
            <li> Still have my GHD to this day and LOVE IT! My daughter has one also. Literally only takes seconds to heat up and beeps when ready. It gets hot and I mean HOT so I use a heat styling product with it. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I decided at the last minute I needed to straighten and I only had 10-15 minutes or even 5 for a real quick top layer straightening as apposed to 40-60 minutes. I was able to plug it in, turn it on and within seconds it was HOT and ready to go! I know it&#x27;s pricey but it has great bones and I love the ceramic plates on it. It really is an outstanding and superior product compared to the stuff sold at your corner pharmacy, or other large nearby retailer.</li>
            <li> 7/21/14 - I purchased this flat iron on May 25, 2013.  I&#x27;ve used this product every day since then with no issues. Also the styler is NOT a fake and I was able to register it on GHD&#x27;s website with no problem. I only buy products that are ship and sold from Amazon.com only! Maybe that is why so many people have received fakes, I&#x27;m not sure.  I have course thick hair and this flat iron has been wonderful. The plates are hot, but doesn&#x27;t damage my hair or the ends. I would recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Was able to register the product with no problem! Great deal on an authentic ghd flat iron as this costs $180 at the salon!</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best flat iron I have owned.  Heats up quickly and does the job.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Heats up almost instantly, works beautifully.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about people not getting an authentic GHD flat iron; I contacted my niece who bought one for my sister at the retail outlet Sephora, and asked her to send me the sku number off the box. Once I got that I was able to look through the models available on Amazon and buy one that is authentic. Other people&#x27;s reviews had convinced me to make sure I was getting an authentic GHD flat iron. I am grateful to them for posting their review so I could make an informed purchase. I really like this flat iron. I had used my sister&#x27;s GHD when I was visiting her last year, so I already knew this was the brand for me. I have very think hair and the Revlon and Conair brands just weren&#x27;t cuttin&#x27; it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am a very trusting person, so am I with products I purchase online. The GHD 1 inch styler I recently purchased from the vendor Platinum Home Delivery (order fulfilled via Amazon) was far from what you consider a great item. It was obvious that the product has been used before, the packaging of the product was ripped, the box old and used and the procuct codes on the GHD flat iron were not matching.&lt;br /&gt;I should have read all the other posts before buying but I didn&#x27;t. PLEASE CHECK THE GHD WEBSITE YOU CAN VERIFY YOUR PRODUCT CODES THERE. A REAL GHD HAS ONE HOLOGRAPHIC CODE AND A DATE CODE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I got had a hologram sticker on the cord and a different hologram sticker with a different code on the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really difficult to know when it is real or fake - I returned the product, got a refund and ordered from a licenced GHD dealer. It wasn&#x27;t as cheap but I still got a discount. I should have done that before saving myself shipping cost and trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful with what you can get on this platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003ES7GRA Ghd 00235 Classic Styler, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li> Bought these at a very reasonable price and they are great.They arrived within the week of ordering them which was also great.</li>
            <li> Awesome straightener, very efficient and fast to warm up. The only thing missing is the option to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally bit the bullet and purchased the ghd straightener! I had been eying it for years on Sephora, but could never shell out that much money. Needless to say, I was really excited to find it for a discounted price on Amazon. I was really skeptical after reading mixed reviews and warnings about receiving fakes. The straightener I got is completely legit and I was able to register it on the ghd website with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, wavy, medium-length hair. With my old straightener (a Remington Wet 2 Straight) I&#x27;d have to put it on the highest setting to get any results. In turn, I got tons of split ends, and my hair looked dry, frizzy, and damaged. The second I walked out the door, my hair would immediately begin to poof up again (I live in the South- hello, humidity!). With the ghd straightener, there are no heat settings. It heats up in seconds and automatically adjusts to the meet the needs of your hair. I was amazed at how it glided so easily throughout my hair and left my thick, wavy hair pin straight after 1 pass, instead of 3 or 4 (or 5) like my old straightener. My hair doesn&#x27;t get snagged anymore! Instead, I&#x27;m left with shiny, silky, and healthy straight hair. Even my boyfriend noticed the difference the first time I used it! I was also impressed that it stayed completely straight after spending time outside in 90% humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this and it completely exceeds my expectations. I hope this lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This is great but it cannot be adjusted temperature wise in case&lt;br /&gt;you need a lower heat. Otherwise it is great!&lt;br /&gt;Better deals on Ebay tho if you want to search there.</li>
            <li> Foremost, rest assured that if you purchase this item directly through Amazon, it is guaranteed authentic. If you purchase from a third-party here, there is no such guarantee. Before ordering this item, I read the reviews and saw that many folks who purchased through the third-party option ended up with counterfeit versions. (And, if this has happened to you, please notify Amazon immediately ... they will resolve the issue and the third-party vendor will lose the right to sell at Amazon. They take this very seriously.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it does not get any better. It&#x27;s just that simple. For years, I have used the T3 line. I love their appliances and have never had a single complaint. But, this GHD is even more outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heats quickly and evenly. When hair is done in appropriately smaller sections, this is a one-pass system. It took me less time to straighten my hair with this GHD than with my T3 (since my T3 often needs some quick touch-ups).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord is a \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; that every straightener should have. (In my opinion, it&#x27;s actually a safety feature rather than a convenience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only, tiny quibble is the fact that it does not come with a travel case. I had this small hope that it would be under the straightener, so I took apart the box ... but no. My T3 came with a heat resistant travel case.  I have taken it on every trip ... and never once had a problem. Here, I am not sure that I&#x27;m willing to just toss it in my bag and hope nothing happens. Man, and this straightener was sooo close to perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If healthy hair is your priority, choose this over any low-end, unevenly heated, bare-metal straightener. Yes, it is expensive but, when considering the health of your hair, it is entirely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all means, this is a superior product.</li>
            <li> There are less expensive stylers, but if you use one everyday, you want one that works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works great. It&#x27;s well-built, to begin with. The grip is easy to hold, and it springs open when you aren&#x27;t clamping it. There&#x27;s a very long (9 foot!) cord, and unlike any others I&#x27;ve seen, it connects to the styler with a swivel. That makes it easy to maneuver, especially for styling someone else&#x27;s hair if you need to walk around them and go at it from all sides. The other thing that makes this extremely useful is how quickly it heats up and is ready to go. Turn it on, and it beeps, and then, in under half a minute, it beeps again twice, signaling it is ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can straighten hair, very quickly, and it does an impressive job. Curling is easy too, whether you go for tight curls or wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you leave it sitting and forget to turn it off, it shuts off automatically after half an hour. (I almost think that it would be better to shut off after 15 minutes inactive. Given how quickly it heats up, that wouldn&#x27;t be a bother if you happened to step away too long inadvertently.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy-to-use, built-to-last, and built safe, this heats up quickly and does a good job.</li>
            <li> What do you need your hair to do? Curl? Waves? Straighten? This award-winning elegant, stylish 1-inch curler can do it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sleek black look and features an extra-long 9-foot swivel extension cord. It will work well with short or long hair. It features universal voltage so that it provides consistent heat even when traveling (you must provide the international adaptor). All in all, this is a great all-purpose styler that feels great in your hands and delivers the look you desire for your hair. It also has an automatic shut-off feature, and will shut off after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I just received my GHD classic sytler yesterday, and registered it on GHD&#x27;s website.  It wasn&#x27;t a fake, and did my hair for the first time this morning with it, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!  My hair feels so healthy!  I had tried a CHI first, returned it.  Bought a CROC, which was better, but still wouldn&#x27;t tame my thick, coarse hair without being on the 450 degree setting, which made me nervous.  I bought the GHD on the recommendation of a couple of friends who I trust.  Read reviews on Amazon and made sure to purchase the iron direct from AMAZON.  Glad I did!  This flat iron is AWESOME!  My hope is that it lasts longer than a year!</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Sephora and thought it was going to straighten my course-unprocessed hair. The GHD did sort of straighten it, but it also left my hair dry, brittle, and dull looking. This means it fried my hair. Additionally, the straightening did not last. Any sign of humidity had my hair frizzing out. The GHD straightener is not ideal for course hair, naturally dry hair, or curly hair in my opinion. I also found this product to be overpriced because I found it worked just as well as less expensive brand. I have now found an excellent straightener that straightens, smooths, and does not dry out my hair, and lasts without putting product in my hair. The point I&#x27;m making is I think it&#x27;s wise to wait on this one...there are better straighteners out there. I found one.</li>
            <li> Hi i buy one but the ghd is broken doesn&#x27;t work at all. what are the procedures to either replace it or return it?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because i did my research and knew that fakes wee being sold. I received mine and registered it on the ghd site and it was real. Also the seller was amazon so that may be the difference. Anyway it&#x27;s great hits up quickly and leaves my hair straight and smooth with only a couple passes. I wish that the temperature could be set</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. It heats up very quickly. It actually makes my hair shiny. It is worth every dollar I spent on it!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews before ordering. My daughter has long curly hair and of coarse wants straight hair - so now&lt;br /&gt;she can have both with minimal fuss and without destroying her beautiful locks. Using it in Australia, so dual voltage was important.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it was much less expensive on Amazon than from an authentic GHD dealer.  The quality is substantially less than my last GHD and I wish I had spent the full amount on the real deal because I know from past experience how great the GHD products are. I suppose it&#x27;s possible GHD quality has declined in the last 5 years, rather than that I got a down-market version, but if I could do it over, I wouldn&#x27;t take the chance.</li>
            <li> WELL THE THING WORKS GREAT BUT I CANT REGISTER IT SO IT MUST BE FAKE AND IM NOT VERY HAPPY!!</li>
            <li> One side of the straightner is not getting hot anymore and I haven&#x27;t had it that long.  May I return it?</li>
            <li> I have previously used a Ghd straightener and loved it.  It worked much better than my Chi and so I decided to buy a Ghd for myself.  However, this straightener was not as good (although the same model that my friend purchased 2+ years ago).  It takes longer to straighten my hair and it does not stay as straight later into the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this works better than the Chi, but not so much better as to warrant the price for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectations and was disappointed by this product!</li>
            <li> Great product would have given it 5 stars if I had been able to register it here&#x27;s hoping it doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Heats up in seconds! Awesome flat iron! Better than the Chi and has lasted for several years now. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> i love this straighter, its the Mercedes of all straighteners.  it gets hot really quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. the seller is great. the shipping was quick and painless I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> Having read the reviews, I knew I was taking a risk, as many people have received fake ones. I spend a good hour examining them, tried them out, and concluded they were definitely not the real thing. Returned them, and ordered a pair direct from the GHDs website</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair this works great.  Didn&#x27;t get the sale price. This is a good deal. I bought mine in 2000 and use it every day. Still working like the day I got it.</li>
            <li> Love this GHD, does a very good job and heats up VERY quickly. Really good purchase and well worth it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moA6I4BBT0VV81]]In the attached video I explain how to register your flat iron and check for authenticity that you are actually receiving an actual ghd product.  I was quite surprised to see so many negative reviews stating that they received a fake product. Many went on to talk about holes on the cord and the prong and where it is made, but actually those are old posts on the internet and the only sure way is by going to ghd website and registering your product.  Even at the ghd website some of the illustrations were out of date which I point out in the video. By entering the halogram sticker unique code and date code of your product, you will be emailed to let you know if your product is genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me discuss about the benefits of the flat iron itself.  I have tried numerous brands of flat irons.  From Hot Tools, FHI, CHI, HAI, Chameleon to Sedu.  This is my first ghd brand and I am happy I got to try it out.  The ghd Classic 1-inch Styler uses ceramic plate technology which helps reduce breakage and damage to the hair because the ceramic can glide through your hair without pulling it.  It also maintains an even temperature throughout the plates with no cold spots which means less passing on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ghd has actual ceramic plates and not aluminum plates that are ceramic coated which in time will wear off, chip and peel.  Ceramic produces negative ions.  Dry or damaged hair has positive ions.  When you use the ghd Ceramic Flat Iron you are applying negative to positive so you counteracting and balancing the condition of your hair. The negative ions will make your hair smoother, silkier and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what is missing?  Tourmaline.  Tourmaline also emits negative but has far-infrared heat. It can get rid of odors and pollutants. When tourmaline is heated, it can produce more negative ions than plain ceramic plates.  This means means far more less damage by locking in your hairs own moisture and minimizing frizz, static electricity and flyaways. That is why I give this flat iron four stars instead of five. I prefer a flat iron that has BOTH ceramic and tourmaline technology like the Sedu Pro Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron. Not that this flat iron is a bad choice, but my Sedu is my all time favorite and rated 5+++++++ stars and more.zz, static electricity and flyaways.

            <li> This is one of the best flattening irons you can buy! It heats up VERY quickly. In fact, I left it on too long (as my own one takes forever to heat up) and it shut itself off. So, yes, the automatic shut-off works ! I actually love having the piece of mind knowing that it shuts off after 30 mins.  Sometimes, my 13-year old daughter will borrow my hair iron and I have to double-check to make sure she didn&#x27;t leave it on.  Btw,&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and this flattening iron did a fantastic job! My hair also felt very silky and not damaged.  This is hands-down, the best flattening iron I have owned/used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the straightener very often but it has worked great for me. gets very hot, very quickly and does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I have been coveting one of these stylers since I borrowed a friend&#x27;s in the UK in 2007... and I finally got one! And it&#x27;s an authentic one! I suspect Amazon&#x27;s prices are low to compete with all of the vendors selling fakes on here, which is a shame for them but worked out just fine for me. MAKE SURE you select the one that&#x27;s shipped from AND sold by Amazon - the main page for this product seems to rotate between several vendors, not all of them trustworthy, and right now I have to check the little &amp;#34;More Buying Choices&amp;#34; sidebar to find the one sold by Amazon itself. They were the main vendor for this page when I ordered, but they&#x27;re not now, so it looks like it changes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to register mine with GHD&#x27;s website, and everything looks/feels like the quality you&#x27;d expect from something that usually retails for almost twice what you&#x27;ll pay for one here, so I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;s legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a CHI for the last 8 years. The same CHI. It&#x27;s held up well, clearly, and still works, but it just doesn&#x27;t heat like it used to, and its time has been up for a while now. It&#x27;s served me well, I&#x27;d read some reviews in several places saying that their quality had dropped off, and I still remembered how wonderful the GHD I&#x27;d tried had been (and that was when my CHI was still in its prime!), so in looking to replace my straightener, I really wanted to see if I could find an authentic GHD at a reasonable price. And I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had my GHD for a few days now, so I can&#x27;t attest to its longevity (I somehow doubt anything will ever compete with its predecessor on that front anyway), but it works like an absolute dream. The first time I turned it on I was sure something wasn&#x27;t working quite right because it gave me the &amp;#34;all heated up!&amp;#34; beep so rapidly - under 15 seconds. But no. Ready to go. It slid through my hair like butter, leaving nothing but smoothness in its wake. My ends don&#x27;t feel all frazzled like they do when I use cheaper straighteners, and I can get pretty substantial waves out in a single pass with minimal styling product. And it goes into sleep mode after 30 minutes, which is wonderful - &amp;#34;did I leave the hair straightener on?&amp;#34; is my personal equivalent of the old &amp;#34;did I leave the gas on?&amp;#34; worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fantastic product for an excellent price, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Just choose your vendor wisely, and make sure to check authenticity on their website!I use cheaper straighteners, and I can get pretty substantial waves out in a single pass with minimal styling product.

            <li> I like this straightener, but I definitely don&#x27;t love it. It does the job, but seems to take a lot of time to get my hair straight. I was hoping for the price that it would be a miracle worker, but its not. I have naturally fairly straight hair too, so I would think it would be worse for someone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> My styler seems to be legitimate and has the shiny sticker and seems to be correct in all other ways. It does indeed work, so that really is all that matters. I was given this free for an honest review. I have to say overall I like this styler. It is the perfect size for my hair as it is short and medium in thickness. The styler it self is a little heavy to hold up for long periods, so just be warned about that and it rolls on my counter top. It heats up quick and works great though, and I love that I can curl or straighten, and it has an auto shut off in case I forget to turn it off! That is the best feature to any styler in my opinion so I do not burn my house down!. Also, this one in particular looks very nice not that it matters for functionality, but it is a pretty iron. I was able to straighten my hair in far less time than my previous straightener and it seems also I am not using nearly as much heat. So, I love this styler, and my only complaint is that it is a bit clunky to hold.</li>
            <li> I bought this as s gift for my wife, who recently tried a family member&#x27;s GHD straightener and loved it.  She was immediately disappointed that it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the one she had tried (or even as well as her old, cheap flat iron).  She Googled the issue and learned that there are many counterfeit versions of this product.  She saw that she could verify its authenticity by registering it with GHD.  But when she went to register it, she found that the hologram sticker that was supposed to have the serial number printed on it was missing.  We believe this item is fake and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine blonde hair, and this straightener helps me get so much more sleekness and volume. It is sturdy and heats up so fast! Plus I love how it sleeps if you leave it on too long so that it won&#x27;t burn your house down.</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist I&#x27;m picky about my tools. Read great reviews on this flat iron and it was on a sale. Came in a gorgeous box, the tool itself is sleek and slim. Great design. Heats up in 15 seconds. Perfect grip. Love it!</li>
            <li> I recently just had a funeral for my GHD classic 1 inch hair straightener after one of the blades stopped heating. I have had this hair straightner for almost 4 years, longer than any of my relationships. :) It is absolutely amazing and I am defintiely buying another. I have went through all kinds of straighteners such as CHI and Paul Mitchell. A CHI will only last me a year. After a couple CHI&#x27;s this was confirmed case. I used my GHD every day and I dropped it religiously and it has lasted much longer than expected. My mother and younger sister have the same GHD that I used and is currently four years old too and is still working. It is worth the price by far and the quality and durablility is great. It also comes with a two year warranty, which is twice as long as most. It heats up in a snap and it shuts off automatically if I accidently leave it on. I have thick curly horse-like hair, and this thing makes it pretty. I will continue to cry on the inside until my new GHD comes in. Love you GHD!</li>
            <li> love it! totally worth it</li>
            <li> I was scared when ordering this product because I read a few reviews about people receiving knock offs of the GHD. I took the chance however and ordered! I am so happy to say that I am &amp;#34;the chosen one&amp;#34;. I was able to register my GHD on the website and it comes with a 2 year warranty. The straightener itself works wonders!!!! It heats up so fast and leaves hair so soft. The only bad thing about this is that I am wanting to straighten my hair everyday, haha. But honestly, it was well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> Yeah, was not as great as I thought, overrated. I really wanted to LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless it does the job.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is awesome. It gets hot in seconds and holds the heat from start to finish. It is definitely worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I was able to register my straightener online at GHD...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my sister likes this just as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 chi straighteners my whole life and I was a loyal chi person. My friend recommended the Ghd and it is amazing and so much better. Silky hair and doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat</li>
            <li> I was a little weary about buying this because of all the bad reviews about it being counterfeit. I also know that a lot of people have posted about this already but I received my product and was able to register it on GHD website and that it is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome deal!! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product. It heats up in 30 seconds and straightens on the first swipe. I am able to straighten my hair in half the time it used to take me and also it doesn&#x27;t seem to create the breakage or damage other straighteners cause.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with GHD but felt I should have been advised that the powerpoint connection would be for a US powerpoint and not Australian.</li>
            <li> If you are really aching to get this please do not go with the Free Shipping (FedEx Smartpost), it took two days for Amazon to send out, and about ten days in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the authenticity, the GHD I got was one the &amp;#34;chosen one&amp;#34;. This is my first GHD, when first using it my hair was 80 percent dry (I know, I know it is not good to straighten hair while damp), I was so excited I used it right away. When I finished the rest of my head I noticed there wasn&#x27;t one wet patch of hair on my head and I hadn&#x27;t burnt myself on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many high end straighteners, very many. Most of them costed as much, if not more as this did. However the difference between this one and all the other ones I&#x27;ve had is that I didn&#x27;t have build up in my hair after straightening. It&#x27;s like the excess moisture completely evaporates and leaves the natural oil&#x27;s in my hair. This by far is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is the softest it has ever been, and it feels very natural and flowy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have thick, curly, and semi kinky hair. It took me 30 minutes to straighten my whole head of head the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to and is a GHD. The registration worked fine although the registration numbers were not on the cord as GHD site suggests. They are actually on the label inside of the iron by the power switch and hard to read. My daughter tried one of these while in the UK and had to have one. Hopefully it lasts as they are spendy. Best price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment. Was excited to try out my new ghd straightener last night, but as I took it out of the (admittedly flimsy and scratched) box I had my doubts. I mean, the cord was tangled and there weren&#x27;t even instructions in the box. It just looked &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34; Sadly, my suspicions were confirmed. The iron wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I tried 3 different outlets (just in case ...) but no such luck. Saving $50 off retail may seem like a great bargain, but it&#x27;s a total ripoff if you&#x27;re paying for a fake that won&#x27;t even turn on. The increasing prevalence of fake electronics and clothing on Amazon is concerning.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever! This is my 2nd GHD  for my daughter away to college. Don&#x27;t trust the cheapies and burn your hair like I did!</li>
            <li> It worked great for me. So far it is still working great for me. I&#x27;ve always used a chi but this is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> Best straighteners for my wild hair.  Keeps it under control in humid weather conditions.  I have used GHD straighteners for at least 10 years and my previous ones died of old age!</li>
            <li> this item was not the one I was looking for. In addition, the quality was not as good as it should be! Go find something else.</li>
            <li> After reading all the cautionary tales about fakes I ordered this gift for my wife directly from Amazon to avoid the problem of unscrupulous sellers. To our dismay the item Amazon shipped us appears to be a counterfeit since we can&#x27;t register it on ghd&#x27;s site. Also, the box says that it was \\&quot;Manufactured in P.R.C.\\&quot; whereas everything else I&#x27;ve read says the real ones are made in South Korea. I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon doesn&#x27;t have better control over its supply chain. Caveat Emptor!</li>
            <li> Got my ghd Classic 1-inch Styler / Straightener today and was able to register it on the ghd site with no problem.  I was a little hesitant to purchase through Amazon b/c of a few scary reviews that people had received fakes.  If this one is a fake, at least I was able to register it with non problem and will get a guaranteed &amp;#34;from ghd&amp;#34; as a replacement.  I dont for see having any problems... I purchased this ghd straightener as a replacement to the one I purchased off Amazon well over 4 1/2 years ago (it just died last week).  I loved my last ghd straightener! Good luck! :)</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. It takes several passes to achieve any straightening and even then my hair doesn&#x27;t get that straight and it doesn&#x27;t stay straight.  It doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  It catches on my hair as it passes and it has caused a lot of breakage as well.  This is much much worse than my $30 Walgreens no-name straightener.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener. Makes my hair smooth and shinney! Heats up within 30 seconds and does a quick and beautiful job!</li>
            <li> I was worried about this product after reading several reviews stating that this flat iron was a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; or \\&quot;not actually a genuine ghd\\&quot;, but because the price was so much less on Amazon versus Trade Secret, Nordstrom, etc., I decided to take my chances...and I&#x27;m glad I did! I went online to register it. After entering the 2 required codes (located on the hologram tag attached to the product), I was happy to discover that it IS a genuine ghd flat iron! I have had a Chi for many years, and I actually think this flat iron works better on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> The GHD works wonders on my hair. I have naturally wavy hair that can be difficult to straighten but this product takes care of business. I am definitely hooked - definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had gone for years using mediocre flat irons not wanting to bite the bullet and just buy the expensive type. But man am I glad i finally did! I&#x27;ve had this GHD for years now and it&#x27;s never failed me. It heat up in seconds and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair like other irons can. Would highly recommend spending a little bit more for a stellar product.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this straightener, despite being nervous about the potential of it being fake. When I received it, the seal was broken and the straightener looked much cheaper than the GHD products I have been used to. I emailed GHD directly asking if I successfully registered the product on the site that the product was guaranteed to be authentic. BEWARE: EVEN IF YOU CAN REGISTER YOUR STRAIGHTENER ON THE SITE IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE ITS AUTHENTICITY. The customer service representative said that registration was \\&quot;just for marketing purposes.\\&quot; Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was, spend a little bit of extra money to get the real thing.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this item from a salon for 2x the price and loved it before it finally died 2 years later. Purchased from this seller and was a bit concerned from previous reviews about it being &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;. As far as I can tell it is authentic, was able to register the product with serial number on GHD website- works wonderfully and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Product received was not genuine, therefore could not be used.  Be sure to register with manufacturer to ensure authenticity.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing styler! I&#x27;ve used regular curling irons for the last couple of decades, with my preference being a fatter iron. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used a flat iron. I had a lot of fun playing with it, and was surprised by how well and how quickly it worked. It heated almost instantly, sounding a chime when it was ready to use. I sectioned off my hair and used it according to the directions on their website. It felt so slick and smooth as I pulled it down my hair that I wondered if it even made contact. However, my hair was warm and perfectly straight, so it did the trick! It only took a few minutes for my entire head of hair to be stick straight. That&#x27;s not how I wear it, I was just playing. I found directions online for curling with the ghd styler and went to work. It was a little tricky at first, because I was using it a way that I never used a curling iron. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to get the hang of it, and soon I had loose waves and curls that looked and felt wonderful. I&#x27;m thrilled with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ghd Classic styler that I received is genuine. Based on the comments here, I immediately went to the ghd website and registered it, and verified that it was the real deal. The only problem I had was reading the tiny date code printed inside the unit. I finally had to take a picture of it with my phone and enlarge it a little so I could make out the numbers.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for an authentic one (just like everyone else), but sadly.. I received a fake.&lt;br /&gt;It did not register on the GHD website and looked a bit cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I did not order directly from Amazon b/c they were out of stock and instead ordered from AVEYOU (I&#x27;m sure their other products are good, but fake GHDs are just everywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and got a refund which was a bit bothersome . I ordered one again from the Official GHD website and was able to register. And so far, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> BEST STYLING PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.</li>
            <li> Great styler, but I was not able to register it with Ghd. Pretty disappointed. They said that does not mean it&#x27;s not authentic, just that I did not buy it from an approved dealer.</li>
            <li> I had no problems registering my straightener and it works perfectly! I love it! :) It straightens so easily and doesn&#x27;t snag at all like the CHI does! I would definitely recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> High quality, reasonable price and quick arrival. What do you want more? Thank you so much it was a pleasure dealing with you :)</li>
            <li> I just got my straightener yesterday and could tell it was a fake from the time I opened the box. Very disappointed. I will be paying the price and buying one from GHD.</li>
            <li> This was the best purchase!  I am happy with the quality and results.  I am sure it will last long.</li>
            <li> This was a fake GHD. I figured it would be but I wanted to try. I went to register it with GHD and they couldn&#x27;t find the serial number so I just returned it and had to pony up for the real deal, however the real one is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I like soo much, I needed a product like this. Really it is the best in the market. The price was the best too</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever consider buying any other brand of hair straighteners.  I have very curly hair and these are the only straighteners that actually so the job and I have tried many over the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Highly recommended and will buy again if need be. I&#x27;ve tried other flat irons and this one seems to work best for my wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. She loves it</li>
            <li> heats up super fast. cord very long</li>
            <li> Great styler.  It doesn&#x27;t really live up to the hype but the hype was overinflated so let&#x27;s not blame the product.  I was able to register mine with no problems.  Other people have covered what the ghd styler can do, so I won&#x27;t go into it.  If you&#x27;re pretty satisfied with your existing hair tools, this won&#x27;t change your life, but it&#x27;s a solid tool and works well.</li>
            <li> this is the best straightener i&#x27;ve ever used. absolutely worth what i spent on it. i use it as a curler as well</li>
            <li> Normally I do not write reviews but this time I am so upset... I purchased the ghd flat iron more than a month ago and used a few times. It not only took so long to straighten my hair but also my hair felt always dull and frizzy and the next day it was a a fuzzy ball!! I had tried a cheaper version of a flat iron before and it had done a much better job. I had a Braun flat Iron  for 8 years that had done a much better job. I do not recommend this product at all, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I LOVE GHD - I&#x27;ve tried all the cheaper flat irons and have gotten exactly what I paid for ... NOT what my poor hair deserves!  I&#x27;m back to GHD and am just as happy as before - EXCEPT that there is no temperature control!  THAT&#x27;s a bummer ... I didn&#x27;t notice that on the description!  Nonetheless, I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!! My friend had one and I wanted one so bad so I could use it to curl my long a** hair without using a straight iron and a curling iron.. this is simple to use and best purchase/investment ever!! lol</li>
            <li> This website makes the irons look very real but its FAKE! don&#x27;t be fooled. I registered my iron online and the codes don&#x27;t match up. So guess what, I had to return it and purchase a REAL ghd that works wonderful from my salon. Don&#x27;t be fooled. THESE ARE FAKE FLAT IRONS NOT AUTHENTIC ghd&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was not able to be registered therefore I returned it.  I assume since it can not be registered it is a fake.</li>
            <li> I have very tightly coiled, african american hair. I used the blow dryer with a heat protectant and this iron got my hair bone straight AND shiny. Its the holy grail basically, in my opinion lol</li>
            <li> No more need for pricey keratin treatments to smooth my thick unruly mane! One pass of the iron and my locks are smooth, straight, and shiny. thanks ghd!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My favorite hair straightener ever.  I have had 3 of these.  They last about 2 years before they start getting glitchy or getting too hot if used for a long period of time.  It straightens hair very nicely, and it can also curl hair</li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this to friends , my husband bought it for me and I love it  works great</li>
            <li> Hair type: medium length, coarse, thick, dirty blonde with highlights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the BabyLiss 1 1/4 in. for 6 years and it was time for a new flatiron. My plates were old and I loved the iron, but wanted to try something different! So I bought the GHD for $185 at Sephora. It sucked. Took forever to iron hair and there was no temp setting. Then I bought the Sedu flatiron from Ultra for $160.00. It sucked too. There is not a temperature setting and it left my hair dry and brittle. The GHD and Sedu are the exact same thing to me. If you have thick long hair like me get the bigger inch flatiron, but I was not impressed at all with the the GHD or the Sedu. I was going to buy the Sultra, but it seemed too much like the others. Long story short...I bought a new BabyLiss and I LOVE it. It does not leave my hair dry, but soft. It&#x27;s quick too. I chase my flat brush with the iron and it takes 10 minutes!!! The plates are longer and wider and it only cost $135 from Ulta. Do yourself a favor...save time and money and buy a BabyLiss now! You will thank me for this review later:)</li>
            <li> Original Ghd Stylers, registered them on the official website to make sure they were Ghd! Would definitely recommend this product! Don&#x27;t be deceived by the price, they are definitely original!</li>
            <li> I have always owned cheap hair straighteners as i only straighten my bangs. I decided to invest in a GHD and purchased this in September 2013. Now, nine months later, after very little use it has completely stopped working. It does not turn on at all. I straighten my bangs every couple of days and that&#x27;s it. I have purchased cheap straighteners in the past when i sued to straighten all my hair and they lasted a couple of years. I am very upset and would NOT recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> It works very well, heat up so fast and I like the long cord and it doesn&#x27;t  twisted. Fair enough with price I got for this item.</li>
            <li> Very good styler and much cheaper than in the store.always difficult to find good quality(not damaging)styler with dual voltage.Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and works great!</li>
            <li> Just had my very long, very thick hair cut today, and they finished it with this straightener. I&#x27;m a big supporter of what isn&#x27;t broken doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced, but with how well this one worked, and how silky smooth my hair feels now compared to my old straightener, I am now shopping around to replace it. I&#x27;ll probably get a $50 model like the HSI, instead of this for 140-190, but for those willing to pay this price, it works wonderfully and hopefully you love the results as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Does not get as hot as I thought. I have to go over it several times. I need another suggested flat iron.</li>
            <li> i love this product! i have curly/wavy medium thick hair and it makes my hair feel silky and smooth. The iron heats up really quickly and easy to use. This product came in brand new as if i had just bought it from the store myself, love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this flat iron, but it is really amazing. It is ready really quickly (less than 20 seconds) and straightens/styles my hair quickly.  The straightening is even seeming to last into a second day.  Can&#x27;t say that about my old one ...  Highly recommend!  As a sidenote - It was an authentic GHD - I was able to verify &amp; register it with GHD with no problems.</li>
            <li> My sister in laws sister is a hair dresser.  I asked her advise on a flat iron and she recommended GHD.  She told me more or less what it would cost and that I could easily find it on Amazon.  When I looked for it, sure enough I found it and at a much lower price than what she stated.  I bought it and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I was happy when I received my GHD but very disappointed that the code to register on the website was missing. It is in working order but I am not sure if it is genuine.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair straightener. It lets you straighten your hair, straighten but curl/flip the ends, or even curl your hair. I definitely recommend getting a heat pouch (so you can put it away in, for example, a suitcase right after using it) but this is an excellent product. I&#x27;ve had it for a while now, and friends have had theirs for longer, so it lasts, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works in different countries with other voltage (e.g. I took it to Australia) and the beep to let you know that it&#x27;s hot is awesome.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a basic Chi for about 4 years until it recently stopped working.  I bought this one after using a friend&#x27;s GHD styler and I love it!  It does a much better job than my Chi ever did and my hair stays straight for longer!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that Amazon is not verifying authenticity of the products they sell. As soon as I opened the box, I tried to register it on the ghd website, and although I re-typed the codes several times, they were not recognized. I am returning this ASAP.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd GHD flat iron, and I don&#x27;t feel the quality is as good as my first one.</li>
            <li> I was scared to buy this iron because of the other reviews. BUT I did and when I got it it was AUTHENTIC!I registered it on the GHD website with NO PROBLEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> absolutely love it, the right size and high quality item.  100% recommended it works perfect on my hair.</li>
            <li> After reading review with titles like \\&quot;FAKE\\&quot; i was a bit nervous, but took a gamble anyway. Its authentic. I also found out that GHD has outsourced the production of some of there irons to china. In fact, when i went to register my iron, I clicked the help link for the date code and the example label had \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; clear as day on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Iron:&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING, Night and day with the old one! my favorite feature is the no tangle swivel cord</li>
            <li> Like everyone else I was really afraid of getting a fake ghd product from here. In the past I have been ripped off before when trying to buy this straightener but I took a chance anyway and its real!! I verified it on the website and I got an email back saying its authentic. I am really pleased I got this straightener for 90 dollars!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this straightener for my birthday. It was on sale a few weeks ago on the website for almost the same price, and i wish I had gotten it. The one shipped from Amazon would not register. the hologram code and date codes did not work. I typed them in at least 3 times, and they kept saying they were not working. It looks real, but since I couldn&#x27;t register it, I will return it. Just spend the extra money and purchase it from the actual website, the price isn&#x27;t that much different, and they have sales sometimes. About 3 weeks ago it was 50 dollars off.  Very disappointed because others have said that it registered.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I RECEIVED A FAKE.  WILL JUST PURCHASE FROM GHD TO GUARANTEE I GET AN AUTHENTIC STRAIGHTENER PERIOD.</li>
            <li> It was working good for few months. Then after 6-8 months it is gone. Not working. Museum....</li>
            <li> I replaced my GHD flat iron that was 4 years old.  Normal wear and tear prompted to replace my GHD.  I love that fact that it has a universal voltage converter (I travel to Europe a lot).  And, the flat iron beats CHI, Hot Tools and those other crap flat irons that only for last 6 months.  First off, I have no idea what other people are talking about on the reviews.  IT IS NOT FAKE!!!!  It is VERY real.  I registered the flat iron right away and it worked.  I would recommend to purchase it directly from Amazon.com (sold and ships by).  Other sellers....well, I probably won&#x27;t trust them.  Cheers.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream. Better than any other iron I have used before. Heats up fast and love the auto turn off</li>
            <li> Heats up within seconds, great and easy use, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair.,Leaves the hair shiny and perfect to style the way you want it</li>
            <li> The first I ordered didn&#x27;t even turn on.. Then I  ordered another and the same thing !! both didn&#x27;t work! I would not recommend buying this brand!</li>
            <li> I was little concerned as some people mentioned getting fakes, but this is the real deal.  It is so slick that it is almost too slick, the hair slide through really quickly.</li>
            <li> The GHD iron is far superior to any other flat iron out there.  I will never buy anything else.  They last forever!</li>
            <li> It was fine for a month or two, then I got lazy about straightening out my hair and took a break. A month or so later I decide to straighten my hair and it won&#x27;t turn on...</li>
            <li> The hair straightener is amazing when it works. I had it for about 2 months and then it stopped working all together. No reason, it just stopped. The return date is too late, so I&#x27;ll only get part of my money back for a hair straightener I payed over $100 for. Wonderful. Be wary.</li>
            <li> just as described, love it</li>
            <li> Heats up so quickly!!! Takes less than a minute I swear! Works like a dream. I love mine.</li>
            <li> Brought as gift for my daughter ok for the first month then didn&#x27;t heat as it should of so was disappointed  with this buy</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it and worth every cent!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Heats up fast, and straightens hair without a problem. My hair is really hard to straighten, and it works great every time.</li>
            <li> Please try to register this product immediatly.This vender is selling fakes. Mine was a fake, the site would not accept its serial number to register. I would not risk buy it from this  joint.</li>
            <li> Meh... not impressed.  If you had given this to me to try without me knowing the name/price, I would have guessed Walmart buy for about $35.00.  It did not grip my hair well (kept sliding out when I got towards the bottom of the strand), and didn&#x27;t give a smooth, glossy effect I wanted.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Got nervous reading reviews after purchasing as there were indications some people had received knockoffs from Amazon sellers. Mine was for my wife and she told her hairdresser she was getting one and how much I&#x27;d payed and was told &amp;#34;if its that cheap it must be a knockoff&amp;#34; as they are nearly three times the price here in New Zealand but it turned up with the holographic sticker and registered on GHD&#x27;s website first time and my wife loves it and swears its better than her Remington one even though I can&#x27;t understand how much tech can be in a couple of hot plates!</li>
            <li> Works well- checked the serial number on GHD&#x27;s website and was authentic. Paid much less than other stores that are selling it (over $200 at Sephora), definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these are wonderful. They heat up within 15 seconds and give amazing results. Chord is flexible and lengthy in case of any socket problems.</li>
            <li> i called GHD directly and they told me there was NO WAY TO AUTHENTICATE this product unless i mailed it directly to them for inspection.  They said the hologram and other numbers have been copied and even if their website accepts the product code it done NOT indicate that the product is genuine.  NOT WORTH THE RISK OF FIRE OR BURNS and the cost of an inferior product.  Stop the Fraud! Don&#x27;t purchase!</li>
            <li> This was an okay flatiron.  If I hadn&#x27;t received both and tried them at the same time, I would probably be pretty happy with this flatiron.  However, I prefer the Conair.  Its just smoother and easier, and the price is so much better.</li>
            <li> I used to use a flatiron which doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;curl\\&quot; the hair very well..leaves a crease in the hair.  The GHD Styler is awesome for both curling and straightening - awesome product!</li>
            <li> I had read several reviews saying that the GHD stylers were fakes. But I chose to purchase one direct from amazon.com not one of the 3rd parties and it is authentic.  I just got done registering it on GHD&#x27;s website and everything went through just fine. I am also in love with this styler!  It heats up in just a few seconds and it smoothes my hair with ease!  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this was a counterfeit or faulty product. The texture of the plastic did not feel like the other HHS stylets I&#x27;ve had, and it did not work as well. Never seemed to get hot enough. And there was a strange beeping that seemed like a faulty electronic problem. I have since bought the same exact time from a Sephora and it works great.</li>
            <li> Best Flat Iron I have ever owned and there have been a lot!  The GHD heats up within seconds and is ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> This is not the straightner I was looking for, it was the classic/ orginial one I was looking for and didn&#x27;t provide enough information.  Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better. Overpriced</li>
            <li> I have an older Chi styler that is wider so I thought I&#x27;d give this ghd 1\\&quot; a try.  It heats really quickly and beeps to let you know it&#x27;s ready.  It also has a flashing LED light.  Even though I have beyond shoulder length hair, it is very fine in texture.  This narrower styler worked better for me.  I can curl the ends under or flip it easier than with the wider styler.  It glides through my hair without any tugs or pulls.  It has a \\&quot;sleep mode\\&quot; in case you forget to turn it off.  After 30 minutes it starts to cool down.  The only negative is that it&#x27;s hard to set it on the counter like it shows in the picture, because the black part is so rounded that it wants to fall over.  (my Chi is slightly flattened) I guess it doesn&#x27;t hurt for it to lay on its side since there is a small gap between the plate and the edge of the styler so the plate doesn&#x27;t make contact with the counter, but I wouldn&#x27;t go off and leave it.  It has a swivel cord which is a must for this type of styler.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use a styler often because my hair is fragile, but when I do I will probably reach for this one.  It leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  It comes very nicely boxed so it would make a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;addition:  I didn&#x27;t realize when I wrote this review that there was a controversy over fake ghd stylers, but I just registered mine and it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, so most of the time I let it air dry and I walk around looking like I am wearing a nest on my head. Straightening my hair goes a long way in avoiding that look. The straightener that I usually use is manufactured by a popular company (starts with an R) and cost a mere $22. I think that the differences between this, more expensive brand, and the one I usually use, are insignificant. This styler heats quickly. So does the cheaper model. This styler straightens hair adequately. So does the cheaper model. The only differences are that the ghd Classic 1-inch Styler has a longer cord with a built-in gfci device and remote test/reset unit and is about an inch and a half longer, which puts your hand further from the heat. In summary, this model and brand of hair straightener heats up and straightens no better than a much cheaper model but does seem safer from an electrical/heat standpoint. Except maybe for professionals, I&#x27;m not sure that the significant cost difference (over $100) is worth the additional safety features.</li>
            <li> I finally bought this after my old hair straightener nearly caused an electrical fire when the wires frayed.  My sister has had her ghd for many years and she uses her daily.  She has been trying to convince me to buy one for a long time, claiming it was the best straightener on the market, but I hesitated because of the price.  I have had mine for a year now, and I have no regrets!  It straightens perfectly, and I also use it to create perfect curls and waves.  It has an automatic shutoff, and I just feel like it is better quality and safer than my last one.  Now I am joining my sister in convincing everyone to buy one too!  Worth the price for something you use on your hair every day!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the drugstore-purchased flat iron that I&#x27;ve been using. The ghd Classic 1-inch styler heats up fast and maintains the perfect temperature while styling my hair. The extra long cord (9-feet) is something that I&#x27;m going to have to get used to, but I do see how it would be perfect for professional stylists to use in salons. The ceramic plates come together perfectly and there&#x27;s even a little extra give when I squeeze them over my hair. I appreciate that this has a reset button on the plug to keep the user from getting shocked while using. I even loved how this arrived, in a beautiful box. My hair looks great and I am looking forward to using this for years to come.</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPING IS STUPID. It took forever but my GHD is great and just as described. Registration was easy.</li>
            <li> This is a knock off iron - not an authentic GHD iron.  Amazon is allowing me to return it.</li>
            <li> I will start by admitting that I really don&#x27;t do much with my hair.  It&#x27;s naturally curly and I never even blow dry it.  I gave my last flatiron to my daughter when she went away to college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after using the ghd styler, I think the reason I never did much with my hair is because I was always using substandard products.  This styler doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.  It runs through smoothly.  It takes at most two passes to straighten my hair.  It heats up really quickly.  I love the fact that the cord is super long and swivels.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking frizzy.  It even helps to straighten out my cowlick at my hairline.  It curls easily as well (but I mostly just used it for straightening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an on off switch and a LED light to indicate when it&#x27;s ready to use (which is about 30 seconds - it&#x27;s super fast).  It&#x27;s also dual voltage, which is fantastic when I travel (you just need to provide a plug adapter for the outlet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely worth the money.  If you are in need of a styler to use every day, invest in this one!</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal! Very pleased with it. I had it registered on the official site of GHD and its the real deal :)</li>
            <li> This is the second GHD I&#x27;ve bought off amazon in the last 6 months - 1 for my sister and 1 for me!!! I truely LOVE them... you can&#x27;t beat a GHD (Good Hair Day)... I was in both cases afraid of it being a fake as some reviews stated. Both times I took the advice to go to &#x27;buying options&#x27; and to ensure you are getting it direct from Amazon...  they registered fine.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product 100% you will never go back to any other brand, they are so fine! I Love the GHD&#x27;s and they are not wrong - I always have Good Hair Day&#x27;s!!!:)......weather permitting...! : )&lt;br /&gt;I live in Australia and the only thing other expence was an adapter! which was fine!!! :)... I LOVE GHD!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying a GHD iron because of the rumors about fakes. However, I saved $90 by buying this from Amazon (Amazon fulfilled, not third party) and it was an actual GHD product.  I registered, with ease, on GHD website to prove authenticity. Thanks Amazon!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used!  plus, I can curl with it!  I registered it online and activated the guarantee.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Authentic and really high up in the hair straightener choices. And at a good price! I got tired of worrying about burning my hair so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Hello everyone!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m from Spain, and this product is so much more expensive here than in the USA, so I was afraid of the fake items sold throught the Internet. Even so I decided to buy this one, and a Remington curl wand (throught amazon.com too) and I have to say that I&#x27;m really happy with it because this brand is amazing. You get perfect hairstyles with very proffessional finishing touchs. I recommend this item to everybody who has a very messy and untameable hair like me!</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried with buying a GHD hair straightener over the internet and i thought the cheaper price was too good to be true, but i was able to do some research and was delighted to discover that the GHD i was sent was a genuine product, it works great.</li>
            <li> This is not an authentic styler and is a knock off. It was made in PRC vs. South Korea or England. The Official GHD website would not register it.</li>
            <li> Literally the best flat iron I have used to date. The heat is always consistent no matter if my hair is wet or dry. I love how it heats up and beeps as soon as its ready in 30 seconds or so. I only have to spend one pass in each section.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she tells me that she like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;It performs just as describes by the advertiser.</li>
            <li> I was replacing this with my previous ghd which I got for full price and worked great for years.. Though i was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews, but couldn&#x27;t resist because of the price.. I checked the product the minute I got it and went online and found out I got the original..</li>
            <li> These are fake, I got these as a Christmas presents, after 3 months theyve stopped working, tried to register them on the Ghd website, it said code wasnt known...Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and I registered it online and it seems to be authentic.  The price was great so I was a little nervous from what other reviewers said.  Now, I have bought my daughter MULTIPLE other straighteners over the years--she is biracial and her hair is a little &amp;#34;poofy.&amp;#34;  She told me that she feels this only works a little better than the $20 ones I have bought her in the past.  Hopefully, for the price, it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> The GHD Classic is a basic home use flat iron. It does the job but if you want something better, I would choose the professional or the eclipse version of it. All of them have the smart ship sensor in it to heat up evenly to 365 degrees, which is the perfect temperature for your hair not to be burned and the shine come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a great warranty, excellent customer service and the product quality is awesome. Though I would recommend to buy it from your hair stylist as they get it from their local beauty supply store for a better prize, plus some of the stores offer free return and exchange for the warranty period of 2 years in store, taking away the hassle of calling customer service or waiting for the replacement to arrive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 3.5 years now (I ordered from this exact listing as well). I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fake or real but either way it is the best flat iron I have ever used. I have fine thin hard to straighten and curl hair and it works perfect on me plus on my mom with thick curly hair. It is still working great, so it lasts a long time. If it ever does go out on me I will be repurchasing the same one!!</li>
            <li> I love it,it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works good! Nice lil &amp;#34;hello&amp;#34; beep when it&#x27;s turned on. Solid, even, sufficient heat but not scalding. Glides through the hair smoothly with a good feel. Features automatic shut off and extra long 9 ft cord too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality flat iron all around. Will update in a few months to report on it&#x27;s durability after regular use.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron!  It heats up so fast, doesn&#x27;t damage hair and straightens like a dream.  Much better than other brands I have tried.  Really a great flat iron that works well.  Oh, an mine seems to be authentic, I checked for all the red flags and didn&#x27;t find any.  Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews before I ordered, and I almost didn&#x27;t order at all.  The price was so good, I was really doubtful it would be a true GHD.  But, it was coming directly from Amazon, not just fulfilled or a third party, so I thought just give it a shot, mentally prepared it might be fake.  I got it yesterday, registered it with GHD with no problems.  Used it this morning, and it works fabulously.  If you order from Amazon, LLC you will not be disappointed, but be careful of “fulfilled” or “third party”.  Hope this review helps someone questioning the authenticity as I was.</li>
            <li> It was real !! It registered and everything! My wife loves it</li>
            <li> Best straightner I&#x27;ve ever used. Heats up QUICK. Perfect for straightning, curls, or beach waves. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about ordering this flat iron due to rumors I had heard that it may be an imitation. It arrived on time and I&#x27;m very satisfied. It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> This came without the hologram card with an official GHD product code so it is most likely fake, making the price tag way too high. I&#x27;m appalled Amazon allows knockoffs to be sold on it&#x27;s site. Seems like it could be a legal issue.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great quality and safety features.</li>
            <li> I received the classic styler by GHD today and it is 100% authentic.  I registered it on the GHD website and the registration was confirmed.  This styler retails for $185 and Amazon had it for $109.&lt;br /&gt;It works great!  Make sure to order from Amazon and not a third party.</li>
            <li> Was not able to register this product on the manufacturer&#x27;s website, leading me to believe it was a fake.</li>
            <li> Love it! Heats up quickly and smooths my frizzy parts great!</li>
            <li> The BEST straightener. Nice and hot. Auto turn off if you forget. Nice quality</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t checked to see if its registered and original, but it is phenomenal! Love it</li>
            <li> I was just replacing the one I had. Great Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> This straightener is pretty nice.... I think I like the Chi more... but this one works a step below a Chi</li>
            <li> My sister owned one of these and I tried hers out when she visited.  It put my flatiron to shame and was worth every penny.  It smooths the hair far and easily and heats up quickly.  I&#x27;ve owned one for about a year now and am very satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> I received an authentic straightener. While I like it, it is not any better than my old Paul Mitchell one. It does heat up within seconds which is really nice.</li>
            <li> We ordered this from Amazon because it looked like a really good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some people said that this is fake I was a skeptic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife who owns a GHD and refuse to go with any other band looked at this order and said it is fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We returned this and ordered a new from the manufacturer’s website and she is happy with that order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how quick it heats up, plug it in and 10 seconds it is beeping. Works great on my hair and leaves a beautiful shine. I have purchased other flat irons for a lot more money and am really impressed with this one.  I was nervous after reading some of the reviews that this maybe a fake. That wasn&#x27;t the case. As soon as I received it, I went on line and was able to register it with GHD  with no problems. I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> gets hot very quickly and it double beeps to tell you when it&#x27;s ready, which is very nice.  however if you leave it on for awhile, it continuously beeps which is pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to register this product, but it works perfectly. It gets super hot really fast and straightens my crazy curly har. I love this iron.</li>
            <li> I just retired my 6 year old CHI and initially got a CHI replacement but it just did not feel like my old CHI. I knew then that I had to look for that perfect flat iron that I&#x27;ve been used to. Well, I found it with this GHD Classic Styler. It heats up fast and takes just one quick swipe to straighten my curly hair. It is an amazing iron without any unnecessary frills. Flat iron does damage the hair so keeping it to a minimum is the best thing to do and don&#x27;t think that paying extra for temp. adjustment and other frills will somehow be less damaging. Stick to this basic one and you will be so happy! Also, I did buy this iron from Amazon itself and was able to register it without any problems.</li>
            <li> You me the nicest greeting and thank you for your dealings upscale&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will deal with you thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will deal with you</li>
    </ol>
