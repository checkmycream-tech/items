            <li>and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>you will fall in love with this cream!</li>
            <li>I love how well this lotion works!</li>
            <li>but this is amazing.</li>
            <li>Has ingredients that are great for the skin but did not see a huge improvement in stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I bought this because there appeared to be many good reviews about it</li>
            <li>Well I just need to stop ordering all this kind of stuff</li>
            <li>RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING IN MY REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND HAS NOT BEEN INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY</li>
            <li>, after about two weeks of usage of the Sieva Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream, I can honestly say that I CAN notice a difference.</li>
            <li>it smell nice, quite remind me orange zest.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Kind of citrusy.  </li>
            <li>a guy so can&#x27;t say how it works on stretch marks from pregnancy, but as for newer surgical scars, wait for your doctor&#x27;s approval and take before and after photos for your own peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I tried this cream and honestly I saw results in a week.</li>
            <li>It is made with shea butter, cocoa butter, olive oil, jojoba oil, rose hip oil, and</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using this product it worked great!!</li>
            <li>it has pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this cream, it significantly reduces stretch marks!</li>
            <li>Wow, perfect combination.</li>
            <li>i liked its lovely smell  and how it works on my skin.  </li>
            <li>, I tried to many but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>Natural product with great results!</li>
            <li>product overall has a nice smell and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It is very pleasant and natural smelling.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all high quality and each have properties on their own to help, but together they make a great combo.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Aloe juice, shea, cocoa and mango butters, organic olive oil, rose hip seed oil, if I made a list of all my favorite and most effective skin care components, it would include everything in this generously sized jar.&lt;br /&gt;There is even a bit of orange oil, giving a light, refreshing scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions are also easy to read and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this cream for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>Been using it for more than 3 weeks but still no results.</li>
            <li>I had so many stretch marks</li>
            <li>but none of the creams I was gifted worked for me.</li>
            <li>This cream, however, sure works wonders.</li>
            <li>I glad I bought this cream.</li>
            <li>This lotion is non greasy and has a nice light smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff is more than a stretch mark cream.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks seem more hydrated and look better than they did before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a miracle ingredient as it helps the nutrients in the rest of the product absorb better, as well as having antioxidant and disinfecting/antiseptic properties.</li>
            <li>It goes on luxuriously silky, lovely scent, and</li>
            <li>this product is way more affordable than the Mederma</li>
            <li>I love the citrus scent as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>Then you may want to try out this product and see if you can get results just I was able to get.</li>
            <li>but i wish is worked better then it smells</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use to see if the marks will fade more.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this cream.  </li>
            <li>I love that because once I use a lotion or ointment</li>
            <li>~ I received my order in a very timely manner, packaging was great and the product was sealed for safety.</li>
            <li>I have used this for about a month and it is an okay product.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging of the product and how the ingredients are listed on the front.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>5 stars very worth it!</li>
            <li>Excited about the combination of ingredients for my skin!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>They are noticeable still, but have faded significantly in just 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>Happy so far!</li>
            <li>So many awesome active ingredients that helped reduce the visibility of my stretch mark.</li>
            <li>so far this product has seemed to work great for me.</li>
            <li>most importantly, it works.</li>
            <li>Thankful to be able to try this one risk free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with this product I have noticed some help in my scars so far</li>
            <li>We received it in the mail very quickly.</li>
            <li>Is it safe for pregnant womanï¼Ÿ</li>
            <li>This is a huge help in the fight against her stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and has a nice citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But it not only works for stretch marks, its great for surgery, rosacea, acne Scars, &amp; blemishes.</li>
            <li>I have received this for free to review.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I received this for free......</li>
            <li>but I really like how it leaves my skin nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter makes this feel so smooth on your body too.</li>
            <li>As someone that regularly creates her own skin preparations, after reading the list of ingredients, this is one spectacular</li>
            <li>but they definitely fill all the way up to the top!!</li>
            <li>Very effective, i buy this all the time...and definitely will recommend.</li>
            <li>Worth to buy!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>It has a rich creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping for more positive results.</li>
            <li>far I have to say I am pleased with the results, the first thing I noticed because I am sensitive to it on a good day and even more now is the scent.</li>
            <li>I bought it when they had the buy 1 get 1 special.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working amazing</li>
            <li>I think to get full results</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>For my full review please go to [...]</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I am always very iffy about stretch mark creams because most &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; say that there is no way to get them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so much lighter now that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see them if I was looking at them in the mirror across the room.</li>
            <li>I am so amazed by this, I bought it and a week later I saw big results for stretch marks, very happy</li>
            <li>I put some on my hands really quick go test it</li>
            <li>The next thing I noticed was how nice it went on, smooth</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs into my skin very quickly, and my skin feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first ever stretch mark cream to show results!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see the stretch marks on my legs or boobs like at all....and the ones on my tummy are so much lighter!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34; Massage into skin using a circular motion until absorbed of brush on in even layers with a fan brush&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is effective in even a short amount of time</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the scar to appear to look more even toned to my natural skin complexion.</li>
            <li>I am going completely nuclear when it comes to getting rid of the last of my stretch marks, so I was happy when I received this product.</li>
            <li>This wonderful smelling cream, in conjunction with the derma roller has completely decreased that &#x27;raised&amp;#34; feeling of stretch marks on my sides.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who they paid to give them 5 stars, but this isn&#x27;t worth a damn.</li>
            <li>very easy to apply and seems to be working very well so far.</li>
            <li>It is thick and smells good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wear off&amp;#34; like some other creams I&#x27;ve tried--once the marks have faded, they&#x27;re faded for good.</li>
            <li>Didnt work for me, maybe I wasnt using it right</li>
            <li>It really faded the stretch marks I have on the sides of my belly and the scars are looking less noticeable which makes me happy.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied because the product itself leaves my skin baby soft and the ingredient list is amazing because I actually know everything on it!</li>
            <li>My stretch mark are already very light and almost the same color as my skin</li>
            <li>it reduces the color of the stretch mark and scars, will leave your skin soft and smooth without uneasy feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>and I think it is pretty evenly tied with the outcome.</li>
            <li>but I am seeing results after just two weeks of using the cream consistently.</li>
            <li>I habe four children which left me with many stretch marks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>put this on every day before bed and feel so much better about my face the next morning.</li>
            <li>On the recommendation of a friend who used Sieva while she was expecting I got my first jar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed because prior to this I had tried several different products ranging from creams to silicon tapes.</li>
            <li>but they have always felt rough so this was a nice change to that roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(first I gained a lot, then lost a lot--</li>
            <li>this will cure your scars/stretch marks&#x27; but no kidding after just a week of use a burn scar on my arm has drastically faded, and since I&#x27;m currently pregnant I&#x27;ve used it to replace my normal cocoa butter routine to try to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I would honestly recommend other to try</li>
            <li>I only tried this product because it mentioned MONEY BACK GUARANTEE and all of the reviews were good</li>
            <li>It was at that time that I used a mild almond scrub (just a generic brand from the grocery store) and was amazed how it smoothed right out!  </li>
            <li>product is worth a try, I was given a sample to review, and after using, I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that by June, in full fledged bikini season, my stretch marks will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>So with that being said I will continue to use this product and not waste any more money on the other products that just wasnt a fit for me</li>
            <li>I have had two children and young while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Within 2 days of use I could physically see a huge difference in the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>When applying I don&#x27;t need to use much product and after massaging it into the skin it leaves a very silky finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to keep using it, but I&#x27;m really encouraged by what I have seen by using it for a month.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s a quote straight from your label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the kinda of results I received.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it might sound ominous, it&#x27;s actually a low-viscosity emollient derived from coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Now.....as you can imagine gaining that much weight caused a LOT of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fast absorbing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with how well the Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Removal Cream works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this cream.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of times you could really see an improvement.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>But for the newer one, after a month of use it seems to have worked very well.  </li>
            <li>They are real.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and i see that the stretch marks are lighting up it really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cream to moisturize and help remove scars!</li>
            <li>that is very moisturizing but does not feel sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now just working on keeping it off) and this cream faded the very, *</li>
            <li>What I REALLY like about this product, though, is its ingredients.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>Not only is it disappearing, but the surrounding skin is soft and more supple.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>My skin feels totally smooth, and my stretch marks are fading slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>and by the time I got pregnant with my second child, I still had not lost all of the baby weight from the first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This cream works pretty good, and the way it smells isnt bad also :).</li>
            <li>I have been using Sieva&#x27;s Stretch Mark and Scar Cream for quite some time now and my fiery red scars have faded significantly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue and it dries quickly, the scent is a little unappealing but besides that best product on the market.</li>
            <li>For the older one, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much difference.  </li>
            <li>Along with being newly pregnant and having a variety of small scars because of being a rough and tumble girl all of my life I thought it would be a good</li>
            <li>I am lucky enough not to have the super deep</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream and have just started using it on my stomach area while I am pregnant with my second child.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample to review, and after using, I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to friends and family who have scars or stretchmarks they are self-conscious about.</li>
            <li>Opinions are my own and come only after extensive personal use.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, if we apply it a few more times, his stretch marks will keep fading.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cream is a nice thick texture.</li>
            <li>I started out on her scar and so far, it already looks lighter and less prominent.</li>
            <li>I also have a scar from surgery on the back of right leg that is about well</li>
            <li>I usually go right back to a project or</li>
            <li>I bought this for my five year old cousin awhile back because he had gotten a huge gash from falling which left an intense scar on his face.</li>
            <li>I have stretch marks on the top of my thighs and also a few on my belly from pregnancy that are about 17 years old</li>
            <li>(I gained a little bit of weight pretty quickly</li>
            <li>very soft feeling on the skin</li>
            <li>imma going to keep using an see if there are any changes ill give it a little bit more time...smells good though an came on timeâ™¡</li>
            <li>shady, like so many products on amazon.</li>
            <li>With my first pregnancy I gained about 75 pounds (!)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I do NOT have before and after pictures because I am embarrassed and would rather not post pictures of my naked body all over the internet...</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many products that claimed to work and was not able to ever get the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My daughter was a little more rambunctious than my other kids, and the scar on her forehead just proves that.</li>
            <li>In just a weeks time you could tell a huge difference and they stretch marks became less noticeable.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I was not very health conscious while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>So far its not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see results.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work on me, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li>; Avoid direct contact with eyes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have applied it twice on my abdomen with old stretchmark&#x27;s and it has not helped at all.</li>
            <li>and it made my hands like baby soft without that greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I even started to put it on my old acne scars and it even out my skin.</li>
            <li>Are you looking for a product that will help reduce or completely diminish you stretch marks and scars?</li>
            <li>It is made of all natural ingredients which she loves.</li>
            <li>I have scars on my tummy from my surgery early this year (2014) and I have used a well endorsed brand to help the scar marks fade - to no avail.</li>
            <li>and my skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work on old scars as advertised.</li>
            <li>for this marks disappear  complete</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are about 17 years old and have faded a lot over the years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a road rash scar on my arm since I was a kid, and it&#x27;s nearly gone now.</li>
            <li>A while back, after a surgery, I used a popular scar cream, not nearly as effective as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must say, happily, they are wrong!</li>
            <li>I have got many scars due to my kitchen skill and have stretch marks too due to pregnancy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works on not only new but old stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Thick formula is easy to apply and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I only used it for few days and noticed smooth skin around my C-section scar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s FDA approved, &amp; Paraben and Cruelty Free.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is made with a special Collagen-Fix Skin Repair Complex which helps repair the skin&#x27;s natural process and reduce the skin</li>
            <li>unlike different product that ive tried.&lt;br /&gt;its not sticky and feels soft.</li>
            <li>Sieva Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Removal Cream Review is made from a mixture of Vitamins and natural moisturizers such as Shea butter, Cocoa butter, Olive oil, Jojoba oil, and Rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>but when you run your fingers across them you can barely feel them.</li>
            <li>I feel like with continued use, my scar marks that have been making me feel so self conscious, will totally go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced that anything can actually get rid of stretch marks completely.</li>
            <li>It made the scarring much worse and a lot more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I had several stretch marks due to me gaining a lot of weight very fast.</li>
            <li>I am 29 weeks pregnant and have very little stretch marks use this because it keeps me moisturized even when applied at night.</li>
            <li>I thought this cream was gonna be bullsh*t, because I had used other creams before with no results really.</li>
            <li>and I really can see difference in how my stretch marks are not as dark and noticeable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only started using the cream, so I will update with progress but from a starting point the cream is rich and thick.</li>
            <li>No harsh smells, and a scar on my hand is disappearing after long last.</li>

            <li> and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> you will fall in love with this cream!</li>
            <li> I love how well this lotion works!</li>
            <li> but this is amazing.</li>
            <li> Has ingredients that are great for the skin but did not see a huge improvement in stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this because there appeared to be many good reviews about it</li>
            <li> Well I just need to stop ordering all this kind of stuff</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING IN MY REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND HAS NOT BEEN INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY</li>
            <li> , after about two weeks of usage of the Sieva Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream, I can honestly say that I CAN notice a difference.</li>
            <li> it smell nice, quite remind me orange zest.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Kind of citrusy.  </li>
            <li> a guy so can&#x27;t say how it works on stretch marks from pregnancy, but as for newer surgical scars, wait for your doctor&#x27;s approval and take before and after photos for your own peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I tried this cream and honestly I saw results in a week.</li>
            <li> It is made with shea butter, cocoa butter, olive oil, jojoba oil, rose hip oil, and</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using this product it worked great!!</li>
            <li> it has pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this cream, it significantly reduces stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Wow, perfect combination.</li>
            <li> i liked its lovely smell  and how it works on my skin.  </li>
            <li> , I tried to many but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> Natural product with great results!</li>
            <li> product overall has a nice smell and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It is very pleasant and natural smelling.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all high quality and each have properties on their own to help, but together they make a great combo.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Aloe juice, shea, cocoa and mango butters, organic olive oil, rose hip seed oil, if I made a list of all my favorite and most effective skin care components, it would include everything in this generously sized jar.&lt;br /&gt;There is even a bit of orange oil, giving a light, refreshing scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions are also easy to read and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this cream for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Been using it for more than 3 weeks but still no results.</li>
            <li> I had so many stretch marks</li>
            <li> but none of the creams I was gifted worked for me.</li>
            <li> This cream, however, sure works wonders.</li>
            <li> I glad I bought this cream.</li>
            <li> This lotion is non greasy and has a nice light smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is more than a stretch mark cream.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks seem more hydrated and look better than they did before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a miracle ingredient as it helps the nutrients in the rest of the product absorb better, as well as having antioxidant and disinfecting/antiseptic properties.</li>
            <li> It goes on luxuriously silky, lovely scent, and</li>
            <li> this product is way more affordable than the Mederma</li>
            <li> I love the citrus scent as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Then you may want to try out this product and see if you can get results just I was able to get.</li>
            <li> but i wish is worked better then it smells</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use to see if the marks will fade more.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this cream.  </li>
            <li> I love that because once I use a lotion or ointment</li>
            <li> ~ I received my order in a very timely manner, packaging was great and the product was sealed for safety.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and it is an okay product.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging of the product and how the ingredients are listed on the front.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> 5 stars very worth it!</li>
            <li> Excited about the combination of ingredients for my skin!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> They are noticeable still, but have faded significantly in just 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Happy so far!</li>
            <li> So many awesome active ingredients that helped reduce the visibility of my stretch mark.</li>
            <li> so far this product has seemed to work great for me.</li>
            <li> most importantly, it works.</li>
            <li> Thankful to be able to try this one risk free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product I have noticed some help in my scars so far</li>
            <li> We received it in the mail very quickly.</li>
            <li> Is it safe for pregnant womanï¼Ÿ</li>
            <li> This is a huge help in the fight against her stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and has a nice citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But it not only works for stretch marks, its great for surgery, rosacea, acne Scars, &amp; blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have received this for free to review.</li>
            <li> It has a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I received this for free......</li>
            <li> but I really like how it leaves my skin nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter makes this feel so smooth on your body too.</li>
            <li> As someone that regularly creates her own skin preparations, after reading the list of ingredients, this is one spectacular</li>
            <li> but they definitely fill all the way up to the top!!</li>
            <li> Very effective, i buy this all the time...and definitely will recommend.</li>
            <li> Worth to buy!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> It has a rich creamy texture.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping for more positive results.</li>
            <li> far I have to say I am pleased with the results, the first thing I noticed because I am sensitive to it on a good day and even more now is the scent.</li>
            <li> I bought it when they had the buy 1 get 1 special.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working amazing</li>
            <li> I think to get full results</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> For my full review please go to [...]</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I am always very iffy about stretch mark creams because most &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; say that there is no way to get them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so much lighter now that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see them if I was looking at them in the mirror across the room.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed by this, I bought it and a week later I saw big results for stretch marks, very happy</li>
            <li> I put some on my hands really quick go test it</li>
            <li> The next thing I noticed was how nice it went on, smooth</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs into my skin very quickly, and my skin feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first ever stretch mark cream to show results!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see the stretch marks on my legs or boobs like at all....and the ones on my tummy are so much lighter!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34; Massage into skin using a circular motion until absorbed of brush on in even layers with a fan brush&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is effective in even a short amount of time</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the scar to appear to look more even toned to my natural skin complexion.</li>
            <li> I am going completely nuclear when it comes to getting rid of the last of my stretch marks, so I was happy when I received this product.</li>
            <li> This wonderful smelling cream, in conjunction with the derma roller has completely decreased that &#x27;raised&amp;#34; feeling of stretch marks on my sides.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who they paid to give them 5 stars, but this isn&#x27;t worth a damn.</li>
            <li> very easy to apply and seems to be working very well so far.</li>
            <li> It is thick and smells good!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wear off&amp;#34; like some other creams I&#x27;ve tried--once the marks have faded, they&#x27;re faded for good.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me, maybe I wasnt using it right</li>
            <li> It really faded the stretch marks I have on the sides of my belly and the scars are looking less noticeable which makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied because the product itself leaves my skin baby soft and the ingredient list is amazing because I actually know everything on it!</li>
            <li> My stretch mark are already very light and almost the same color as my skin</li>
            <li> it reduces the color of the stretch mark and scars, will leave your skin soft and smooth without uneasy feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> and I think it is pretty evenly tied with the outcome.</li>
            <li> but I am seeing results after just two weeks of using the cream consistently.</li>
            <li> I habe four children which left me with many stretch marks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> put this on every day before bed and feel so much better about my face the next morning.</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of a friend who used Sieva while she was expecting I got my first jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed because prior to this I had tried several different products ranging from creams to silicon tapes.</li>
            <li> but they have always felt rough so this was a nice change to that roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (first I gained a lot, then lost a lot--</li>
            <li> this will cure your scars/stretch marks&#x27; but no kidding after just a week of use a burn scar on my arm has drastically faded, and since I&#x27;m currently pregnant I&#x27;ve used it to replace my normal cocoa butter routine to try to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I would honestly recommend other to try</li>
            <li> I only tried this product because it mentioned MONEY BACK GUARANTEE and all of the reviews were good</li>
            <li> It was at that time that I used a mild almond scrub (just a generic brand from the grocery store) and was amazed how it smoothed right out!  </li>
            <li> product is worth a try, I was given a sample to review, and after using, I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that by June, in full fledged bikini season, my stretch marks will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> So with that being said I will continue to use this product and not waste any more money on the other products that just wasnt a fit for me</li>
            <li> I have had two children and young while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days of use I could physically see a huge difference in the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> When applying I don&#x27;t need to use much product and after massaging it into the skin it leaves a very silky finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to keep using it, but I&#x27;m really encouraged by what I have seen by using it for a month.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a quote straight from your label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the kinda of results I received.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it might sound ominous, it&#x27;s actually a low-viscosity emollient derived from coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Now.....as you can imagine gaining that much weight caused a LOT of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s fast absorbing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with how well the Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Removal Cream works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this cream.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of times you could really see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> But for the newer one, after a month of use it seems to have worked very well.  </li>
            <li> They are real.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and i see that the stretch marks are lighting up it really works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cream to moisturize and help remove scars!</li>
            <li> that is very moisturizing but does not feel sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now just working on keeping it off) and this cream faded the very, *</li>
            <li> What I REALLY like about this product, though, is its ingredients.  </li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> Not only is it disappearing, but the surrounding skin is soft and more supple.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> My skin feels totally smooth, and my stretch marks are fading slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> and by the time I got pregnant with my second child, I still had not lost all of the baby weight from the first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This cream works pretty good, and the way it smells isnt bad also :).</li>
            <li> I have been using Sieva&#x27;s Stretch Mark and Scar Cream for quite some time now and my fiery red scars have faded significantly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue and it dries quickly, the scent is a little unappealing but besides that best product on the market.</li>
            <li> For the older one, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much difference.  </li>
            <li> Along with being newly pregnant and having a variety of small scars because of being a rough and tumble girl all of my life I thought it would be a good</li>
            <li> I am lucky enough not to have the super deep</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream and have just started using it on my stomach area while I am pregnant with my second child.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample to review, and after using, I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to friends and family who have scars or stretchmarks they are self-conscious about.</li>
            <li> Opinions are my own and come only after extensive personal use.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, if we apply it a few more times, his stretch marks will keep fading.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cream is a nice thick texture.</li>
            <li> I started out on her scar and so far, it already looks lighter and less prominent.</li>
            <li> I also have a scar from surgery on the back of right leg that is about well</li>
            <li> I usually go right back to a project or</li>
            <li> I bought this for my five year old cousin awhile back because he had gotten a huge gash from falling which left an intense scar on his face.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks on the top of my thighs and also a few on my belly from pregnancy that are about 17 years old</li>
            <li> (I gained a little bit of weight pretty quickly</li>
            <li> very soft feeling on the skin</li>
            <li> imma going to keep using an see if there are any changes ill give it a little bit more time...smells good though an came on timeâ™¡</li>
            <li> shady, like so many products on amazon.</li>
            <li> With my first pregnancy I gained about 75 pounds (!)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I do NOT have before and after pictures because I am embarrassed and would rather not post pictures of my naked body all over the internet...</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many products that claimed to work and was not able to ever get the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My daughter was a little more rambunctious than my other kids, and the scar on her forehead just proves that.</li>
            <li> In just a weeks time you could tell a huge difference and they stretch marks became less noticeable.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I was not very health conscious while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> So far its not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work on me, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li> ; Avoid direct contact with eyes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have applied it twice on my abdomen with old stretchmark&#x27;s and it has not helped at all.</li>
            <li> and it made my hands like baby soft without that greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I even started to put it on my old acne scars and it even out my skin.</li>
            <li> Are you looking for a product that will help reduce or completely diminish you stretch marks and scars?</li>
            <li> It is made of all natural ingredients which she loves.</li>
            <li> I have scars on my tummy from my surgery early this year (2014) and I have used a well endorsed brand to help the scar marks fade - to no avail.</li>
            <li> and my skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on old scars as advertised.</li>
            <li> for this marks disappear  complete</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are about 17 years old and have faded a lot over the years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a road rash scar on my arm since I was a kid, and it&#x27;s nearly gone now.</li>
            <li> A while back, after a surgery, I used a popular scar cream, not nearly as effective as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say, happily, they are wrong!</li>
            <li> I have got many scars due to my kitchen skill and have stretch marks too due to pregnancy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works on not only new but old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Thick formula is easy to apply and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I only used it for few days and noticed smooth skin around my C-section scar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s FDA approved, &amp; Paraben and Cruelty Free.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is made with a special Collagen-Fix Skin Repair Complex which helps repair the skin&#x27;s natural process and reduce the skin</li>
            <li> unlike different product that ive tried.&lt;br /&gt;its not sticky and feels soft.</li>
            <li> Sieva Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Removal Cream Review is made from a mixture of Vitamins and natural moisturizers such as Shea butter, Cocoa butter, Olive oil, Jojoba oil, and Rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> but when you run your fingers across them you can barely feel them.</li>
            <li> I feel like with continued use, my scar marks that have been making me feel so self conscious, will totally go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that anything can actually get rid of stretch marks completely.</li>
            <li> It made the scarring much worse and a lot more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I had several stretch marks due to me gaining a lot of weight very fast.</li>
            <li> I am 29 weeks pregnant and have very little stretch marks use this because it keeps me moisturized even when applied at night.</li>
            <li> I thought this cream was gonna be bullsh*t, because I had used other creams before with no results really.</li>
            <li> and I really can see difference in how my stretch marks are not as dark and noticeable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using the cream, so I will update with progress but from a starting point the cream is rich and thick.</li>
            <li> No harsh smells, and a scar on my hand is disappearing after long last.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; has old stretch marks for months now on his arms due to working out and weight training.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy into the whole &#x27;</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference but maybe did not stick with it long enough</li>
            <li> it is not near as red and &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34; looking as it was 2 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I have used it every single day (sometimes just once, sometimes several times depending on how often I am home that day)</li>
            <li> After using it daily for several months my spots are a lot less obvious.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to choose a cream for a surgery scar I have on my neck.</li>
            <li> did try this product for my stretch marks and didn&#x27;t see any results which was strange.</li>
            <li> Well I used it twice everyday like it recommended, and my stretch marks aren&#x27;t completely faded.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no miracle cream, but I think it may work considerably after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> , it did get rid of some tiny strech marks though, but other than that it didnt .</li>
            <li> I only used it 3 times as after the 3rd time it caused a little tenderness</li>
            <li> She is having a second surgery this summer on her other foot and this will be a</li>
            <li> /&gt;The raised keloid on the left side went down considerably after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This definitely worked better and was less expensive than other stretch mark creams!</li>
            <li> She just had foot surgery right before Christmas and has a really nasty looking scar on the top of her foot.  </li>
            <li> The scars and stretch marks are also not only less visible</li>
            <li> They seem less red and almost blurred, so that&#x27;s why I gave this product a 4 star.</li>
            <li> very thick cream , not absorbing really into skin.</li>
            <li> I am beyond curious to see the result.</li>
            <li> Hopefully since I&#x27;m only 25, my stretch marks will fade over time but this product proved to be a waste of time and money for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how the changes over the next few weeks to come.</li>
            <li> for myself, I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; on the back of my legs and my stomach stretch marks feel much softer and a little less visible.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which soaks volumes in terms of value.</li>
            <li> Little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complain is it&#x27;s very little product</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other creams to try to reduce the scar and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have itchy or redness as other creams.</li>
            <li> I am using it on scars I have on my legs due do an accident.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> It takes time to work just like any other cream you would buy does.</li>
            <li> I tried this product 2 times a day for 2 weeks and had very minimal results with my scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> So far not much has changed with my stretch marks but nothing has gotten worse</li>
            <li> Very disappointed since is showed good reviews .It says 100 % guarantee</li>
            <li> I was really shocked at how quickly it started working!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first but figured what could it hurt to try</li>
            <li> Iv been using it for a week heavily like day &amp; night putting a thick layer on my stomach an nothing so far not even a little bit...</li>
            <li> Helps dark stretch marks lighten up</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne my whole life, unfortunately still do to this day.</li>
            <li> I generously put the cream on the entire scar, using it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks in a half</li>
            <li> The bottom newer scar is still visible but much less</li>
            <li> Been using it for a little while now</li>
            <li> I thought that It would come in a little sample size jar</li>
            <li> It does not contain any chemicals, fillers, binders, or artificial ingredients and is 100% pure and organic.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> tired of using different cream</li>
            <li> going to update at in few weeks.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Once I reviced this product I applied it my back shoulders and chest a thin layer for about a week.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few creams like cocoa butter and lanolin oil to no avail.</li>
            <li> a few stretch marks is an understatement.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I started to see a lighter change in color of my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t even seen a slight change!</li>
            <li> Not worth the $30 ill never get back</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t read the directions ,because the letters are too small to read</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really looks so awful, after using 1 bottle of this product, that I&#x27;ve been using for almost 2 months, I&#x27;ve seen changes on my scar, it&#x27;s lighten up, and gets smaller.</li>
            <li> IT smells weird, has a weird texture, and has too much menthol.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything really helps at least not these types of creams  :(</li>
            <li> but then had a hard time finding it again.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or sticky in the least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thick.</li>
            <li> Other reviews must be fake</li>
            <li> use a very small amount, about the size of a pea.  </li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> but this product did no good for me</li>
            <li> If your looking for a pure and 100% ORGANIC way to rid yourself of those nasty stretch marks and scars after pregnancy, then this product is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and it has not caused any side effects or poor reactions to my skin.</li>
            <li> and it soaked into the skin well without leaving a greasy residue behind.</li>
            <li> im a little disappointed</li>
            <li> But having acne means getting the terrible red scars all over my face.</li>
            <li> I buy stretch mark creams like crazy, I like the fact that it does not smell like coco butter.</li>
            <li> I had sun damage on my arms that was so bad that i considered having my arms lasered.</li>
            <li> There is no miracle in this bottle :-(</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m using just once a day and is gone is just 2 1/2 weeks. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and smells horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is great. I had several stretch marks due to me gaining a lot of weight very fast. In just a weeks time you could tell a huge difference and they stretch marks became less noticeable. This is the second time I purchased this.</li>
            <li> This feels great on the skin! Excited about the combination of ingredients for my skin! Will update in a month on how it works!</li>
            <li> Wow, perfect combination. The first ever stretch mark cream to show results! It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue and it dries quickly, the scent is a little unappealing but besides that best product on the market. Keep it up guys!</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels nice on skin. Been using it for more than 3 weeks but still no results.</li>
            <li> Going from 110 to 190 with my last pregnancy I got a lot of stretch marks!!! And this stuff is amazing!!  You can&#x27;t see the stretch marks on my legs or boobs like at all....and the ones on my tummy are so much lighter!! Will continue using this product forever!!!</li>
            <li> . I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I love it! It&#x27;s extremely thick. It has a consistency that is comparable to a body butter. When applying I don&#x27;t need to use much product and after massaging it into the skin it leaves a very silky finish. Not greasy or sticky in the least. I give this one two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for review. Opinions are my own and come only after extensive personal use.</li>
            <li> I bought this because there appeared to be many good reviews about it and it seemed like it was sold for a good price. My fianc&amp;eacute; has old stretch marks for months now on his arms due to working out and weight training. The stretch marks seem to have worsened and reddened over the course of the months so we thought it was time to buy a stretch mark cream for him. We received it in the mail very quickly. He used it last night and by this morning, the redness of the stretch marks were gone. I should have bought this during and after my pregnancy. I had so many stretch marks but none of the creams I was gifted worked for me. This cream, however, sure works wonders. Hopefully, if we apply it a few more times, his stretch marks will keep fading.</li>
            <li> This stretch mark and scar removal cream feels so awesome on my skin! Sieva generously sent me this for review, and I&#x27;m in love! No harsh smells, and a scar on my hand is disappearing after long last. I think to get full results I&#x27;ll need to keep using it, but I&#x27;m really encouraged by what I have seen by using it for a month.</li>
            <li> Great is working well!</li>
            <li> I glad I bought this cream. It smells really good and I did notice an instant change on my skin on the 1st application. I am hoping for more positive results. I would recommend to anyone with skin issues.</li>
            <li> Definetly a scam. Doesn&#x27;t work and smells horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Feb 22 and got it 2 days later. I have used it every single day (sometimes just once, sometimes several times depending on how often I am home that day) I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in stretch marks (I gained a little bit of weight pretty quickly so I have some stretch marks on my hips) it does smell nice and isn&#x27;t greasy so thats good. I hope that by the end of the container I will see a difference..fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> very soft feeling on the skin</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are getting lighter now</li>
            <li> So far not much has changed with my stretch marks but nothing has gotten worse so I&#x27;m staying hopeful. My stretch mark are already very light and almost the same color as my skin so I know the change isn&#x27;t going to cause them to totally disappear but I do want them a tad lighter. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied because the product itself leaves my skin baby soft and the ingredient list is amazing because I actually know everything on it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product. So far its not greasy or sticky. I will continue to use it daily until i see any results and will update this review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my five year old cousin awhile back because he had gotten a huge gash from falling which left an intense scar on his face. We&#x27;ve tried other creams to try to reduce the scar and nothing worked. I was pleasantly surprised to see results. It took awhile but it&#x27;s lightening and shrinking it.</li>
            <li> so far this product has seemed to work great for me. very easy to apply and seems to be working very well so far. nice!</li>
            <li> i have stretch mark and scars from my pregnancy and C section. tired of using different cream so i stop. then i found this product  Stretch mark and scar cream. i liked its lovely smell  and how it works on my skin.  unlike different product that ive tried.&lt;br /&gt;its not sticky and feels soft. it reduces the color of the stretch mark and scars, will leave your skin soft and smooth without uneasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;this product is worth a try, I was given a sample to review, and after using, I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> Very effective, i buy this all the time...and definitely will recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!!! I had sun damage on my arms that was so bad that i considered having my arms lasered. This lotion is non greasy and has a nice light smell. After using it daily for several months my spots are a lot less obvious. Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Great product, good results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Didn&#x27;t really work on me, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t read the directions ,because the letters are too small to read</li>
            <li> very thick cream , not absorbing really into skin. feel creasy!</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and saw no change or improvement just sofents the skin for a bit and then it drys up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now on my stretch marks from having 3 babies and my stretch marks were purple, they are almost the color of my skin!! They are noticeable still, but have faded significantly in just 2 weeks! I&#x27;m shocked! This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous. You want me to trust a product for my body that had the instructions for use misspelled on the label? Why in the world should anyone trust a company that doesn&#x27;t care enough to spell check their label. There is no way  I will use this product , I don&#x27;t trust it and nor should anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a quote straight from your label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Avoid direct contact with eyes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or check out the grammar here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Massage into skin using a circular motion until absorbed of brush on in even layers with a fan brush&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expert use of the word &amp;#34;of&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its shady, like so many products on amazon. Stay away from it.</li>
            <li> Been using it and havent seen the slightest difference</li>
            <li> My friend suggest me to buy this product after giving birth now i have stretch marks, a friend of mine use this and it works great on her. i could not wait to try this.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream once before, loved it but then had a hard time finding it again. This definitely worked better and was less expensive than other stretch mark creams!</li>
            <li> The cream did nothing for me . I have applied it twice on my abdomen with old stretchmark&#x27;s and it has not helped at all. Very disappointed since is showed good reviews .It says 100 % guarantee but I cant get my money back or credited because it says 30 days are up . Well I just need to stop ordering all this kind of stuff I don&#x27;t think anything really helps at least not these types of creams  :(</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. It did remove some of the color from my deeper stretch marks, but still viable. Doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it goes on great. Thick formula is easy to apply and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It is thick and smells good!</li>
            <li> I love the smell! I buy stretch mark creams like crazy, I like the fact that it does not smell like coco butter. I am 29 weeks pregnant and have very little stretch marks use this because it keeps me moisturized even when applied at night. going to update at in few weeks.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference but maybe did not stick with it long enough</li>
            <li> Iv been using it for a week heavily like day &amp; night putting a thick layer on my stomach an nothing so far not even a little bit...imma going to keep using an see if there are any changes ill give it a little bit more time...smells good though an came on timeâ™¡</li>
            <li> I am so amazed by this, I bought it and a week later I saw big results for stretch marks, very happy I got this and I just ordered my second bottle of it! Highly recommended! 5 stars very worth it!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this and its not gressy!!</li>
            <li> Finish two containers already and no results at all ... It didnt work for me ðŸ˜¢</li>
            <li> Does nothing.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product 100% recomended.</li>
            <li> Helps dark stretch marks lighten up</li>
            <li> Great cream. Been using it for a little while now and I really like it! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is more than a stretch mark cream. it&#x27;s healing even for hands and all scars. I keep it to cure dryness. If you want to quench your skin. This cream does that and them some.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and doesn&#x27;t work. Other reviews must be fake</li>
            <li> i Loved it, non-greasy and smells good. I have 15y/o burn scar on my thigh, it&#x27;s really looks so awful, after using 1 bottle of this product, that I&#x27;ve been using for almost 2 months, I&#x27;ve seen changes on my scar, it&#x27;s lighten up, and gets smaller. I&#x27;ll defi buy another bottle. Worth to buy!</li>
            <li> Is it safe for pregnant womanï¼Ÿ</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have been using this product for about two weeks in a half and I can see my stretch marks already lighting up and fading. I am very satisfied with this product and I would recomend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me and I&#x27;m a mom of 2</li>
            <li> I put some on my hands really quick go test it and it made my hands like baby soft without that greasy feel. It smelled citrusy to me but I don&#x27;t mind it! Like jar but they definitely fill all the way up to the top!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using the cream, so I will update with progress but from a starting point the cream is rich and thick. A little goes a long way which soaks volumes in terms of value. I am optimistic about my results!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the kinda of results I received. I always had some back acne and facial acne and chest ance. I was a kid I picked at it. It made the scarring much worse and a lot more noticeable. Once I reviced this product I applied it my back shoulders and chest a thin layer for about a week. Let me tell you the results are impressive, I have to say buy far one of my best investment I have made. Recommend you give it a shot it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> My daughter was a little more rambunctious than my other kids, and the scar on her forehead just proves that. She had to have stitches and now has a scar on her face. I always worried for her, so I am always looking for a way to help fade it. I decided to give this one a try, while also using it on some stretchmarks on myself. The ingredients are all high quality and each have properties on their own to help, but together they make a great combo. I started out on her scar and so far, it already looks lighter and less prominent. My stretch marks seem more hydrated and look better than they did before. The cream is lighter than I expected, not heavy and sticky like another I tried. It is effective in even a short amount of time, I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does in 4 or 6 weeks. I highly recommend. I have already told my friends about it, I know plenty of people who need help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN MY REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND HAS NOT BEEN INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY</li>
            <li> As someone that regularly creates her own skin preparations, after reading the list of ingredients, this is one spectacular product.&lt;br /&gt;It starts with the chemical-sounding Caprylic Capric Triglyceride.&lt;br /&gt;While it might sound ominous, it&#x27;s actually a low-viscosity emollient derived from coconut oil. It&#x27;s a bit of a miracle ingredient as it helps the nutrients in the rest of the product absorb better, as well as having antioxidant and disinfecting/antiseptic properties. Grapefruit seed extract also helps recharge skin. Aloe juice, shea, cocoa and mango butters, organic olive oil, rose hip seed oil, if I made a list of all my favorite and most effective skin care components, it would include everything in this generously sized jar.&lt;br /&gt;There is even a bit of orange oil, giving a light, refreshing scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on a recently healed wound that left a scar. Not only is it disappearing, but the surrounding skin is soft and more supple. A while back, after a surgery, I used a popular scar cream, not nearly as effective as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be wonderful for pregnant women as a stretch mark belly cream. It goes on luxuriously silky, lovely scent, and most importantly, it works. I was given a sample to review, and after using, I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> It smells great!  Sadly, it is only a moisturizer.  There is no miracle in this bottle :-(</li>
            <li> I chose to use this product on my stomach area and sides. I have had two children and young while I was pregnant. With that being said, I was not very health conscious while I was pregnant. With my first pregnancy I gained about 75 pounds (!) and by the time I got pregnant with my second child, I still had not lost all of the baby weight from the first pregnancy. Then I gained about 45 pounds with my second child. Now.....as you can imagine gaining that much weight caused a LOT of stretch marks. I have tried a few creams like cocoa butter and lanolin oil to no avail. I did try the Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy but at almost $50 a tube, that just was not a feasible option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after about two weeks of usage of the Sieva Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream, I can honestly say that I CAN notice a difference. I am not saying that my stretch marks are gone and I have perfect skin! I am saying that there IS a noticeable difference. My stretch marks have lightened and are not as deep as I think they looked before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the cream once a day for about 5 days and then I upped it to twice a day after that. I will continue to use it two times a day because I think that has caused a change faster and it has not caused any side effects or poor reactions to my skin. Unfortunately, I do NOT have before and after pictures because I am embarrassed and would rather not post pictures of my naked body all over the internet...lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $25 this product is way more affordable than the Mederma and I think it is pretty evenly tied with the outcome.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a pure and 100% ORGANIC way to rid yourself of those nasty stretch marks and scars after pregnancy, then this product is the way to go. I&#x27;ve had three kids so to say that I have a few stretch marks is an understatement. Sieva Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Removal Cream Review is made from a mixture of Vitamins and natural moisturizers such as Shea butter, Cocoa butter, Olive oil, Jojoba oil, and Rosehip seed oil. There&#x27;s no chemicals! It&#x27;s FDA approved, &amp; Paraben and Cruelty Free.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is made with a special Collagen-Fix Skin Repair Complex which helps repair the skin&#x27;s natural process and reduce the skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a nice thick texture. It&#x27;s very creamy and has a nice citrus scent. I goes on smooth. And it&#x27;s fast absorbing so you don&#x27;t have to walk around with your clothes sticking to you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works on not only new but old stretch marks. I&#x27;m very please with how well the Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Removal Cream works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it not only works for stretch marks, its great for surgery, rosacea, acne Scars, &amp; blemishes. I can&#x27;t wait to use it all over!</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to test out Sieva&#x27;s stretch mark and scar cream and I LOVE IT! I usually don&#x27;t buy into the whole &#x27;this will cure your scars/stretch marks&#x27; but no kidding after just a week of use a burn scar on my arm has drastically faded, and since I&#x27;m currently pregnant I&#x27;ve used it to replace my normal cocoa butter routine to try to prevent stretch marks. I love the citrus scent as well. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I have got many scars due to my kitchen skill and have stretch marks too due to pregnancy. I am beyond curious to see the result.I have just started using it which is why the result is still not showing up. But we will see it soon.One thing I like about this cream, is that- it smell nice, quite remind me orange zest.The scent is similar to the orange facial serum I have tried before.It is moisturizing and hydrating as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the cream to reduce stretch mark / scar, then go ahead and try it. (Remember, it is not gonna give you instant result, so be patient!) I have received this for free to review.</li>
            <li> It has a light citrus scent. I loved the feel of it over my skin. Time will tell if it actually makes a difference with my stretch marks. I received the cream to review. For my full review please go to [...]</li>
            <li> This is good stuff!  I&#x27;m really liking this cream.  Within a few days I started to see a lighter change in color of my stretch marks.  I&#x27;ll be buying more ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I received this for free...... I thought that It would come in a little sample size jar but once I received this it was actually a GREAT SIZE. So many awesome active ingredients that helped reduce the visibility of my stretch mark. I would honestly recommend other to try</li>
            <li> After a week my stretch marks start to disappear. I even started to put it on my old acne scars and it even out my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, honestly is the best strech marks cream, I tried to many but this one is amazing. I don&#x27;t have itchy or redness as other creams. My only complain is it&#x27;s very little product, I&#x27;m using just once a day and is gone is just 2 1/2 weeks. :(</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Ive been using it for quite sometime now and applying it as directed and i haven&#x27;t even seen a slight change! Not worth the $30 ill never get back</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product. So often I have purchased skincare products that fall short. Thankful to be able to try this one risk free.</li>
            <li> Are you looking for a product that will help reduce or completely diminish you stretch marks and scars? Then you may want to try out this product and see if you can get results just I was able to get. I have been using this product for almost 30 days now and I really can see difference in how my stretch marks are not as dark and noticeable like they used to be. My husband&lt;br /&gt;has even commented that he can see them disappearing!!  I have stretch marks on the top of my thighs and also a few on my belly from pregnancy that are about 17 years old and I have tried so many products that claimed to work and was not able to ever get the results I was looking for. I also have a scar from surgery on the back of right leg that is about well lets just say it is from my youth and it has some age to it also and I also applied this cream daily there along with my stretch marks and again I am very pleased to say this product works. The scars and stretch marks are also not only less visible but when you run your fingers across them you can barely feel them. So with that being said I will continue to use this product and not waste any more money on the other products that just wasnt a fit for me and now I am asking you to give this product a try and see it if  this is the best match for you also!</li>
            <li> My fiance has been battling her stretch marks ever since our daughter was born. She has been using a lot of different oils and they are working but this is amazing. After one use she started seeing a difference. After a couple of times you could really see an improvement. It is made of all natural ingredients which she loves. This is a huge help in the fight against her stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> Noticed they appear just a tad lighter after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I only tried this product because it mentioned MONEY BACK GUARANTEE and all of the reviews were good but this product did no good for me i took before and after pictures but i see no difference it smells great but i wish is worked better then it smells im a little disappointed but i can say i tried it but i won&#x27;t be trying it again</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this cream from a drug store. I am using it on scars I have on my legs due do an accident. The smell isn&#x27;t so great in my opinion but I am seeing results after just two weeks of using the cream consistently.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! I love the feel of this cream, and the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> it has pleasant light scent. I only used it for few days and noticed smooth skin around my C-section scar.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen result yet, but it moisture my skin and won&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li> I love it. I can feel the difference from my stretchmarks before.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent! I habe four children which left me with many stretch marks. After using this for only 2 weeks I have seen a noticable difference. I will continue to use to see if the marks will fade more.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me, maybe I wasnt using it right, it did get rid of some tiny strech marks though, but other than that it didnt .</li>
            <li> I love everything about this cream.  It smells awesome.  It has a rich creamy texture.  I continue to use it and watch the awesome results.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Personally I haven see any change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now. I bought it when they had the buy 1 get 1 special. It makes the stretch marks softer, but does not fade it.</li>
            <li> I was really shocked at how quickly it started working! Within 2 days of use I could physically see a huge difference in the appearance of my stretch marks. I would highly recommend using this product it worked great!! I was a little skeptical at first but figured what could it hurt to try and I&#x27;m so happy I tried it!</li>
            <li> Works perfect, I use it for everything, is not grassy, absorbs really quick, nice smell</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell. Little dab goes a long way. I have been using it on a scar on my leg been using it for  week it has lighten some . Will update when I use the cream longer.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to choose a cream for a surgery scar I have on my neck. I actually have 2, one from a surgery a year ago and one from October 2014 (2 months ago).  For the older one, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much difference.  But for the newer one, after a month of use it seems to have worked very well.  I took before and after pics and will post here.  They are real.  I did it for myself so that I would have an objective view of the results and not an emotional one.  The dates on the photos are 11/24/2014 and 12/26/2014, so about a month apart.  The bottom newer scar is still visible but much less pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The raised keloid on the left side went down considerably after a few weeks of use. It was at that time that I used a mild almond scrub (just a generic brand from the grocery store) and was amazed how it smoothed right out!  I only used it 3 times as after the 3rd time it caused a little tenderness so I stopped, but continued using the scar cream twice a day religiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant. Kind of citrusy.  And it dissipates after application. So don&#x27;t worry about an odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a very small amount, about the size of a pea.  A little goes a long way!  So start small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy so can&#x27;t say how it works on stretch marks from pregnancy, but as for newer surgical scars, wait for your doctor&#x27;s approval and take before and after photos for your own peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would and have recommended this to friends.</li>
            <li> Natural product with great results! Im using this on a surgical scar and am noticing some changes!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not but it&#x27;s a good lotion lol?</li>
            <li> Loved it! Smelled amazing! And made my elbows noticeably softer!</li>
            <li> Has ingredients that are great for the skin but did not see a huge improvement in stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Great cream, works well and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks my stretch marks are deep and redish they look lighter and smaller.  I will give an update in about 4 weeks with a pic of final results...</li>
            <li> Bought Sieva Stretch Mark cream after my first pregnancy and I also have scars from a past surgery. It really faded the stretch marks I have on the sides of my belly and the scars are looking less noticeable which makes me happy. I have say I am very pleased.  Buy this if you have stretch marks and scars that you would like to fade away.</li>
            <li> I have scars on my tummy from my surgery early this year (2014) and I have used a well endorsed brand to help the scar marks fade - to no avail. I have been using Sieva&#x27;s Stretch Mark and Scar Cream for quite some time now and my fiery red scars have faded significantly. I feel like with continued use, my scar marks that have been making me feel so self conscious, will totally go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. Iâ€™m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end userâ€™s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I notice an improvement on my scars. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne my whole life, unfortunately still do to this day. But having acne means getting the terrible red scars all over my face. I am lucky enough not to have the super deep scarring.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I tried this cream and honestly I saw results in a week. It was incredible. Not only did it help with my scarring but it didn&#x27;t upset my acne prone skin!&lt;br /&gt;I put this on every day before bed and feel so much better about my face the next morning. I definitely recommend getting this if you struggle with acne scarring.&lt;br /&gt;I did try this product for my stretch marks and didn&#x27;t see any results which was strange. I bought it for my scaring so it wasn&#x27;t a big issue for me.</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of a friend who used Sieva while she was expecting I got my first jar. Along with being newly pregnant and having a variety of small scars because of being a rough and tumble girl all of my life I thought it would be a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have to say I am pleased with the results, the first thing I noticed because I am sensitive to it on a good day and even more now is the scent. It is very pleasant and natural smelling. You don&#x27;t have any over powering perfumes or chemical scent to assault your nose. The next thing I noticed was how nice it went on, smooth and it soaked into the skin well without leaving a greasy residue behind. I love that because once I use a lotion or ointment I usually go right back to a project or some such where I need my hands so not having to worry about the residue is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product I have noticed some help in my scars so far and my skin is soft and supple. I have every confidence that I will not see any stretch marks happening.</li>
            <li> This cream works pretty good, and the way it smells isnt bad also :). Thanks.</li>
            <li> I tried this product 2 times a day for 2 weeks and had very minimal results with my scars and stretch marks. I ever exfoliated the skin before every application. Hopefully since I&#x27;m only 25, my stretch marks will fade over time but this product proved to be a waste of time and money for me.</li>
            <li> The Stretch Mark and Scar Removal Cream ~ I received my order in a very timely manner, packaging was great and the product was sealed for safety. I began using the cream the night it arrived after showering. I purchased the product to see if it would decrease the appearance of my C-Section mark on my lower stomach that is so embarrassing to me. I generously put the cream on the entire scar, using it at least twice a day. I have noticed the scar to appear to look more even toned to my natural skin complexion. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about 2 or 3 weeks give or take. I&#x27;m impressed because prior to this I had tried several different products ranging from creams to silicon tapes.</li>
            <li> This is great cream to use on strechmarks or scars. It takes time to work just like any other cream you would buy does. But you do start to sr results.</li>
            <li> After a month of diligent daily use, this stuff hasn&#x27;t reduced the appearance of stretch marks on my stomach. I will update this review after further use if I notice any change.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very smooth. and i see that the stretch marks are lighting up it really works. I would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on old scars as advertised. There was also no way to contact the seller so I had to go through Amazon to get my money back. Smells nice though and a great moisturizer--- but this isn&#x27;t why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I am going completely nuclear when it comes to getting rid of the last of my stretch marks, so I was happy when I received this product. I am using shea butter, along with this cream and a derma roller each day. I am always very iffy about stretch mark creams because most &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; say that there is no way to get them. I must say, happily, they are wrong! This wonderful smelling cream, in conjunction with the derma roller has completely decreased that &#x27;raised&amp;#34; feeling of stretch marks on my sides. My skin feels totally smooth, and my stretch marks are fading slowly but surely. I am hoping that by June, in full fledged bikini season, my stretch marks will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks in this function  I do not give 5 start because even not finish the product and I still  wait  for this marks disappear  complete</li>
            <li> Well I used it twice everyday like it recommended, and my stretch marks aren&#x27;t completely faded. There is, however, a difference in the appearance of them. They seem less red and almost blurred, so that&#x27;s why I gave this product a 4 star. It&#x27;s no miracle cream, but I think it may work considerably after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cream to moisturize and help remove scars!</li>
            <li> My daughter (17) and myself have been using this twice a day for about a week now. She just had foot surgery right before Christmas and has a really nasty looking scar on the top of her foot.  I have been looking for something to use on myself (back of thighs and stomach stretch marks from pregnancy) that is very moisturizing but does not feel sticky or greasy. We both have used this and both saw great results! The itchiness of her scar has subsided drastically and the actual appearance of the scar itself does seem look &amp;#34;faded&amp;#34;...it is not near as red and &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34; looking as it was 2 weeks ago.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how the changes over the next few weeks to come. She is having a second surgery this summer on her other foot and this will be a must have in her recovery process.&lt;br /&gt;As for myself, I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; on the back of my legs and my stomach stretch marks feel much softer and a little less visible. My stretch marks are about 17 years old and have faded a lot over the years but they have always felt rough so this was a nice change to that roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product overall has a nice smell and works wonderfully. I would highly recommend to friends and family who have scars or stretchmarks they are self-conscious about. Give it a try...you will fall in love with this cream!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to notice any difference yet on my scars but I really like how it leaves my skin nicely moisturized.  I will update my review with pictures of before and after of my leg scar after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels nice and has a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that anything can actually get rid of stretch marks completely. I&#x27;ve had some yo-yoing weight (first I gained a lot, then lost a lot--I&#x27;m now just working on keeping it off) and this cream faded the very, *very* deep marks on my stomach 50-60%. They&#x27;re so much lighter now that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see them if I was looking at them in the mirror across the room. I may buy another jar to see if it continues to fade the marks, but I&#x27;m reasonably impressed with this so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wear off&amp;#34; like some other creams I&#x27;ve tried--once the marks have faded, they&#x27;re faded for good. I ran out of my jar two weeks ago and they look the same as they did on the last day I applied it. It also works great on scars--I&#x27;ve had a road rash scar on my arm since I was a kid, and it&#x27;s nearly gone now.</li>
            <li> IT smells weird, has a weird texture, and has too much menthol. You are freezing after you put it on!</li>
            <li> I thought this cream was gonna be bullsh*t, because I had used other creams before with no results really. I recommend this cream, it&#x27;s not a miracle cream but it works with use overtime. I use it for my shoulders, and sides since women tend to get stretch marks there for some reason lol. It smells good and isn&#x27;t all sticky afterwards. I personally like it. You&#x27;ll just have to buy and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who they paid to give them 5 stars, but this isn&#x27;t worth a damn. I used the entire bottle and received no results. Just another scam.</li>
            <li> Very good and effective cream! I am very pleased with this cream, it significantly reduces stretch marks!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working amazing, I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and I have yet to have stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and it is an okay product. I usually see my stretch marks lighten after using it for 3 days all in a row but it usually doesn&#x27;t get better after that and if i stop using it for a day, they go back to just how they were before.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have any stretch marks or scars because it will help soothe the area and diminish its appearance. Scars and stretch marks begin to gradually fade away. I love the packaging of the product and how the ingredients are listed on the front. The shea butter makes this feel so smooth on your body too. The instructions are also easy to read and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this cream for it to be effective. Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love how well this lotion works!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream and have just started using it on my stomach area while I am pregnant with my second child. I do not have stretch marks (yet), so I am using it to prevent them from occurring. The cream absorbs into my skin very quickly, and my skin feels very soft and smooth. What I REALLY like about this product, though, is its ingredients.  It does not contain any chemicals, fillers, binders, or artificial ingredients and is 100% pure and organic.  It is made with shea butter, cocoa butter, olive oil, jojoba oil, rose hip oil, and vitamin E.  Comes in a four-ounce jar, so it is a good amount.  Happy so far!</li>
            <li> I received my stretch mark  cream and I love it thank you so much</li>
