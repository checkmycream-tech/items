            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product offsite from a salon. When I tried to use the product the pump disconnected itself from the bottle. I had to align the spring together and kind of screw it in to use it, and even then I had to pump several times for the cream to come out. To this day I still have to rotate the pump a certain way and pump multiple times. Not sure if I&#x27;ll order it from here again.</li>
            <li> I use all the GK products and love them.&lt;br /&gt;Since I started having my hair straightened with GK system the use of the shampoo conditioner leave in conditioner and serum leaves my hair healthier easy to manage and very shiny..&lt;br /&gt;As long as keep straigtening my hair I will continue to use this product. Bottom line I love it!!!</li>

            <li> Love it!!!  This is the best I have come across when it comes to keeping your hair feeling, smelling and looking amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product. It&#x27;s lite weight and non grease so it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down but strong enough that you just need a small amount each time.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is the very best, and smells great !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, the best shampoo!</li>
            <li> It is really good I love it</li>
            <li> I use a dab of this combined with the Global Keratin Hair Thermal Style Her on my damp hair. When I flat iron my curly hair it is smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> Good delivery, works good, would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Great for just before blowdrying.. Leaves hair shinning and soft. Use small amount.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase for me.  It works really well for a few hours and then frizz creeps back in. I&#x27;m going to increase the amount used and see if that works better.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my hair stronger and a lot less frizzy. It is much straighter as well.  Buy it today !!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My daugther love it</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters hair after Keratin treatment for leave in conditioning.  Her hair is so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Shipping was fast - will definitely purchase more products from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It smells beautiful and really tames the frizz but it makes my hair looks dirty even if I just washed it. My hair is naturally very shiny and I prefer the GK Serum because it keeps my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> the product smooths out freezy hair and it smells so fresh. it does not dry out the hair when used everyday</li>
