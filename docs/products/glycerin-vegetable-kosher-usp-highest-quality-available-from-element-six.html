            <li>After two applications, most all the stains are gone!</li>
            <li>Very good, useful stuff.</li>
            <li>And the fog from my mixture was amazing.  </li>
            <li>No problems at all and the packaging was really nice.</li>
            <li>Use this to make my own face wash.</li>
            <li>If you are looking towards making your own vape e-juice, tjis is the bottle to buy.</li>
            <li>Makes wonderful real vanilla when used with Amazon&#x27;s vanilla bean.</li>
            <li>Good to have on hand for when I want to make more lotions and shower gels.</li>
            <li>I use this to make my own e-juice.  </li>
            <li>I make all of my own flavoring&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I use it for making my own watercolor paint, by mixing it with gum arabic and honey.  </li>
            <li>We used this in making super bubbles and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Best VG I&#x27;ve purchased so far.</li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect product and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Awesome, big clouds!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The appropriate grade for making e-juice.</li>
            <li>packing was interesting tho.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought multiple bottles of this product and it works great for diy vape juice!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll work for vaping, but better options exist.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great value.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>great item fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the ejuice concentrated flavors and Nic that you don&#x27;t want more than a 6 month supply to store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vegetable glycerine can be used so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is said when glycerin is used as a preservative the material will be safe to use for 14-22 months.</li>
            <li>Great product and received fast.</li>
            <li>Good stuff right here.</li>
            <li>High quality vegetable glycerin, great for homemade cleansers, lotions, soaps, and beauty products.</li>
            <li>but my bottle looks more like someone printed their own super ghetto label off of their computer and slapped it on this bottle.</li>
            <li>Also know for vaping, this is naturally sweet on its own, so recipes may need some adjustment if you are used to making a 50/50 blend</li>
            <li>Seems pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>and it is pure and smooth and tastes great.</li>
            <li>This product is so versatile; its worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Good pure food grade vegetable glycerin</li>
            <li>Lots of vapor, no weird taste, and cheap for a good amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have rather gotten what was in the picture than this generically labeled bottle that wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top.</li>
            <li>I use this to mix ejuice, great quality and enough for more than 2 years :).</li>
            <li>I have used tons of this VG already in both making my own e liquids, adding to higher PG e liquids, making quality homemade bubbles and using it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>best part, the glycerin and water cost me less than $14.00, and I got 3 gallons made.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I&#x27;d bought much more than I needed, but it turned out that we used it all up, and could have in fact used more of it.</li>
            <li>This worked just fine for my lotions I make.</li>
            <li>I will keep this on my quick order list!</li>
            <li>Shipped in a BPA free bottle.</li>
            <li>It was as advertised, and a good price as far as I can find.</li>
            <li>Works great in my Vape, Vg is good for clouds and not so much flavor, but it&#x27;s still there when mixed with the stuff I use, you get tons for your money, and I&#x27;ll for sure be back for more, when using in DIY vaping remember that VG is for clouds, PG for flavor.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great performer for vaping, very smooth and takes flavor very well.  </li>
            <li>I use this to make my own face mist and helps my dry face stay nice during winter.</li>
            <li>Put it in a spray bottle and use it like oxy clean or spray and wash.</li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>I think this is top quality, pure vegetable glycerine.</li>
            <li>I did not receive a 32oz bottle, I received three 11oz bottles and a note ensuring me that I was receiving the full amount I ordered.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give this a good rating because when I received the bottle the cap was wrapped with electric tape several times around</li>
            <li>Love this product Fast delivery Thank you</li>
            <li>Good supplier, came properly packaged and did not leak.</li>
            <li>I use it for all of my vape juices and its not bad by its self either.</li>
            <li>Just ordered another 1 Quart bottle and went through the first one quickly!</li>
            <li>quick shipping</li>
            <li>came quickly and as described</li>
            <li>I also like to use a couple tablespoons in our bubble solution, it helps make nice bubbles that won&#x27;t pop as easily, works great and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Useful in diy projects.</li>
            <li>Did I even get the right product here?</li>
            <li>husband got a stain on a new, and loved (Russian River Brewery) sweatshirt.</li>
            <li>Most flavors fully steep in this VG within a few days at most.</li>
            <li>this product shipped super fast</li>
            <li>Might even use for glycerites in the future for more herbal persuits.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more next year...</li>
            <li>I have purchased from a cake decorating store and this is better than some of the standard brands sold in the store.</li>
            <li>exactly like described and delivered fast!</li>
            <li>first time i have used this product and it works well</li>
            <li>You should already know this, but it was my first time buying it</li>
            <li>home really stops the severity!</li>
            <li>Look forward to more in the future.</li>
            <li>Nice - use it for DYI vape with flavors purchased from other sources.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily make my own juice, but I do use this vegetable glycerin to &amp;#34;water down&amp;#34; some of the older juice that I have that contains too high a percentage of nicotine for dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I will have to aliquot the rest since the bottle is so large.</li>
            <li>No strange taste to speak of, bottle arrived free of leaks, ready to compound my vapor liquids into the finest flavors.</li>
            <li>Very horror movie look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very please with purchase.</li>
            <li>This vapes very well.  </li>
            <li>Just know that using too much will leave a stickiness.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really know this.  </li>
            <li>i had read that vg does not hold flavor to well, but i didnt not expect it for it to nuf flavor so much, recommend using a mix of vg and pg</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I decide to do some cloud chasing builds I vape this VG straight from the bottle</li>
            <li>I bought this to go along with my potassium permanganate and it works very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other types, but this is thick, rich, and puts out beautiful clouds.</li>
            <li>Shipped out fast and is a high quality VG I use it to make juice for my sub ohm vape set up.</li>
            <li>Decent stuff.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get this bigger bottle and saved a lot more compared to smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>good clear and thick whats not to like</li>
            <li>I use this high quality vegetable glycerin for natural/organic face serums and lotions.  </li>
            <li>A lot of high grade VG.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I need it to be high quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a few of the uses for vegetable glycerin off the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve bought several of these in the last year due to going through so much making my own e-liquid for my RDA ecigs).  </li>
            <li>Then I tried it on an old favorite shirt of mine which has been stained, and washed and dried for years.</li>
            <li>It removed the set-in stain completely!</li>
            <li>This is simply finest-quality vegetable glycerin, exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Essential Six seems to be of lower quality; not as sweet, and has an &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; taste to it, when compared to Essential Depot.</li>
            <li>It really is that simple.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping, solid buy</li>
            <li>It will keep contaminants and wild yeasts out of the wine.</li>
            <li>Perfect base for Vape juice.  </li>
            <li>As far as I know PG and VG are safe for long periods of time put in a dark place at room temperature, around 70.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t care less if they shipped it to me in 32  1oz bottles, but I did find it funny</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s super thick, it mixes very well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I normally use Essential Depot glycerin, and I could taste the difference immediately.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I used it to make e-juice and it vapes like no other.</li>
            <li>I was using plastic pipettes to dispense it at first but now that the liquid level is down</li>
            <li>I am a nurse and due to so much hand washing @</li>
            <li>It can be used as a low-glycemic sweetener in cooking, as a emollient in skin care, and as a thickener/plasticizer in different formulations (such as natural cleaners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hasnt given me any problems, clean taste and thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different brands of glycerin, some vegetable and some other, and I find this brand to be as thick as any (which is good) and have noticed zero signs of impurity, which i have seen in other brands.  </li>

            <li> Very good, useful stuff.</li>
            <li> And the fog from my mixture was amazing.  </li>
            <li> No problems at all and the packaging was really nice.</li>
            <li> Use this to make my own face wash.</li>
            <li> If you are looking towards making your own vape e-juice, tjis is the bottle to buy.</li>
            <li> Makes wonderful real vanilla when used with Amazon&#x27;s vanilla bean.</li>
            <li> Good to have on hand for when I want to make more lotions and shower gels.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own e-juice.  </li>
            <li> I make all of my own flavoring&#x27;s</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I use it for making my own watercolor paint, by mixing it with gum arabic and honey.  </li>
            <li> We used this in making super bubbles and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Best VG I&#x27;ve purchased so far.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect product and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Awesome, big clouds!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The appropriate grade for making e-juice.</li>
            <li> packing was interesting tho.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought multiple bottles of this product and it works great for diy vape juice!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll work for vaping, but better options exist.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great value.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ejuice concentrated flavors and Nic that you don&#x27;t want more than a 6 month supply to store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vegetable glycerine can be used so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is said when glycerin is used as a preservative the material will be safe to use for 14-22 months.</li>
            <li> Great product and received fast.</li>
            <li> Good stuff right here.</li>
            <li> High quality vegetable glycerin, great for homemade cleansers, lotions, soaps, and beauty products.</li>
            <li> but my bottle looks more like someone printed their own super ghetto label off of their computer and slapped it on this bottle.</li>
            <li> Also know for vaping, this is naturally sweet on its own, so recipes may need some adjustment if you are used to making a 50/50 blend</li>
            <li> Seems pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> and it is pure and smooth and tastes great.</li>
            <li> This product is so versatile; its worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Good pure food grade vegetable glycerin</li>
            <li> Lots of vapor, no weird taste, and cheap for a good amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have rather gotten what was in the picture than this generically labeled bottle that wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix ejuice, great quality and enough for more than 2 years :).</li>
            <li> I have used tons of this VG already in both making my own e liquids, adding to higher PG e liquids, making quality homemade bubbles and using it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> best part, the glycerin and water cost me less than $14.00, and I got 3 gallons made.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought I&#x27;d bought much more than I needed, but it turned out that we used it all up, and could have in fact used more of it.</li>
            <li> This worked just fine for my lotions I make.</li>
            <li> I will keep this on my quick order list!</li>
            <li> Shipped in a BPA free bottle.</li>
            <li> It was as advertised, and a good price as far as I can find.</li>
            <li> Works great in my Vape, Vg is good for clouds and not so much flavor, but it&#x27;s still there when mixed with the stuff I use, you get tons for your money, and I&#x27;ll for sure be back for more, when using in DIY vaping remember that VG is for clouds, PG for flavor.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great performer for vaping, very smooth and takes flavor very well.  </li>
            <li> I use this to make my own face mist and helps my dry face stay nice during winter.</li>
            <li> Put it in a spray bottle and use it like oxy clean or spray and wash.</li>
            <li> Clean.</li>
            <li> I think this is top quality, pure vegetable glycerine.</li>
            <li> I did not receive a 32oz bottle, I received three 11oz bottles and a note ensuring me that I was receiving the full amount I ordered.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this a good rating because when I received the bottle the cap was wrapped with electric tape several times around</li>
            <li> Love this product Fast delivery Thank you</li>
            <li> Good supplier, came properly packaged and did not leak.</li>
            <li> I use it for all of my vape juices and its not bad by its self either.</li>
            <li> Just ordered another 1 Quart bottle and went through the first one quickly!</li>
            <li> quick shipping</li>
            <li> came quickly and as described</li>
            <li> I also like to use a couple tablespoons in our bubble solution, it helps make nice bubbles that won&#x27;t pop as easily, works great and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Useful in diy projects.</li>
            <li> Did I even get the right product here?</li>
            <li> husband got a stain on a new, and loved (Russian River Brewery) sweatshirt.</li>
            <li> Most flavors fully steep in this VG within a few days at most.</li>
            <li> this product shipped super fast</li>
            <li> Might even use for glycerites in the future for more herbal persuits.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more next year...</li>
            <li> I have purchased from a cake decorating store and this is better than some of the standard brands sold in the store.</li>
            <li> exactly like described and delivered fast!</li>
            <li> first time i have used this product and it works well</li>
            <li> You should already know this, but it was my first time buying it</li>
            <li> home really stops the severity!</li>
            <li> Look forward to more in the future.</li>
            <li> Nice - use it for DYI vape with flavors purchased from other sources.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily make my own juice, but I do use this vegetable glycerin to &amp;#34;water down&amp;#34; some of the older juice that I have that contains too high a percentage of nicotine for dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I will have to aliquot the rest since the bottle is so large.</li>
            <li> No strange taste to speak of, bottle arrived free of leaks, ready to compound my vapor liquids into the finest flavors.</li>
            <li> Very horror movie look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very please with purchase.</li>
            <li> This vapes very well.  </li>
            <li> Just know that using too much will leave a stickiness.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really know this.  </li>
            <li> i had read that vg does not hold flavor to well, but i didnt not expect it for it to nuf flavor so much, recommend using a mix of vg and pg</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I decide to do some cloud chasing builds I vape this VG straight from the bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with my potassium permanganate and it works very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other types, but this is thick, rich, and puts out beautiful clouds.</li>
            <li> Shipped out fast and is a high quality VG I use it to make juice for my sub ohm vape set up.</li>
            <li> Decent stuff.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get this bigger bottle and saved a lot more compared to smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> good clear and thick whats not to like</li>
            <li> I use this high quality vegetable glycerin for natural/organic face serums and lotions.  </li>
            <li> A lot of high grade VG.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so I need it to be high quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a few of the uses for vegetable glycerin off the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve bought several of these in the last year due to going through so much making my own e-liquid for my RDA ecigs).  </li>
            <li> Then I tried it on an old favorite shirt of mine which has been stained, and washed and dried for years.</li>
            <li> It removed the set-in stain completely!</li>
            <li> This is simply finest-quality vegetable glycerin, exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Essential Six seems to be of lower quality; not as sweet, and has an &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; taste to it, when compared to Essential Depot.</li>
            <li> It really is that simple.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping, solid buy</li>
            <li> It will keep contaminants and wild yeasts out of the wine.</li>
            <li> Perfect base for Vape juice.  </li>
            <li> As far as I know PG and VG are safe for long periods of time put in a dark place at room temperature, around 70.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t care less if they shipped it to me in 32  1oz bottles, but I did find it funny</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s super thick, it mixes very well.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I normally use Essential Depot glycerin, and I could taste the difference immediately.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I used it to make e-juice and it vapes like no other.</li>
            <li> I was using plastic pipettes to dispense it at first but now that the liquid level is down</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and due to so much hand washing @</li>
            <li> It can be used as a low-glycemic sweetener in cooking, as a emollient in skin care, and as a thickener/plasticizer in different formulations (such as natural cleaners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hasnt given me any problems, clean taste and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different brands of glycerin, some vegetable and some other, and I find this brand to be as thick as any (which is good) and have noticed zero signs of impurity, which i have seen in other brands.  </li>
            <li> Do not have any issues with this product; i would purchase it again, as long as price doesn&#x27;t go up.</li>
            <li> I had expected one big bottle</li>
            <li> Makes such a difference when I add a little to my liquid hand soap in the winter.</li>
            <li> as expected, well packaged.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m questioning if this is even remotely legit.</li>
            <li> I wanted really thick fog from my 4 foggers (2 ground hugging and 2 regular), so I mixed my fog juice in these portions:  </li>
            <li> Use less when using a foaming bottle.</li>
            <li> Is not worth the money !</li>
            <li> Because of the viscosity it can be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I tried the Element Six glycerin, to save a few pennies.</li>
            <li> This Glycerin works well as a component in the soaps we make in our small business.</li>
            <li> I used it to add more moisture to my conditioner, as a base for a leave in spray, and as the base to a big bite</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the bottle is awkward and not conducive to mess-free pouring.</li>
            <li> nothing negative to say at all.</li>
            <li> I was a hero for at least a couple of days!</li>
            <li> Word of warning, it&#x27;s thick!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this VG.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t a bad thing to say about it.</li>
            <li> For syringes, I would recommend a 12 gauge fill needle (this will save you from some painful fingers)</li>

            <li> No strange taste to speak of, bottle arrived free of leaks, ready to compound my vapor liquids into the finest flavors. Might even use for glycerites in the future for more herbal persuits. Definitely a solid purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this high quality vegetable glycerin for natural/organic face serums and lotions.  It is the best.  I have the 32oz bottle and it will last forever!  I was using plastic pipettes to dispense it at first but now that the liquid level is down, I will have to aliquot the rest since the bottle is so large. This product is so versatile; its worth every penny!! Because of the viscosity it can be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Works great in my Vape, Vg is good for clouds and not so much flavor, but it&#x27;s still there when mixed with the stuff I use, you get tons for your money, and I&#x27;ll for sure be back for more, when using in DIY vaping remember that VG is for clouds, PG for flavor. VG also does not wick well in tanks and is best suited for dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works flawlessly for vaping.</li>
            <li> Useful in diy projects.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Just ordered another 1 Quart bottle and went through the first one quickly! I use it to make e-cig liquid and it works perfectly. No problems at all and the packaging was really nice.</li>
            <li> Good pure food grade vegetable glycerin</li>
            <li> As advertised.... quick shipping</li>
            <li> great stuff...works well for my e-juice</li>
            <li> god for soap mixing and vaping ,hair products ect</li>
            <li> good product, timely delivery, no complaints!</li>
            <li> High quality vegetable glycerin, great for homemade cleansers, lotions, soaps, and beauty products. Vegetable glycerin helps to retain skin moisture so it is the perfect choice for skin care products. Since this is also food grade, you can use this vegetable glycerin to replace the alcohol when making herbal and botanical tinctures and salves. I also like to use a couple tablespoons in our bubble solution, it helps make nice bubbles that won&#x27;t pop as easily, works great and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in my Halloween fogger (fog juice is just Glycerin and distilled water).  I wanted really thick fog from my 4 foggers (2 ground hugging and 2 regular), so I mixed my fog juice in these portions:  70% Glycerin 30% distilled water.  Shake and use.  It really is that simple.  And the fog from my mixture was amazing.  Very horror movie look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part, the glycerin and water cost me less than $14.00, and I got 3 gallons made.  A gallon of Fog Juice retail is $20.00 and up.  Great savings and great product.  Will be buying more next year...</li>
            <li> as expected, well packaged.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use it in my home made e-juice and it is pure and smooth and tastes great. Makes my e-juice taste as good or better than anything I have tried! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> works great in my scrubs</li>
            <li> Awesome, big clouds!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for makin E vapes</li>
            <li> Good VG Not my favorate but it is one of the cheaper prices i&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> This glycerin is very good, I cook with it üç≤,...and make hair products for my Household..... I have no complaints!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was organic, but it is not. Shipped in a BPA free bottle. Very cool!!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff right here. Perfect for making e juice.</li>
            <li> The appropriate grade for making e-juice. Only complaint is that the bottle is awkward and not conducive to mess-free pouring.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. We use it for making electronic cigarette juice (E-cig juice) . It has no flavor and seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> For a while now, this is the only VG I use for my ejuice. I&#x27;ve used other types, but this is thick, rich, and puts out beautiful clouds. Carries flavor well too. Even though it&#x27;s super thick, it mixes very well. No need to heat it or anything like that. Just pour it in the bottle with your flavoring and nic, and shake it up. Most flavors fully steep in this VG within a few days at most. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this VG.</li>
            <li> For those of you looking to vape this it&#x27;s perfect. Lots of vapor, no weird taste, and cheap for a good amount. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Giant, Monster bubbles.  That is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packing was interesting tho.  I did not receive a 32oz bottle, I received three 11oz bottles and a note ensuring me that I was receiving the full amount I ordered. I really couldn&#x27;t care less if they shipped it to me in 32  1oz bottles, but I did find it funny that they felt they must explain to me that 11x3 &amp;#62; 32. (who knows maybe they have received complaints from people that can&#x27;t multiply or add). Great product, and I got a chuckle out of the note. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought multiple bottles of this product and it works great for diy vape juice!</li>
            <li> good clear and thick whats not to like</li>
            <li> Just what was needed! This is great for non alcohol based tinctures  in the MB2e machine. Also use it for balms, salves, vape pen juice, etc. Ez to flavor. Use the code for discount on the Magical Butter machine! http://magicalbutter.refr.cc/G88G4CL  Happy cooking!</li>
            <li> Vapes great.  Good flavor</li>
            <li> Great quality vegetable glycerin and for a very good price for making vaporizer juice. Will continue buying this brand. Wish they sold them in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Best VG I&#x27;ve purchased so far. Perfect sweet taste.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own face mist and helps my dry face stay nice during winter. good price and product!</li>
            <li> More than you&#x27;ll ever need, great value for the price</li>
            <li> A lot of high grade VG. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of this VG already in both making my own e liquids, adding to higher PG e liquids, making quality homemade bubbles and using it as a moisturizer. Its a great price and a great product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use this to make my own face wash. Very please with purchase.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect product and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this a good rating because when I received the bottle the cap was wrapped with electric tape several times around and when I opened up the cap there was not even a tamper proof foil seal. Also others who&#x27;ve commented o  this have read off of the bottle something about food grade, and US bottled blah blah but my bottle looks more like someone printed their own super ghetto label off of their computer and slapped it on this bottle. It literally just says: &amp;#34;GLYCERIN VEGETABLE KOSHER USP HIGHEST QUALITY AVAILABLE&amp;#34; and the manufacturer says it was made by &amp;#34;Confectionery Arts International&amp;#34;. So what the heck? Did I even get the right product here? I&#x27;d have rather gotten what was in the picture than this generically labeled bottle that wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top. Now I&#x27;m questioning if this is even remotely legit. I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> Decent stuff.  I have no complaints, but no raves either.  It&#x27;ll work for vaping, but better options exist.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> I used this glycerin to make liquid soap from a bar. I made one gallon of great soap with no sulfates, parabens and not tested on animals for about $1.50 per gallon. I only used 2 TBS of glycerin.</li>
            <li> I used it to make e-juice and it vapes like no other. If you are looking towards making your own vape e-juice, tjis is the bottle to buy.</li>
            <li> I tried the Element Six glycerin, to save a few pennies. I normally use Essential Depot glycerin, and I could taste the difference immediately. Essential Six seems to be of lower quality; not as sweet, and has an &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; taste to it, when compared to Essential Depot. Even mixing them doesn&#x27;t hide the taste.</li>
            <li> We used this in making super bubbles and it worked great. At first I thought I&#x27;d bought much more than I needed, but it turned out that we used it all up, and could have in fact used more of it. I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Makes wonderful real vanilla when used with Amazon&#x27;s vanilla bean. Found a recipe on line and it is the best!</li>
            <li> This worked just fine for my lotions I make. Good to have on hand for when I want to make more lotions and shower gels.</li>
            <li> Nice - use it for DYI vape with flavors purchased from other sources.  Excellent quality, excellent price!</li>
            <li> AMAZING SPOT REMOVER !!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband got a stain on a new, and loved (Russian River Brewery) sweatshirt. It went through the dryer and we were thinking it was ruined. I went online and found this formula for removing spots: 1/4 cup glycerin (vegetable), 1/4 cup liquid dish soap, and 1 1/2 cups water. Put it in a spray bottle and use it like oxy clean or spray and wash. IT IS AMAZING!!! It removed the set-in stain completely! I was a hero for at least a couple of days! Then I tried it on an old favorite shirt of mine which has been stained, and washed and dried for years. After two applications, most all the stains are gone! You will never buy another commercial spot remover! Give it a try. Oh, the mixture also works great on a fingernail brush if you garden or whatever and get stained fingernails.</li>
            <li> Perfect use for the liquids for my electronic cigarette</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own e-juice.  This vapes very well.  Mixes well too!</li>
            <li> This is great quality Glycerin to have for your purpose. I have purchased from a cake decorating store and this is better than some of the standard brands sold in the store. Would recommend for your humidor, electronic cigarette, DIY beauty products. Thanks for a great value.</li>
            <li> very good to make herbal oils for my vaporizer/ecig.</li>
            <li> exactly like described and delivered fast!</li>
            <li> came when said ...seems to do what i bought it for .</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing. Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> I love it I put it in my lotion.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder for me (I&#x27;ve bought several of these in the last year due to going through so much making my own e-liquid for my RDA ecigs).  This stuff world great for my purpose (e-liquid mixing).</li>
            <li> first time i have used this product and it works well</li>
            <li> fast shipping, solid buy</li>
            <li> Clean. I&#x27;ve used it for months for vapor and I haven&#x27;t a bad thing to say about it. Keep it sealed and cooled, great product!</li>
            <li> loved it. I use it for all of my vape juices and its not bad by its self either.</li>
            <li> Used this to make olive leaf extract so I need it to be high quality and this worked great.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me forever. I used it to add more moisture to my conditioner, as a base for a leave in spray, and as the base to a big bite spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it&#x27;s job. Just know that using too much will leave a stickiness. Balance it with water and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Love this product Fast delivery Thank you</li>
            <li> It was as advertised, and a good price as far as I can find.</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I use this for vaping. I make all of my own flavoring&#x27;s and this was at a nice price and was perfect for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all that needs to be said.</li>
            <li> came quickly and as described</li>
            <li> Perfect base for Vape juice.  Word of warning, it&#x27;s thick!  You should already know this, but it was my first time buying it and I didn&#x27;t really know this.  For syringes, I would recommend a 12 gauge fill needle (this will save you from some painful fingers) Overall this is a great performer for vaping, very smooth and takes flavor very well.  Also know for vaping, this is naturally sweet on its own, so recipes may need some adjustment if you are used to making a 50/50 blend</li>
            <li> Very good price!  Makes such a difference when I add a little to my liquid hand soap in the winter. I am a nurse and due to so much hand washing @ work, my fingers crack and bleed.  But using some soap with glycerine @ home really stops the severity!</li>
            <li> I use this to mix ejuice, great quality and enough for more than 2 years :). I decided to get this bigger bottle and saved a lot more compared to smaller bottles. As far as I know PG and VG are safe for long periods of time put in a dark place at room temperature, around 70. It&#x27;s the ejuice concentrated flavors and Nic that you don&#x27;t want more than a 6 month supply to store.</li>
            <li> Used it to preserve magnolia branches-worked great!</li>
            <li> this product shipped super fast and i have zero complaints... i use this for making ejuice.. works great</li>
            <li> Very nice product for making my soaps.  Soap turned out perfect.</li>
            <li> Good service from seller. Shipped on time. The glycerin is good, I use it for making e-juice and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  nothing negative to say at all.</li>
            <li> Hasnt given me any problems, clean taste and thick. Ordering the PG now that I am running low, will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Seems pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, this glycerin is great!</li>
            <li> Is not worth the money !</li>
            <li> good product. Perfect for making body wash. Use less when using a foaming bottle. Perfect for thickening up thinning soaps.</li>
            <li> Perfect will order again</li>
            <li> Do not have any issues with this product; i would purchase it again, as long as price doesn&#x27;t go up.</li>
            <li> using this to make e juice. i had read that vg does not hold flavor to well, but i didnt not expect it for it to nuf flavor so much, recommend using a mix of vg and pg</li>
            <li> This Glycerin works well as a component in the soaps we make in our small business. This comes well packaged and has a foil seal, which I find comforting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> This is simply finest-quality vegetable glycerin, exactly as described.  It can be used as a low-glycemic sweetener in cooking, as a emollient in skin care, and as a thickener/plasticizer in different formulations (such as natural cleaners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I use it for making my own watercolor paint, by mixing it with gum arabic and honey.  I&#x27;ve used different brands of glycerin, some vegetable and some other, and I find this brand to be as thick as any (which is good) and have noticed zero signs of impurity, which i have seen in other brands.  I think this is top quality, pure vegetable glycerine.</li>
            <li> Best VG out there. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I had expected one big bottle but I got 3 smaller ones which was no big deal. Everything arrived in an orderly fashion and the grade of glycerin is perfect for what I needed. Thanks a bunch.  Pleasure doing business with you. Look forward to more in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product,&lt;br /&gt;Great Seller.</li>
            <li> Very good, useful stuff. Good supplier, came properly packaged and did not leak. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Good price too.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great item and great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vegetable glycerine can be used so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it as a preservative&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it as a hand lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in E cigarettes, and making herbal concentrates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Medical Marijuana dispenseraries (SP) sell a cannabis tincture in glycerin so patients can put 4-5 drops under the tongue for pain relief. A friend does this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wineries uses glycerine in the air locks when fermenting wine. It will keep contaminants and wild yeasts out of the wine. They could use water in the airlocks but choose to use glycerin because water evaporates and glycerin does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a few of the uses for vegetable glycerin off the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is said when glycerin is used as a preservative the material will be safe to use for 14-22 months.</li>
            <li> perfect to cut my vapor juice!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily make my own juice, but I do use this vegetable glycerin to &amp;#34;water down&amp;#34; some of the older juice that I have that contains too high a percentage of nicotine for dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I decide to do some cloud chasing builds I vape this VG straight from the bottle and I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I will keep this on my quick order list!</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with my potassium permanganate and it works very well you get a very nice reactionand the kids in the neighborhood absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> Shipped out fast and is a high quality VG I use it to make juice for my sub ohm vape set up. It works well</li>
            <li> 2nd time ordering. Will continue to use. Great product and received fast.</li>
