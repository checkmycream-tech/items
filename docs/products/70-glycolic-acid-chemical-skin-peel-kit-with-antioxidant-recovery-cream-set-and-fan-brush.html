            <li>Great Buy!</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!!</li>
            <li>They loved it as well!</li>
            <li>this peel works great  </li>
            <li>but the Glycolic Acid was a paste (not liquid) which was vastly superior to use.  </li>
            <li>trying this product just once I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>your skin looks good</li>
            <li>just so I would have a good supply.</li>
            <li>This worked better than I thought it would!</li>
            <li>it does&#x27;t look any better in the days after.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with the peel</li>
            <li>sure you are reading the directions and doing this peel</li>
            <li>Love this product ..</li>
            <li>I will be ordering some more soon.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to use it more like once/week</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever used any kind of chemical peel.</li>
            <li>or Plastic Surgeon for a HUGE price.</li>
            <li>One thing is it did leave my face super smooth after the treatment</li>
            <li>I decided to try it for the full 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Be sure to have your baking soda water standing by to neutralize it after it stings too much.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for a full 10 minutes too.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, u started using it soon after I got it.</li>
            <li>, I see a tremendous change in my face since using it.</li>
            <li>This is powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li>My last purchase was a 40% strength and gave better results.</li>
            <li>and I really like the recovery cream !</li>
            <li>I applied even more acid and left it on 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I burned the side of my nose the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>now that summer is all most over I will be going back to it</li>
            <li>it starts off by burning your skin, leaving behind a somewhat like scab on your skin and 2 days of washing you face the brown spots will peel off and wahla you have fresh new beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was red in areas, but by the next morning this cleared and left my skin looking beautiful.</li>
            <li>But my main comparison is that it doesn&#x27;t really do the job!  </li>
            <li>My old style left my skin noticeably smooth &amp; fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>The accompanying instructions were very helpful.</li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t seen any results at all.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, but the first time I tried this glycolic solutions for 5 minutes in case it didn&#x27;t react well to this product.</li>
            <li>but I like the product still waiting for full results to make a total determination..</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li>you have that new skin look baby skin</li>
            <li>The second time (2 weeks after the first treatment)</li>
            <li>At first I used it left it on for 2 min</li>
            <li>I had nice results, but obviously you can&#x27;t expect anything too dramatic after the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a professional peel, but I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times</li>
            <li>I bought a second bottle shortly after the first one</li>
            <li>I had my third treatment last night, again for the full 10 minutes and 2 weeks after the previous treatment, and WOW is my skin glowing!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to update this later, but so far; no complaints</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  hoping to see some improvements  to my skin in the near future.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the product I received is 70% strength. My last purchase was a 40% strength and gave better results.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin darker :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting glycolic peels on and off for the past year by a professional. It was getting rather pricey each month, so I decided to try it myself. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, but the first time I tried this glycolic solutions for 5 minutes in case it didn&#x27;t react well to this product. I had nice results, but obviously you can&#x27;t expect anything too dramatic after the first use. The second time (2 weeks after the first treatment) I decided to try it for the full 10 minutes. My skin was red in areas, but by the next morning this cleared and left my skin looking beautiful. I had my third treatment last night, again for the full 10 minutes and 2 weeks after the previous treatment, and WOW is my skin glowing!! I introduced this product to both of my parents and had them try it for themselves. They loved it as well! Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> At first I used it left it on for 2 min cause I couldn&#x27;t take the burning then I thought in a couple of days I will see peeling but that didn&#x27;t happen . two weeks later I left it on for 5 min and waited a couple of days no peeling. I did it again earlier this week and no peeling what so ever and this time I left it for 9 min. Be warn you will break out but will go away. One thing is it did leave my face super smooth after the treatment</li>
            <li> Never used a acid peel before and here to tell you it works wonders. it starts off by burning your skin, leaving behind a somewhat like scab on your skin and 2 days of washing you face the brown spots will peel off and wahla you have fresh new beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I bought a kit similar to this but the Glycolic Acid was a paste (not liquid) which was vastly superior to use.  This brush is useless, use a cotton ball. I leave on as long as I can stand it (approx. 3 min.) which was never an issue with the paste either (stayed on 10 min.).  Be sure to have your baking soda water standing by to neutralize it after it stings too much.  But my main comparison is that it doesn&#x27;t really do the job!  My old style left my skin noticeably smooth &amp; fresh looking.  This one doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything!  My skin still feels rough &amp; it does&#x27;t look any better in the days after.  It is definately an acid, but... The lotion is greasey so use for night time, not day time wear.  If I could still buy the previous brand I would have but I couldn&#x27;t find it so tried this one.  I have used it 4 times now &amp; still see no results &amp; it is just has uncomfortable to use.  They say it will sting less with useage.</li>
            <li> wonderful..great peel. I applied only once..and dropped the bottle on bathroom floor,..itbroke, so ordered another bottle. but that one application was enough for peeling. Applied only on hands, arms and feet..not face..have 30 percent for that...loved it..</li>
            <li> This peel works slowly, and the jar of cream I thought was actually goin to be bigger. Miss leading on photo, its very small.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the peel and I really like the recovery cream ! It smells like cinnamon and it helps dry skin loads .</li>
            <li> I have read on several reviews how this product doesnt work.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this product just once I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you are reading the directions and doing this peel right.&lt;br /&gt;It will work. Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with high hopes. I am African American and I have a few dark marks I want to get rid off. This item is not 70% strength as described. I applied the acid and it did not frost nor sting/tingle or burn. I applied even more acid and left it on 15 minutes. It did not peel my skin what so ever not even a little bit. Worst product I have ever purchased off of amazon.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I&#x27;ve only used it 2x. I&#x27;ll have to update this later, but so far; no complaints</li>
            <li> Love this product ..shipping was lightning speed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this peel works great  your skin looks good you have that new skin look baby skin</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT!! Would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, u started using it soon after I got it. It works really well, I see a tremendous change in my face since using it. I will be ordering some more soon.</li>
            <li> This worked better than I thought it would! I bought a second bottle shortly after the first one just so I would have a good supply. The accompanying instructions were very helpful. I have already recommended this product.</li>
            <li> This is powerful stuff.  I burned the side of my nose the first time I used it. But now I&#x27;ve got it down. I&#x27;m  hoping to see some improvements  to my skin in the near future.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!! I diluted it quite a bit with water before applying and my skin was so scabbed up!!! Used once and will NEVER use it again!!!!!</li>
            <li> They only other place to get this product was through a Derm. or Plastic Surgeon for a HUGE price. I got the same result&#x27;s. Saved hundo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever used any kind of chemical peel. But it seems to work like it is supposed to. Be careful to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> It  did the job, because I got noticed by my friends ( I didn&#x27;t tell them that I was using the product) now that summer is all most over I will be going back to it</li>
            <li> please read the directions and use with care but I like the product still waiting for full results to make a total determination..</li>
            <li> This is a 70% glycolic acid mix, but it seems really weak. I&#x27;ve never had a professional peel, but I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times and I really haven&#x27;t seen any results at all. I leave it on for a full 10 minutes too. It stings but not unbearable. Maybe I just need to use it more like once/week but I don&#x27;t want to over do it.</li>
