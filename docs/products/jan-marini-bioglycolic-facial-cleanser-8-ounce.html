    <ol>
            <li>The best cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have now bought the Jan Marini bioglycolic body wash as well and am very happy with both products.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Perfect.  </li>
            <li>It does a very good job at exfoliating</li>
            <li>This is good for acne-prone skin, but the gel worked BEST for my face.</li>
            <li>It wakes up your skin and is a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal.</li>
            <li>But as a mask or shaving it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Love this product!I have used the cleanser for 3 months and it makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li>These products have impressed me, so now I&#x27;m hunting for a Jan Marini eye makeup remover.  &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>I just saved a good amount of money too.</li>
            <li>Loving this skin care line, great for women over 50</li>
            <li>There is a fair amount of glycolic acid in it, so it does have a bit of a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked as good since I began using this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Awesome exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>this morning I used again and I cannot tell you how much better my skin appears!</li>
            <li>All around I am satisfied!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and no matter how broke I am, my Jan Marini Bioglycolic cleanser is a MUST in my skin care routine!</li>
            <li>It makes me love to wash my face!  </li>
            <li>Love the price and convenience of getting it from Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Always makes my face nice smooth and no acne!!</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed that my skin looked brilliant right after cleansing, as if I had just had a chemical peal.  </li>
            <li>I love the service and the product is exactly as advertised and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it did an awesome job of removing makeup and impurities if used as directed.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest this to people who may be sensitive to odor, the gel doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li>At night I wash twice to make sure</li>
            <li>But most acids will do that.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the oil-free biglycolic cleanser and it felt much better.</li>
            <li>My face looks better with makeup now than it used to.</li>
            <li>This product has more of a gel consistency</li>
            <li>I realized I was almost out of my favorite cleanser...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff--have used it for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 5?years now and will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li>My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>I love this face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The best facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>its very potent but really works!</li>
            <li>All in all, excellent product, it arrived quickly, and I&#x27;ll definitely reorder from this seller.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many cleansers and this is by far the best I have used for adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have always had beautiful Italian olive skin, but not I have skin problems galore!!</li>
            <li>First, it feels like lotion, it has a nice smell to it unlike the gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the brightness, smoothness and youthfulness of my skin</li>
            <li>I think it does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser does a fantastic job of getting into your pours w/o drying out your skin.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>love, love this stuff so much</li>
            <li>but you feel really clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling really clean without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>I like the oily skin formula because it leaves my skin feeling clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned this is the best facial cleanser out there.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cleanser.</li>
            <li>In other words, it makes a great exfoliator.      </li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I first used the product, my skin would feel a bit dry for a while, but as I used it more and more, my skin adapted and feels wonderfully clean afterwards!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched a long time for the perfect cleanser and finally found it.</li>
            <li>Really gets off the make-up and it so easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly as I remembered it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this cleanser after being told that glycolic acid works better for adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have always had problems finding appropriate cleansers for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice and actually improved the appearance of my face.  </li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant because of the prices, but my skin needed it and the price for the cleanser and SPF are not bad.     </li>
            <li>I love that one bottle lasts forever, since I only have to use two pumps to wash my face/neck thoroughly and my skin feels so clean every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT dry out your skin, and when you use the entire system: Well, I am proud to say I am almost completely acne free!   </li>
            <li>This cleanser is great for dry or sensitive skin that is prone to acne.</li>
            <li>you put it on DRY and then use a warm washcloth to wipe off.</li>
            <li>I had a facial with the Jan Marini facial cleanser about 6 months ago and couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin looked and felt in just one use.</li>
            <li>After searching online, I found this very reasonable price and ordered.</li>
            <li>Most AHA/BHA products do the same thing and it is just a matter of finding one you like.    </li>
            <li>I know for most of us, when we find something that finally works, we often don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s in it!</li>
            <li>Of course I bought a bottle of the cleanser and after six months of use, my skin looks better than it has in my entire life.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt this is THE BEST product on the market for troubled skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the timely transaction!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using these products for about 3 weeks consistently now.  </li>
            <li>This is my first bioglycolic product and it makes my face feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried more facial cleansers than I can imagine.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and is clean with this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>In terms of what I do like, my skin is not dried out and seems more radiant and clear.</li>
            <li>I really hope my skin starts to look better when I go back to Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>if you have super sensitive skin, this IS an acid.</li>
            <li>Certainly doesn&#x27;t remove make up or oil.</li>
            <li>And ingredients that can interfere with my hormones, make me very reluctant to use them.    </li>
            <li>I have been using this product since the summer and really like it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just the lotion and cream that are really cost-prohibitive.</li>
            <li>Seeking hope and help, I went to a fancy spa for a facial, while there, the aestetician asked what products I was using for my face, I told her I was using some cheap Walgreens stuff (St. Ives, Aveeno, etc.)</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much detergent cleanser agent in it, so it doesn&#x27;t foam...</li>
            <li>it has a consistency much like the Cetaphil gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>i really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product - for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>I like this product but personally still stands incomparable to what the Bioglycolic gel does for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I think they work really well together.  </li>
            <li>Use a washcloth when washing your face to make sure all the residue is off - if you just splash water to rinse your face, you&#x27;ll leave residue on your skin, which makes it harder for the skin to absorb your moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast--price reasonable</li>
            <li>I feel like it really reduces razor bumps.</li>
            <li>But I think I am open to more natural glycolic products, that don&#x27;t use additional chemicals in order to save money.</li>
            <li>but if you do it everyday your skin will get used to it and it will not be as effective.</li>
            <li>When I did my face stopped becoming dry.</li>
            <li>Glycolic acid is a chemical exfoliant, so it&#x27;s pretty much eats through that top layer of dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria.  </li>
            <li>, my old acne scars are almost gone, my skin tone is bright and even and my pores look so small</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend leaving it on for 2-5 minutes before gently rinsing, so you can obtain the full benefits of the glycolic ingredient.</li>
            <li>If I use it consistently, my face remains fairly clear.</li>
            <li>cant live without this cleanser!</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased this cleanser to prepare my face for glycolic peels.  </li>
            <li>The key to getting the most out of this product is to not use it as a daily cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I recommend to ANYONE looking for a high quality exfoliant -  but keep in mind</li>
            <li>This face cleanser has improved my skin more than any other I have tried (and that&#x27;s a lot!!).  </li>
            <li>I have had moderate/severe acne basically my whole life, since I was about 7 years old.  </li>
            <li>and so it&#x27;s very drying for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it really helps clear up my acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for five years now, and never dries out my normal to T-zone oily complexion.</li>
            <li>She recommended this product and I tried it once or twice before I took it right back.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>After two weeks my face was virtually clear!  </li>
            <li>I  generally tolerate acids very well.</li>
            <li>If removing makeup, I still need to use my regular cleanser first.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it on amazon for $19 as I  have always paid $48 plus tax in the past.</li>
            <li>Until recently finding it on Amazon, I had always purchased it at my Dermotologist office at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>It would go from mild to moderate and in the last 10 years went severe, twice.</li>
            <li>This one is close to a cream cleanser and the oily skin formula is a clear gel.</li>
            <li>completely resurfaced my skin and helped keep the hormonal acne at bay.</li>
            <li>I have adult cystic acne &amp; over the years have tried every product out there.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne that started when I turned 22.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant because it&#x27;s so expensive, but decided to order anyway because the reviews were so good.</li>
            <li>Within a few days of using the cleanser and cream, I noticed significant improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like I just got a facial at a high end establishment.</li>
            <li>MY skin is clearer but the product is extremely drying I cut down to once a day and try to use more moisturizer</li>
            <li>It took only a couple of weeks not only for my skin to clear up, but even for some acne scars to dissapear!</li>
            <li>I ordered this just before the holidays and got notice that it shipped right away and a few days later, it&#x27;s in my mailbox.  </li>
            <li>You need to apply it to dry skin (I wet my face first), massage in, wipe off with a damp washcloth, and then rinse your face.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought the lotion a long time ago because my face has totally transformed into glowing clear skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only product line that actually clears up cystic acne, and usually in just a few days :)  </li>

            <li> Seeking hope and help, I went to a fancy spa for a facial, while there, the aestetician asked what products I was using for my face, I told her I was using some cheap Walgreens stuff (St. Ives, Aveeno, etc.)</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much detergent cleanser agent in it, so it doesn&#x27;t foam...</li>
            <li> it has a consistency much like the Cetaphil gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> i really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product - for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I like this product but personally still stands incomparable to what the Bioglycolic gel does for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I think they work really well together.  </li>
            <li> Use a washcloth when washing your face to make sure all the residue is off - if you just splash water to rinse your face, you&#x27;ll leave residue on your skin, which makes it harder for the skin to absorb your moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast--price reasonable</li>
            <li> I feel like it really reduces razor bumps.</li>
            <li> But I think I am open to more natural glycolic products, that don&#x27;t use additional chemicals in order to save money.</li>
            <li> but if you do it everyday your skin will get used to it and it will not be as effective.</li>
            <li> When I did my face stopped becoming dry.</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid is a chemical exfoliant, so it&#x27;s pretty much eats through that top layer of dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria.  </li>
            <li> , my old acne scars are almost gone, my skin tone is bright and even and my pores look so small</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend leaving it on for 2-5 minutes before gently rinsing, so you can obtain the full benefits of the glycolic ingredient.</li>
            <li> If I use it consistently, my face remains fairly clear.</li>
            <li> cant live without this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this cleanser to prepare my face for glycolic peels.  </li>
            <li> The key to getting the most out of this product is to not use it as a daily cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I recommend to ANYONE looking for a high quality exfoliant -  but keep in mind</li>
            <li> This face cleanser has improved my skin more than any other I have tried (and that&#x27;s a lot!!).  </li>
            <li> I have had moderate/severe acne basically my whole life, since I was about 7 years old.  </li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s very drying for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it really helps clear up my acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for five years now, and never dries out my normal to T-zone oily complexion.</li>
            <li> She recommended this product and I tried it once or twice before I took it right back.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> After two weeks my face was virtually clear!  </li>
            <li> I  generally tolerate acids very well.</li>
            <li> If removing makeup, I still need to use my regular cleanser first.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it on amazon for $19 as I  have always paid $48 plus tax in the past.</li>
            <li> Until recently finding it on Amazon, I had always purchased it at my Dermotologist office at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> It would go from mild to moderate and in the last 10 years went severe, twice.</li>
            <li> This one is close to a cream cleanser and the oily skin formula is a clear gel.</li>
            <li> completely resurfaced my skin and helped keep the hormonal acne at bay.</li>
            <li> I have adult cystic acne &amp; over the years have tried every product out there.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne that started when I turned 22.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because it&#x27;s so expensive, but decided to order anyway because the reviews were so good.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using the cleanser and cream, I noticed significant improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like I just got a facial at a high end establishment.</li>
            <li> MY skin is clearer but the product is extremely drying I cut down to once a day and try to use more moisturizer</li>
            <li> It took only a couple of weeks not only for my skin to clear up, but even for some acne scars to dissapear!</li>
            <li> I ordered this just before the holidays and got notice that it shipped right away and a few days later, it&#x27;s in my mailbox.  </li>
            <li> You need to apply it to dry skin (I wet my face first), massage in, wipe off with a damp washcloth, and then rinse your face.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought the lotion a long time ago because my face has totally transformed into glowing clear skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only product line that actually clears up cystic acne, and usually in just a few days :)  </li>
            <li> I used everything as directed, cleanser on DRY skin (DO NOT wet your skin BEFORE cleaning) and mix spf with my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> You apply it to dry skin, not wet, and I use a battery-operated cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> The biggest issues I have with Jan Marini in particular are the harsh sulphates and parabens.</li>
            <li> I also developed tiny little white heads all over my cheeks and 10 months later they are still there.  </li>
            <li> As a cleanser it doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin long enough to be of any benefit</li>
            <li> Definitely follow the proper way to use it- on dry skin and use a wet rag to wipe it off before rinsing it off with water and a rag.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say it has cleared up my skin as it does cause some minor irritation</li>
            <li> If it takes a while to feel the tingle, then you had a lot of old dead skin on your face.  </li>
            <li> From time to time I would get little breakouts, nothing major.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions stated on the bottle to put on DRY skin, and just wipe off with damp cloth.</li>
            <li> This is because you have different layers of dead skin on different parts of your face.</li>
            <li> I have used other Jan Marini products and wanted this to go along w/ the other facial items.  </li>
            <li> I only use this product at night before bed, because of slight pink-ness afterward.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller..if I do get a pimple its tiny compared to what I previously would get.</li>
            <li> The regular Biglycolic Facial Cleanser seems very heavy and even greasy.</li>
            <li> It seems this one is made for folks with delicate maybe even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I began researching AHA facial care, and came across Jan Marini&#x27;s bioclear line.</li>
            <li> Once you can&#x27;t take the tingle anymore wipe it off w/a wet cloth.  </li>
            <li> i use this every other day along with a vitamin c cleanser from trader joes.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail on the date due.</li>
            <li> My derma put me on glycolic acid due to my sensitivity with benzoyl peroxide and salycic acid after years of use.  </li>
            <li> After a few days my skin became extremely dry despite using moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they are so stingy with the cream.</li>
            <li> and I just wanted to share my feelings in the subject.</li>
            <li> but I think that you can use less.  </li>
            <li> I have tons of black heads.</li>
            <li> Aside from the acid, the rest of the ingredients are known for being harsh and undesirable.</li>
            <li> The directions say to lather your face and then remove with a wet washcloth, and I see why: this cleaner can&#x27;t be removed with just splashing your face with water because it is thick and clings to the skin.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this the correct way, I no longer needed to have micro dermabrasions to get rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I tried using them less, not using them in combination together, everything!</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser on and off because I am not sure about how I feel about it yet.   </li>
            <li> I meant to buy the Jan Marini Bioglycolic Gel which I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Soon as I realized it was the wrong thing I ordered I went back to the site to order the one I need.</li>
            <li> It may tingle a little bit, but I take that to mean it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days, I can tell the difference!</li>
            <li> This is a very harsh chemical and must be used with caution.  </li>
            <li> I had been having lots of breakouts and was having a hard time getting rid of them.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I mean I&#x27;ve been dealing with this stuff since I was a preteen, so this product feels like a miracle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to suck it up, though, because I tried ordering a less expensive substitute, and it was unimpressive, to say the least.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to prefer it, if I use this cleanser 2x a week or when I look tired and dull.</li>
            <li> and I have broken out since using the product.</li>
            <li> This has made me break out, I look old, my skin looks terrible.</li>
            <li> Note that I bought the Bioglycolic Cleanser, which is pictured, but the product erroneously says Bioclean Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that suffers from acne and is hoping for a miracle.</li>
            <li> I believed I had bad genes and there was nothing that I could do about it.    </li>
            <li> I went through a phase of bad, bad skin.</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This face cleanser has improved my skin more than any other I have tried (and that&#x27;s a lot!!).  I would definitely recommend trying it out.  Definitely follow the proper way to use it- on dry skin and use a wet rag to wipe it off before rinsing it off with water and a rag.  At night I wash twice to make sure I get all the make up off.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser on and off because I am not sure about how I feel about it yet.   In terms of what I do like, my skin is not dried out and seems more radiant and clear. But most acids will do that. My skin seems to prefer it, if I use this cleanser 2x a week or when I look tired and dull. In other words, it makes a great exfoliator.      I cannot say it has cleared up my skin as it does cause some minor irritation and I have broken out since using the product. I  generally tolerate acids very well. Most AHA/BHA products do the same thing and it is just a matter of finding one you like.    The biggest issues I have with Jan Marini in particular are the harsh sulphates and parabens. Aside from the acid, the rest of the ingredients are known for being harsh and undesirable. Your skin absorbs everything you put on it. And ingredients that can interfere with my hormones, make me very reluctant to use them.    I have this big bottle I want to finish, however the ingredients make me feel uneasy and I just wanted to share my feelings in the subject. I know for most of us, when we find something that finally works, we often don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s in it! But I think I am open to more natural glycolic products, that don&#x27;t use additional chemicals in order to save money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cleanser after being told that glycolic acid works better for adult acne. From time to time I would get little breakouts, nothing major.  I purchased the night cream and spf day cream as well.  I immediately noticed that my skin looked brilliant right after cleansing, as if I had just had a chemical peal.  The glow did not last though, after about a week or two my skin began to almost blister with blemishes and acne.  I also developed tiny little white heads all over my cheeks and 10 months later they are still there.  I was horrified at the results of these products.  I tried using them less, not using them in combination together, everything! but the damage was done.  This is a very harsh chemical and must be used with caution.  I have always had beautiful Italian olive skin, but not I have skin problems galore!! I don&#x27;t know when my face will return to the way it was before, but I do know I will never purchase a Jan Marini product again!</li>
            <li> Awesome exactly what I needed.  I have rosecia and this cleared it up..</li>
            <li> I have had moderate/severe acne basically my whole life, since I was about 7 years old.  I had tried everything. Proactive doesn&#x27;t work, and every topical prescription medicine doesn&#x27;t work.  I was one of those people that believed nothing could ever help.  I believed I had bad genes and there was nothing that I could do about it.    Finally, when I was 20 someone recommended Jan Marini Bioglycolic.  After two days I saw improvement! After two weeks my face was virtually clear!  I recommend this product to anyone that suffers from acne and is hoping for a miracle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the summer and really like it.  I have used other Jan Marini products and wanted this to go along w/ the other facial items.  I think it does a fantastic job.  I had been having lots of breakouts and was having a hard time getting rid of them.  This cleanser does a fantastic job of getting into your pours w/o drying out your skin.  It says to use a quarter size amount but I think that you can use less.  Just recently I started using it in the morning and at night and again- Not Drying!  It is not recommend as use for a makeup remover and I agree.  It just doesn&#x27;t take the eye makeup off.  So I just use something else for that and then f/u w/ this cleanser.</li>
            <li> i use this every other day along with a vitamin c cleanser from trader joes. its very potent but really works! completely resurfaced my skin and helped keep the hormonal acne at bay. you put it on DRY and then use a warm washcloth to wipe off. then rinse. cant live without this cleanser!</li>
            <li> The regular Biglycolic Facial Cleanser seems very heavy and even greasy. I have combination skin that leans toward oily. The directions say to lather your face and then remove with a wet washcloth, and I see why: this cleaner can&#x27;t be removed with just splashing your face with water because it is thick and clings to the skin. I ended up buying the oil-free biglycolic cleanser and it felt much better.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I began researching AHA facial care, and came across Jan Marini&#x27;s bioclear line. I was hesitant because it&#x27;s so expensive, but decided to order anyway because the reviews were so good. Within a few days of using the cleanser and cream, I noticed significant improvement in the texture of my skin. It was softer and almost glowing. I have problems with dermatitis and psoriasis, and Jan Marini just wiped it out. By \\&quot;problems\\&quot; I mean I&#x27;ve been dealing with this stuff since I was a preteen, so this product feels like a miracle. My only complaint is that they are so stingy with the cream. You only get an ounce, and that lasts about a month. I&#x27;m going to have to suck it up, though, because I tried ordering a less expensive substitute, and it was unimpressive, to say the least. I still have plenty of the 8 ounce cleanser left, though--it&#x27;s just the lotion and cream that are really cost-prohibitive.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail on the date due. I eagerly opened this gift to myself and ran to the shower! I have purchased this product before from a spa and it was exactly as I remembered it! It smoothed my skin and refined my pores literally in ONE use! this morning I used again and I cannot tell you how much better my skin appears! I feel like I just got a facial at a high end establishment. I recommend to ANYONE looking for a high quality exfoliant -  but keep in mind if you have super sensitive skin, this IS an acid. All around I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> I went through a phase of bad, bad skin. Seeking hope and help, I went to a fancy spa for a facial, while there, the aestetician asked what products I was using for my face, I told her I was using some cheap Walgreens stuff (St. Ives, Aveeno, etc.) so she recommended I tried the Jan Marini skin care line. At first I was hesitant because of the prices, but my skin needed it and the price for the cleanser and SPF are not bad.     I used everything as directed, cleanser on DRY skin (DO NOT wet your skin BEFORE cleaning) and mix spf with my regular moisturizer. It took only a couple of weeks not only for my skin to clear up, but even for some acne scars to dissapear! I absolutely love this product and no matter how broke I am, my Jan Marini Bioglycolic cleanser is a MUST in my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> The best cleanser I have ever used.  I have been using this for years and I won&#x27;t ever change from using this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this just before the holidays and got notice that it shipped right away and a few days later, it&#x27;s in my mailbox.  I love the service and the product is exactly as advertised and in perfect condition.  I will definitely get my Jan Marini products here from now on!  I just saved a good amount of money too. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the market, from Pro-Active to M.A.C. to Yonka, etc, etc.  I had a facial with the Jan Marini facial cleanser about 6 months ago and couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin looked and felt in just one use. Of course I bought a bottle of the cleanser and after six months of use, my skin looks better than it has in my entire life.  I never get acne anymore, my old acne scars are almost gone, my skin tone is bright and even and my pores look so small now[[ASIN:B00158OCX2 Jan Marini Bioglycolic Facial Cleanser]].  This product has been nothing short of a miracle for my skin.  I love that one bottle lasts forever, since I only have to use two pumps to wash my face/neck thoroughly and my skin feels so clean every time I use it.  Without a doubt this is THE BEST product on the market for troubled skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great for dry or sensitive skin that is prone to acne. It won&#x27;t suck the moisture from your face but you feel really clean. I&#x27;ve searched a long time for the perfect cleanser and finally found it.</li>
            <li> Loving this skin care line, great for women over 50</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my esthetician.  I use it 2-3x/week.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, although it&#x27;s difficult to use.  You need to apply it to dry skin (I wet my face first), massage in, wipe off with a damp washcloth, and then rinse your face.  There isn&#x27;t much detergent cleanser agent in it, so it doesn&#x27;t foam...it has a consistency much like the Cetaphil gentle cleanser.  If removing makeup, I still need to use my regular cleanser first. I wish I had purchased the gel version, but I do notice improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and reduction in my acne.  WARNING: There is a fair amount of glycolic acid in it, so it does have a bit of a burning sensation.  Glycolic acid is a chemical exfoliant, so it&#x27;s pretty much eats through that top layer of dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria.  I only use this product at night before bed, because of slight pink-ness afterward.</li>
            <li> Love this product!I have used the cleanser for 3 months and it makes my skin look great! I have always had problems finding appropriate cleansers for my sensitive skin.Jan Marini has been a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this cleanser to prepare my face for glycolic peels.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it did an awesome job of removing makeup and impurities if used as directed.  It also smells nice and actually improved the appearance of my face.  My face looks better with makeup now than it used to. It leaves your skin feeling really clean without drying it out.  Will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a cosmetic store when I told the cashier about running low on my Glytone cream wash.  My derma put me on glycolic acid due to my sensitivity with benzoyl peroxide and salycic acid after years of use.  She recommended this product and I tried it once or twice before I took it right back.  This product has more of a gel consistency and so it&#x27;s very drying for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i really like this product.  it arrived quickly.  it really helps clear up my acne</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser thinking it was the oily skin formula. The difference is night and day. This one is close to a cream cleanser and the oily skin formula is a clear gel. I used this a couple of times and I don&#x27;t like it. It left a residue on my skin. I like the oily skin formula because it leaves my skin feeling clean with no residue. I would recommend this formula for sensitive/dry skin. If you have oily/combo skin do not buy this use the oily skin formula.</li>
            <li> MY skin is clearer but the product is extremely drying I cut down to once a day and try to use more moisturizer but if you want to get rid of stubborn pimples and white heads this product is for you!</li>
            <li> Note that I bought the Bioglycolic Cleanser, which is pictured, but the product erroneously says Bioclean Cleanser. Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this stuff so much I bought FIVE at one time. I can&#x27;t live without it and yes, I have tried. It wakes up your skin and is a great exfoliator. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cleanser. My skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I have adult cystic acne &amp; over the years have tried every product out there. This is the only product line that actually clears up cystic acne, and usually in just a few days :)  It does NOT dry out your skin, and when you use the entire system: Well, I am proud to say I am almost completely acne free!   I highly recommend this product - for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for five years now, and never dries out my normal to T-zone oily complexion. I would definitely recommend leaving it on for 2-5 minutes before gently rinsing, so you can obtain the full benefits of the glycolic ingredient. But everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so it would vary with personal experience. When I first used the product, my skin would feel a bit dry for a while, but as I used it more and more, my skin adapted and feels wonderfully clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned this is the best facial cleanser out there.  I have used it for several years.  I tried several cleansers which didn&#x27;t work for me.  They left bumps underneath my skin.  My face feels clean and is clean with this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I realized I was almost out of my favorite cleanser...that I can&#x27;t miss a day without. After searching online, I found this very reasonable price and ordered. My order came just in time! I was just about to be out! Thanks for the timely transaction!</li>
            <li> I really hope my skin starts to look better when I go back to Mary Kay. I had gone to get a facial and she told me I should start using a glycolic...... NEVER AGAIN. This has made me break out, I look old, my skin looks terrible. I have tons of black heads. I hate this product. I gave it a go too, I used it for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne that started when I turned 22. It would go from mild to moderate and in the last 10 years went severe, twice. I actually got this product by mistake. I meant to buy the Jan Marini Bioglycolic Gel which I have used in the past. Soon as I realized it was the wrong thing I ordered I went back to the site to order the one I need. I didn&#x27;t try to return this product, instead I gave it a shot. First, it feels like lotion, it has a nice smell to it unlike the gel. It seems this one is made for folks with delicate maybe even sensitive skin. I followed the instructions stated on the bottle to put on DRY skin, and just wipe off with damp cloth. After a few days my skin became extremely dry despite using moisturizer. So I decided to rinse it off with water like a regular face wash. When I did my face stopped becoming dry. I like this product but personally still stands incomparable to what the Bioglycolic gel does for my skin. When the gel came I only use this product in the morning, a soon as I wake up before going to the gym. But after coming back from the gym, before heading to work &amp; coming back from work, I use the gel. This is good for acne-prone skin, but the gel worked BEST for my face. I would suggest this to people who may be sensitive to odor, the gel doesn&#x27;t smell very good but I don&#x27;t mind, and can sting just a tiny bit in the beginning. This product won&#x27;t do that. I don&#x27;t regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> This is NOT for use to remove eye makeup, as it has a Bioglycolic exfoliant (like alpha-hydroxy, it&#x27;s acidic), so I&#x27;ve been using a vegan tea-tree oil eye makeup remover and then cleanse my face and neck with Jan Marini&#x27;s Bioglycolic Facial Cleanser.  It is moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.  I&#x27;ve been using it with the BioClear cream, I bought them from this seller together and I think they work really well together.  I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the brightness, smoothness and youthfulness of my skin and I&#x27;ve been using these products for about 3 weeks consistently now.  It makes me love to wash my face!  TIP FROM MY ESTHETICIAN: Use a washcloth when washing your face to make sure all the residue is off - if you just splash water to rinse your face, you&#x27;ll leave residue on your skin, which makes it harder for the skin to absorb your moisturizer.  All in all, excellent product, it arrived quickly, and I&#x27;ll definitely reorder from this seller.  These products have impressed me, so now I&#x27;m hunting for a Jan Marini eye makeup remover.  &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> The key to getting the most out of this product is to not use it as a daily cleanser.  Once a week, after cleaning your face, smooth on a thin layer of this all over you face &amp; let it sit until you start to feel it tingle.  The tingle is the glycolic acid doing its job. Once you can&#x27;t take the tingle anymore wipe it off w/a wet cloth.  Different areas of your face will tingle at different times. This is because you have different layers of dead skin on different parts of your face. If it takes a while to feel the tingle, then you had a lot of old dead skin on your face.  Once I started using this the correct way, I no longer needed to have micro dermabrasions to get rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff--have used it for a couple of years.  Shipping was fast--price reasonable</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two years now. Absolutely amazing! I love this product. I am 17 and I never get pimples like I did before I used this cleanser. You feel it working when it&#x27;s going on. I am so glad I found it on amazon for $19 as I  have always paid $48 plus tax in the past. This is a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is my first bioglycolic product and it makes my face feel so soft and smooth.  I have now bought the Jan Marini bioglycolic body wash as well and am very happy with both products.</li>
            <li> I have been using the bioglycolic cleanser going on 5 years. My complexion has improved. I remember only using it for 2 months and my dad was the first person to notice that my skin was clearer.(of all people he would be usually the last). I bought the bioglycolic lotion a month ago..I wish I would have bought the lotion a long time ago because my face has totally transformed into glowing clear skin. My pores are smaller..if I do get a pimple its tiny compared to what I previously would get. Jan Marini is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Eyes burned when used it, gave it a friend that recommended it.  I like a soapy cleanser, this is not.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Gentle and effective cleanser. Have been using this product for a couple of years. I have tried more facial cleansers than I can imagine. I won&#x27;t look further for another.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5?years now and will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> Perfect.  I have been using this product for years. Until recently finding it on Amazon, I had always purchased it at my Dermotologist office at a much higher price.  Love the price and convenience of getting it from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and will continue to!</li>
            <li> I use this as a mask and also for shaving the bikini line. As a cleanser it doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin long enough to be of any benefit and I don&#x27;t see how it can &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34; anyway. Certainly doesn&#x27;t remove make up or oil. But as a mask or shaving it&#x27;s great. Massage on and then leave for a while, then add a tiny bit of water to get it moist again and massage in again. It does a very good job at exfoliating but if you do it everyday your skin will get used to it and it will not be as effective. For shaving bump prone areas I put it on and massage it in, leave it on for a while, then get in the shower and add a bit of water so the razor can glide easier. I feel like it really reduces razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really gets off the make-up and it so easy to wash off. My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> Noticed an improvement in my skin within days.</li>
            <li> I love this face cleanser.  I got introduced to it at a salon when I was getting a facial.  You apply it to dry skin, not wet, and I use a battery-operated cleansing brush.  It may tingle a little bit, but I take that to mean it&#x27;s working.  My skin has never looked as good since I began using this cleanser.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for almost 18 years.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The best facial cleanser. A must have</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Always makes my face nice smooth and no acne!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many cleansers and this is by far the best I have used for adult acne. If I use it consistently, my face remains fairly clear. If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days, I can tell the difference!</li>
