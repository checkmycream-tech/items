            <li>With all the face washes available out there, you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be fairly easy to pick one up</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and as ordered--thanks!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, fair skin, and tends toward the oily side.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m so grateful that this was given to me, just a great overall cleanser!</li>

            <li>B000PKWAM6 Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel, 8.4 fl oz (250 ml)]]</li>
            <li>I have been using Dermalogiica Special Cleansing for some time</li>
            <li>Love this product so much, once you go Dermalogica</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is gentle on my face and don&#x27;t have any soapy residue.</li>
            <li>No seal between the pump and main bottle, there is a crusty substance around the pump top, and the &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; is a strip of packaging tape that appears to have been peeled off and re-applied.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m finding that the Special Cleansing Gel leaves my face so clean yet so soft, that there are many days where I skip my moisturizer altogether.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended:)</li>
            <li>do a search &amp; see if you can find a free sample as I did first</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it !!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ll enjoy the touch and feel of your skin.    </li>
            <li>Well worth the prices</li>
            <li>There is not artificial fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t strip your face of necessary oils, but gets it nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>but I am certainly ordering a bottle of this!</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much (bonus there!)</li>
            <li>My skin is fair, dry and sensitive as well.  </li>
            <li>I tried: Murad, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, Mary Kay, etc.</li>
            <li>BTW, I have sensitive skin and this special cleansing gel by Dermalogica</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much everything out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the Dermalogica product line, and now that I don&#x27;t have to hunt down a stor, I&#x27;ll never be without.  </li>
            <li>Omni solutions sent us \\&quot; Essesntial Cleansing Solution\\&quot; instead of \\&quot; Special Cleansing gel\\&quot; and then they sent the replacement via regular First Class mail and it reached us after like 3 weeks because of postal delays.</li>
            <li>The person I gave this to, upon her request, says she really likes it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the face and gets my eye makeup off as well.</li>
            <li>Gentle and does not irritate skin</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using dermalogica products for almost 15 years and have seen positive results now that I am getting older.  </li>
            <li>The 16.9oz dispenser last a very long time making this a very cost effective Cleansing Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Buy , you will not regret it.</li>
            <li>I always come back to this because it is non-drying and makes my face feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I have to clean my face with a makeup remover wipe prior to use which</li>
            <li>I have been using this Dermalogica Special Cleaning Gel for several years.</li>
            <li>I then follow up with a light scrubbing with a washcloth and a rinse of water and then pat dry</li>
            <li>It may seem expensive, but one 16 oz bottle lasts me for over a year, and you don&#x27;t need more than a pea size amount, so I believe it&#x27;s cheaper than most drug store products.</li>
            <li>This product, is oh-so-gentle on your skin yet, cleans it gently and leaves it feeling soft as if it had never been cleaner!    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 years old with better skin than I had 20 years ago due to this product.</li>
            <li>In any case, I looked past that as soon as I tried this wash because it is just so great--just a straightforward, gentle cleanser that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Also, this bottle is HUGE and I espect it to last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but really when you do the math this lasts for 6-9 months and you may spend just as much on buying cheeper products multiple times over that time</li>
            <li>so i think its pretty obvious that this was opened, dumped out and replaced with something else.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is so gentle that you can even open up your eyes while washing with it, and my eyes are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive normal to dry skin with red blotchy patches on my cheeks</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and although some other products were ok, I was alway blotchy and have a hard time with adult acne.</li>
            <li>She promised me that my skin would clear up in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is gentle enough to take off eye makeup with out having to use a seperate eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this facewash has never irritated the skin on my face or eyes.</li>
            <li>As this product is rather expensive, you&#x27;ll be happy to hear that you ONLY need about a nickel size of the dispensed gel to achieve these terrific results.</li>
            <li>You first wet your hands and then your face.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old and have dryer skin as I age, and this product does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets!</li>
            <li>After having fairly clear skin in my 20&#x27;s, my acne started back up as I turned 30.</li>
            <li>and I feel like this is the only product I can wash my face with that keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>People tell me frequently that I look much younger</li>
            <li>Not harsh and deep cleans .</li>
            <li>Prior to using the Special Skin Gel, when I washed my face with other products they left my face drier and some left a film of some type.</li>
            <li>A large bottle will last you at least 6 months and probably much longer!    </li>
            <li>Does not dry my skin out and works well with my dermalogica skin smoothing cream.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested this brand of cleanser &amp; of course I \\&quot;thought\\&quot; another over priced cleanser that is going to dry my skin out, WOW</li>
            <li>I have oily and sensitive skin, it cleans my face without dry it.</li>

            <li> Someone suggested this brand of cleanser &amp; of course I \\&quot;thought\\&quot; another over priced cleanser that is going to dry my skin out, WOW</li>
            <li> I have oily and sensitive skin, it cleans my face without dry it.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the larger size, although expensive, it will last up to a year because all that&#x27;s needed is a tiny bit, which spreads easily.</li>
            <li> The cleanser also goes a long way, only a pea to dime size for every use.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin tight and soft.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> &amp; after washing my face (&amp; I REALLY mean this) for the absolute 1st time my skin felt clean, refreshed, &amp; not all tight &amp; dry as usual!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and some small acne</li>
            <li> and it can never decide if it is dry or oily.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin</li>
            <li> I always tried different cleansers but everything always made the skin tight.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been a lot harder for me than it should be.</li>
            <li> And of course it can be expensive for some, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> so on occasion when I have run out I have tried other products.  </li>
            <li> (not sure what it is from but in Winter my skin gets very red with eczema).</li>
            <li> Recommended toner is multi-active toner and active moist.</li>

            <li> The person I gave this to, upon her request, says she really likes it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for years . It&#x27;s great for the face. Use it twice a day. Great price and speedy shipping from this seller.</li>
            <li> I like the pump on this bottle.  Makes it easy to grab the amount of product you need while at the sink or in the shower. Also, this bottle is HUGE and I espect it to last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and the item arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> I love this face soap and love how clean it makes my face feel without being greasy.</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!this product is fake!!!the seal is ruined by someone before!!!and the product date is also erased!!!I want my money back!!!</li>
            <li> I must say that I was not entirely excited when a friend gave this face wash to me as a gift. Perhaps I should have taken offense? In any case, I looked past that as soon as I tried this wash because it is just so great--just a straightforward, gentle cleanser that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. With all the face washes available out there, you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be fairly easy to pick one up that is no-frills and doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin but it&#x27;s been a lot harder for me than it should be. So I&#x27;m so grateful that this was given to me, just a great overall cleanser!</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for 6 years and it the best i have ever used. I always tried different cleansers but everything always made the skin tight. This cleanser is gentle enough to take off eye makeup with out having to use a seperate eye makeup remover. It has no soap in it so it keeps the skin&#x27;s PH balance in check and removes impurities w/o disturbing the skin&#x27;s natural moisture balance. The cleanser also goes a long way, only a pea to dime size for every use. Use every morning and night. Toner and moisturize after every wash.  Recommended toner is multi-active toner and active moist. And of course it can be expensive for some, but its worth it. Take care of your skin. You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleansing gel now for about 5 years.  It is not cheap so on occasion when I have run out I have tried other products.  I always come back to this because it is non-drying and makes my face feel clean.  I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 30 that is worried about drying out their skin. It does not make your skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I sufferred from moderate acne as a teenager. After having fairly clear skin in my 20&#x27;s, my acne started back up as I turned 30. I went to a facialist who started me on Dermalogica products. She promised me that my skin would clear up in about 2 weeks. It did! I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for 10 years now, and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very sensitive, fair skin, and tends toward the oily side.  I&#x27;ll never switch to another skin care line. It may seem expensive, but one 16 oz bottle lasts me for over a year, and you don&#x27;t need more than a pea size amount, so I believe it&#x27;s cheaper than most drug store products. I have also used the daily microfoliant (awesome) and their moisturizers. I cannot think of a better product anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the Dermalogica product line, and now that I don&#x27;t have to hunt down a stor, I&#x27;ll never be without.  Product arrived quickly and as ordered--thanks!</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much everything out there. Anything you can buy in the grocery store, mail order products like proactive etc. I picked up a bottle of this at a spa b/c it is what they used at their business for a facial. It works great. I have super sensitive skin and although some other products were ok, I was alway blotchy and have a hard time with adult acne. I have mixed skin and it can never decide if it is dry or oily. This WORKS! It is very gentle on my skin and I don&#x27;t need to put any cream or moisturizer on afterwards.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Beauty_Solutions and its obviously been tampered with.  No seal between the pump and main bottle, there is a crusty substance around the pump top, and the &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; is a strip of packaging tape that appears to have been peeled off and re-applied.  Cleaner smells very different from the last bottle i just finished so i think its pretty obvious that this was opened, dumped out and replaced with something else.</li>
            <li> Omni solutions sent us \\&quot; Essesntial Cleansing Solution\\&quot; instead of \\&quot; Special Cleansing gel\\&quot; and then they sent the replacement via regular First Class mail and it reached us after like 3 weeks because of postal delays. I would have thought they would send it through a faster service sinc eit was their fault. I would avoid them in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Dermalogica Special Cleaning Gel for several years. My skin is fair, dry and sensitive as well.  Prior to using the Special Skin Gel, when I washed my face with other products they left my face drier and some left a film of some type. They didn&#x27;t seen to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; my skin.    This product, is oh-so-gentle on your skin yet, cleans it gently and leaves it feeling soft as if it had never been cleaner!    As this product is rather expensive, you&#x27;ll be happy to hear that you ONLY need about a nickel size of the dispensed gel to achieve these terrific results. A large bottle will last you at least 6 months and probably much longer!    You first wet your hands and then your face. Place a nickel size portion of the gel in your hands and rub your hands together, then rub all over your face. Yes, it is so gentle that you can even open up your eyes while washing with it, and my eyes are very sensitive.  If you get a great amount of suds in your hands, you&#x27;re using TOO much of the  product. I then follow up with a light scrubbing with a washcloth and a rinse of water and then pat dry, If you feel you need moisturizer feel free to apply. But I&#x27;m finding that the Special Cleansing Gel leaves my face so clean yet so soft, that there are many days where I skip my moisturizer altogether.    Well worth the prices and I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ll enjoy the touch and feel of your skin.    [[ASIN:B000PKWAM6 Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel, 8.4 fl oz (250 ml)]] Also available in 16 oz pump bottles</li>
            <li> A basic non scented cleansing gel that does it&#x27;s everyday job. Does not dry my skin out and works well with my dermalogica skin smoothing cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much, once you go Dermalogica there is no turning back!</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, but this foaming cleanser is the best for my sensitve skin and the best at getting all the makeup off.</li>
            <li> Bought this many times already, it is really a good facial wash! I am happy that it keeps my skin clean and hydrated. Will continue using this.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive normal to dry skin with red blotchy patches on my cheeks all year round (not sure what it is from but in Winter my skin gets very red with eczema). I thought I had just about tried every cleanser recommended with no big relief. Someone suggested this brand of cleanser &amp; of course I \\&quot;thought\\&quot; another over priced cleanser that is going to dry my skin out, WOW what a super pleasant surprise! First off it&#x27;s quite concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much (bonus there!) &amp; after washing my face (&amp; I REALLY mean this) for the absolute 1st time my skin felt clean, refreshed, &amp; not all tight &amp; dry as usual! This cleanser is liquid gold to my skin! I love it &amp; would recommend it to anybody. If you think it&#x27;s maybe to expensive do a search &amp; see if you can find a free sample as I did first but I am certainly ordering a bottle of this! I just can&#x27;t say anything bad about it &amp; I do speak my mind! Highly recommended:)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying beauty products online from an unknown seller. I have no regrets! The product arrived with original seal. Not only did the product arrive sooner than estimated arrival time given here on amazon, DermaShoppe included samples with my purchase. It was obvious that the samples were selected based on my purchase - they are perfect for my skin. Now that&#x27;s what I call customer service!!! BTW, I have sensitive skin and this special cleansing gel by Dermalogica is not too harsh for my skin. I use it as make-up remover (pre-cleanse) and regular face wash. Also perfect to clean make-up brushes. Highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this facewash !!! It is gentle on the face and gets my eye makeup off as well. I have sensitive skin and this facewash has never irritated the skin on my face or eyes. There is not artificial fragrance in it. This is a product I have been using for about 5 or more years and stick with a good thing. Even though Dermalogica is expensive, I feel it is a value to purchase the bigger size as it lasts so long. I am 55 years old and have dryer skin as I age, and this product does not dry out my skin. I would highly recommend it !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Dermalogica, you know it&#x27;s awesome stuff.  I buy this once a year or so and love it.  So do all guests who use my shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dermalogica products for almost 15 years and have seen positive results now that I am getting older.  People tell me frequently that I look much younger and I have dermalogica to thank for it.  I recommend buying the larger size, although expensive, it will last up to a year because all that&#x27;s needed is a tiny bit, which spreads easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogiica Special Cleansing for some time it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I am more than satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> The best cleansing gel I have ever used. The 16.9oz dispenser last a very long time making this a very cost effective Cleansing Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Buy , you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I have always used this gel to wash my face. It not only feels good, but it smells great. I love the fact that it is gentle on my face and don&#x27;t have any soapy residue. Will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Best face wash, does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and love it! I have very sensitive skin and some small acne and I feel like this is the only product I can wash my face with that keeps my skin clear. I&#x27;ve tried basically every type of face wash you can think of with all sorts of different price points. I tried: Murad, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, Mary Kay, etc. the list goes on. I finally decided to bite the bullet and spend the extra money to try this out. I will never use anything else a again and here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- It lasts forever! Mine lasts me anywhere from 6 - 9 months. I use it twice a day, morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t strip your face of necessary oils, but gets it nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle and does not irritate skin&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used to remove light makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Upfront price, but really when you do the math this lasts for 6-9 months and you may spend just as much on buying cheeper products multiple times over that time period.&lt;br /&gt;- If you wear a lot of makeup, it won&#x27;t take it off. I have to clean my face with a makeup remover wipe prior to use which I don&#x27;t mind doing.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t suds a ton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! Love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 years old with better skin than I had 20 years ago due to this product. Not harsh and deep cleans . Keeps my skin tight and soft. Use on neck as well. I&#x27;ve had no blemishes or by&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts since using this product the past 2 years. Take a look at the moisturizing cream as.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found this to be a good cleanser</li>
            <li> I have use this for 10 year and love it.  I have oily and sensitive skin, it cleans my face without dry it.</li>
