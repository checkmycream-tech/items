            <li>/&gt;Overall an AMAZING prooduct and</li>
            <li>The one file head I really think works the best is the silver all metal</li>
            <li>works great took awhile to get it but happy with the product  just as good as a professional</li>
            <li>but it does a rather nice job and seems to use batteries well.</li>
            <li>Shipping OK, product a good spare to have.</li>
            <li>like all good love it</li>
            <li>doesnt work worth beans!!!</li>
            <li>decent for the price I paid, the attachments arent the greatest</li>
            <li>I am happy with it though, I like being able to buff my nails to a fine sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for quick fixer-uppers.</li>
            <li>Wow, what an amazing deal at $3!!!  </li>
            <li>but good and battery life is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>this product is easy to use and i love it!</li>
            <li>For the price, I was just seeing if it was to good to be true.</li>
            <li>This is so handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super cheap, didn&#x27;t expect anything great.  </li>
            <li>Helped me take off acrylic easily, shipped quickly, came in cute purple pouch and bits came in own case!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>great product -very</li>
            <li>useful -good price</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love buying her inexpensive finds</li>
            <li>I would like a lot better if it came with instructions on each piece</li>
            <li>The Emjoi is the best--fortunately, the attachments fit my Emjoi!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order more than one</li>
            <li>Wish it had more power.b</li>
            <li>I was able to try this out today, and it&#x27;s a hit and miss with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried to put the top on and its like its made of candle wax.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>Works much better than I ever thought it would for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had one just like this before and paid more money.</li>
            <li>It worked ok..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for beginners.</li>
            <li>I need more  of drill for my husband feet..or  saw</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay to try it.</li>
            <li>It served my purpose to some degree, except, as many review did, it cannot hold the bits after some use.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m talking barely touching your nail.  </li>
            <li>I love these for my manicures and pedicures.  </li>
            <li>I might order more for gifts.</li>
            <li>Love the price and product.</li>
            <li>should have ordered more</li>
            <li>Does the job amazingly for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the quality and performance of this item.</li>
            <li>Comes with a cute carrying bag</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to part with many.</li>
            <li>Powerful I was very surprised excellent tool</li>
            <li>This works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that after using this item, that I will have to stop being cheap and invest in one that plugs in/works better for my needs.</li>
            <li>This electric file is perfect for the amount that I spent on it.</li>
            <li>Granted it was cheap, but you&#x27;d be better off getting something pricier that does its job.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and to change.  </li>
            <li>Tips fall out too easily</li>
            <li>it is portable easy to use any place  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use and the bits stay in.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t really strong.</li>
            <li>nice for the price , and was very fast to ship</li>
            <li>I do my own nails and this is my first drill...</li>
            <li>Bubble wrap would have been fine.</li>
            <li>Once you can attach and the piece stays, it works fine.</li>
            <li>I like this just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works perfectly fine for me, I have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li>This worked out just fine</li>
            <li>I enjoyed getting pedicures until I got an infection from place not sterilizing their utensils adequately.</li>
            <li>as originally I found one in the drug store and now I cannot easily find them.  </li>
            <li>someone who likes to do their nails might find this item helpful, but I don&#x27;t have that much time to do my own nails.  </li>
            <li>So so cheap</li>
            <li>but they actually work great.</li>
            <li>I liked this device so much</li>
            <li>that I know she&#x27;ll enjoy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other then that if you have the time to sit and lightly touch it to your nail (since the light/medium pressure will cause it to stop working) it does work.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this items as it helps a lot...</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-mine came in a light purple  silk like bag with a draw string.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I went cheap.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, and I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>A fantastic surprise.  </li>
            <li>I kind of wish it had a setting of how fast you want it to go</li>
            <li>i found it very useful</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not pay more than I did, but it does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>First, the top part that comes off to replace the battery doesn&#x27;t screw on in a secure locked position so it tends to pop off during usage.</li>
            <li>Fun to add to the mani pediatrics kit!</li>
            <li>but my daughter seems excited with it</li>
            <li>Im pretty sure theirs</li>
            <li>I would like to know what&#x27;s the purpose of each filer head &amp; how to clean them after each use without messing them up.</li>
            <li>Very cheap and does not work well even with brand new batteries!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice tool it took a very long time to get to me</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t anything special but it keeps everything together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true what they say you get what you payed for.</li>
            <li>Its strong and does a good job of filing your nail down smoothly.</li>
            <li>Wow this is really cool when I first used it I really loved it and its fun to use.</li>
            <li>Is great not for just nails, but for other filing works as well.</li>
            <li>I most likely need a better quality product.</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast and very hot!</li>
            <li>And the device and the battery got very hot.  </li>
            <li>Another thing is that it looks pretty cheap when you look at it</li>
            <li>It is quite powerful and is great for assisting in cuticle removal, filing down nails and buffing and smoothing nails!</li>
            <li>It works okay as far as filing and working on polishing the nails.  </li>
            <li>Do my own acrylics and this is definite help..</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it uses batteries instead of being plugged in cause my old one died that way.  </li>
            <li>but then again it wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid..</li>
            <li>but it was worth waiting for.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, and this is well worth what I paid for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say that for 5 bucks it is easily worth the risk.</li>
            <li>I liked the different tools as well.</li>
            <li>After installing fresh batteries, the device didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This was worth every penny</li>
            <li>; it seemed to get warm to the touch pretty quickly when used for a short amount of time. &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I do wish it had more heads as I have seen other drills with more</li>
            <li>I recommend this great little to anyone who wants to get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>Got one for my husband who can&#x27;t bend because of spinal&lt;br /&gt;problems and helps him reach and do his toe nails and for us the pricewas right.</li>
            <li>Pretty good 5 bucks spent here.</li>
            <li>this thing is pretty fast on full blast.</li>
            <li>It words just as good as the previous one I have.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t do much for the nail because it was kinda light on the acrylic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent - not bad for the price</li>
            <li>This is a good little rotary file for the price.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as the original and bogs down with too much pressure?</li>
            <li>I wish the motor had a little more power but overall it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well on nails as as substitute to manual buffing with an emory board.  </li>
            <li>Only ok.</li>
            <li>It is not expensive but it serves my purpose to trim my deformed, over grown nails which hurts my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love these things, keep several all around the house..</li>
            <li>And funny</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Did not come with bits... Very furious!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am particular fond of it for zipping the nails off my toddler really quickly.  </li>
            <li>It uses 2 AA batteries which is pretty convenient.  </li>
            <li>The first one I had lasted for years until my puppy chewed it up.</li>
            <li>I love it now that I finally have it.</li>
            <li>Cute but does not work..  Not enough power.</li>
            <li>And it quit working on the first day.</li>
            <li>First I thought it was electrical</li>
            <li>it broke on first use</li>
            <li>or you could file right thru ur whole nailbed.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the pink conical file so far (on real, rather brittle toenails, no acrylic or anything like that), but it worked great!</li>
            <li>You might grind down way more than you want!</li>
            <li>Havent used these for acrylics yet, but on the natural nails free edge this works really well.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>You have two options with this device:&lt;br /&gt;Insert the bits in securely, in which case they will not spin, or will barely spin.&lt;br /&gt;OR</li>
            <li>It works great, if no better that my TRIM brand one, of which I&#x27;ve owned 2 so far plus a Homedics one with the built-in dryer.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that the accessories are pressed into the hole and held there just by friction, and they come out rather easily as you are working on your nails.  </li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>However, the price is good and they meet my needs as long as they last.  </li>
            <li>Nice little manicure tool.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really stay shut unless you hold it or tape it</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and I spotted him through my front window really checking this package out.  </li>
            <li>So no need to really apply pressure whIle you&#x27;re filing with either one.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful, but it was inexpensive...</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t have to use much force</li>
            <li>Really dollar store item.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have any problems with this drill, really.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li>This thing is Absolutely amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-doesn&#x27;t really make &amp;#34;nails on a chalkboard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This actually is a decent and effective little grinder.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it to smooth nail bed and nail edges, and push back my cuticles.</li>
            <li>other better ones out there</li>
            <li>Very cheap and not worth it.</li>
            <li>It works well enough to shape and clean up my nails.</li>
            <li>-The picture makes it look pocket size but its a great size not too big not too small</li>
            <li>I paid more than the current price and even the current price is too much...</li>
            <li>Second, there are two  file heads that work a little bit too good sometimes.</li>
            <li>Its only good for taking up a little space in your junk drawer.</li>
            <li>them loosely - in which case it would work fine - except the bits slip out</li>
            <li>Mainly because the set of 5 different tools that come with it, im sure wont last forever.</li>
            <li>But in it popped at the last second in it&#x27;s cute purple silk pouch.  </li>
            <li>This item I had high hopes for,but ended , but it ended after three uses ; it stopped working.</li>
            <li>This holds up to my high dollar drill.  </li>
            <li>Another reason I gave it four stars is because the cute little draw string bag that came with it ripped.</li>
            <li>The drill came in a little cute purple pouch.</li>
            <li>and I found it  to be very rough on my nails causing them to be brittle and split often and easily, something my nails have never done.</li>
            <li>So far  it  works  very well.</li>
            <li>After play around for quiet while to figure out, how it work change butteries I have to put a powerful battery to make it work.</li>
            <li>At its low price it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Overall the biggest and most basic issue is that this tool doesnt do the thing it is intended to do at all, i ended up using my manual file and buffer to complete the job.</li>
            <li>at least it was super cheap -</li>
            <li>Amizon sells other nail bit sets but I.  would like to find oi if they fit this tool.</li>
            <li>Arrived ahead of time, was well package and is exactly as I expected from the picture also is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>when added brand new batteries it never worked.</li>
            <li>and its NEW KEEP IT</li>
            <li>I bought 2 packs of new batteries none work.</li>
            <li>I bought it to file the new denture.  </li>
            <li>Great for natural nails and getting polish out of those small areas along with being great for filing down small rough patches around the finger nail area.</li>
            <li>In order to do my nails I have to hold the power button on the entire time which makes it harder and more time consuming.</li>
            <li>This definitely comes in handy when doing acrylic nails, it gets the job done but there are a few disadvantages about this product.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but to my amazement, this thing actually works WELL!  </li>
            <li>Even came early!</li>
            <li>This is overall a pretty sturdy and durable nail tool.</li>
            <li>Stops easily with little pressure.</li>
            <li>The heads are very easy to change and my nails look like I left a salon everyday</li>
            <li>In fact, you need to be careful when sing it on natural nails, it&#x27;ll really cut right through natural nail.</li>
            <li>but what do you expect for less than $5 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a little to strong for natural finger nails.  </li>
            <li>Works well, came early the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it four stars is because the batteries die really fast, and I put new ones and they still die after a while.</li>
            <li>I try to keep my nails nice but being in the Army makes it tough.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t waste your money since it was so cheap</li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>I got this thinking it would help me keep my cuticles from snagging and keep my nails naturally buffed.</li>
            <li>convenience is that it uses 2 AA batteries, disposable or rechargeable, The fixed rechargeable with charger does not work when get old,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I checked the mail too see that it had arrived way before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>Not too loud</li>
            <li>Not as professional as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>But overall it works pretty well especially because im new with doing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>but I actually think other brands might fit this</li>
            <li>As others have said, the motor really isn&#x27;t strong enough to do an adequate job and bogs down when even slight resistance is applied.</li>
            <li>my nails are shiny like when the sweet little ladies at the nail salon do them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially because it is a variable speed battery operated tool.</li>
            <li>Small and light weight.  </li>
            <li>my nail condition is back to normal.</li>
            <li>so you have to shake it and hold it upside down for the batteries to touch the contact, pretty much you are shaking it constantly to work.</li>
            <li>I currently have acrylics on and it didn&#x27;t spin fast enough to do ANYthing.</li>
            <li>and I have found it to be a powerful little Drill/Grinder for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was surprised because the price was so low.</li>
            <li>Maybe enough to remove old nail polish and trim the nails</li>
            <li>Does not really work if you press ot to much</li>
            <li>And then it worried me further because it didn&#x27;t show up until the last estimated day of delivery nearly a month after ordering it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting to do my own fake nails</li>
            <li>While it seems well constructed, the pink rubber grommet is nothing more than a small, flat rubber</li>
            <li>the first day this came in I opened it up and used all the attachments, just a little of each, to try them all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item seemed fine other than missing bits.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>had the same kind for almost 8 years, but it finally failed to function, and I ordered the same one as I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>only give it less than 5 stars because you need to be careful or you could scorch your nails or do somemajor damage miscalculating how powerful it can be.  </li>
            <li>Runs a little fast</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about ordering when I saw all the negative reviews but this filer is awesome!  </li>

            <li> For what it costs its a pretty impressive product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and all tips work great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall an AMAZING prooduct and</li>
            <li> The one file head I really think works the best is the silver all metal</li>
            <li> works great took awhile to get it but happy with the product  just as good as a professional</li>
            <li> but it does a rather nice job and seems to use batteries well.</li>

            <li> like all good love it</li>
            <li> doesnt work worth beans!!!</li>
            <li> decent for the price I paid, the attachments arent the greatest</li>
            <li> I am happy with it though, I like being able to buff my nails to a fine sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for quick fixer-uppers.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an amazing deal at $3!!!  </li>
            <li> but good and battery life is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> this product is easy to use and i love it!</li>
            <li> For the price, I was just seeing if it was to good to be true.</li>
            <li> This is so handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super cheap, didn&#x27;t expect anything great.  </li>
            <li> Helped me take off acrylic easily, shipped quickly, came in cute purple pouch and bits came in own case!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> great product -very</li>
            <li> useful -good price</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love buying her inexpensive finds</li>
            <li> I would like a lot better if it came with instructions on each piece</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is the best--fortunately, the attachments fit my Emjoi!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order more than one</li>
            <li> Wish it had more power.b</li>
            <li> I was able to try this out today, and it&#x27;s a hit and miss with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried to put the top on and its like its made of candle wax.</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> Works much better than I ever thought it would for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had one just like this before and paid more money.</li>
            <li> It worked ok..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for beginners.</li>
            <li> I need more  of drill for my husband feet..or  saw</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay to try it.</li>
            <li> It served my purpose to some degree, except, as many review did, it cannot hold the bits after some use.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m talking barely touching your nail.  </li>
            <li> I love these for my manicures and pedicures.  </li>
            <li> I might order more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Love the price and product.</li>
            <li> should have ordered more</li>
            <li> Does the job amazingly for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality and performance of this item.</li>
            <li> Comes with a cute carrying bag</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to part with many.</li>
            <li> Powerful I was very surprised excellent tool</li>
            <li> This works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that after using this item, that I will have to stop being cheap and invest in one that plugs in/works better for my needs.</li>
            <li> This electric file is perfect for the amount that I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Granted it was cheap, but you&#x27;d be better off getting something pricier that does its job.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and to change.  </li>
            <li> Tips fall out too easily</li>
            <li> it is portable easy to use any place  </li>
            <li> Its easy to use and the bits stay in.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t really strong.</li>
            <li> nice for the price , and was very fast to ship</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and this is my first drill...</li>
            <li> Bubble wrap would have been fine.</li>
            <li> Once you can attach and the piece stays, it works fine.</li>
            <li> I like this just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works perfectly fine for me, I have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> This worked out just fine</li>
            <li> I enjoyed getting pedicures until I got an infection from place not sterilizing their utensils adequately.</li>
            <li> as originally I found one in the drug store and now I cannot easily find them.  </li>
            <li> someone who likes to do their nails might find this item helpful, but I don&#x27;t have that much time to do my own nails.  </li>
            <li> So so cheap</li>
            <li> but they actually work great.</li>
            <li> I liked this device so much</li>
            <li> that I know she&#x27;ll enjoy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other then that if you have the time to sit and lightly touch it to your nail (since the light/medium pressure will cause it to stop working) it does work.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this items as it helps a lot...</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-mine came in a light purple  silk like bag with a draw string.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I went cheap.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, and I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> A fantastic surprise.  </li>
            <li> I kind of wish it had a setting of how fast you want it to go</li>
            <li> i found it very useful</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did not pay more than I did, but it does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> First, the top part that comes off to replace the battery doesn&#x27;t screw on in a secure locked position so it tends to pop off during usage.</li>
            <li> Fun to add to the mani pediatrics kit!</li>
            <li> but my daughter seems excited with it</li>
            <li> Im pretty sure theirs</li>
            <li> I would like to know what&#x27;s the purpose of each filer head &amp; how to clean them after each use without messing them up.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and does not work well even with brand new batteries!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice tool it took a very long time to get to me</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t anything special but it keeps everything together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works good enough for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true what they say you get what you payed for.</li>
            <li> Its strong and does a good job of filing your nail down smoothly.</li>
            <li> Wow this is really cool when I first used it I really loved it and its fun to use.</li>
            <li> Is great not for just nails, but for other filing works as well.</li>
            <li> I most likely need a better quality product.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and very hot!</li>
            <li> And the device and the battery got very hot.  </li>
            <li> Another thing is that it looks pretty cheap when you look at it</li>
            <li> It is quite powerful and is great for assisting in cuticle removal, filing down nails and buffing and smoothing nails!</li>
            <li> It works okay as far as filing and working on polishing the nails.  </li>
            <li> Do my own acrylics and this is definite help..</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it uses batteries instead of being plugged in cause my old one died that way.  </li>
            <li> but then again it wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid..</li>
            <li> but it was worth waiting for.  </li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and this is well worth what I paid for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say that for 5 bucks it is easily worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I liked the different tools as well.</li>
            <li> After installing fresh batteries, the device didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This was worth every penny</li>
            <li> ; it seemed to get warm to the touch pretty quickly when used for a short amount of time. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I do wish it had more heads as I have seen other drills with more</li>
            <li> I recommend this great little to anyone who wants to get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> Got one for my husband who can&#x27;t bend because of spinal&lt;br /&gt;problems and helps him reach and do his toe nails and for us the pricewas right.</li>
            <li> Pretty good 5 bucks spent here.</li>
            <li> this thing is pretty fast on full blast.</li>
            <li> It words just as good as the previous one I have.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do much for the nail because it was kinda light on the acrylic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent - not bad for the price</li>
            <li> This is a good little rotary file for the price.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as the original and bogs down with too much pressure?</li>
            <li> I wish the motor had a little more power but overall it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on nails as as substitute to manual buffing with an emory board.  </li>
            <li> Only ok.</li>
            <li> It is not expensive but it serves my purpose to trim my deformed, over grown nails which hurts my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love these things, keep several all around the house..</li>
            <li> And funny</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Did not come with bits... Very furious!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am particular fond of it for zipping the nails off my toddler really quickly.  </li>
            <li> It uses 2 AA batteries which is pretty convenient.  </li>
            <li> The first one I had lasted for years until my puppy chewed it up.</li>
            <li> I love it now that I finally have it.</li>
            <li> Cute but does not work..  Not enough power.</li>
            <li> And it quit working on the first day.</li>
            <li> First I thought it was electrical</li>
            <li> it broke on first use</li>
            <li> or you could file right thru ur whole nailbed.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the pink conical file so far (on real, rather brittle toenails, no acrylic or anything like that), but it worked great!</li>
            <li> You might grind down way more than you want!</li>
            <li> Havent used these for acrylics yet, but on the natural nails free edge this works really well.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> You have two options with this device:&lt;br /&gt;Insert the bits in securely, in which case they will not spin, or will barely spin.&lt;br /&gt;OR</li>
            <li> It works great, if no better that my TRIM brand one, of which I&#x27;ve owned 2 so far plus a Homedics one with the built-in dryer.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the accessories are pressed into the hole and held there just by friction, and they come out rather easily as you are working on your nails.  </li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> However, the price is good and they meet my needs as long as they last.  </li>
            <li> Nice little manicure tool.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really stay shut unless you hold it or tape it</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and I spotted him through my front window really checking this package out.  </li>
            <li> So no need to really apply pressure whIle you&#x27;re filing with either one.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful, but it was inexpensive...</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have to use much force</li>
            <li> Really dollar store item.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any problems with this drill, really.  </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> This thing is Absolutely amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t really make &amp;#34;nails on a chalkboard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This actually is a decent and effective little grinder.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it to smooth nail bed and nail edges, and push back my cuticles.</li>
            <li> other better ones out there</li>
            <li> Very cheap and not worth it.</li>
            <li> It works well enough to shape and clean up my nails.</li>
            <li> -The picture makes it look pocket size but its a great size not too big not too small</li>
            <li> I paid more than the current price and even the current price is too much...</li>
            <li> Second, there are two  file heads that work a little bit too good sometimes.</li>
            <li> Its only good for taking up a little space in your junk drawer.</li>
            <li> them loosely - in which case it would work fine - except the bits slip out</li>
            <li> Mainly because the set of 5 different tools that come with it, im sure wont last forever.</li>
            <li> But in it popped at the last second in it&#x27;s cute purple silk pouch.  </li>
            <li> This item I had high hopes for,but ended , but it ended after three uses ; it stopped working.</li>
            <li> This holds up to my high dollar drill.  </li>
            <li> Another reason I gave it four stars is because the cute little draw string bag that came with it ripped.</li>
            <li> The drill came in a little cute purple pouch.</li>
            <li> and I found it  to be very rough on my nails causing them to be brittle and split often and easily, something my nails have never done.</li>
            <li> So far  it  works  very well.</li>
            <li> After play around for quiet while to figure out, how it work change butteries I have to put a powerful battery to make it work.</li>
            <li> At its low price it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Overall the biggest and most basic issue is that this tool doesnt do the thing it is intended to do at all, i ended up using my manual file and buffer to complete the job.</li>
            <li> at least it was super cheap -</li>
            <li> Amizon sells other nail bit sets but I.  would like to find oi if they fit this tool.</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of time, was well package and is exactly as I expected from the picture also is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> when added brand new batteries it never worked.</li>
            <li> and its NEW KEEP IT</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs of new batteries none work.</li>
            <li> I bought it to file the new denture.  </li>
            <li> Great for natural nails and getting polish out of those small areas along with being great for filing down small rough patches around the finger nail area.</li>
            <li> In order to do my nails I have to hold the power button on the entire time which makes it harder and more time consuming.</li>
            <li> This definitely comes in handy when doing acrylic nails, it gets the job done but there are a few disadvantages about this product.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but to my amazement, this thing actually works WELL!  </li>
            <li> Even came early!</li>
            <li> This is overall a pretty sturdy and durable nail tool.</li>
            <li> Stops easily with little pressure.</li>
            <li> The heads are very easy to change and my nails look like I left a salon everyday</li>
            <li> In fact, you need to be careful when sing it on natural nails, it&#x27;ll really cut right through natural nail.</li>
            <li> but what do you expect for less than $5 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little to strong for natural finger nails.  </li>
            <li> Works well, came early the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it four stars is because the batteries die really fast, and I put new ones and they still die after a while.</li>
            <li> I try to keep my nails nice but being in the Army makes it tough.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t waste your money since it was so cheap</li>
            <li> I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would help me keep my cuticles from snagging and keep my nails naturally buffed.</li>
            <li> convenience is that it uses 2 AA batteries, disposable or rechargeable, The fixed rechargeable with charger does not work when get old,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I checked the mail too see that it had arrived way before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Not too loud</li>
            <li> Not as professional as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> But overall it works pretty well especially because im new with doing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> but I actually think other brands might fit this</li>
            <li> As others have said, the motor really isn&#x27;t strong enough to do an adequate job and bogs down when even slight resistance is applied.</li>
            <li> my nails are shiny like when the sweet little ladies at the nail salon do them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, especially because it is a variable speed battery operated tool.</li>
            <li> Small and light weight.  </li>
            <li> my nail condition is back to normal.</li>
            <li> so you have to shake it and hold it upside down for the batteries to touch the contact, pretty much you are shaking it constantly to work.</li>
            <li> I currently have acrylics on and it didn&#x27;t spin fast enough to do ANYthing.</li>
            <li> and I have found it to be a powerful little Drill/Grinder for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was surprised because the price was so low.</li>
            <li> Maybe enough to remove old nail polish and trim the nails</li>
            <li> Does not really work if you press ot to much</li>
            <li> And then it worried me further because it didn&#x27;t show up until the last estimated day of delivery nearly a month after ordering it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to do my own fake nails</li>
            <li> While it seems well constructed, the pink rubber grommet is nothing more than a small, flat rubber</li>
            <li> the first day this came in I opened it up and used all the attachments, just a little of each, to try them all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item seemed fine other than missing bits.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> had the same kind for almost 8 years, but it finally failed to function, and I ordered the same one as I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> only give it less than 5 stars because you need to be careful or you could scorch your nails or do somemajor damage miscalculating how powerful it can be.  </li>
            <li> Runs a little fast</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering when I saw all the negative reviews but this filer is awesome!  </li>
            <li> I mean - as it stands, it isn&#x27;t really worth a quarter</li>
            <li> So, only for minor and temporary jobs</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasted as long.</li>
            <li> I cannot depend on the dentist to make all the adjustment, particularly minor ones.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t work, a complete waste of my mine,</li>
            <li> Was broken right out of the package</li>
            <li> I would buy a more expensive one!</li>
            <li> This puppy is powerful and if you have nails that are a bit on the thin side you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> not nearly powerful enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> They were all loose in the box.</li>
            <li> comes loose and pops out</li>
            <li> The batteries are too loose in there</li>
            <li> In order to file you have to hold the power button down at the same time 3.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are very thick due to psoriasis &amp; they grow back fast.</li>
            <li> They look the same but this one has less speed.</li>
            <li> The main filer &amp; the one that is identical but a little smaller that files the edges &amp; around the cuticle, you have to be very careful not to press hard while using it</li>
            <li> Getting the cap back on after putting batteries in requires a little manipulation &amp; a twist.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned after ordering this product because it didn&#x27;t have tracking the way that every other single item I have ever purchased on amazon has.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful, though...</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use all the attachments like the pink one.</li>
            <li> In fact if you aren&#x27;t careful you&#x27;ll end up scorching your nail from friction heat.  </li>
            <li> It stopped working after like 5 min I bought 2 big waste of money</li>
            <li> This product is what I expected and it gets the job done by filing my toe nails where I can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> I spent money and only got an item with missing pieces.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this on your natural nails if you have really thin fragile nails like mines, But if your thinking about buying this to do acrylic nails</li>
            <li> It was missing one of the attachments and with new batteries it worked slow.</li>
            <li> but that is such a small thing that I don&#x27;t even care.  </li>
            <li> Other than taking forever to receive it after I ordered it, it&#x27;s an &#x27;O.K.&#x27; kit.  </li>
            <li> Also because it seems like judging by other reviews that the product can be inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same product in the past and have used them for years for manicures and pedicures.</li>
            <li> The pink rough topper can take an edge off in a few moment but doesn&#x27;t hurt your finger if you nick it.  </li>
            <li> there is no way to replace the batteries as the unit hardly can be open.</li>
            <li> at least for me personally it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not as powerful as a plug-in model</li>
            <li> And, because of this, it is not worth the cost of returning it.</li>
            <li> This allows me to grind down the thick cuticles before that gross stuff happens, pus let&#x27;s me trim the thick growth under the nails that grows despite cleaning nails &amp; pushing back cuticles.</li>
            <li> You have to push the button down while using it</li>
            <li> ; when I was using the item, I had to hold down the on/off button</li>
            <li> I was a little worried ordering this because of some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Probly like 1 month and a half.</li>
            <li> Do t spend less than $40 on an electric file.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as previous ones.  </li>
            <li> So its pretty much useless!</li>
            <li> cuz it does burn a little...</li>
            <li> took a little while, but</li>
            <li> files them down with no difficulty!</li>
            <li> sharp one for going under the nail to get any extra acrylic that might have hardened in the wrong spots &amp; shaping/cutting down the cuticle &amp; removing any overgrown cuticle off the nailbed.</li>
            <li> This eliminates so much of the hassle of cutting his nails because he likes this nail drill.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m saying don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow but expected as its from china</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> every few seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste of my time, money, and life.</li>
            <li> I just wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> use it for my pedicures as I have trouble seeing</li>
            <li> Had to press down a bit hard for it to do what i wanted it to</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that its a bit awkward to snap back on when you put in the batteries</li>
            <li> I usually go to the foot doctor for my trimmings every few months.  </li>
            <li> Spins around but next to useless.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and small grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen that other reviewers have had problems with it being to weak.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t small, being longer than my hand, but is somewhat slim so you can even hold it pen-style if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I was truly shocked because I was prepared for something that would reflect the ~$5 bucks I spent on it total including shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li> They get too thick &amp; create hang nails that often catch &amp; tear down, which is painful &amp; a bloody mess that only heals fast with Peterson&#x27;s ointment.</li>
            <li> I do suggest that if you plan to use it often, buy at least two.</li>
            <li> This is battery so its probably why it sucks.</li>
            <li> AT THE LEAST BIT OF PRESSURE.</li>
            <li> even works on my toe nails which are at least 4x as thick as my finger</li>
            <li> However, after rotating it slowly, I got it to come on.</li>
            <li> But seriously.</li>
            <li> Broke on the second use :(</li>
            <li> I expect another weak ineffective battery powered appliance.</li>
            <li> The bits are so weak and poorly made that while holding the power button the file will stop working as it contacts my nail.</li>
            <li> Its battery operated and moves very slow 2.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> 5 Bits Electric Manicure Nail Drill File: It is too poor doesn&#x27;t work well, the instruction say it stay on but doesn&#x27;t,  </li>
            <li> The piece pop off the end while you&#x27;re using this, its really frustrating.</li>
            <li> The attachments are poor quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t poorly constructed or &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; feeling the way even something you would buy at a beauty store might.  </li>
            <li> I use it to shorten my fake nails...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I was sorry</li>
            <li> I found that useless</li>
            <li> This is utterly useless as a file.</li>
            <li> As soon as you touch your nail the feeble motor comes to a halt.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to reach with the clippers because of their shape</li>
            <li> But, since the ON switch requires continuous pressure, it is difficult to keep it on.</li>
            <li> That saying is no longer irrelevant in my vocabulary.</li>
            <li> This file should be marketed for children as I found it useless.</li>
            <li> My feet started looking horrible when I found this little gem.</li>
            <li> The variable speed works by depressing the button to the speed at which you want it to go.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad about this product.</li>
            <li> off.&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned : always read the bad reviews before you buy</li>
            <li> not too bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase</li>
            <li> But, the stupid thing didn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Powerful I was very surprised excellent tool</li>
            <li> Not enough power but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it to shorten my fake nails...files them down with no difficulty!</li>
            <li> Everything was damage , came with open bag.</li>
            <li> works well-- great  value</li>
            <li> Works great! Was surprised because the price was so low.</li>
            <li> i found it very useful</li>
            <li> great product -very useful -good price</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on nails as as substitute to manual buffing with an emory board.  Shipping takes a while but the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Super cheap, didn&#x27;t expect anything great.  Wasn&#x27;t great - met expectations.  Got these for stocking stuffers. When I received the order the pieces were not even packaged. They were all loose in the box. Didn&#x27;t even have packaging in the box.  You can&#x27;t waste your money since it was so cheap, I&#x27;m saying don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and this is my first drill...I love it. Easy to use and all tips work great.</li>
            <li> works good for doing your nails</li>
            <li> Only ok. too time consuming for me!  someone who likes to do their nails might find this item helpful, but I don&#x27;t have that much time to do my own nails.  I tried to use the bits to touch up my nails, but I don&#x27;t think they did a great job, but then again I do not like taking the time to do my nails.</li>
            <li> I was going to return this item because it arrived after Christmas and I wanted it for presents, but actually it is so good I decided to keep it.</li>
            <li> The attachments tend to fall out of handle.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and shipment was punctual</li>
            <li> Small and light weight.  Works as directed.  Good for at home or travel.  Buy a couple to keep at home and in your desk at work.</li>
            <li> So so cheap but they actually work great. I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> Arrived as a defected item.  Worthless item to buy.</li>
            <li> excellent seller.thank you</li>
            <li> good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Runs a little fast but I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It works great considering the price.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and does not work well even with brand new batteries!! I would buy a more expensive one! Shipping was slow but expected as its from china</li>
            <li> Good product, great price.</li>
            <li> 5 Bits Electric Manicure Nail Drill File: It is too poor doesn&#x27;t work well, the instruction say it stay on but doesn&#x27;t,  you have to hold the butter the entire time, and still doesn&#x27;t do nothing to your nails. After play around for quiet while to figure out, how it work change butteries I have to put a powerful battery to make it work.</li>
            <li> Nice little manicure tool. My cuticles are very thick due to psoriasis &amp; they grow back fast. They get too thick &amp; create hang nails that often catch &amp; tear down, which is painful &amp; a bloody mess that only heals fast with Peterson&#x27;s ointment. This allows me to grind down the thick cuticles before that gross stuff happens, pus let&#x27;s me trim the thick growth under the nails that grows despite cleaning nails &amp; pushing back cuticles. You do have to be careful, though...this thing is pretty fast on full blast. You might grind down way more than you want! Caution advised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really stay shut unless you hold it or tape it but what do you expect for less than $5 and free shipping.  They can&#x27;t be making any money with it.  So for the price its a gem</li>
            <li> It was like in the picture</li>
            <li> Way way underpowered. Spins around but next to useless.A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Christmas Order received in February. Shipped from China. No protection from damage during Shipping. Bubble wrap would have been fine. No&lt;br /&gt;Instructions enclosed. Product defective. Will use attachments with similar Drill.</li>
            <li> I liked this device so much I bought it as a gift for my mom. I love buying her inexpensive finds that I know she&#x27;ll enjoy. I enjoyed getting pedicures until I got an infection from place not sterilizing their utensils adequately. My feet started looking horrible when I found this little gem. I read the instructions and haven&#x27;t looked back. My mom&#x27;s birthday is coming up this&#x27;ll go in the gift basket I&#x27;m making her.</li>
            <li> My favorite drill style! I bought this one set to give away as a gift. It works great, if no better that my TRIM brand one, of which I&#x27;ve owned 2 so far plus a Homedics one with the built-in dryer.</li>
            <li> The piece pop off the end while you&#x27;re using this, its really frustrating.</li>
            <li> This was so worthless. I spent money and only got an item with missing pieces. Package was torn. Item seemed fine other than missing bits.&lt;br /&gt;But when added brand new batteries it never worked. Contacted seller and  haven&#x27;t been provided a refund. Unacceptable, avoid at any cost.</li>
            <li> I would like a lot better if it came with instructions on each piece was for.</li>
            <li> The drill did work however it doesn&#x27;t stay on. In order to do my nails I have to hold the power button on the entire time which makes it harder and more time consuming. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> got this for daughter for christmas, forgot to give it to her, gave it to her later as a surprise, she loves it</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this product.  It took a couple of weeks to receive and I was charged $4.99 shipping and handling.  When It finally arrived, it didn&#x27;t work well at all.  You get what you pay for!  The Emjoi is the best--fortunately, the attachments fit my Emjoi!</li>
            <li> Manicure at home is easier with this equipment.  I usually go to the foot doctor for my trimmings every few months.  The equipment makes is easier to trim in between doctor visits.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad about this product. The size is perfect, even for travel. The heads are very easy to change and my nails look like I left a salon everyday haha. Very good product and I am VERY pleased!</li>
            <li> It was delivered in the 10 to 20 day window on March 6, 2015.  It works okay as far as filing and working on polishing the nails.  The only problem I have is that the accessories are pressed into the hole and held there just by friction, and they come out rather easily as you are working on your nails.  I had to place the grinder back three times while using it.</li>
            <li> Good for beginners- u get what u pay for</li>
            <li> Great price and great set!! Do my own acrylics and this is definite help.. Even came early!</li>
            <li> decent for the price I paid, the attachments arent the greatest but it was good for the $</li>
            <li> This is overall a pretty sturdy and durable nail tool. It executes exactley like it should, and flawlessly does its job. Just like I was, im sure you will be happy with the purchase. I do suggest that if you plan to use it often, buy at least two. Mainly because the set of 5 different tools that come with it, im sure wont last forever. A while of course, but not forever. Oh, and I only gave it 4 stars because it took quite a while to arrive.  Probly like 1 month and a half.</li>
            <li> did not work I wasted my money</li>
            <li> Worked great for my needs. Loved the price.</li>
            <li> Got everything Perfect</li>
            <li> I try to keep my nails nice but being in the Army makes it tough. I got this thinking it would help me keep my cuticles from snagging and keep my nails naturally buffed. It was missing one of the attachments and with new batteries it worked slow. Dont waste your money. Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and very hot! It&#x27;s difficult to use. Won&#x27;t buy this ever again. Good luck</li>
            <li> Has plenty of power.  Easy to handle and to change.  The buffing does a great jobs bot of hands and feet works well,</li>
            <li> Was broken right out of the package</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these before and know that after a while, they stop working properly.  However, the price is good and they meet my needs as long as they last.  I could not believe that this one came all the way from China as I could see by the package.  I was sorry I didn&#x27;t order more than one as originally I found one in the drug store and now I cannot easily find them.  The shipping rate was like only ninety nine cents.  I find humor that my mail man reads the mail before he places it in the mail box and I spotted him through my front window really checking this package out.  Ha Ha</li>
            <li> Broke on the second use :(</li>
            <li> The nail drill saved me a lot of money upon purchasing it. I don&#x27;t have to hire someone else to do my nails anymore because I already have this in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> This nail drill saves me a lot on trips to the manicure/pedicure shop. Why pay when I can do work on my nails at home?</li>
            <li> The speed is good, the product works excellent.</li>
            <li> It worked but not enough power to file a nail. I found that useless</li>
            <li> This definitely comes in handy when doing acrylic nails, it gets the job done but there are a few disadvantages about this product.  First, the top part that comes off to replace the battery doesn&#x27;t screw on in a secure locked position so it tends to pop off during usage. Second, there are two  file heads that work a little bit too good sometimes. The main filer &amp; the one that is identical but a little smaller that files the edges &amp; around the cuticle, you have to be very careful not to press hard while using it or you could file right thru ur whole nailbed..... OUCH!! So no need to really apply pressure whIle you&#x27;re filing with either one. The one file head I really think works the best is the silver all metal sharp one for going under the nail to get any extra acrylic that might have hardened in the wrong spots &amp; shaping/cutting down the cuticle &amp; removing any overgrown cuticle off the nailbed. I would like to know what&#x27;s the purpose of each filer head &amp; how to clean them after each use without messing them up.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t really strong. Takes forever !</li>
            <li> Not the best. Wish it had more power.b Stops easily with little pressure.</li>
            <li> This is a compact, portable, battery-operated file with a variety of &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; that allow for different applications. It comes with a carrying sack that facilitates portability.</li>
            <li> The best use for this manicure nail drill set is for my toes as well as my finger nails. Got one for my husband who can&#x27;t bend because of spinal&lt;br /&gt;problems and helps him reach and do his toe nails and for us the pricewas right.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering when I saw all the negative reviews but this filer is awesome!  It works great for my toe nails.  I think it&#x27;s a little to strong for natural finger nails.  You have to push the button down while using it but that is such a small thing that I don&#x27;t even care.  I love the fact that it uses batteries instead of being plugged in cause my old one died that way.  You can&#x27;t beat this for the price!</li>
            <li> This product is identical to one I already have. It words just as good as the previous one I have.</li>
            <li> Packed well and in use *****</li>
            <li> You have two options with this device:&lt;br /&gt;Insert the bits in securely, in which case they will not spin, or will barely spin.&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;Insert them loosely - in which case it would work fine - except the bits slip out every few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way to open the device to try and salvage it... at least it was super cheap - but then again it wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid.. I mean - as it stands, it isn&#x27;t really worth a quarter</li>
            <li> The bit&#x27;s keep falling out.  Will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> It is not expensive but it serves my purpose to trim my deformed, over grown nails which hurts my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I had the same kind for almost 8 years, but it finally failed to function, and I ordered the same one as I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The convenience is that it uses 2 AA batteries, disposable or rechargeable, The fixed rechargeable with charger does not work when get old,&lt;br /&gt;and there is no way to replace the batteries as the unit hardly can be open.</li>
            <li> Received my bill before I received the products.  The attachments do not stay in the mechanical part of the product. Once you can attach and the piece stays, it works fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great size and I thought would help me with my manicures because I have tremors. It wasn&#x27;t any easier for me and I found it  to be very rough on my nails causing them to be brittle and split often and easily, something my nails have never done. Now that  I am not using it my nail condition is back to normal. I was very hopeful, but it was inexpensive...I most likely need a better quality product.</li>
            <li> Love these things, keep several all around the house..</li>
            <li> This is a very nice tool it took a very long time to get to me but it was worth waiting for.  Amizon sells other nail bit sets but I.  would like to find oi if they fit this tool. I would buy them if they do thank you.</li>
            <li> If this lasts, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> the deliver was on time...i give them that. But, the stupid thing didn&#x27;t even turn on. waste of my time, money, and life.</li>
            <li> I like this just fine. I had one for years until it quit. I hope this one lasted as long.</li>
            <li> Great tool for hands and toenails as well.  Great Price...bought 5.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this out today, and it&#x27;s a hit and miss with me.&lt;br /&gt;1&amp;#62; it is battery operated so that alone should have been a give away. (you get what you pay for)&lt;br /&gt;2&amp;#62; when I was using the item, I had to hold down the on/off button or it wouldn&#x27;t stay on....&lt;br /&gt;3&amp;#62; if you don&#x27;t have the nail bits put in correctly they well fall out when in use. LOL&lt;br /&gt;4&amp;#62; it seemed to get warm to the touch pretty quickly when used for a short amount of time. &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;Other then that if you have the time to sit and lightly touch it to your nail (since the light/medium pressure will cause it to stop working) it does work. I do have to say that after using this item, that I will have to stop being cheap and invest in one that plugs in/works better for my needs.</li>
            <li> A plastic face cleaner came instead of the nail groomer. Kit of 5 bits only has ONE? and its NEW KEEP IT And funny your email doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
            <li> this product is easy to use and i love it! it works really good on my nails and i don&#x27;t have to use much force</li>
            <li> Works well, came early the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it four stars is because the batteries die really fast, and I put new ones and they still die after a while. Another reason I gave it four stars is because the cute little draw string bag that came with it ripped. But overall it works pretty well especially because im new with doing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and small grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;I can take it with me everywhere. I put it in my purse and here we go!&lt;br /&gt;I recommended to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be. The attachments are poor quality. I would not recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> It says it takes 2 AA batteries but they won&#x27;t even go in. If I forces them in they would he stuck. I just wasted my time and money. Not to mention it didn&#x27;t come with a satin carrying case  or instructions or anything it said it was going to. It also took a month to ship.  I had to Google what type of batteries to use for it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is junk. I bought 2 packs of new batteries none work. I tried to put the top on and its like its made of candle wax. There&#x27;s pieces off it broke off.&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned : always read the bad reviews before you buy</li>
            <li> Just as advertised !!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this items as it helps a lot...</li>
            <li> Works ok. You get what you pay for and I think this product lives up to its price. Set your expectations based on that and you will be happy with your purchase.</li>
            <li> comes loose and pops out</li>
            <li> I had my 1st one for years before it died on me and found this again on amazon. it works! i don&#x27;t use all the attachments like the pink one. but good and battery life is pretty good too. this one i ordered from amazon and received in what looked like used packaging though. i could tell none of the pieces were used.</li>
            <li> No power. Maybe enough to remove old nail polish and trim the nails but that&#x27;s it,</li>
            <li> It did take a while to receive but when it arrived I was very pleased. Works much better than I ever thought it would for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> This is utterly useless as a file. It has no power what so ever. It just stops spinning when I pushed onto my nails to file them. Its only good for taking up a little space in your junk drawer. But seriously. You get what you pay for. Do t spend less than $40 on an electric file. This is battery so its probably why it sucks.</li>
            <li> I had one just like this before and paid more money. It works good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Works great! Simple, easy to use.  Great to keep nails perfect between mani and pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It came in a ziplock bag. The drill came in a little cute purple pouch. After hours of searching youtube videos and the internet to find out which ways to put in the batteries... -___- &amp; getting the drill tips in the hole...It worked ok..Really didn&#x27;t do much for the nail because it was kinda light on the acrylic. Had to press down a bit hard for it to do what i wanted it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All i have to say is, Cheap. It&#x27;s ok for beginners.</li>
            <li> Worked much better than I thought it would for the price! I really like it!</li>
            <li> Other than taking forever to receive it after I ordered it, it&#x27;s an &#x27;O.K.&#x27; kit.  I&#x27;m glad I did not pay more than I did, but it does a decent job.  Great for quick fixer-uppers.</li>
            <li> Does not really work if you press ot to much it stops.</li>
            <li> the thingy that the screws keep coming out of the device...I need more  of drill for my husband feet..or  saw</li>
            <li> at least for me personally it didn&#x27;t work for me. i have used it twice and it does nothing to my nails. It&#x27;s true what they say you get what you payed for. It&#x27;s inexpensive so it&#x27;s okay to try it.</li>
            <li> Did not come with bits... Very furious!</li>
            <li> Very cheap and not worth it.</li>
            <li> Broke on second use. Really dollar store item.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Helped me take off acrylic easily, shipped quickly, came in cute purple pouch and bits came in own case!</li>
            <li> Excellent tool. Is great not for just nails, but for other filing works as well.</li>
            <li> nice for the price , and was very fast to ship</li>
            <li> This electric file is perfect for the amount that I spent on it. It works well enough to shape and clean up my nails. The buffer doesn&#x27;t make my nails as shiny as the manual buffers that are sold in the stores. I mainly use it to smooth nail bed and nail edges, and push back my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Tips fall out too easily</li>
            <li> I bought it to file the new denture.  I cannot depend on the dentist to make all the adjustment, particularly minor ones.  It served my purpose to some degree, except, as many review did, it cannot hold the bits after some use.  You need to push them back constantly.  So, only for minor and temporary jobs and it is indeed inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This electric manicure grooming kit works great.  I use it to grind my acrylic nails, and prep them for use.  I recommend this great little to anyone who wants to get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> works great took awhile to get it but happy with the product  just as good as a professional I would buy item again happy I purchased</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and this is well worth what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly fine for me, I have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best product. But than again I got what I paid for</li>
            <li> As soon as you touch your nail the feeble motor comes to a halt.  And I&#x27;m talking barely touching your nail.  You get what you pay for.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it came with no tools and I still have not heard back, Ellie</li>
            <li> awful..doesn&#x27;t work at all..junk...waste of money..</li>
            <li> I would have loved it.  But I installed the batteries.  It didn&#x27;t come on.  And the device and the battery got very hot.  I disengaged it and later tried again with the same results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent - not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Does its job, no complaints here</li>
            <li> it works well on my toe nails I was unable to reach with the clippers because of their shape</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as previous ones.  They look the same but this one has less speed.</li>
            <li> For what it costs its a pretty impressive product. It comes with all the pieces in the picture and also with a lilac colored silk bag to hold it.  Its strong and does a good job of filing your nail down smoothly. I used for acrylic tips. The only complaint I have is that its a bit awkward to snap back on when you put in the batteries but once you get it you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> IT IS A GOOD LOOKING TOOL BUT HASN&#x27;T ENOUGH POWER TO GET THE JOB DONE.  IT STALLS AT THE LEAST BIT OF PRESSURE.</li>
            <li> Havent used these for acrylics yet, but on the natural nails free edge this works really well.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars just because I havent used them for an extended amount of time or on acrylics yet, will update when I do!</li>
            <li> The attachments fall out.</li>
            <li> not too bad for the price. the Item came on time. not the best but good for travel. like it</li>
            <li> I was a little worried ordering this because of some of the other reviews. Pretty good 5 bucks spent here. my nails are shiny like when the sweet little ladies at the nail salon do them. I want to go get my nails done to learn their tricks now.</li>
            <li> works  well does a good job  it is portable easy to use any place  helps  our nails  any our minds</li>
            <li> I was concerned after ordering this product because it didn&#x27;t have tracking the way that every other single item I have ever purchased on amazon has.  And then it worried me further because it didn&#x27;t show up until the last estimated day of delivery nearly a month after ordering it.  But in it popped at the last second in it&#x27;s cute purple silk pouch.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the pouch.  It isn&#x27;t anything special but it keeps everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen that other reviewers have had problems with it being to weak.  Not for me!  In fact if you aren&#x27;t careful you&#x27;ll end up scorching your nail from friction heat.  This puppy is powerful and if you have nails that are a bit on the thin side you have to be careful.  I am happy with it though, I like being able to buff my nails to a fine sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even works on my toe nails which are at least 4x as thick as my finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am particular fond of it for zipping the nails off my toddler really quickly.  The pink rough topper can take an edge off in a few moment but doesn&#x27;t hurt your finger if you nick it.  This eliminates so much of the hassle of cutting his nails because he likes this nail drill.  He thinks it is part of a robot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t poorly constructed or &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; feeling the way even something you would buy at a beauty store might.  I was truly shocked because I was prepared for something that would reflect the ~$5 bucks I spent on it total including shipping and handling.  It uses 2 AA batteries which is pretty convenient.  You can put spares in the silk pouch.  It isn&#x27;t small, being longer than my hand, but is somewhat slim so you can even hold it pen-style if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any problems with this drill, really.  I do wish it had more heads as I have seen other drills with more but I actually think other brands might fit this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give it less than 5 stars because you need to be careful or you could scorch your nails or do somemajor damage miscalculating how powerful it can be.  Also because it seems like judging by other reviews that the product can be inconsistent.  That is not my experience with it, however.  I would say that for 5 bucks it is easily worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I wish the motor had a little more power but overall it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Came with no instructions, no batteries, just what is shown. I currently have acrylics on and it didn&#x27;t spin fast enough to do ANYthing. Granted it was cheap, but you&#x27;d be better off getting something pricier that does its job.</li>
            <li> This worked out just fine</li>
            <li> I love these for my manicures and pedicures.  Takes the work out of filing!!  I might order more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised. I expect another weak ineffective battery powered appliance. It&#x27;s certainly not as powerful as a plug-in model but it does a rather nice job and seems to use batteries well. Of course it&#x27;s light and portable which also makes it ideal as a carry along applicance. All in all, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love the price and product. Fun to add to the mani pediatrics kit! I liked the different tools as well. Very useful.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the motor really isn&#x27;t strong enough to do an adequate job and bogs down when even slight resistance is applied.</li>
            <li> great for the price  should have ordered more</li>
            <li> Can i give 0 stars? Horrible product! Don&#x27;t waste your money. The batteries are too loose in there so you have to shake it and hold it upside down for the batteries to touch the contact, pretty much you are shaking it constantly to work. And if it finally does as soon you touch the nail it stops. So its pretty much useless!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I checked the mail too see that it had arrived way before the estimated delivery date. This product is great for acrylic nails. I wouldn&#x27;t use this on your natural nails if you have really thin fragile nails like mines, But if your thinking about buying this to do acrylic nails then I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I think they should have a mode on there cuz it does burn a little...&lt;br /&gt;but it does work.</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars because the nail drills kept coming off while working on my nails.</li>
            <li> took a little while, but great price</li>
            <li> This was a good deal. Not as nice as the original and bogs down with too much pressure?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same product in the past and have used them for years for manicures and pedicures. They are inexpensive and serve the purpose well. The first one I had lasted for years until my puppy chewed it up. The second one I had just finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after 3 years of use. This one is my third one. You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Shipping OK, product a good spare to have.</li>
            <li> This product works beyond my expectations! And the price is amazing too! I highly recommend this product, especially because it is a variable speed battery operated tool. It is quite powerful and is great for assisting in cuticle removal, filing down nails and buffing and smoothing nails! I even use it on the bottom of my feet to remove calluses. The variable speed works by depressing the button to the speed at which you want it to go.</li>
            <li> Works as it says. Does the job amazingly for how cheap it is. I recommend this product for anyone who does their nails themselves.</li>
            <li> Took out of the package and it doesn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this to file my dear parrot&#x27;s talons, and he has welcomed this way of salon treatment.</li>
            <li> work great for the money</li>
            <li> I love it now that I finally have it.</li>
            <li> Wow this is really cool when I first used it I really loved it and its fun to use.</li>
            <li> Cute but does not work..  Not enough power.</li>
            <li> This item I had high hopes for,but ended , but it ended after three uses ; it stopped working.I guess you get what pay for.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but to my amazement, this thing actually works WELL!  Getting the cap back on after putting batteries in requires a little manipulation &amp; a twist.  I suspect that may explain some of the reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Without the twist to seat it, it won&#x27;t turn on.  I&#x27;ve only tried the pink conical file so far (on real, rather brittle toenails, no acrylic or anything like that), but it worked great!</li>
            <li> Works good For the price</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality and performance of this item. At its low price it is well worth the money. I would recommend it to any one wanting a good value.</li>
            <li> This thing is Absolutely amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Its bigger than the picture shows&lt;br /&gt; -The picture makes it look pocket size but its a great size not too big not too small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Not too loud&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t really make &amp;#34;nails on a chalkboard&amp;#34; sounds but I guess that depends on the condition of you nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Every attachment works great.&lt;br /&gt;- the first day this came in I opened it up and used all the attachments, just a little of each, to try them all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Comes with a cute carrying bag&lt;br /&gt;-mine came in a light purple  silk like bag with a draw string.&lt;br /&gt;-fits everything in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) batteries not included&lt;br /&gt;- I wasn&#x27;t bothered by this since they are only AA batteries so I already had some to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Great Gifts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) CAME IN ALMOST 3 WEEKS EARLIER THAN AMAZON EXPECTED!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an AMAZING prooduct and I look forward to buying these as gifts in the future</li>
            <li> junk..when you try to file my nails motor stops</li>
            <li> Great for natural nails and getting polish out of those small areas along with being great for filing down small rough patches around the finger nail area.</li>
            <li> item comes with the notice since your buying from china it will take in my case a month, it&#x27;s a plastic battery run sander that cost maybe 3.00 so you can&#x27;t really complain. I&#x27;m just starting to do my own fake nails so I went cheap.</li>
            <li> not nearly powerful enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> This is a good little rotary file for the price. Its easy to use and the bits stay in. I bought 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Junk!! I paid more than the current price and even the current price is too much... don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Awesome drill for my gel nails</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this to work on her acrylic nails. Wow, what an amazing deal at $3!!!  This actually is a decent and effective little grinder.  In fact, you need to be careful when sing it on natural nails, it&#x27;ll really cut right through natural nail. I even used it to grind off the corrosion and pitting on my car battery cable connectors. It actually did the job!</li>
            <li> This product has no power at all. It doesn&#x27;t have enough power to file my fingernail. Terrible.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, and I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Took forever to receive, like weeks, amd wouldn&#x27;t turn off. Bad purchase</li>
            <li> Took along time to come and not after following up  about it.  So far  it  works  very well.</li>
            <li> U get what u paid for</li>
            <li> like all good love it</li>
            <li> After installing fresh batteries, the device didn&#x27;t work. However, after rotating it slowly, I got it to come on. But, since the ON switch requires continuous pressure, it is difficult to keep it on. And it quit working on the first day. While it seems well constructed, the pink rubber grommet is nothing more than a small, flat rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was it made in China, it was shipped from there, too! And, because of this, it is not worth the cost of returning it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok it work alright</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star, I got it, put battery&#x27;s in it and it doesn&#x27;t work, a complete waste of my mine, if I was you I wouldn&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> Used this to remove a gel pedicure! Was awesome I do not like soaking in acetone this removed polish without damage</li>
            <li> Very fast ship &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> It stopped working after like 5 min I bought 2 big waste of money</li>
            <li> For the price, I was just seeing if it was to good to be true. That saying is no longer irrelevant in my vocabulary. They went beyond and back with this product. I feel as if I owe them money!</li>
            <li> Not as professional as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This product is what I expected and it gets the job done by filing my toe nails where I can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> First I thought it was electrical but then I found out it is actually battery opperated. I must admit I was a bit dissapointed there but my daughter seems excited with it</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for &amp; this was junk</li>
            <li> horrible!!!!!!! dont waste your money!!! doesnt work worth beans!!!</li>
            <li> it broke on first use</li>
            <li> This holds up to my high dollar drill.  This is so handy and easy to use. The power is great and I have ZERO complaints! This was worth every penny and I didn&#x27;t have to part with many. Thank you</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of time, was well package and is exactly as I expected from the picture also is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> A fantastic surprise.  Great to be able and literally have my manicure in my bag whenever I need &amp;#34;emergency care&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase of this Manicure Drill.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my pedicures as I have trouble seeing and I have found it to be a powerful little Drill/Grinder for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It fits well in my hand and changing the heads is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I received it well before the anticipated arrival time.&lt;br /&gt;Giving this Manicure Drill a 5 star recommendation.</li>
            <li> Worst idea ever!!! Product wasn&#x27;t even in a package, looked used, threw away! Had to leave one star if possible I would have left blank!</li>
            <li> This works pretty good. Im pretty sure theirs other better ones out there but for the price i got this for i think it ROCKS! Like it does what its supposed to do. I kind of wish it had a setting of how fast you want it to go but it doesnt. Another thing is that it looks pretty cheap when you look at it but it works wonders so its all good..</li>
            <li> Great product and Seller to work with.</li>
            <li> works great filed fingernails and toes!</li>
            <li> This file should be marketed for children as I found it useless. 1. Its battery operated and moves very slow 2. In order to file you have to hold the power button down at the same time 3. The bits are so weak and poorly made that while holding the power button the file will stop working as it contacts my nail. Overall the biggest and most basic issue is that this tool doesnt do the thing it is intended to do at all, i ended up using my manual file and buffer to complete the job.</li>
