            <li>Very good texture, great scent and does something</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working beautifully</li>
            <li>I saw great results without changing my diet or exercising (at all).</li>
            <li>I was hoping after all the great reviews that this product would work.  </li>
            <li>May be a great product for others, just not for me</li>
            <li>It smells great and works wonders.</li>
            <li>I am so happy i did.</li>
            <li>My cellulite has greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>this one does I am so happy I found this</li>
            <li>So, I was expecting this product to work miracles because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Finulite is a great moisturzer but that is all it does.</li>
            <li>It has improved greatly the texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>Great creams.</li>
            <li>LOL)</li>
            <li>But I am so happy with this product I will.  </li>
            <li>Great buy for all of us girls who suffer from the dreaded cellulite.</li>
            <li>Great product for a great price....</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t holding out any great hopes.</li>
            <li>Now I can go to the pool, proudly.</li>
            <li>But this one, stood out to me and I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li>Finulite is s great product I have been using it for a while now</li>
            <li>However anything that will boost my confidence in wearing shorts or a swimsuit in 30 days is a WIN for me.</li>
            <li>Plus the smell was not that great.  </li>
            <li>This product had great reviews</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see great results.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>The cellulite on my thighs is not gone, however it is greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>Great combo together.</li>
            <li>The effects have made me really happy.  </li>
            <li>I was using Avon before and it was great but its discontinued.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I did this.</li>
            <li>lol thats all they did .</li>
            <li>The product smells great.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product, I have been using for two weeks and combined with exercising it has made my skin look firmer and the texture smoother.</li>
            <li>I also used the finulite brush which i think helps with the great results.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>And bonus it smells great...</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I find that working out on the bicycle at the gym and going to tanning salons help a great deal with minimizing the appearance as well.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s nothing great.</li>
            <li>AND YOU COULD WIN A YEARS SUPPLY&amp;#34; but</li>
            <li>consistencey and quality of the lotion is great.</li>
            <li>Great job with this product,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave reviews often but when a product is great and works so well for me</li>
            <li>happy with the results</li>
            <li>I am def happy with the product and have already purchced another shippment.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>but I am still getting great results.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Turns out it was a great product i noticed improvement in my cellulite not in two weeks</li>
            <li>This product works great to tighten up those problem areas.</li>
            <li>The seller always delivers promptly and is great to work with.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about six weeks now and have experienced a smoother surface around my thighs.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on this product and I have to say, they were great.</li>
            <li>It smelt great</li>
            <li>and it is great.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s a great product, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll find out since I can&#x27;t get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can tell this is a great company.</li>

            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>Also, the price is great for the results that you get.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just a happy side-effect though, I would use it regardless.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they will work great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use finulite for three consecutive months and I can say it works great.</li>

            <li>softer, very nice feeling.</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend noticed the amazing difference!</li>
            <li>Finulite has been amazing for me!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Simply amazing!</li>
            <li>These are amazing!</li>
            <li>Not to mention the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>But this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure after almost two months of use its one of the best.</li>
            <li>I love this product for its results but it also smells great!</li>
            <li>&quot; I have a nice figure - with my clothes off is another story!</li>
            <li>After using 4 weeks I  received many compliments and comments regarding how great I looked-even some wanting to know if I had lost weight!</li>
            <li>I really liked it!&lt;br /&gt;Gotta use the massager too!</li>
            <li>It even smells nice!</li>
            <li>What a nice surprise!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely Awesome!  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the results as the dimples on my bottom and thighs are smoothing out and firming up!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled !</li>
            <li>Along with  some patience, a good diet and excercise the results are great.</li>
            <li>But what i am most impressed with is the customer service from the company that distibutes the product.  </li>
            <li>I would almost still buy it just for the smell :P</li>
            <li>It seems to do wonders for tone and am loving it and will buy again!</li>
            <li>I like that the creams are not greasy and they both have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Lotion is not greasy and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>they both smell citrusy and pleasant.</li>
            <li>a pleasant odor and are agreeable to use.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>If this eliminates or significantly decreases my cellulite I will be a faithful customer for life!!!</li>
            <li>Of course I do exercise and eat very healthy but this product is a great complement ..</li>
            <li>This is not a miracle but is as good as any much pricier cellulite maintnence treatment, including wonderful Murad, is enriched with skin-nourishing vitamins and smells excellent.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and feels silky good.</li>
            <li>Ok about the product, it works very very good.</li>
            <li>My arms look amazing, and my stomach is greatly improving.</li>
            <li>Honestly I decided to try this product because it had great reviews</li>
            <li>It smells really good</li>
            <li>I want my cellulite gone for good.</li>
            <li>Good product I refer to my friend</li>
            <li>This cream smells really good.  </li>
            <li>The End to Cellulite after reading all the good reviews,</li>
            <li>; wise.  </li>
            <li>It is also good for releasing and comforting muscles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels just like lotion and smells good too.</li>
            <li>This product is good.</li>
            <li>Might be why some aren&#x27;t having good results.  </li>
            <li>I used to use another product and thought based on the reviews this might be good to try and this shows me that some reviews might be padded on here.  </li>
            <li>Even with my good diet and exercise, I still couldn&#x27;t stop the scale from going up a pound or two every morning</li>
            <li>It smells good and it works.</li>
            <li>I wanted to look good for the summer.</li>
            <li>which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Good product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a fair chance</li>
            <li>Smells good, but I saw no results after finishing both bottles.</li>
            <li>Smells like medicine and doesn&#x27;t do any good that I can tell.</li>
            <li>I loved the Diva Stuff Cellulite bar I&#x27;ve been using though.</li>
            <li>For starters, it smells really good.</li>
            <li>My thighs have never looked this good.</li>
            <li>It also smells really good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just cream that smells good.</li>
            <li>Quality is good.</li>
            <li>The price is affordable &amp; it smells really good.</li>
            <li>A GOOD REVIEW</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>It doesnt smell good either.</li>
            <li>smells good - that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>it smells really good...</li>
            <li>Guess I will just keep exercising and eating a good diet.</li>
            <li>and they could not stop raving about how good I looked</li>
            <li>I am a person that has been struggling with weight for a good portion of my life and after I had my son I had gained and now lost 80 pounds.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, too.  </li>
            <li>It does smell good though.</li>
            <li>Creams smell good, and my skin feels so silky.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of products and frankly don&#x27;t have the money or time to burn.</li>
            <li>good price....</li>
            <li>I am planing on taking a trip to Mexico and do want to look good in my shorts..</li>
            <li>So give it a try and good luck to all.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good creme/lotion for Cellulite.</li>
            <li>I work out and eat fairly well</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford to have the cellulaze treatment, this is a good, temporary fix.</li>
            <li>Just like with every thing else that&#x27;s good in life, you have to be patient and keep at it.</li>
            <li>But I might say they both smell so good.</li>
            <li>it seemed like a good idea to try.</li>
            <li>I guess if you like the fragrant smell then they are good for you.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>I bought it as gift for my mom and sister and they also loved it.</li>
            <li>,  I think the price  is fair, for what It does , as for my cellulite  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase the Finulite because it had some good reviews.</li>
            <li>good luck to all...........</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how good the results are yet</li>
            <li>its so good</li>
            <li>Is it fair</li>
            <li>Smells good tho</li>
            <li>My legs have always been the one part of my body that I actually loved about myself.</li>
            <li>this smells really good.</li>
            <li>I also actually loved the smell of both of these.  </li>
            <li>Everything on pinterest pointed me toward this product and it has a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>This definitely is a good addition to a cellulite care regimen-it smells good and has a number of good ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soo cool!!!</li>
            <li>The product does smell great (both Am and PM), very easy to apply, not greasy at all.</li>

            <li>I am so happy and now have more confidence to wear shorts again.</li>
            <li>It smells good and feels nice, but I can&#x27;t say it worked for me.</li>
            <li>The lotion was nice and creamy and did smell good though.</li>
            <li>Finulite cream and soap also has a mild but very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>The product smells beautiful and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Mine is more so my genes (which I just love my family for!!</li>

            <li>I was very excited to receive this product!</li>
            <li>The lotions smell great and absorb quickly!</li>
            <li>day and night creams apply easily and have a very nice smell.</li>
            <li>I used this creams lo g time ago with amazing results, but after fighting with the bottle to squeeze the cream out, I gave up and stopped using it.</li>
            <li>and I saw amazing changes.</li>
            <li>The results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really an amazing feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finulite is amazing, it truly does work.</li>
            <li>Smells great and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>I got amazing results with this cellulite treatment.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed the smell &amp; formula was changed, but hoped the result would be just as amazing.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product twice now and will continue to, works amazing.  </li>
            <li>All in all amazing,</li>
            <li>and this product worked amazingly.  </li>
            <li>makes your thighs look great and smooth.</li>
            <li>Its smooth, creamy and smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and the results are amazing...</li>
            <li>I am going to look amazing for my honeymoon</li>
            <li>There are some amazing purification properties in this product.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>and I got an amazing result</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing amazing results.  </li>
            <li>this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the product is also nice and it leaves your skin</li>
            <li>It has honestly toned, softened, and erased my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I think the Mitt is supposed to be some kind of knock off &amp;#34;body brushing&amp;#34; technique, but that too is a joke.</li>
            <li>but the creams smell good &amp; I&#x27;m enjoying using them.</li>
            <li>But it dries nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you all tacky &amp; sticky adsorbs well.</li>
            <li>As the bottle says, no cream in itself is effective as I well know.</li>
            <li>Each bottle lasts about one month; it smells nice; and also works as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it does get results, but you have to continue using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest..</li>
            <li>However, they smell really nice</li>
            <li>I noticed an honest decrease in the appearance in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s as effective as the cream.</li>
            <li>kind of attitude.</li>
            <li>also found so nice from the company that they send me a personalized letter, giving me the opportunity to review their product.</li>
            <li>but honestly, I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything out there for firmer skin and cellulite reduction and NOTHING has worked as fast and as wonderfully as finulite!!!</li>
            <li>fast service and great product!</li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about this product, I&#x27;ve ordered it 3 times now:)  </li>
            <li>The smell has changed a bit, but it is still a nice suttle smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly saw no improvement.</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>/&gt;They hit a homerun on the formulation and I am guessing that is why it is so popular.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, not medicinal at all.</li>
            <li>I wanted to take the time to submit an honest, but informative review of [[ASIN:B004WSXD4</li>
            <li>When I came across this cream I liked that it does not tingle your skin</li>
            <li>The cream consistency and smell is nice.</li>
            <li>and it really is the best cellulite product i have ever come across.</li>
            <li>It smelled really nice.</li>
            <li>and I think does just as good of a job while smelling better.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a hassle putting it on morning and night</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think their is a product that can take away cellulite.</li>
            <li>it smells nice.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but did not change a thing for me.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it a kind of trick?</li>
            <li>I also liked their smell and feel.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Its citrus like - kind of like the smell of a vitamin C supplement but lighter.</li>
            <li>I feel like it works to soften the skin nicely and stimulate the areas - theophylline and theobromine are used in medicine for this type of stuff</li>
            <li>Can be used just as a lotion with nice essence.</li>
            <li>Losing this much weight is great but seeing results is keeping me going!</li>
            <li>Thanks for an amazing product!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She tray this nice product and........</li>
            <li>I had the orange peel kind of cellulite, not the lumpy kind.  </li>
            <li>Smell isn&#x27;t strong and its a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and is easily applied.  </li>
            <li>The product smells great, has a nice texture and is quickly delivered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty incredible..</li>
            <li>The am &amp; pm formula go on easy and smell&#x27;s good to  </li>
            <li>and she is also seeing a difference!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the cream smells great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It works quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and smells good.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that Finulite absorbs quickly and smells great.  </li>
            <li>I maintain my healthy weight, work out, eat right and take very good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I also, love that its animal cruelty free!!</li>
            <li>Excellent so far!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different creams and supplements for cellulite and have not been impressed by any of them, but I have noticed quite a remarkable improvement in my cellulite since using the Finulite.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to more Finulite.....and more results!</li>
            <li>It is very smooth to apply and smells nice.</li>
            <li>As for how it feels on, very light, not sticky or oily, and moisturizes without \\&quot;sticking\\&quot;, spreads on nice.</li>
            <li>As for how it feels on, very light, not sticky or oily, and moisturizes without \\&quot;sticking\\&quot;, spreads on nice.</li>
            <li>this is great stuff and smells wonderful unlike other anti cellulite creams.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even explain how happy I am with the results I&#x27;ve seen from using my first set of bottles!</li>
            <li>Though I haven&#x27;t saw much in the way of losing inches, this product is very good for moisterizing your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I am amazed with all the positive review!!!!</li>
            <li>and wow what an awesome difference!!!</li>
            <li>They were more effective than I thought.</li>
            <li>By far the best product for cellulite.  </li>
            <li>and I also felt better circulation and a warm feeling on my legs.</li>
            <li>I will keep it up because I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li>As far as anything can help improve the appearance of cellulite (and I&#x27;ve used a lot of things), this product is about the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very happy with the changes so far.</li>
            <li>Even cheap products can astonish you when they have good ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with the reduction of my waistline so far.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and I have seen amazing results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to be keeping a good diet while using the product.</li>
            <li>This one I have noticed is much more effective.</li>
            <li>So results aside, I am going to tell you the best things about this product so far.</li>
            <li>This product has shown me the best results so far.  </li>
            <li>This by far is the best product I have found.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product...smells great...feels nice...</li>
            <li>It was important to me that I knew someone who used finulite and loved it</li>
            <li>year I tried The Body Shop&#x27;s Spa Fit collection, which seemed to work (but not as good as Finulite)</li>
            <li>If I am to continue to use a product it has to be more effective than this.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;ll see what happens in the meantime, I&#x27;m hoping but seeing as cellulite hasn&#x27;t been able to be effectively treated by any product</li>
            <li>I have to admit that it has been the most effective anti-cellulite combat I have come across.</li>
            <li>Will buy again, helped tone up the skin after having 2 babies, which then made me more comfortable in my own skin!</li>
            <li>My wife says she would use it just for the smell, as it is very captivating, better than most if not all perfumed skin lotions I have smelled, no alcohol scent at all either.  </li>
            <li>The cream has a nice texture, it smells good, absorbs quickly and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>Great when used with working out and eating right.</li>
            <li>Now is so easy to squeeze!.</li>
            <li>I will definetly continue using this easy product!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE !</li>
            <li>and I looked great in my bathing suit and got so many compliments thanks to Finulite!!</li>
            <li>and I love all natural products and this lotion is the best!!</li>
            <li>This product is non-greasy and it absorbs quickly into the skin, not forgetting that it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it on its own without proper diet and exercise.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite creams and Finulite by far is the very best, I will continue to use it and recommend to everyone I know who is looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li>and I am super excited about my beach trip this summer!!!</li>
            <li>great product...recieved it very fast.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and my husband even noticed a difference the first time I was using it.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results and am ready for my trip!</li>
            <li>The best product ever, I tried different cellulite lotions so far the best!</li>
            <li>I saw a great difference in my thighs and stomach just after my first order.  </li>
            <li>believe the great reviews---Finally, a product that really shows results!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, absorbs really fast, and WORKS!</li>
            <li>Too good to be true</li>
            <li>I am a very fit 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This stuff feels like a very cheap lotion and doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>The texture is very smooth and feels silky (not sticky) when it goes on.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really happy about trying more than one product for day and night and should have followed my instincts in the first place.</li>
            <li>If so, I strongly advise caution if trying this product when you are taking any kind of medication.</li>
            <li>First let me say I really liked the scent and the non-greasy feel, but I didn&#x27;t pay thirty dollars for a good smelling lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fragance is good, it absorbs quickly as well...</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good, and in conjuncture with results it is nice to find a product that I believe in.</li>
            <li>This product works very effectively when used consistently as directed.  </li>
            <li>I have to say too that I think diet, exercise and drinking lots of water is very important in conjunction with this product to develop even better results.</li>
            <li>Are you doing something to them?&amp;#34;  Its not a miracle cream that will get rid of every bit of cellulite, but it certainly does a GREAT job of minimizing it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order some more tomorrow..</li>
            <li>Customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li>There is a notable reduction in cellulite although not 100%.  </li>
            <li>and I love it, it in not a miracle of course</li>
            <li>its really nice to wear something and feel totally comfortable.</li>
            <li>am pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>I love that there is an AM and PM bottle.</li>
            <li>(love it)</li>
            <li>I bought cause many people recommended it but still wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s gonna work.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much better then before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it another try for another month but will start using a massager with it to see it works better.</li>
            <li>I got to the lowest weight I could with still being healthy, and</li>
            <li>Love this product helps with the soap too more results you see.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>AS SOON I FINISH THIS PRODUCT ,,AND THEN I WILL GIVE YOU A MORE ACCURATE REVIEW ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li>I have tried many, MANY cellulite products, procedures and treatments.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not awful either</li>
            <li>I noticed better results once I started doing this.</li>
            <li>I have tried many creams before this.</li>
            <li>Note: I have not increased amount of excercise since beginning use of this product, but I&#x27;m sure it will help boost your results.</li>
            <li>Then I purchased it for myself twice and used it whenever I had an important event, including my own wedding.</li>
            <li>I still use them as I think it&#x27;s more of a long-term effect rather than immediate.</li>
            <li>I thought with all the good reviews it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>I saw better results within two days of using this product than a month of finulite.</li>
            <li>The smell was okay, but you can get better smelling and more moisturizing lotion anywhere for 1/5 the price.</li>
            <li>I like Evelyn Cosmetics product better.</li>
            <li>It smells okay</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If I did it twice a day, as instructed, I&#x27;m sure my results would be even better.</li>
            <li>I Love this product have ordered 3x.</li>
            <li>I am gonna go ahead with 2 and 2 more</li>
            <li>im getting more</li>
            <li>i love this product</li>
            <li>My legs look alot more toned and It gives me a lot more confidence.</li>
            <li>best part is my husband can see a big difference on how my legs look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost count of how many miracle creams i&#x27;ve bought to try and tackle my cellulite problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy and will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>and it costs a lot more..</li>
            <li>It smells ok but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here to buy one more round--i&#x27;m going abroad for a month in May</li>
            <li>You had better do massage after applying the product.</li>
            <li>Expecially 2 pronounced dimples on the top of 1 leg.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works fabulously!</li>
            <li>more veggies and more water), bikram yoga</li>
            <li>Great product it really works</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing even better results and will update when I finish the bottles.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to buy even after all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I for sure recommend using with the mitt.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 3 more months supply.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing mesotherapy, corporal massages, eating healthy walking 3 times a week and using this.</li>
            <li>I guess for better results</li>
            <li>Not a miracle worker but does ok.</li>
            <li>, they are smoother and have given me more confident for wearing shorts again.</li>
            <li>Much better than others</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be trying to sell these instead of risking more dimples.  </li>
            <li>The doctor told me it would contour my legs and butt more, and help reduce the appearance of my cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results whit way cheaper products.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>What can be better than this???</li>
            <li>I would not even wear shorts unless they went to my knees, but I will gladly show off my shorty-shorts any time now.</li>
            <li>While my cellulite isn&#x27;t gone, I can say that after 6 weeks the depth of my dimples is improved and my skin is smoother and more taut in those areas where I apply the cream.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is going to magically eliminate your cellulite, but I think it can improve the appearance of problem areas.</li>
            <li>this product was ok.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I use the product most of the time as directed</li>
            <li>It still seems to look better than before I started.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m reordering some more today.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what i thought was going to happen when i purchased this</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I eat healthy, workout 4-5 times a week and had a bit of cellulite that I could notice.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this product works wonders.</li>
            <li>You must keep a healthy diet too and drink plenty of water.</li>
            <li>love the scent of it, almost could eat it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not too sure this is working.</li>
            <li>I have been using Finulite on and off for over a year and it works wonders, and when combined with diet and exercise its even better.</li>
            <li>heating up,  makes me sweat allot more,  </li>
            <li>I love the mitt also,  </li>
            <li>she enjoys using it more than competing products.</li>
            <li>I keep coming back to Finulite as in my opinion it works the best.  </li>
            <li>My thighs feel firmer, my dimples are no longer as prominent, and I can just tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;I think that with continuous use, the dimples I have left will be 99.99% gone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Finulite, for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>im definiltly going to order more.</li>
            <li>She says she doesn&#x27;t even try to look for something different since this product works wonderful.</li>
            <li>Did not do much more than moisturize.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to try Finulite, make sure to decide about the refund before 60 days from the purchase date.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more and will update on progress.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>With regular exercise and good diet this product works great.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin is much better.</li>
            <li>I say give it a try, the price is a lot more cheaper than then</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t choose anything else :)</li>
            <li>The skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It seems to work quicker on the dimples more than the ripples.</li>
            <li>I think I had more cellulite than this product could handle.</li>
            <li>and it is one of the better cellulite creams I have used.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when it was confirmed for me that this product works!  </li>
            <li>but I do recommend to use this when you do workouts,if you truly want this product to be supra magical</li>
            <li>It works OK I guess, but it has a perfume type odor that I and others could smell when wearing it.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product and I will be purchasing more in the future, as I am almost out.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>My cellulite continues to get better.  </li>
            <li>my legs look alot better.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fantastic!</li>
            <li>If you have time to detox area before use (scrub/brush) even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to give it away because I&#x27;ve found another product that works so much better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how most everyone who reviewed this stuff gave it 5 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>When rubbed in vigorously with the massager it definitely works best and results are more noticeable.</li>
            <li>however the best part about this product is that it actually works!!!  </li>
            <li>And yes in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise program you will get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This customer stated that he got better results after one month with this combination than the lotion alone.</li>
            <li>The Vichy lotions for cellulite are much better...</li>
            <li>I read the results get better the longer you use it</li>
            <li>Make sure to stick with it</li>
            <li>and I was more confident to wear shorts during summer.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and hope I see even greater improvement.</li>
            <li>I love that it blends into the skin and does not leave a greasy feel</li>
            <li>and I had to order more.</li>
            <li>I will say that I love the way both AM and PM lotions smell (esp AM),</li>
            <li>You are better off doing something else.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if there were more product one would see results.</li>
            <li>I loved from the minute I put it on my legs were soft and smooth and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>This product combined with working out and a healthy diet is helping me achieve the look I want.  </li>
            <li>I ordered again and I will continue using for more results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My legs are a lot smoother &amp; more toned looking.  </li>
            <li>I have used many of the Nivea products.</li>
            <li>I love the two separate lotions to work on one problem.</li>
            <li>legs looks better and I am buying more because I can see the difference</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Smells really good and fresh on.</li>
            <li>Smells really good and fresh on.</li>
            <li>I love the way it seems to tighten up the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love to wear it in summer with shorts or skirts</li>
            <li>After reading really good reviews on this product I knew it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help with my cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I used one bottle of the night and day creams but didn&#x27;t feel like wanting more.</li>
            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>do think this product would work better if in jar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a forever customer, unless someone develops a magic pill.</li>
            <li>It smoothed out most everything, minimizing my cellulite appearance but it did not get rid of it, just made it look 90% better.  </li>
            <li>Thankyou for such a great cellulite treatment!!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;d tried several products, but this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>The title should say it all but more words are required.</li>
            <li>I like it ok.  </li>
            <li>After all the great reviews I was execting too much</li>
            <li>I wish I could purchase more than 8oz.</li>
            <li>im sure</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more because of the results.</li>
            <li>I used these for 3-4 weeks and they did work ok.</li>
            <li>Great smell, fast absortion.</li>
            <li>and I put it on many areas of my body.</li>
            <li>Awesome product and deserves a definite 5 Star Rating!</li>
            <li>so glad i tried this.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice and is smooth on the skin</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t have aminophylline, it has the sister compound theophylline which is supposed to be more potent.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I have bought cream at walmart that work better than this, even coconut oil does.</li>
            <li>And still getting better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to spending my summer showing off my cellulite free legs!</li>
            <li>but l have to say Works :).  </li>
            <li>It firms your skin up for sure.</li>
            <li>I would definitely by more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and texture of both creams.  </li>
            <li>I love it-</li>
            <li>it ensures I&#x27;m able to see my muscles.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare with others, but I love this one</li>
            <li>:) Would recommend to friends for sure.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much better then before.  </li>
            <li>I love that there is an AM and PM bottle.</li>
            <li>I read most reviews about it before I order.</li>
            <li>I think works better than any cream.</li>
            <li>Smells great, absorbs fast - just like scented body lotion.</li>
            <li>Even my daughter noticed that my legs look better.</li>
            <li>I would saw that it is better then nothing, and I will probably use it again in a month or two to keep my legs in shape until I find some permanent solution for the cellulite.</li>
            <li>The difference was a smoother and more hydrated look.</li>
            <li>The packaging is lovely and it smells divine.</li>
            <li>The skin feels smoother and a bit more toned.</li>

            <li>but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Not all of the cellulite is gone, but I feel better about it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I researched the ingredients to make sure there weren&#x27;t any cancer causing stuff in finulite.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product has work for me</li>
            <li>This is one of the better cellulite creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased and have used this cream for many months now.  </li>
            <li>watching somewhat better what I eat.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Planning to use it with the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt  to see more effect.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>And when I continued to use it I was feeling better that I was doing something to getting rid of my cellulite(which</li>
            <li>I love the ingredient list and how it smells, took awhile to get used to</li>
            <li>but I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>overall, this is a wonderful cellulite cream,</li>
            <li>I think its for emphasizing putting on the cremes twice a day, but to me it also seems that they can sell two bottles for more money than just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells amazing and makes my legs so smooth.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the soap and brush to help aid the cream and was pleased with results.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and looks better, more glowing.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it every day morning and night.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I use them after showering &amp; it takes just a couple minutes, at most.</li>
            <li>I noticed more definition and tone in my legs.</li>
            <li>My husband also liked the light citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The title says it all, this product works alright, but I had significantly better results with the Bliss products.</li>
            <li>I would like a more thorough explanation of how its used in this product specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another note is that aminophylline is theophylline + 2 ethylenediamine and this formulation makes theophylline more water soluble - I suppose for medicinal purposes to increase solubility and therefore bio-availability (google it).</li>
            <li>but I think diet and exercises work better for me.</li>
            <li>Glad though that it works for some people.</li>
            <li>As cellulite is probably mostly genetic</li>
            <li>really LOVE the smell the lotions so even if it doesn&#x27;t work with the cellulite</li>
            <li>And Ive Tried MANY Products&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I have not paid attention to see if my cellulite has diminished, but I do love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many of my friends and I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this to see if my legs get even better.  </li>
            <li>think all this work better together that believe that you will get that you want sit on the couch doing nothing.</li>
            <li>I think that I would defiantly see better results</li>
            <li>My skin became more tighter and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Despite working out (lifting weights &amp; cardio), I&#x27;ve struggled with cellulite for many years.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bit more considering their web site</li>
            <li>was so convincing.</li>
            <li>creams smells lovely and I would buy this over and over again!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>
            <li>but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Maybe in 6 more months my cellulite will disappear?  </li>
            <li>So I just order two more sets.</li>
            <li>so maybe this month I will have more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may order one more time just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help me with the cellulite on my gluts but have had no luck.</li>
            <li>and it is condensed more into one area.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I have seen many 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I notice best results when I use in combination with regular body brushing and bellabaci cups.</li>
            <li>:) Now I also paired it with exercise and trying to eat healthy</li>
            <li>They both fit in one of my hands!</li>
            <li>this is one of many tightening products that i have invested in.  </li>
            <li>the price is more than nivea</li>
            <li>but it works a lot better than nivea...</li>
            <li>Ok, whatever.</li>
            <li>I continued to use it for the remainder of the month and reordered more</li>
            <li>I think that combining it with my weekly workout schedule is definitely the best way to go.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this along with the derma roller because many reviewers suggested it.  </li>
            <li>I continued with the cream though and after about 2 more weeks I started seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li>Will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t just slap it on and expect it to work magic.</li>
            <li>so if I see any more of a difference after using it another month I&#x27;ll write another review.</li>
            <li>and I am highly satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve had cellulite since I was 12.</li>
            <li>It seems too easy and too good to be true, but I&#x27;m feeling adventurous.</li>
            <li>I workout and eat right but was really hoping for the best that was not delivered.</li>
            <li>I was really good during my pregnancy with eating right, and I even exercised up until I was 8 month along.</li>
            <li>This is my first Amazon review, but this product earned it!!!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about this product and was very excited about getting it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited about using this product again.</li>
            <li>But the change in formula isn&#x27;t as effective as the original.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product 3 times already and so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Drink water and sweat after applying the AM cream and lay flat w/ the PM cream for best results.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>And someone having excellent results with an anti cellulite product when they had very very little cellulite to begin with isn&#x27;t surprising.</li>
            <li>Because I am very sceptical when it comes to creams and potions, these numbers are pretty impressive for me.  </li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase would  highly recommend</li>
            <li>Now, in my 40s the problem is becoming even more visible.</li>
            <li>This cream is affordable and works awesome as long as you keep using it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest giving it a try - good luck ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, soft, and</li>
            <li>hope it continues to work as good as the first time i applied it,  </li>
            <li>I use pretty good pressure when I massage in for 5 or 6 min each leg.</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive at first because I thought that an inexpensive treatment could not be as good as they claimed.</li>
            <li>I have gotten into a pretty good routine of using the mitt in the shower, then following-up with the AM/ PM cream when I get out of the</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and is so easy to apply!</li>
            <li>smells wonderful, and doesnt irritate my sensitive skin, does EXACTLY what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>Lotion smells nice and lasts a little over a month, so you may have to reorder for best results.</li>
            <li>and I am excited to see the results!</li>
            <li>Still there- but significant improvement!</li>
            <li>The cellulite has diminshed significantly!</li>
            <li>Within a week I noticed a huge difference, now a month later I am happily looking at my legs in the mirrror!</li>
            <li>Second of all it smells great and the ingredient content is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo glad I chose these products, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love how it does not feel greasey and abosorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>I feel healthy and much more fit</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves skin looking and feeling very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It is by far the most effective cellulite cream out there! :)</li>
            <li>First, it smells wonderful and makes your skin incredibly soft and lovely.</li>
            <li>I liked this product from the very first day.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I got better results with this product, eating right,</li>
            <li>That said, I am stocking up on Finulite after I write this because the first shipment of 3 sets I purchased expire 11/2016, which is a great, long shelf-life, and I want to make sure I cover my bases for this summer and beyond....plus the price point is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other creams and gels, but I&#x27;m impressed with the results I&#x27;m achieving using Finulite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other products and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>It is also nice that the day time absorbs quickly because if I wear pants to work then they go on easily.</li>
            <li>It is very good smell, just now I received it ,I applied it on the area that have a cellulite, and I wait the result through the next days</li>
            <li>Anytime I want to look a bit better in shorts or a swim suit, 30 days makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Sure beats the huge price and no-guarantees of the alternatives.</li>
            <li>It smells great but as far as decreasing or eliminating cellulite; I don&#x27;t see the changes.  </li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of any kind of &amp;#34;cellulite cream&amp;#34; on the Internet, and I have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working great so far.</li>
            <li>I have combined a well balanced diet and workout with the product and so far I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product for a great price.  </li>
            <li>The company genuinely cares if their customers are satisfied?</li>
            <li>The Finulite creams and the Finulite massage mitt have made my arms look smooth - making them look more defined.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on some of the feedback and so far its been working great.</li>
            <li>I believed the reviews but am learning that many no name companies give free products, etc... for ppsitive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am happy so far</li>
            <li>Knowing realistically that cellulite can&#x27;t really ever fully disappear, this product is about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what a month does.it smells  nice, and its worth the money to give it a try.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use that much, just a dime sized amount for problem areas, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>price is reasonable as well, 30 days treatment supply and good</li>
            <li>Really dammm good cream it has worked so well for me</li>
            <li>The new ballet barre video effective!</li>
            <li>Overall, good product, and would recommend using in conjunction with exercise and good, clean diet.</li>
            <li>The product smelled great, was very easy to apply and made my legs super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>for many people  I&#x27;m excited to use</li>
            <li>Works best in conjunction with other methods, I think it speeds up the results you see from drinking your water and excersizing.</li>
            <li>Finulite gave me the best results out of any other cream I have tried.</li>
            <li>That sounds like a lot more fun!</li>
            <li>Smells good and pleasant afterwards unlike some other creams that you want to rinse off after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Because it is a two step product, it is easy to forget some applications.</li>
            <li>Have tried it, has an orange smell, cream easily absorbs into skin.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to add into my nightly/morning routines.</li>
            <li>It easily fits into my am and pm routine.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be an easy fix.  </li>
            <li>Every body is different and I&#x27;m happy it has worked for so many</li>
            <li>Yet it is easy to spread on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In only two weeks, my legs look so much better, smoother, and my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>After only a week of using finulite and the mitt along with healthy diet and going to the gym ; I can already see great results.</li>
            <li>I just wanted an easy fix.</li>
            <li>When I contacted the company, Kandance responded very quickly and sent the correct product out promptly.  </li>
            <li>but it becomes an easy routine.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy to add to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many products for reducing the appearance of cellulite and am happy to of found one that finally works!</li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitant at purchasing the product because it seemed too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product to everybody who has a problem with cellulite.</li>
            <li>Awesome product this stuff really works would definitely buy more from this place an fast shipment so you looking for a good celliute cream</li>
            <li>I tried so many cellulite creams but this one is really special.</li>
            <li>First off this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells great, not like most cellulite creams currently on the market and its goes on smoothly without an oily affect...</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty freakin amazing.  </li>
            <li>This treatment is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>You have to be patient and consistent with your routine, cellulite didnt build over night and it will not disappear over night,but you will see amazing results (for me</li>
            <li>My cellulite even after 5 months of clean eating and weight training had only improved from a stage 4 to a mild 3 at best.</li>
            <li>but it certainly makes me legs a lot smoother!!!  </li>
            <li>I use exactly as directed and have noticed a significant improvement on my legs!!</li>
            <li>The texture is very rich and easy to apply, and the smell of the product is light and sweet smelling which I feel is just as important.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am always more confident in shorts and a bathing suit when I&#x27;ve been consistent with applying my Finulite.</li>
            <li>I was using this product with the massage mitt and was working just fine</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a wonderful product ; )</li>
            <li>the dimples are less noticeable and the smell is wonderful .</li>
            <li>First of all it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and combined with massage twice a day it really seems to work.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, works with massage but not as quickly as Avon did.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Besides helping with the cellulite it leaves my skin very soft and has a good smell.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product is so super easy to apply with a very nice smell.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant odor, and it smooths and softens your skin  as well (better than regular lotion).  </li>
            <li>Product has a pleasant smell and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light, fresh smell</li>
            <li>I tried this product because it had exactly what I was looking for - Theophylline, a very strong Xanthine.</li>
            <li>I am now onto my third bottle and I am very satisfied with the result!</li>
            <li>The End to Cellulite AM/PM (8 oz)]] IS the best cellulite cream I&#x27;ve ever used hands down!  </li>

            <li>have used Finullite on my tights and arms, and I have noticed improvements after 2 weeks and a huge difference after 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s huge to me.</li>

            <li>this worked to really smooth out my thighs.</li>
            <li>Product does make your skin tighten and smooth.  </li>
            <li>so the surface of the skin could then smooth out</li>
            <li>But worth every penny:)</li>
            <li>It helps keep my leg area feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I can now fit into jeans</li>

            <li>&#x3D;) worth buying.</li>
            <li>Along with my order, I received a note from Finulite, which states if you like and rate the product with 5 stars, you will be added to a draw for free products.    </li>
            <li>All it does is make your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>It progressed to the point where I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing skirts or shorts.</li>
            <li>My husband bought this for me, and I almost killed him for doing so - LOL!!</li>
            <li>Now I feel comfortable in shorts again.  </li>
            <li>but it had such great ratings.</li>

            <li>I &amp;#34;HIGHLY&amp;#34; recommend for anyone looking to smooth out and get rid of cellulite.  </li>

            <li>I took my vitamins, &amp; applied my Vitamin A/ Retinol Cream throughout the day available at any drug store.</li>
            <li>This is the third set of Finulite I use, and I am completely happy with the results.</li>

            <li>I am eager to see how great my skin can look after further usage!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now &amp; have noticed a great improvement!</li>
            <li>In one month I felt completely comfortable In my bikini</li>
            <li>I had read some fabulous reviews about this cream</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I am really fit, but still have cellulite.  </li>
            <li>the second order she was so happy about the results........</li>
            <li>Not only works great for cellulite, but it mosturizes</li>
            <li>My cellulite wasn&#x27;t severe, just a light dimpling to my thighs and butt.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m supposed to be getting another set free by writing this review</li>
            <li>I heard most cellulite products stink, buut this one has a lite scent that actually smells really good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>and wow this stuff is good.</li>
            <li>I am feeling good about it so far.</li>
            <li>My legs aren&#x27;t perfect, but there is so much improvement that I am actually wearing shorts that I have never had the confidence to wear before</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really soft also and has a good smell.</li>
            <li>Good old fashion exercise is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I have used both as directed- morning &amp; night, and there had been no result- not even a good moisturizing action.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a great company with a terrific product, it&#x27;s nice to find something that really works.  </li>
            <li>hasn&#x27;t been a miracle but still using it so far so good</li>
            <li>So far Finulite has worked and smells good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Another plus is the bottles are attractive and have the easy to use flip top, and the bright pink and purple colors will surely make it easier to remember which is night and day, and as someone who has used different \\&quot;night and day\\&quot; formula remedies, I can say that usually those work the best.</li>
            <li>It also has a very pleasant smell and it sinks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>The texture is just right, it spreads, sticks and absorbs well and the smell is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered more Finulite on Amazon right away.  </li>
            <li>The product also smells very good and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin like other creams.</li>
            <li>I hope all is well since most of the reviews are so positive!</li>
            <li>Finulite does smell great, but I ended up liking the other product better...</li>
            <li>A good value for a cream that&#x27;s effective when compared to other creams on the market</li>
            <li>Really works!!!</li>
            <li>I saw a difference after the first week!!</li>
            <li>It really does!!!</li>
            <li>This product really works!!!</li>
            <li>and i haven&#x27;t noticed much difference!!!</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of time to use the mitt, but very worth it.</li>
            <li>It smells great, makes your skin soft and think all 3; together are the triple threat :) highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Even my husband has noticed the difference in my legs and said it is barely noticable now:):):)</li>
            <li>I wish that the dispenser top could be modified so that it didn&#x27;t clog up after sev uses, but I&#x27;m happy enough with the product, compared to others, that I&#x27;m willing to overlook that.</li>
            <li>The quality, cheap price and results make it all worth while!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for quick and great service.  </li>
            <li>Dries very quickly and product was packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use (just like applying lotion) and you see fast results.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I HIGHLY recommend it..</li>
            <li>Very very useful，We brought 5 for friends and we&#x27;ll buy 3 more.</li>
            <li>Essentially, I have more even skin, the tightening effect is visibly noticeable and it definitively makes me more comfortable and confident while wearing a bathing suit.  </li>
            <li>I am a research scientist, getting my PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology, and I can say that I very much like the ingredients in this product and am enjoying the results.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have the special massage brush working in lightly with knuckles worked for me.</li>
            <li>and I was super stoked when my very blunt and honest girlfriend of mine said, &amp;</li>
            <li>My skin is super smooth and 80% free of cellulite.</li>
            <li>nothing special, paid a lot of money for something that smells pretty good but does absolutely nothing for the Cellulite...</li>
            <li>The results are noticeable in a week or a few weeks, depending how diligent you are In addition, it has very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I used to be pretty self conscience wearing shorts but after using this product for a couple of weeks it gave me a HUGE confidence boost!</li>
            <li>It is worth a shot to try!  </li>
            <li>I can notice a significant difference in the apperance on my orange peel skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products before, but this  is a first time when the expectations did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Its worth a shot!</li>
            <li>The cellulite in that area has diminished significantly within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>am by no means overweight, but - as I imagine most of you reading this review - I have received the genetic curse of cellulite (gee, thanks mom!).</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin felt smoother after just one week, and with consistent use I could see more results after about one month.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit I was excited to try this product because of the reviews I read however</li>
            <li>I have been using this product diligently for a little over a month on my butt and thighs and can honestly say that my celulite IS going away!!  </li>
            <li>I have tried ALLOT  of cellulite creams on the market, first of all I love how there is an a.m. and p.m. cream.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for someone who doesn&#x27;t have significant amount of cellulite.</li>
            <li>when you stop the appearance returns but it is well worth the effort!</li>
            <li>After the first week or two, I wasn&#x27;t sure that I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original formula and found it reduced my cellulite appearance.</li>
            <li>The creams work ok, but they got my skin pretty greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far</li>
            <li>Although it is priced higher than the other products, I still feel that it is the best value of the creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li>But when my first month&#x27;s supply was up, I decided to give it one more month&#x27;s chance.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product</li>
            <li>I have seen some changes its worth a try !</li>
            <li>I started to see a difference after about 4 weeks and a significant difference after 2 months.</li>
            <li>I work out 4 or 5 days a week and eat pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant decrease in my cellulite in my three months of using it.  </li>
            <li>I have lost a significant amount of weight</li>
            <li>If you consistently use them, keep exercise and eat healthy, you will see the change.</li>
            <li>So Excited To Keep On Using</li>
            <li>At this price it is worth a shot!</li>
            <li>and I am confident the results will only continue to get better!</li>
            <li>I am usually a sceptic when it comes to all of these \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; creams but decided to give this one a try because all of the great reviews!</li>
            <li>It smells fine, kind of medicinal, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been working as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>It will definitely serve you well to make sure you are keeping your sugars and carbs to a minimum and eating the right foods, drinking plenty of water and getting a good multivitamin in every day.</li>
            <li>I have tried different creams before, and I think this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I found them most effective in the upper arms area and my stomach.</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands and this one is by far the best one in the market.</li>
            <li>I work out and eat clean but cellulite, as you know is stubborn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot, especially for it&#x27;s great price, so give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It did make my skin super smooth, but cellulite is a bitch to get rid of even with exercise</li>
            <li>My butt is tighter and we both love it :) It hasn&#x27;t completely evaporated all of my cellulite</li>
            <li>#34;Wow, your legs are looking super smooth.</li>
            <li>, I forgot to mention that this cream absorbs wonderfully fast and completely and smells great.</li>
            <li>I eat clean, drink lots of water and exercise about four times a week</li>
            <li>The cream has a light smell and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>i havent see any difference, the only good thing is that leave you skin smooth...</li>
            <li>The creams smell great not like most others I have wasted money on.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of Finullite, it feels very hydrating and smooth as it absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast and I was excited to see it in the mailbox so soon!</li>
            <li>I thought for sure with all of the positive reviews that this would work.</li>
            <li>I was eager to try this product as I have read so many positive reviews on it.  </li>
            <li>By there being so many positive reviews for Finulite, it gave me the confidence to order the product, and I would say 50% of this product is using it</li>
            <li>just wanted to add 1 more positive review for Finulite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this product on Amazon and read many positive reviews</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my old stretch marks were looking better too!</li>
            <li>With finulite you feel your skin really nourished with the first application, the smell is great and it is a very convenient format</li>
            <li>The lotion smells nice and makes your skin feel soft but that&#x27;s about all!  </li>
            <li>You will see results right away which greatly improve over time and prevent future cellulite.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>very surprised and very pleased, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The purple PM has a fantastic, clean, and light smell and while the Pink AM isn&#x27;t my type of fragrance it is still pleasant.</li>
            <li>my skin was right after the massage!</li>
            <li>I use the lotion as recommended, as soon as I get up and right before bedtime!</li>
            <li>As previously mentioned by another reviewer it is easy to use and smells great.</li>
            <li>Love this cream, and I really need it to keep cellulite away.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the cost, I&#x27;d use this as a full body lotion.</li>
            <li>(I walk on the treadmill 3-5 times a week on full incline), So I can&#x27;t 100% say that it is the cream, but I do see some improvement in the 2 weeks I have used it.</li>
            <li>what i wouldn&#x27;t do is buy the creams &amp; not the mitt as like i said it&#x27;s the mitt that&#x27;s really doing the work :).</li>
            <li>not 1.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles (must to say that that is true for ALL creams).</li>
            <li>I am hoping that combining it with body brushing, a good diet and lots of water will finally result in a reduction of my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I was looking around for stretch mark creams and many sounded promising.</li>
            <li>and I just love how much it smooths my cellulite.  </li>
            <li>: I WAS GIVEN A FULL REFUNDED...</li>
            <li>It smells good when you open the cap.</li>
            <li>I would recommend SWEAT SWEET instead of this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is light and fresh so using it at night doesn&#x27;t keep you awake because of the fragrance being so strong.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rate if it worked since I wasn&#x27;t able to apply it.</li>
            <li>I have been a true believer of this product</li>
            <li>At this rate, I might be able to wear shorts again really soon&lt;</li>
            <li>I was really good about using the AM daily but for the PM I may have skipped a couple Saturday nights.  </li>
            <li>I started using this to get ready for summer hoping to be able to wear shorts with confidence.</li>
            <li>I rinsed my legs in cool water to tone the skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years and this one really seems to diminish the appearance of cellulite bumps.  </li>
            <li>people only give this a good review because when it arrives it comes with a piece of paper saying &amp;#34;GIVE US</li>
            <li>so I think be sure and get that too to really see the effects.</li>
            <li>i got it for my girlfriend for the second time and she is saying some results you have to use it every day with good diet and exercise</li>
            <li>Most of them without much change.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my skin so soft, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even good as basic lotion.</li>
            <li>My legs are so much smoother and appear much more toned.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain :)</li>
            <li>Thanks you too :-)</li>
            <li>I noticed an awesome improvement to my trouble areas in no time when I used this as recommended, and not only did it get rid of the embarrassing bumps, it also had ingredients in it that my skin (KP aka &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) LOVED.</li>
            <li>I work out regularly and am in good shape.  </li>
            <li>However, I would advise to use in conjunction with exercise and a sensible diet, which created a solid combination for me for good results.  </li>
            <li>Although it is a bit more time consuming to get ready in the morning and for bed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several creams that claimed to get rid of cellulite for good, but never had any luck with them.</li>
            <li>After reading multiple good reviews, I decided to try for myself.</li>
            <li>Love Finulite, it&#x27;s getting me ready for spring❤</li>
            <li>I decided to try this not bad for the price and after reading reviews I did</li>
            <li>But not a bad product</li>
            <li>Win win.&lt;br /&gt;Update #1 - 24 hours later: Skin feels a little bit tighter yet softer, very nice feeling.</li>
            <li>It made the cellulite disappear and left skin looking smooth within a week of my first use, it also has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>You have to be consistent and make sure you use both the am and pm product daily, but if you do, you will love the results!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews others have posted on this product and was so happy and excited to finally see a cream that really seemed to work for people.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap compared to your alternatives, it has all the right ingredients and it works just as described.</li>
            <li>the morning, I used the derma-roller with strong force ( the first time my eyes were practically watering)</li>
            <li>Anywho, to those who are fit already use it and it has the same affects: tightens,makes skin soft,and has a lovely smell to it!</li>
            <li>I think finding something to completely obliterate the dimply scourge would be as rare as unicorn tears and Pegasus feathers, that being said this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with some other cellulite treatments and I&#x27;ve seen great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple other cellulite products but decided to give this one a try after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>this works so amazingly well, and its way better than your higher priced products of the same type!</li>
            <li>I made sure to rub my stomach with alcohol pads to rid of any excess dirt before applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 30 days, I noticed an honest 20% decrease in the appearance of the stretch marks, the cellulite \\&quot;deep indentations,\\</li>
            <li>receiving my dermaroller in the mail from amazon and a fresh order of Finulite cream, I was excited to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also a great value compared to other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>Like any other product where we want to see great results, weight loss has to play a role in reducing visible cellulite in problemed areas.</li>
            <li>The finulite works pretty good, you don&#x27;t see major changes, but you do get results.</li>
            <li>quick delivery too</li>
            <li>I received the package quick, and started using it immediately.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>I got this thinking it would help with the bit of cellulite I got while pregnant.</li>
            <li>The ratings and reviews of Finulite, many with before-and-after photos, were enough to convince me to hold off on spending thousands of dollars and try one more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price too for what you are getting - and the tubes are a lot more sanitary and much easier to handle than the typical jars you find out there.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have been using the cream in conjunction with their massage mitt and it has made such wonderful improvements in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>The item shipped quickly as promised.</li>
            <li>Even with that, I&#x27;ve seen quick results.</li>
            <li>Seems to be helping tremendously.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m following a healthy diet on top</li>
            <li>So I REALLY wish I would have taken before pictures of myself, because when I looked today after a few weeks of using this I was REALLY happy!  </li>
            <li>i have never been pregnant</li>
            <li>It is part of my anti-cellulite fight now (exercise and 10 min quick massage).  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering, but mildly floral.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mit, and can&#x27;t wait to use it as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll make these products work even better.</li>
            <li>It can only get better from here  :-)</li>
            <li>My first impression is that it actually smells nice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many drugstore and high end products but nothing works as well as this.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>It goes on cleanly and does not leave a greasy residue, so no prob with putting pants on right after application.</li>
            <li>This time around, I&#x27;m very pleased with my results and definitely see the difference.  </li>
            <li>I believe in this product in conjuncture with a VERY healthy diet, and regular exersize.  </li>
            <li>, I am really liking what I see and in case, I just ordered me some more because the price is very reasonable....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it makes my skin super soft the moment it is put on and keeps it that way all day!</li>
            <li>Once and awhile, something new or interesting will come on the market</li>
            <li>it actually smells pretty good...</li>
            <li>I also purchased the mitt, and I strongly recommend that for really getting the product worked into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am in pretty good physical shape</li>
            <li>It takes me 1 minute to put on my problem areas and its fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I still had some cream from the first set left, so I could make a good</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off buying bliss fatgirlslim or clarins high definition body lift, overall it was just a nice moisturizer</li>
            <li>I recommend using it consistently for 4-6 weeks before giving up!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and let me just say that I have already noticed a pretty significant change in the tops of my thighs and butt..</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this product!</li>
            <li>I am on my 3rd order and have no doubt I will order a 4th and more!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it!!!</li>
            <li>but in just the first week!</li>
            <li>I was so amazed to start seeing results within the first two weeks!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>On my second bottles and love seeing the results!</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first week of using it!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this stuff, because the reviews I read before I purchased it sounded promising.</li>
            <li>Received this product with my hopes up very high hoping i finally found a good product for my cellulite.</li>
            <li>My thighs are so smooth and the cellulite have reduces sooo much.</li>
            <li>I started using finulite a month ago, and wow huge results!  </li>
            <li>this is a amazing product i have only been using it for about 3 months</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff that works fast.</li>
            <li>I am aiming to be 100% free of cellulite and this product is really helping with that goal.  </li>
            <li>I am finding amazing results and I am now onto my second supply of Finulite.</li>
            <li>This product really works and I have seen a huge difference in the appearance of my thighs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>The morning one is better than the night one as far as smell.</li>
            <li>I am on my second month supply of finulite, and I am happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It looks like a natural tan AND it hides cellulite a lot better.</li>
            <li>it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>its definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>I started getting a bit of cellulite in my early 30s, but I was able to keep it at bay with body brushing and exercise.</li>
            <li>But I started to notice and feel my skin change, and am SO pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth a</li>
            <li>I use about one set per month and find the prodcut to be well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell and is fast absorbing,</li>
            <li>So it can be costly but the benefits have been worth it.</li>
            <li>I would love to feel not so self conscious about how I look in my shorts this summer.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the bottles were bigger!</li>
            <li>The results you see will be worth it.</li>
            <li>Ive used this product for two weeks now and I absolutely love it, It helps diminish the look of cellulite and makes my skin soooo silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>Ladies be honest with yourself and read medical literature - no cream will reduce cellulite.</li>
            <li>This does take some dedication, but it is well worth it when you can see the difference yourself.</li>
            <li>Still worth a try.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will completely disappear soon</li>
            <li>I have no idea if the product is worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Who wants to keep spending more &amp; more money, only to find out, it still won&#x27;t do anything?</li>
            <li>I call that a success.</li>
            <li>It may not make it completely disappear, but I saw a big difference and I am really happy about it.</li>
            <li>This lotion also works just as good or  better than more expensive creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the deep dimples &amp; bulges will smooth away over time with continued use &amp; massage, healthy diet &amp; excercise.</li>
            <li>My cellulite was not incredibly horrible to begin with, but after a month, it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
            <li>it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>what if you could get the same kind of results by melting chocolate on your body?</li>
            <li>what if you could get the same kind of results by melting chocolate on your body?</li>
            <li>It was worth a try</li>
            <li>I Have Had Cellulite For Many YEars Since I Was Young</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is worth $30.</li>
            <li>(think Nivea in the blue pump), the scent is very light but pleasant and it moisturizes my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am more comfortable going out in shorts and not feel self-conscious among all the other cellulite free girls on my college campus.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel soft and smell nice, unlike other creams of this kind...</li>
            <li>I love the smell and texture of this lotion much better than other products I have used.  </li>
            <li>The price is also a huge plus, compared to other products of its kind.  </li>
            <li>It helps to take a before picture because then you can tell how significant the progress really is.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually really good smelling lotion as opposed to the other chemically smelly cellulite treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>, right?)</li>
            <li>Just work out and eat right.</li>
            <li>Cellulite is stubborn fat buildup under the skin that takes time to get rid of but with the right products it can be done.</li>
            <li>I do all the right things:  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll see improvement right on the 1st week..</li>
            <li>Works right away and leaves my skin feeling softer and firmer.</li>
            <li>I work out and eat right</li>
            <li>I am also exercising diligently with Core Fusion and Jillian Michael&#x27;s videos and eating right.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>And this product didn&#x27;t work right away.  </li>
            <li>but you also have to eat right, work out etc.</li>
            <li>Although I am slim and I work out 4-5 times a week and eat right</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect change right away</li>
            <li>Now the bottle said it takes up to five weeks to start noticing the changes so of course the results didn&#x27;t show right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently found Sweet Sweat body cream to work better.</li>
            <li>so I ordered my own bottle recently and the shipment was super fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way both lotions smell- clean and citrus based.</li>
            <li>I wish to see more improvement on my thights where I have some major issues too.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a 2 star rating because the lotions do smell amazing and make the area being massaged very smooth, but obviously if you lotion the same spot twice a day.. anything will make it smoother.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to improve the cellulite issues or tone &amp; smooth skin.</li>
            <li>i would really recommend it, specially if you use it with the smoothing massage mitt.</li>
            <li>It also made my skin super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing is that both lotions smell nice.</li>
            <li>Used for more than a month, sooner or later insist, may be effective, but it is really very obvious, run out to buy these four bottles will not be used again</li>
            <li>Finulite did, however, manage to make my butt smell like the sort of cheap, fruity fragrance normally found in lip gloss marketed to 12-year olds.</li>
            <li>My skin generally feels and looks better....</li>
            <li>But this product is worth the money as it really works!</li>
            <li>#1, it arrived FAST, packed well, and the bottles were 100% full, no skimping or under filling bottles here.</li>
            <li>I have tried several products over the years, but Finulite is by far the best because it actually works!</li>
            <li>I saw smoother and worth noting pump-free skin within the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>No bad reactions, price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Works quite nicely and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have loose skin and cellulite on my stomach and backs of my thighs and this cream with the finulite massager tightened the skin and made it smooth!!</li>
            <li>I read all the different reviews on here &amp; thought \\&quot;well this product has high positive post &amp; the price seems good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also eating very clean and exercising 6 days a week, so that plays a major role in this change.</li>
            <li>Come on people be smart!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work right away, but after consistent use for 4 weeks, I did notice a difference.</li>
            <li>It smells good, which is unusual for this type of cream, it absorbs into the skin well without any greasy residue, it leaves my skin feeling really soft, and most importantly, it is definitely improving the look of my cellulite, more than any other product like this that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I will certainly continue to use it as I already saw results in a month!  </li>
            <li>I certainly recomend it to any girl struggling with cellulite!</li>
            <li>I certainly will tommorow after applying the am lotion, before hopping on my elliptical!</li>
            <li>She mentioned that she really likes the scent, describing it as similar to grapefruit; it absorbs quickly (and goes on lightly); and it leaves her skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the subtle changes already that I immediately purchased 2 more orders of the set so that I would have it available without running out.</li>
            <li>Already my skin looks better - smoother, and more firm.</li>
            <li>The creams actually have a nice smell and are very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Before I got pregnant I weighed about 120lbs, and was very toned.  </li>
            <li>I would say I saw about a 40% improvement in the look of my skin after a few months of treatment, which is great because I really needed some help.  </li>
            <li>That sounds like a lot more fun!r after I use it longer -- and if there is interest I can find out how much theophylline is in natural chocolate.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Between this, eating more vegetables and drinking fresh vegetable juice, and vacuum massaging my butt and legs, it is working.  </li>
            <li>I exercise regularly and eat right for the most part</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t give up and realize that this kind of thing is not a very fast process.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivered.</li>
            <li>They take the time to instruct the customer on how to use it in the packaging, and it is priced in a very reasonable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It definitely dimishes the look of cellulite and leaves the area very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>but I have noticed,what other customers say, as it being more smooth.</li>
            <li>The seller, however, ships super fast and usually runs some kind of promotion (free gift, etc)</li>
            <li>Hey, this cream really works, though, and it does it fast!!</li>
            <li>Will work overtime with consistent use</li>
            <li>you just gotta be consistent.</li>
            <li>I have wasted a lot of money trying different products and this product has really made me happy!</li>
            <li>It worked almost from the first week.</li>
            <li>I have just finished the second bottle and the results are better than any cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I have tried it all, and finulite really works!</li>
            <li>Will most definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>At first I saw no difference.</li>
            <li>My skin really looks it&#x27;s smoothest ever after these shower massages!  </li>
            <li>Thanks finūlite!  </li>
            <li>do not like the smell, which does resemble a sugary tween cosmetic, but that&#x27;s pretty inconsequential.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more sets my next go around.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still in love obviously if I&#x27;m still purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent in using this product.</li>
            <li>For real!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time when my friend offered it when we were bridesmaids.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be without it ;)</li>
            <li>It works but i believe in combination with the massage mitt same company works even better and faster.</li>
            <li>By itself it was ok, results were slightly moderate.</li>
            <li>I see results in a matter of weeks and most of the time I only put the cream on in the morning.</li>
            <li>Go on a diet first, then use the product.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>I definitely will purchase more as I want to keep the cellulite off.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I have tried it all, and this product really works well!</li>
            <li>I seen results in the first week.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to put some work and money into it, trust me it does work.</li>
            <li>After attempt of two other cellulite creams brand with no luck, so thought to give this another chance along with my purchase of massage mitt and it&#x27;s showing better result!</li>
            <li>This is my second order and so far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I noticed after a month of the cream the cellulite is not the first thing my eyes are drawn to in the mirror.</li>
            <li>but it most definitely diminishes it.</li>
            <li>I am a repeat buyer of this product, because it REALLY DOES WORK!</li>
            <li>The cream smells great and has a thick consistency</li>
            <li>Within the first month of using</li>
            <li>will say that I have been dieting and working out at the same time as using Finulite, so I am sure that has helped also..</li>
            <li>Before starting to research procedures, I decided to peruse Amazon for reviews of cellulite reduction products to be sure I hadn&#x27;t missed anything.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this item again if I ever need it, and I would like to add that it works better than the Nivea cellulite treatment, which in itself does work well.</li>
            <li>This product has done absolutely nothing for me!</li>
            <li>My legs are 10x softer now thanks to this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost out, going to order some more next week.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>And to look hot in a bikini.</li>
            <li>: if I get rid of it, I&#x27;ll give Finulite five stars ;-)</li>
            <li>I noticed smoother, tighter thighs after the first application.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly, and I am almost done with the bottles.  </li>
            <li>but you need to be consistent.</li>
            <li>I have had increasing amounts of cellulite on the back of my legs for more than a decade.</li>
            <li>I been putting the cream on fairly consistently twice a day for three or four weeks now, and I am amazed by the results.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will be able to get rid of it completely by next month.</li>
            <li>I will finish using the bottles and waiting for the next magic potion.</li>
            <li>You have to use it consistently however..</li>
            <li>She tried many different products including expensive ones and this product works the best.</li>
            <li>This product really really works!</li>
            <li>I have been told by so many different people that cellulite cream doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The Zaggora Hot Pants claim to boost your calorie burn and they do make one sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat convinced that the Hot Pants worn after applying the Finulite AM Cream create smoother legs...</li>
            <li>it just helped enhance everything and get rid of my cellulite that much quicker!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>Based on the results from the first use, i was expecting continued improvement.</li>
            <li>And I am an avid Amazon shopper.</li>
            <li>Used both am and pm cremes consistently for 30 days along with an increase in exercise.</li>
            <li>The price is inexpensive, so I have ordered more, and will continue to monitor progress for the next</li>
            <li>As I said I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks but really am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this product, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement during the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Finullite almost 4 months ago, and I have placed 2 more orders since then: it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product works, just follow the directions and be consistent</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s willing to do the work and not looking for immediate/next day results.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to try something else in addition to it.</li>
            <li>I have made my second reorder as I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of it</li>
            <li>just wish the bottles were bigger and more affordable but everything has a price tag, you either like it or you don&#x27;t....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference in cellulite after consistent use.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over six weeks on two different occasions and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and at first I had doubts .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I was a skeptic at first.  </li>
            <li>Through consuming extremely healthy foods, diet, and exercise (4x cardio a week + 3x weights with the assistance of a Nutritionist &amp; Personal Trainer</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more when I get low.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for a month now and for the first time I see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I will order again because I want to see if I will have better results next month.</li>
            <li>Finulite really boosted confidence and made a difference!</li>
            <li>And believe me; I have used pretty much everything!</li>
            <li>I have purchased many products in hopes it will diminish my cellulite but haven&#x27;t seen results like I have in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products in the market and any one has gave me the results Finulite does.</li>
            <li>have worked out regularly for over 15 years, follow a healthy diet &amp; drink plenty of water.  </li>
            <li>I wanted so much to like this product!</li>
            <li>Make sure you drink plenty of water, this is a big thing in getting rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li>Might give it higher view later if it keeps getting better.  </li>
            <li>I eat a healthy diet &amp; exercise regularly.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li>This is the first product to get rid of cellulite I&#x27;ve tried so</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did, Three weeks later not only does my skin look 100x better, but the stretch marks I got during my pregnancy are disappearing as well.</li>
            <li>I think after a couple more months I&#x27;ll have my pre pregnancy body back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd set, and will continue to use the cream to see if it makes more of a difference the longer you use it.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it 4 months ago.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done using the first 2 bottles, been using it day and night but still haven&#x27;t seen any changes.</li>
            <li>This cream REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>This is my first set of finulite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cellulite since giving birth to my first child over10 years ago and have tried everything under the sun for it.</li>
            <li>have used this for 4 months now day and night exactly as directed</li>
            <li>Thank you sooooo much Finulite!  </li>
            <li>First let me start by saying im on bottle</li>
            <li>However, it is not anything permanent, but you have to be consistent with it to continue to see results.</li>
            <li>trust me on this, as I have tried SO many different things that are out there for cellulite.  </li>
            <li>This lotion does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>When I used this product for the first time I was optimistic.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite, it&#x27;s mostly around my butt and thighs, the dimples were never that deep</li>
            <li>I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked out, drank lots of water, ate healthy, and massaged the cellulite areas daily while using this product.</li>
            <li>My husband bought me these moisturizing lotions for the first time, about a year ago, and now I buy them all the time.</li>
            <li>Two moths later most all of my cottage cheese thighs R gone.</li>
            <li>I started using this over the summer and think it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I notice it works better when you are exercising and using the product at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back on the road to smooth thighs!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I am interested to see if their is a difference.</li>
            <li>nivea concentrated firmimg serum is 100x better and only costs $9.  </li>
            <li>It REALLY works!</li>
            <li>I rubbed this on my stomach area, love handles, and back fat</li>
            <li>Firstly, this isn&#x27;t going to cause miracles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll finally feel better about bikinis.</li>
            <li>Totally recommended! :-)</li>
            <li>,after reading all the reviews I decided to try finulite, the first thing I do when I received it was take a before picture after they apply the cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty consistent with the am/pm routine, and I did buy and use an inexpensive cellulite massager which I use after the pm application, but I&#x27;ve missed a time or two.  </li>
            <li>sure you use twice daily and massage well into skin to improve circulation!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this cream for 2 more months to evaluate its results, I took pictures of before for comparing in the future.</li>
            <li>With consistent application and patience, there will be results.  </li>
            <li>I first stumbled upon finulite while on Amazon searching for creams for the cellulite.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re mostly in my buttocks and upper thigh.</li>
            <li>I havent figured out how to use this along with self tanner though to be fully summer ready!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products to battle my cellulite and it seemed like all the ones I tried just were funky lotions and creams.</li>
            <li>The product is more than simple to use and in combination with the Finulite Massage Mitt it feels like is working even faster.</li>
            <li>I should use it properly to have a better result ....</li>
            <li>For the first 4 weeks I used the cream in tandem with a massager because I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s helpful.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews and different articles I decided to give Finulite a try.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for showing up in my lifetime!</li>
            <li>Since the first moment I started to use finulite ,just couple days after I noticed the improvement results surround my knees.</li>
            <li>I had seen the improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>I am an avid gym goer and my upper leg had muscle tone with dimpling around it, this product has allowed more of my muscle tone to come out.  </li>
            <li>In fact I even took before and after pictures, which I&#x27;m not going to share because thats embarrassing, but they showed it really did work!  </li>
            <li>I could see results within  the first week.</li>
            <li>Thanks Finulite!</li>
            <li>My cellulite reduced a lot the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I recommend it  because it really works!</li>
            <li>However, I think with regular use and exercise, I probably would have had better results.  </li>
            <li>Very happed with the results!</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>If not try something cheaper first.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li>and actually I think better.</li>
            <li>A review after I&#x27;ve used them for very long wouldn&#x27;t help that much any how, to be honest I don&#x27;t have very much cellulite at all</li>
            <li>They smell very good and dry faster than expected.</li>
            <li>I liked how they changed the presentation from the hard bottles to this very useful, easy to use soft cream bottle.</li>
            <li>And the most important thing for me is that this product made my stretch marks less visible.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months and really love it, easy to use in the morning and evening after shower</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on this product!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried one other cellulite cream (Bliss Fat Girl Slim) and this is much more effective.</li>
            <li>After using it for several months I would have to say that in conjunction with other modalities it can be more effective.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews on this product I finally decided to get it.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but I love it!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several weeks now and am very please with the results I see,and this new formula is better than ever!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She stated for honest results in her professional opinion to take a professional high quality Vitamin Supplement, she suggested [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>, I have tried many other products with no success and this seems to really smoothen the back of my legs the best.</li>
            <li>This product, on the other hand, has a nice smell and absorbs into skin without leaving any type of greasy residue.</li>
            <li>It goes on like any other lotion and has a nice scent, but i do not feel it did anything for my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I was proud to wear shorts this year thanks to this product and a lot of hard work.</li>
            <li>It was enough to annoy me since I work hard to look my best.  </li>
            <li>I am going to see what happens after using a second set, excited to see the results!</li>
            <li>I have been using it since the summer, and with continuous and regular use, exercise and soft massages, my cellulite has improved amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I am not expecting overnight results (I can wish though) but honestly working at desk jobs for over 30 years has really taken its toll from the back of my thighs to the mid or near top of my butt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used this with the seaweed body soap that is suppose to help with cellulite or at least increase the circulation (the soap btw is awesome) in my legs and with moderate excercise.</li>
            <li>I really like it and will continue to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if is really working or not until this moment; 2 months later, I think I need to drink more water, and use it every night and day, sometime Im working till 11 pm</li>
            <li>Now, I won&#x27;t lie and say it completely gets rid of your cellulite, but this is honestly the only product I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve even noticed a difference in the firmness of my skin, and the reduction of cellulite on my butt and thighs.</li>
            <li>and my skin get more firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I trusted the reviews because it really does work, you have to be strict when using it, following the day and night regime</li>
            <li>and i felt in the way of depression when i wanted to wear a mini short or skirt that which i love those so much</li>
            <li>The product has a fresh citrusy scent that I love ( normally , I am very sensitive to smells from moisturizers and only buy &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if all of the positive reviews came from people who truly followed the directions and added diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>So if you want a product that will give you a positive result, here you have it.</li>
            <li>I purchased it from italy , hoping and trusting in positive feedback , but it didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I wish I had a positive review to leave</li>
            <li>and I can say that I have noticed positive changes.</li>
            <li>I found this on another one of my frantic google searches and read mainly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This is the only product and I have used many, that has actually made a Huge difference.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not all in a creme, but at this point I am willing to try whatever can reasonably help.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I use it in the steam sauna shower at the gym ( the heat really opens things up) and also in hot showers at home.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>You have to apply it consistently and really massage it in to the skin.</li>
            <li>omg this thing really works, i got my first set in feb 2012 and</li>
            <li>I have pretty much suffered with \\&quot;cottage cheese</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much on my whole body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month, and I have to admit that during the first couple weeks it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I have used various other cellulite creams in the past mostly for problem area under buttocks and have found this to be one of the best.  </li>
            <li>Finulite gives my legs the extra boost it needs to be able to wear shorts and still feel comfortable in public.</li>
            <li>Now if I could only stop eating junk food, I am sure I would be totally cellulite free...</li>
            <li>I have pretty much have exercised all my life.</li>
            <li>Very impress with the fast results!</li>
            <li>saw results really fast, within the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found them to be really affective when used consistently.</li>
            <li>and I believe in a long run it will help me get rid of most of my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have to say over all I like the product and will continue to use it as long as I am financially able to.</li>
            <li>Will repeat as long as she&#x27;s satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly new, and would be very expensive.(I have done my homework on this!!)</li>
            <li>Its super easy Am and Pm (Pink &amp; Purple).</li>
            <li>The shipping was super quick from Simply Skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>#3 and MOST IMPORTANT by far, there was a small, typed note card within the wrapping of the bottles that states if you do not see an improvement in your cellulite after 4-6 weeks of use contact this email to get a full refund.</li>
            <li>thing that is really interesting is that the fine stretch lines on my stomach from intense exercise and weightlifting movements (like dumbell pullover for chest) have been noticably improved with Finulite --- none of the other products I used for years ever improved this condition, this was an unexpected suprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it absorbs quickly and let my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>The am/pm creams makes it easy to remember and incorporate as apart of your daily routine.</li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s been easy to incorporate the am &amp; pm into my daily routine as it comes with one bottle for day &amp; night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will admit that after going through the bottles the first time I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, however, I do know that you are supposed to give something a three month trial period before making any decisions</li>
            <li>I was really surprised on how quickly I began to notice results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and only takes a couple minutes in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li>I have seen strong improvements in the overall smoothness of my skin in the areas where I&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
            <li>The old bottle was a pain as it was very hard to squeeze the cream out, but the new tube is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I did not have a large amount of cellulite</li>
            <li>I will certainly reorder when it comes up.</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to work over night, because as they say in their pamphlet when you purchase it, cellulite certainly didn&#x27;t form overnight, and you have to be patient.</li>
            <li>I saw Finulite and after reading all the positive reviews I was really hoping it would work.  </li>
            <li>Complete waste of time and money, better to spend more but get a decent product.</li>
            <li>The main thing with these creams is you have to be diligent and consistent, which I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I had an order shipped to me and it had leaked slightly, and they sent me a replacement right away:)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to get rid of cellulite-it really works!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in cellulite reduction.  </li>
            <li>Good customer service is hard to come by these days  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, absorbs quickly, and lasts longer than other cellulite creams sold at the same price.</li>
            <li>So I realize I should probably USE a product before I review it, but there are many other things I can say about this product that are positive without even using them one time.</li>
            <li>really believe that with daily usage, this will make a huge improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference in the look of the back of my thighs and rear end since I have been using finulite.</li>
            <li>I notice a huge difference within a week of using it and the results last even when I stop using it.</li>
            <li>and I am convinced that it&#x27;s the combination of the two that made such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>There has been a huge decrease in the look of my cellulite on my upper legs and thighs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Science stuff:&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I find the most intriguing about this product is that they advertise theophylline *from green tea (also in cocoa beans aka chocolate).</li>
            <li>It,s been few months ago that I finish with the cellulite treatment and my legs looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it feels like a body butter but not quite as heavy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my cellulite after using both bottles.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels much smoother then before.</li>
            <li>but I was very skeptic.</li>
            <li>This has really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t really get the result I needed/wanted .</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can tell by the smell its the real deal</li>
            <li>Going on 4 weeks, there still really wasn&#x27;t much happening.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the massaging mitt and have been using it for about 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement...</li>
            <li>I really like finlite products and have never had a problem with an order.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be ready for a Hawaiian vacation</li>
            <li>The ingredients used in Finulite really makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to those with light to moderate cellulite, like me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak for those with a lot of cellulite.</li>
            <li>depending on the time of month and how much I work out.</li>
            <li>I really think that these worked.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much firmer.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the maker/supplier.</li>
            <li>none that really work and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I bought these creams along with the finulite mitt &amp; together they are working really well.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try this out not expecting much</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing, and I used it for months.</li>
            <li>I would have seen an improvement, but I had already been using a basic (and cheap) moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much firmer and looks smoother.</li>
            <li>This one really really really works.</li>
            <li>It really works!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>but it has helped more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I was very ashamed of my stretch marks</li>
            <li>cause I used to have very toned legs ..</li>
            <li>It does require constant use to maintain the smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>I asked my Dermatologist and there is really nothing you can do to get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li>but this one has really improved the look and feel of my legs</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from the seller too</li>
            <li>And now have cellulite.i don&#x27;t like to spend too much on beauty products...</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much..</li>
            <li>So, the con is that the results are temporary, but they really did improve the look of my legs.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a ton of cellulite and thought this was a reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li>I tried all of the creams and lotions from the drugstores, and none of them really ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>FINULITE HAS CHANGED MY WHOLE ATTITUDE ABOUT SELF-IMAGE</li>
            <li>but I expected to work better than it did.</li>
            <li>but Finulite really helped me get rid of my cellulite much faster and has allowed me to keep it</li>
            <li>The real changes started happening when I used the  FInulite mostuizers along with the Finulite massage mitt.</li>
            <li>I think it really is helping to either break up fat deposits or just drain excess fluids.</li>
            <li>Using them together has absolutely made a difference.</li>
            <li>but after i dug into what this cream is supposed to do i really looked out for the results.</li>
            <li>and it REALLY worked.</li>
            <li>This cream really works.</li>
            <li>I really feel like it is reducing the dimensions of my legs.</li>
            <li>, I am a REAL PERSON</li>
            <li>I do not see much of a change at all.  </li>
            <li>and I really feel it working and  </li>
            <li>My cellulite wasn&#x27;t really severe, but I do feel like it makes me smoother.</li>
            <li>The mitt really does help</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>These products really work.</li>
            <li>The cellulite is much reduced already.</li>
            <li>The finulite i really see results.</li>
            <li>... it does not do absolutely anything with cellulite..</li>
            <li>But, I figured it is much cheaper than continuing endermology....</li>
            <li>very durable.我们前前后后买了5瓶了，还要再买3瓶，当然不全是自己用，还有给亲戚朋友带的。效果非常好。老婆瘦了很多。确实非常有效。想哪里瘦就涂在哪里，1周左右就能看到效果。不过美体产品也是因人而异。我大舅子用了1周腰围缩了3.5cm，嫂子用完全就没有作用。后面还要给三位同事买3瓶，看看他们效果如何我再来评价。虽然瓶子很小，但是非常耐用，我跟老婆两个人从5月假期结束开始使用，直到现在8月初了，还没用完，是两个人同时使用哦～～～～当然了我们使用面积可能不大，我用在腰腹，老婆用在腰腹大腿小腿。</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Thanks again, now I can tell my friends that this product works ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very eager to see the results.</li>
            <li>I have moderate cellulite that is primarily on my thighs.</li>
            <li>I really like Finilite</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of it too.</li>
            <li>I have been using Finulite for about a year, and I have really noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have found that it really works for me.</li>
            <li>My thighs are much thinner</li>
            <li>It really does work at polishing and tonning the skin to eliminate signs of cellulite.</li>
            <li>Believe me if you work-out and use this your ass will look soooo juicy,plump,round that you&#x27;d give yourself a 3-syllable \\&quot;DAAAAMMMNNN!\\&quot; hahaha.</li>
            <li>I have 1 month using this product and I am really seeing and improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li>and you can really tell.</li>
            <li>Save your money -- this product does absolutely nothing to reduce cellulite or even the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>but with much improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m seeing some promising results.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much tighter and firmer.</li>
            <li>highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li>no matter how much I worked out.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell if it works yet.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give up and continued using it and much to my surprise</li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>and I can really see results.</li>
            <li>And, just use what you need to cover the area, and rub it in really well.  </li>
            <li>my son said my legs were very rippley...</li>
            <li>I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  </li>
            <li>The product didnt do much for me, so didnt see a difference in my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product as it directs for three days now but haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results...</li>
            <li>I really think I am noticing a difference</li>
            <li>It was shipped to me quite fast too</li>
            <li>With this product I am confident that in the next few months to come I will have eliminated most of the stubborn areas of Cellulite that I have been trying to get rid of for years.</li>
            <li>I thought this would really help with some of the cellulite on my thighs, but I not.</li>
            <li>As much as I work out, I still have celluite appearances on my thighs, but this product has helped in diminishing it within months.  </li>
            <li>Really recommend it.</li>
            <li>My tummy doesnt have that wrinkled look when I suck it in, as much anymore .</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence about ordering this product I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than Revitashape</li>
            <li>It is really working for me in the 6 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>I have used Finulite 3 months ago and the day and night cream had a more pronounced pink and purple color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked wonders and I was very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>REALLY NOTICED ANYTHING</li>
            <li>I felt that it was reasonably priced</li>
            <li>The cream is very lightweight with no odor.  </li>
            <li>It really makes me wonder who is really writing all those 5 star</li>
            <li>Really ?</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;5, 112 pounds and work out/eat very well.  </li>
            <li>and my cellulite is much improved.</li>
            <li>, they are much smoother and cellulite has diminished drastically.</li>
            <li>I was very dubious about thisproduct</li>
            <li>but this product really seemed to make a difference.</li>
            <li>I really reccomend trying this product.</li>
            <li>but I am a massage therapist and have spent lots of time looking at ways to make my skin look better</li>
            <li>I used it for 3 weeks straight</li>
            <li>and I really think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>so I will be all ready for summer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t work out; I&#x27;ve always had a fast metabolism (which I have noticed</li>
            <li>Skin is smoother, firmer and cellulite is disappearing, difinitely would recommend purchasing along with the mitt really helps.</li>
            <li>he had some very noticeable improvement in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product really does reduce cellulite and even firms your skin.  </li>
            <li>The only thing to help smooth the lumps and dimpled look is Finulite.</li>
            <li>My legs are much smoother and I no longer feel embarrassed about wearing shorts or even a bathing suit.</li>
            <li>so I expected it to work better.</li>
            <li>so I really appreciated their help with the mix up.</li>
            <li>I really like the results I am getting with this cream.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have that much cellulite before</li>
            <li>I Have Given It 5 Stars Because IT REALLY DOES</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>FAST RESULTS (ALL SMILES).</li>
            <li>i work out, i run 2-3 miles (run/walk fast with my capris) and do yoga.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, I am sticking to it because I see it working</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a guy but have some cellulite problems from working out and losing too much weight too fast.</li>
            <li>Following the bi-daily application, they&#x27;re not as visible and leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me too much though.</li>
            <li>It really worked for me...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Much of my stretch marks are visibly gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it really felt as if my skin was tightening and smoothing itself out.</li>
            <li>Even without the diet and exercise the product works very well.</li>
            <li>it really helped allot for my cellulite.</li>
            <li>This product really works for me.  </li>
            <li>My legs and and thighs are much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>Now, Finulite may have been partly responsible, who knows...</li>
            <li>It seems to really work for some people though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Finulite for almost a year now, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s really working.  </li>
            <li>Not that much improvement,</li>
            <li>It seemed to firm up my problem areas and felt nice putting it on.</li>
            <li>After using full set the first time, I can see a big difference in my legs.</li>
            <li>everyone is different,  but read the reviews carefully, because this is a good product,  some people are just  too picky</li>
            <li>and I am hoping to see even more smoothing of the more worse parts of my thighs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done endermologie treatments and have also used several creams to try and tackle my cellulite issues and this is by far the most affordable system that yields results.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely remove my cellulite but it does WAY better than anything else on the market and DEFINITELY reduces cellulite</li>
            <li>For about two minutes total.&lt;br /&gt;Truly the improvement in my legs is a miracle, at least as good as the plastic surgeon&#x27;s pictures</li>
            <li>I loved the smell, it was thick as well</li>
            <li>The PM solution comes out of the bottle with a good squeeze, but the AM is so thick</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 10 days, my cellulite has gotten 50% better on top of the previous 20% !!!!</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have this big cellulite dimple that won&#x27;t go away on the side on my right thigh and cellulite all over my bottom and the back of my legs.</li>
            <li>All in all, this cream is seriously awesome, and if you&#x27;re like me and sick of hiding, it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>This is my second order of finulite cellulite solutions and have noticed that after trying so many other products for this purpose, so far, this one has come out on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month and a half, but the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li>This product will probably give faster results to those with less severe cellulite, but those of you with more severe cases of cellulite will also see results if you stay consistent.</li>
            <li>Ive used so many other products before and nothing much changed after a month or so</li>
            <li>I plan to use it more consistently to see longer lasting results, but I believe in order for this to happen, you must actually apply morning and night with an intense massaging application.</li>
            <li>The first month, I did not see much difference, the second and third month have been of more significance.</li>
            <li>my skin feels super smooth and the cellulite on my legs are less</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the creams are actually adding anything as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the mitt doing most of the work...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see where I will be in the next 8 weeks!!</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of other products from famous brands to non-famous brands but nothing worked like this one.</li>
            <li>but it is a lot more noticeable than with the other product.</li>
            <li>I have recommended to other people and they feel so satisfied as well ..</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have ever found that has significantly diminished the appearance of the cellulite on my outer thighs.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other creams I have used before.</li>
            <li>I went to a dinner party the other night and wanted to wear a sleeveless top.</li>
            <li>My skin feels healthier, smoother, and beginning to feel normal!</li>
            <li>I saw better results with other cellulite creams that I have used.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different, but this is definitely worth a try because it worked for me!</li>
            <li>It will not take away every bit of cellulite, NO product can do that, but I feel there was a significant enough improvement in order for me to continue using the product.  </li>
            <li>However, this creme does more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other creams that have not seemed to make a difference over the years but feel this one is a winner.</li>
            <li>This product works better than any other like it, that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The other ingredients make sense too - cyclic AMP is interesting since the alkaloids in this products, cAMP and the adenosine receptor are inter-related.  </li>
            <li>I have read many reviews of other customers that have used it for several weeks/months and have noted a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I have used other products in the past, but I am very happy with the results of Finulite thus far and plan to continue using it!</li>
            <li>Works way better than any other cellulite treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>, at first I was just thinking that they were being nice because they knew how hard I was working out</li>
            <li>I bought this product with some skepticism, as I have tried many over the counter lotions and potions for cellulite with very little success.</li>
            <li>one complaint, I take advantage of getting free shipping by ordering more than one set, and they keep sending me new massage mitts.</li>
            <li>I eat clean and work out regularly.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product in May and just like so MANY others I began to see results in just a few days of using it.</li>
            <li>so if you have a lot of cellulite- honestly, only exercise and clean eating can rid the appearance of that-</li>
            <li>I love this product, dont have one single comlaint, worth the price even if it were double!</li>
            <li>I used this product religiously every morning and every night until the bottles were empty and made sure to really massage it in until well absorbed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for real.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 3 weeks so far, they ship the product very fast</li>
            <li>I tryed many things to get rid of these things but nothing helped and that was a surprise for me when I noticed that they really became less visible.</li>
            <li>I have gone through the bottles fairly quickly, so either I&#x27;m using too much or the bottles could be bigger!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from cheap local drug store products to expensive high end products &amp; finally have found the perfect solution!  </li>
            <li>The only thing I got out of that was a HUGE credit card bill, which i still haven&#x27;t completely paid off, and three weeks of absolute hell when it came to my pain.  </li>
            <li>I see a small improvement, but nothing out of this world amazing yet.</li>
            <li>I do eat very healthy and work out at least 4 days a week.  </li>
            <li>My cellulite came back, in full display.</li>
            <li>80% of cellulite gone with the first purchase  and a marked difference in skin elasticity.</li>
            <li>I am a 20 something female, who is in good shape (5 foot 2, 108 lbs), was a former gymnast, and still works out regularly.</li>
            <li>I have to say finulite is the ONLY product that I have actually been able to see real results from.</li>
            <li>Not a huge amount but enough for me to not be able to fit into my size XS clothing.</li>
            <li>After a full bottle using only on the side of my thighs, not result, not a change nothing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the results of this product would be on it&#x27;s own, but for me, finulite worked well in this combination.</li>
            <li>Purple bottle had an orange very fluid cream, also with a sweet fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;Set</li>
            <li>It was especially evident when I sat down in shorts.</li>
            <li>I have always had some cellulite at the tops of my thighs but afte having children, it some how seemed to spread down to the top of my knees.  </li>
            <li>I like the light pleasant scent it has to it not like the usual creams out there that have heavy medicinal scents.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin very smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>and I just ordered me a new set!</li>
            <li>Have Already Ordered My New Set Which Arrived Today!</li>
            <li>Of course I still have some cellulite but the huge craters that had tormented me for so long had dissappeared!</li>
            <li>Having tried at least three other anti-cellulite products, I can honestly say that this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product mid july because it had great ratings compare to other cellulite creams and now I am back re ordering again.</li>
            <li>I live an active lifestyle, workout three times a week, eat healthy, and have a slender build.</li>
            <li>I have had mine almost a month and still have over half a bottle, more like 3/4, and I use it day AND night.</li>
            <li>After having 2 kids,I have been fighting cellulite and losing the battle even though I exercise on a regular basis and eat as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li>I am young, I work out, I eat very healthy, but being in nursing school is a stressful experience and the lack of sleep and excess of coffee has resulted in an increase in cellulite over the past year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have known for the price I wasn&#x27;t going to wake up &amp; have a super model back side</li>
            <li>but as I get older I notice some unwanted cellulite.</li>
            <li>And those are mainly for the packaging and the effort.</li>
            <li>I have enough for the next 3 or 4 days, so I have to order more.</li>
            <li>Had quick visual results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 with 3 kids and find as I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of cellulite creams ad this is the only one that seems to do ANYTHING.  </li>
            <li>I am using on my upper arms mostly because I want to wear short sleeves in the summer.</li>
            <li>, I will be definitely buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>Next, its works like a charm, just follow the directions and your cellulite will diminish quickly.</li>
            <li>I noticed results after using Finulite for about 2 weeks and saw steady improvement after that.</li>
            <li>For anyone that left a negative review, it is important to know that it is important to drink a lot of water, eat healthy and exercise regularly.</li>
            <li>I was told about Finulite by a family member, she actually gave me some that she had left in a bottle, I&#x27;m glad I got to test it before I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Its not an overnight wonder, but its gradual and steady.</li>
            <li>bottles for me lasted a decent amount of time, about a month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now feeling confident enough to wear shorts in public something I haven&#x27;t done in years..</li>
            <li>I found this particular one, reading the information on it</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set 1: pink bottle had yellow/orange very fluid cream with a nice melon like fruity smell.</li>
            <li>I definitely see a difference, the area I was most concerned with was my upper leg</li>
            <li>I made sure to exfoliate very well in the shower before I would apply the cream, not wasting any of the cream on dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>The main areas I focused on were my cellulite ridden butt and thighs.</li>
            <li>After consistently using Finulite day and night, my skin is much smoother, and my cellulite is now barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new to try!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new to try!</li>
            <li>and my cellulite is on the lighter side, but still it was really showing on my stomach and after using this product for awhile now it&#x27;s almost completely gone!  </li>
            <li>Now, granted I did give up after two weeks, but my upper arms are looking pretty darn good now, just from the work out, so at least there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li>I love these creams I&#x27;ve been using them every day for a week and they really seem to be working and the effects appear to be long lasting.  </li>
            <li>but I really feel this made a big difference because in the past with just exercising &amp; eating good</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, this product helped with fluid retention, which I really appreciate since it is a problem for me.</li>
            <li>I see my thighs become more tight and supple when using these lotions continuously.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Something else that I&#x27;ve been doing is using a skin brush before I shower every morning to help &#x27;wake up&#x27; my skin cells, and I highly recommend it as it seems to help the process of removing the cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>It does work I still using the some cream and soap highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the brush instead.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cellulite fighting product.</li>
            <li>, I had my hopes, but I tried not to let them get too high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a cellulite solution.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Finulite to anyone who is looking for an improvement in cellulite and skin laxity.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Finulite to anyone with stubborn cellulite.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend getting the massage mitt.</li>
            <li>, my hopes aren&#x27;t high,</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone wanting to get rid of their cellulite of doom.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a cellulite problem.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s trying to battle their cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other cellulite creams and have not found them to be as effective as Finulite.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from mild cellulite on the back of my thighs for years, despite being thin and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>This product really does work and I am really surprised on how quickly I noticed improvement in the smoothness of my skin in only 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have tried a ton of creams, most of them ridiculously expensive, and this is the only one to date that I have been able to see results with right away.  </li>
            <li>So the key is being consistent!</li>
            <li>I feel with a little more time they too will be gone.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a little more than halfway through the bottles and dimples are gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need one set per month, but maybe a little more in the summertime.</li>
            <li>It amazes me how embarrassed we as women are about it, and anything which gives me a little more confidence whenever I have to go home to Australia and face the beach is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>mitt and the massaging action really opens up the skin to receive the cream</li>
            <li>As far as the results, my legs are so much smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I have to say, so far, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely get the mitt, I think the massaging action helps the product penetrate and stimulates circulation as well.</li>
            <li>Really does work!!I am 31 yrs old and 5&#x27;7 and weigh 135 lbs.</li>
            <li>I would completely recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce that cellulite appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took 3 weeks to see minor results, 8 weeks to see full results.  </li>
            <li>For a few years, I have made a practice of working out more and eating healthier, but I never noticed an improvement in my cellulite--</li>
            <li>Must use everyday as directed:)</li>
            <li>This may be the key to the product&#x27;s success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite creams over the years, and it is one of the few products that seems to work.  </li>
            <li>waste of money just work out more and drink tons of water.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me at all, don&#x27;t waste your money and try something better.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin looks much more firm and the cellulite has gone away almost completly.</li>
            <li>but after a few weeks you do start to see a difference:)</li>
            <li>Ingredients are pretty much the same but color coding</li>
            <li>If you combine it with low-fat diet with regular intake of fresh produce and exercise 2-3 a week</li>
            <li>I had significant cellulite on my thighs and butt due in no small part to significant pregnancy weight gain and the subsequent weight loss.  </li>
            <li>It is the first lotion that i found that  makes my skin feel smooth and firm..</li>
            <li>I can tell my thighs are more firm after using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I use a shower brush to exfoliate before applying, to ensure that it&#x27;s absorbed properly.  </li>
            <li>I love it and make it part of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and the extra TLC to those areas.</li>
            <li>even better results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Although it did small nice and made my skin soft, it didn&#x27;t solve my cellulite problem.</li>
            <li>In short, I feel this product is definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>I will update this in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li>more money wasted.</li>
            <li>Used this product all spring and summer with some noticeable results as to making my skin more firm and reducing the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>I normally use them after my working out</li>
            <li>Very noticeable, and has kept me from wearing shorts many times this past summer.  </li>
            <li>be using this product for at least the warm months of the year from here on out!&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>But too price to be a normal lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t review my purchases</li>
            <li>I have had better results with much cheaper creams that lasted a lot longer than these 2 small bottles.</li>
            <li>It will take time, no instant results - but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>I truly believe it is a big part of my success</li>
            <li>Results were good, not great, although I used the product inconsistently.</li>
            <li>For the price though, anybody can afford to use it, so overall - very positive experience.</li>
            <li>So when I,ve done with my first finulite set,I started with the second one right away for complete the professional recommendation.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions using the pink bottle first thing in the morning and the purple bottle right before bed.  </li>
            <li>I eat right and excersise DAILY!!</li>
            <li>even if you managed to &amp;#34;get rid of&amp;#34; cellulite, if you ever stopped youd get it right back.  </li>
            <li>Only used for couple of weeks but notice the difference right away.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviewers have said the cellulite comes right back when they stop using it, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that in my situation.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe that cellulite can ever goes away but finally found the right product for me.</li>
            <li>also think the bottles are to small other then that i am happy with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to use the cream for your whole body, or most of it, the bottle size is not big enough to last a month.</li>
            <li>so I ordered them for a second time, however this time I was pregnant and wanted to use them to reduce the large amounts of cellulite that became present during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>I hope they never stop making this product, because I refuse to live without it.  </li>
            <li>My husband even commented that the new products were working.  </li>
            <li>now 47, and read an article about a new plastic surgery technique called Cellulaze.</li>
            <li>Its such a let down to think if it worked for so many it must work for you and see absolutely 0% change.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use finulite as long as I need it, it has worked far better than any other cream I&#x27;ve ever tried;)</li>
            <li>This is the only one I have ever used to make such a huge change.</li>
            <li>it is amazing especially when i was hiking everyday</li>
            <li>How much the cream is affecting that, I don&#x27;t really know, but in the end, there is enough improvement for me to continue the practice and have hope that this, combined with my healthier diet and exercise, will over time keep improving my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday morning/night and after 1 month using it, I can clearly see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it for sure.</li>
            <li>My legs were so much smoother by the end of the month to the touch and much of the visual cellulite</li>
            <li>I am comfortable enough to finally wear dresses and skirts again.</li>
            <li>I have to assume that people seeing a difference have never taken the time to massage their cellulite prone areas regularly, and that is likely the primary reason they are seeing some difference when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I see my skin more firm and soft...</li>
            <li>Besides the difference I see (predominantly on my outer &amp; back upper thigh), their fragrance is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different serums, patches, or antidotes and as expected, nothing worked.</li>
            <li>After using Finulite for several weeks, my thighs and butt are noticeably smooth and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this item because of the main ingredients and positive product reviews--hoping I would see results.</li>
            <li>I did not think it would work, so I was very surprised at the results - and I was being hyper-critical.</li>
            <li>and it also leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>You will be very surprised by how quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft; however, it does not appear to take away cellulite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the full 30 days (approaching 60 days total with two treatments of Finulite), (I will upload pictures in a few more days, on day 26)</li>
            <li>The major positive that I&#x27;ve seen with this product is that it has actually completely cleared up my keratosis.</li>
            <li>I am always willing to try something new, especially homemade mixtures...I will stick with coffee grind, sugar and olive oil mixture.</li>
            <li>I had certain areas on the back of my thighs up near my buttocks that started showing signs of cellulite, and no matter how much weight I lost (5&#x27;6 at 140 pounds)</li>
            <li>First set didn&#x27;t do anything for me but did make my legs very soft... might just have to try second set ...</li>
            <li>Cellulite is diminished with consistent use, exercise, and proper diet.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have used that actually improves the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>My first reaction to the product is that the bottles are tiny.</li>
            <li>In the end this product seemed to do the exact opposite of what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of this product; it really works!</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I am excited to try on other problem areas.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>but wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of similar products and this one works and smells better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I used both bottles, and my legs still look the same as they did when I first started using  Finulite, I dont</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s from being over weight most of my life, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li>I am almost finished with the first set of AM PM and definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Around the 3rd week I decided to apply the AM cream before putting on my Zaggora Hot Pants and running 3 miles.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the first week I was not using it daily, but once I started and of course with exercise</li>
            <li>Finulite is the first cellulite cream to actually work for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking forward to rocking my bathing suit and not feeling se of conscious!</li>
            <li>It took some days to see a noticeable improvement, but WOW!</li>
            <li>the writing style is almost exactly the same</li>
            <li>One (or two to be exact) that I trust because it simply works</li>
            <li>Give it a try, and be consistent in using it, and I expect you will receive similar results to mine!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually fights cellulite as it says it will.  </li>
            <li>and I was so surprised!</li>
            <li>This was the first cream that I ever used where I not only started to see an improvement in my cellulite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only in my first month</li>
            <li>You will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I used it pretty religiously and used quite a bit at a time.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how this product worked for the price!</li>
            <li>I look exactly the same as if I&#x27;ve never used any product to reduce any cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also dieting and exercising daily (hardcore like elliptical &amp; stepper for 45 minutes not feeble 15 minute walks or anything)</li>
            <li>Then I decided to try Finulite, and I actually started to see some results within the first two months.  </li>
            <li>I look exactly the same as i did when i started using it.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, last summer, I was embarrassed to wear shorts because of cellulite on my legs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many items to compare this to, as I&#x27;ve only used two other creams before.</li>
            <li>Well, I have used my first Finulite cream and have already received my second.</li>
            <li>I have little on tops of thighs that should easily burn but doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased other items from this company and I am VERY excited to try them.</li>
            <li>I apply it right after I take a shower, while in the shower i use Bliss Fat Girl Slimulator, rub it in a circular motion until my things are deep pink then apply the lotion right after.</li>
            <li>My cellulite has been pretty bad practically all my life, but now there is a great improvement.  </li>
            <li>For such a small investment, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>The effects are of course temporary but these 2 lotions do smooth slight areas of cellulite.</li>
            <li>Most products that I have previously used in the past do not have a good smell to them and were a waste of time and money,</li>
            <li>My advice to you is to eat a low sugar and sodium diet, cut down on the caffeine and eat a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>I decided to try something different because this had some positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this one a shot was because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>As long as you keep up with the regimine, you will most likely see results (obviously diet and exercise lifestyle is a must)!</li>
            <li>SO far it has made my skin tighter and so soft!  </li>
            <li>ordered a new set and the cream color is very faded and almost white.</li>
            <li>Got product very fast been using about 10 days on stomach area no results so far maybe to early to review update been using on stomach about 5 wks a little improvement but not much i will purchase one more time to see if its going to work</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did, as it is already helping &amp; I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week &amp; a half.</li>
            <li>I used this so far for a month I must say works well, but of course I&#x27;ve been doing my part with walking and light jogging , but the appearance of cellulite is less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate \\&quot;hail damage\\&quot;, especially on my thighs...</li>
            <li>my legs feel smooth and tight  .</li>
            <li>My legs feel smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>My only caveat is that these two tubes don&#x27;t last the full month (at least for me), perhaps 3 weeks at the most.</li>
            <li>This product was disappointing, even though it had a good amount of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>But honestly combining the nivea gel cream and serum works 20x better than this and is still less expensive.</li>
            <li>only upside to this cream, it left my legs super soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s the ONLY thing that truly works.</li>
            <li>, there is still a little cellulite in the back of my legs but the difference form before i started is significantly better.</li>
            <li>I will say that after using 1 both of AM and PM, it is hard to tell if there is any difference, but I am going to try it a couple more times and see.</li>
            <li>I have spent years looking for a decent cellulite creme that was not full of chemicals &amp; left my skin soft, smooth &amp; nourished, not sticky!!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t particularly care for the new scent.</li>
            <li>So in a desperate attempt to rid myself of this curse, I bought a stepper, and this product.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the great reviews</li>
            <li>I am very please with the results so far for only a month of usage.</li>
            <li>soft and much tighter!This stuff actually did what it said it would do!!</li>
            <li>Did not see any clear results</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d steer clear.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly 2 years and consider it a life-saver (or at least an arm-save). :-)</li>
            <li>stars later after I use it longer -- and if there is interest I can find out how much theophylline is in natural chocolate.</li>
            <li>Tried a second bottle and absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li>its to early to say it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 18 years old, and I have had cellulite since I was 13.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old, weight anywhere from 113-120</li>
            <li>I ended up discovering Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow moisturizer (which gives you a gradual tan).</li>
            <li>With the warmer weather I opted for Jergens natural glo firming moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(diet, massage with body brash and light exercise) gives some improvements, therefore I gave it 3 points and</li>
            <li>However, I have struggled for a long time (*years*) with cellulite.  </li>
            <li>After having a baby i had some troublesome areas around my thighs and tummy that would not go away are finally disappearing thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>I see no difference in cellulite at all so far.  </li>
            <li>135 lb women, but at 45 yrs old, I have some cellulite on my legs.  </li>
            <li>After a month, early sign of cellulite disappeared.</li>
            <li>If it works on a 50+ year old grandma, it should work on anyone.</li>
            <li>This helps to smooth out those trouble spots.</li>
            <li>I do suggest trying them, and after continued use my legs look much firmer overall.  </li>
            <li>I will come back with another feedback in a month to see how much it improves my thighs</li>
            <li>I used a self tanner and wow what a difference with both products being used.</li>
            <li>but my skin was really soft.  </li>
            <li>I even went as far as spending $6,000 on liposuction.  </li>
            <li>If I had only known that these creams existed before I went through all that, I&#x27;d be a much happier woman today.  </li>
            <li>After four weeks, there was a complete difference.  </li>
            <li>I bet you will be pleasantly surprised, just like I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe that if I continue to use it for another 3 months or so, all of the cellulite that I have accumulated over 9 years will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>old woman who has always had cellulite on the backs of my legs.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, tighter and feels silky soft.  </li>
            <li>My cellulite was very noticeable on the back of my thighs.  </li>
            <li>I like this product so far.</li>
            <li>You are supposed to really massage it in a circular motion using deep penetration...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I work out at least 4 times a week and eat well most of the time.  </li>
            <li>As long as you follow the directions and stay consistent you will notice results.</li>
            <li>I used one complete set of the AM/PM cream.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions completely, and saw zero results.  </li>
            <li>I can really use until the last drop of it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a busy schedule, so I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li>and wow what a differince i can already see on my legs and butt...</li>
            <li>soon I believe to see complete results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am slender yet I have SO much cellulite at the back and some on the sides of my legs.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised to find that there is a visible difference in the cellulite pockets.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much about this product because I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times.</li>
            <li>didnt do a thing except make skin feel soft</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a beauty brush instead to brush my skin before a shower, and months later my cellulite has gone away much.</li>
            <li>Finulite has made my skin so soft and it has toned up the skin dramatically.</li>
            <li>my skin isn&#x27;t as it was (naturally).</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and its been working really well</li>
            <li>It definitely did make my skin soft, but I can find a good organic lotion for a whole lot cheaper to do that without questionable ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Are my imperfections gone completely?  </li>

            <li>This product really works especially if you apply it as instructed&lt;br /&gt;both day and night.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m destined to have cellulite forever (thanks, genetics), but Finulite has definitely made an improvement in the look of my legs!</li>
            <li>, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I have been battling cellulite for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li>Please note that, as much as we want for creams to work to cure/remove cellulite, THEY SIMPLY DON&#x27;T WORK.</li>
            <li>, it made my thighs so soft, but it did nothing for the cellulite.</li>
            <li>So far, this product has been helpful.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin firm and smooth</li>
            <li>Is cellulite really that different for some and not others.</li>
            <li>fast acting...</li>
            <li>It sucks that most of us have it, but often it is the fat we eat and not working out.</li>
            <li>So far, I am liking the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exercise much (as I had a hernia operation a while back).</li>
            <li>The only problem is that I go through it too fast-</li>
            <li>Fast forward 24 Hours later</li>
            <li>and I see it, loud and clear.</li>
            <li>Well I am back to say I did not experience as much a smoothing effect as i like.</li>
            <li>I am a slender 31 year old, 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and 110lbs, yet, I have cellulite.</li>
            <li>I am a mature guy and I have always used anti-fat/cellulite creams in order to reduce the fat I have at the sides of my belly.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 28 years old, and I run 5 times a week.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>He even said these creams were old and told me to stop using them immediately.</li>
            <li>I recently started to get a layer of cellulite on my legs and purchased this product based on some promising reviews.</li>
            <li>Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;I am 45 years old, stand 5&#x27;2, and weigh 120 lbs.</li>
            <li>This is the second time i purchase this product, it really works.</li>
            <li>Finally after searching on amazon for cellulite products I found Finulite, and all the reviews seemed promising</li>
            <li>so far it is working just as they say it should ..</li>
            <li>So far, no reduction in BUMPS.</li>
            <li>i rather not waste my time</li>
            <li>I feel that with time my cellulite will completely disappear.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased,so I will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li>Hi, I am 27 years old but have cellulite on my legs and my butt.</li>
            <li>Results are probably different for each person, but I definitely think its worth it.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the quantity of the product, but overall I think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>I just bought my second set of creams and plan to keep this up for a few more months.</li>
            <li>I think the area above my knees bothers me most because in the summer I wear shorts everyday</li>
            <li>I had what I considered severe cellulite which would get worse with any kind of weight gain.</li>
            <li>I swear the good reviews here are fake and this product should be removed from the market.  </li>
            <li>A minor complaint I may have though is the scent; both AM and PM bottles have a very distinct flowery, sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I did drop the weight by following Weight Watchers and exercising (as much as the little one would let me), but my legs never returned to their original beauty.  </li>
            <li>I recently read an article that cellulite and stretch marks are caused by the same problem--lack of water in the right places and broken-down</li>
            <li>But with Finulite (and their accompanying massage mitt) I have definitely noticed a difference, especially in the deeper dimples in my right thigh that have always bothered me.</li>
            <li>I have tried other similar products and wasn&#x27;t left nearly as satisfied as I am with this product.</li>
            <li>I also have an active job where I am on my feet all day, and can be physically taxing at many points (physical therapist).  </li>
            <li>I kid you not, with the addition of Finulite and consistent dry brushing before every shower, I have no visible cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have used many other products and have spent tons of money on finding the \\&quot;right\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>only because its cheap compared to other creams.</li>
            <li>I didnt think i would find a miracle cream but due to all the good feedback I was hoping for at least something but nothing.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this product a try since the conventional diet and exercise just wasn&#x27;t giving me results in specific places that I wanted, but adding this into the equation is just amazing~ Please, before doing something unreasonable like surgery, spare a few dollars and get some real results.</li>
            <li>so they do not last very long, they absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen considerable improvement in loose skin and cellulite and have purchased their cream because you get a lot more for less.    </li>
            <li>Over the last year, I have lost weight and added a steady yet modest work out regimen to my life including weights and cardio.</li>
            <li>The only downside I can really see is that the bottles are a little small and you could easily run out quick if you are using lots of the lotion at once.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of other cellulite creams over the years, without much success.  </li>
            <li>My cellulite was getting pretty bad and this product along with drinking more water and running on the treadmill have been a step in the right direction.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve had cellulite most of my life (even when I was seriously UNDER weight)</li>
            <li>What I do everyday is clean my skin with alcohol</li>
            <li>if the first pack doesn&#x27;t exceed your expectations, don&#x27;t lose faith because the second one will definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants less of the &amp;#34;cottage-cheese&amp;#34; look on your arms, legs, and/or stomach - basically the most fatty areas in your body.  </li>
            <li>i ORDERED MY SECOND SET AND THE LOOK, FEEL AND SMELL OF THE LOTION IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST SET I HAD.</li>
            <li>so I guess you can say that this had a profound impact on me.</li>
            <li>: it is the first time after trying countless products that I actually see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never wore bikini bottoms because I never wanted anyone to see the back of my legs or thighs and wore capri&#x27;s no matter how hot It was outside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my skin is getting better or not, I&#x27;m not using it religiously</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of the 5 star reviews are FAKE.  </li>
            <li>At first I was thinking--ok, so I just wasted my money, because I didn&#x27;t really notice results after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to give Finulite the second chance, and again as with the first time, I see minimum into moderate improvement.</li>
            <li>And having the 2 bottles actually helps me keep a steady routine.</li>
            <li>For last time, I did not consistently apply them on my body, so I did not observe significant change of my body shape.</li>
            <li>I have been using it almost daily for the last 3 months and really see results!</li>
            <li>While the prices are reasonable, bigger bottles would be helpful for how much I put on in a single session-</li>
            <li>Most products on the market today are MUCH pricier and you only get one formulation (not day/night like Finulite offers) and there are little to no results with other products-</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to those needing that extra support in those areas that tend to store fat and excess water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been a problem since the 7th grade when the boy sitting next to me in jr high school asked why I had dimples in my thighs...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone with this same problem.</li>
            <li>I initially tried this brand of cellulite cream because of all the high reviews that it had.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t leave me super sticky after application (no more than normal lotion).</li>
            <li>I only use a small amount in the areas of interest while massaging and the product is absorbed very fast.</li>
            <li>is this a fake or did they change the smell and color the first bottle I got were like a serum type and these new ones are more like a lotion last yr</li>
            <li>Only thing I hope they change is that (which they already may have since I bought them seeing how it&#x27;s different in pictures now) instead of the hard shell bottles, it would be nice for them to be in tubes</li>
            <li>Only downfall, wish the product came in larger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making my experience with finulite a positive one.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at the beginning for I had tried so many products to fight my cellulite, but I got convinced to give Finulite  a try after reading the positive comments on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is only the second day &amp; I will add on to this review after this trial, but I can already say something positive about this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am just not sure if too weeks is the duration in which providing a rating is accurate to suffice.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why that detail is relevant to this product and the purpose of its use.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and non-greasy, but you&#x27;re unlikely to get much improvement from anything you simply rub onto your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different cellulite creams over the past few years, and Finulite has worked the best for me by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a month with absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li>we are all not super models cellulite happens, learn to live with it or be willing to put in the work.</li>
            <li>I got super busy and quit using it consistently for a while, and the cellulite got worse again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say which element has had the most affect, but I would definitely say I see a noticeable difference when I use the Finulite.</li>
            <li>I wore a short dress to a New Years party and my friends all</li>
            <li>I just received my third set of Finulite, which is now the new formula and it too seems to work well.</li>
            <li>and I simply cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>and he mentioned that a special chemical- aminophylline--that breaks down fat when topically applied.</li>
            <li>If you wanted to really stimulate the tissues, I&#x27;d suggest dry brushing before showering and then using the AM cream.</li>
            <li>and I do think there is a slight difference although, I have also been using a wooden massager to deeply massage it in, so it could be the massage more than the actual lotions that is making the difference.  </li>
            <li>Not HUGE but compared to how much damage there is to work on, to even see the slightest difference is very encouraging.</li>
            <li>used this product for 30 days straight, at the same time in the morning and at the same time at night.</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying Finulite, I must say I really did notice a big change below my butt</li>
            <li>I started using it on my upper arms and only a week in now and already seeing a much smoother muscle tone there than the dimples.</li>
            <li>Cellulite runs in my family, and while I have always been relatively fit, the last few years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to think that all of the good reviews are fake.</li>
            <li>Slowly but surely it will continue to improve my overall skin appearance.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe the least expensive is what worked the best!</li>
            <li>At first I was a little skeptical about how much good a cream will do for my cellulite</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get to see if this product actually worked because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Too many products fot cellulite I was expecting at least better results, the bottles are to small I think should try other products.</li>
            <li>and I have seen major, major improvement.</li>
            <li>No other product have done this before.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for 1 month and major improvement I have noticed is in my butt.</li>
            <li>No regrets here!</li>
            <li>just use it everyday be very consistent &amp; u will see resultz</li>
            <li>My cellulite was a progressive process so it will take time to see a major difference.</li>
            <li>only issue would be that both bottles have the exact same ingredients and the only difference in the two is the fragrance.</li>
            <li>However, the second time I got a total different product then the first time.</li>
            <li>probably worth it, especially for the summer time when you have to show your body on the beach ;-) and as long as you use it everyday.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m prepared to keep at it - and for such a great price you can&#x27;t really go wrong!</li>
            <li>the end, this product is great by itself, and in combination of vitamins, constantly keeping your skin moisturized, derma-rolling, and applying the cream( really rub the cream in, I rub the cream in with both hands, then press extremely hard, with slow controlled motions with my thumbs getting the cream deep deep inside the skin, until it no longer feels \\&quot;oily/moisture</li>
            <li>but what the heck, what little bit I do have is worth taking care of now</li>
            <li>I used to have large sunken holes on my thighs and butt now much improved small areas.</li>
            <li>A bit of background: I have had cellulite since I was a preteen and have tried nearly every method and cream and lotion to get rid of it with very little success.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things in the past and spent great amounts of time and money, to end up feeling frustrated, with no results.</li>
            <li>From past experiences with these types of products, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>I am exercising while using the products and in one months time, I am convinced after my second order, I shall be clear of cellulite.</li>
            <li>I am not overweight, and I was devastated to see my body ravaged with this cellulite problem at such a young age.</li>
            <li>my marks were pretty dark as well.</li>
            <li>I ordered it last year and did see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It will not remove your cellulite completely but will help minimize appearance of your cellulite.</li>
            <li>Also, I should say I have barely been working out.</li>
            <li>I gave only four stars because the amount you get in each tube is not nearly enough to last a whole month in my perspective.</li>
            <li>Not only did this product not work - at all - but it made me examine my legs so thoroughly and frequently that I saw cellulite</li>
            <li>once you have enough cellulite to see you cannot completely eliminate it without drastic life-style changes</li>
            <li>I am a 31 year old female, 5&#x27;1 126lbs.</li>
            <li>Company policy is \\&quot;partial refund with the customer absorbing return shipping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have not been faithful with the dual daily application, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>25 year old male.</li>
            <li>I have been using Finulite for about a month now and have seen considerable changes in the amount of cellulite on my glutes and back of legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a youthful 50 year old and constantly struggling with cellulite.  </li>
            <li>It actually does reduce the appearance of cellutlite and makes the skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have tried numerous lotions and remedies for cellulite and nothing works like this product does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However as far as smoothing and strengthening my skin goes, I have noticed results with this product and I will keep using it for the foreseeable future in the hope that combined with exercise</li>
            <li>Now that I am a 20 year old college student that has tried almost every over the counter cellulite treatment, I am so relieved that Finulite has actually given me a break on cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about 3 months now and 80% of my cellulite is barely noticable.  </li>
            <li>But after a full 8 oz of nothing I am not foolish enough to buy another round.</li>
            <li>but hey, I was game for some improvement, anything to make me feel okay in a bathing suit or</li>
            <li>in advance of starting a new diet/exercise routine on Jan 1, 2013, I purchased Finulite after doing COPIOUS amounts of research on cellulite solutions (from other creams to various types of laser surgery, which wasn&#x27;t an option for me at this time due to cost), and began using is just before the 1st of the year (this is important to note, because the results cannot be attributed to the new routine, as I hadn&#x27;t been doing it long</li>
            <li>have recently bought a new cellulite cream by a different company.</li>
            <li>Description made me think it would have a nice herbal smell but this is strong and sickening.  </li>
            <li>Finulite not only decreases the appearance like other products it really works on the fat cells directly.</li>
            <li>I am half way through my first set of lotion</li>
            <li>Using the AM in the morning and the PM at night is much less of a cumbersome ritual than I first thought.</li>
            <li>Using it twice a day with exercise, I notice a small decrease in cellulite, which is more than other products have done for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a cellulite cream, so I cannot compare Finulite to any other product.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my thighs are smoother after several months of use.  </li>
            <li>My body is more firm and tight.</li>
            <li>The smaller more numerous cellulite lines disappeared in about two weeks, but the bigger thick lines on the sides of my belly prove to be trickier.</li>
            <li>year, there is less actual exercise temporary however, but I&#x27;m very consistent with manual hand massage tools, electric massage use, and I am definitely getting results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>big part of those positive reviews must be fake, as it happens more and more on Amazon... sad.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried other very pricey cellulite creams that promise you will see results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not overweight at all, I just have a few spots that are a little more cottage cheese looking than I&#x27;d like (stomach and butt/</li>
            <li>One IMPORTANT tip is to rub it in very deep and hard.</li>
            <li>Not too highly scented, so it won&#x27;t mess with your regular scent of perfume or deodorant or what ever it is you wear normally.</li>
            <li>Not too highly scented, so it won&#x27;t mess with your regular scent of perfume or deodorant or what ever it is you wear normally.</li>
            <li>im sooo happy and shocked that this cream is actually working..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sad to say my experience the second time around isn&#x27;t as amazing.</li>
            <li>for someone has had a gorgeous pair of cellulite free legs, this was just devastating.</li>
            <li>The cottage cheese look on my thighs began to disappear slowly and surely enough it became a HUGE improvement over the months I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many cellulite products,very expensive ones,too,that have not done anything near to what this one does.</li>
            <li>Although it hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared  (I don&#x27;t expect it to), the overall appearance has definitely improved.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all gone, obviously, and I don&#x27;t expect it to ever completely disappear, but after a month, the results are definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Ever since I was in my early teens I have been plagued with cellulite even with being only 130 pounds throughout my teen years.</li>
            <li>I am not 100% cellulite free but the back of my thighs looks way way smoother and my butt the dimples are slowly being diminished</li>
            <li>Some very expensive creams smell only nice and cost a lot money.........but don&#x27;t work !&lt;</li>
            <li>I was so excited about receiving this product since the reviews were so good, but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li>would have given this product 5 Stars, and I might come back and do just that after I&#x27;ve finished up the bottles (I&#x27;m barely two weeks into using the stuff!),</li>
            <li>so it did bruise me a little the first 2 days -</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a miracle in pretty little bottles.</li>
            <li>Other than having your skin a little smooth when you apply it this products is just another gimmick</li>
            <li>I purchased two sets on my first order and I am nearly half way through the second set.</li>
            <li>but I figured if I was researching this product I would like to see all the reviews good or bad.(I&#x27;m also starting to wonder why bad reviews/experiences are being marked as not helpful...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m beyond shocked and thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li>In addition to regular leg and rear exercises, I had tried nearly every topical product on the market to reduce cellulite on my upper thighs and rear.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no excuse to not work out.</li>
            <li>This was apparent after only 2 weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li>I have purchased four sets since May, and plan to continue buying this lotion as long as I keep getting the results I&#x27;ve gotten thus far.</li>
            <li>Strangely not running or diet changes.)</li>
            <li>Remember, you can&#x27;t completely get rid of your cellulite, though diet and exercise will also help with that, but Finulite will drastically reduce the appearance of your cellulite, as long as you use it every morning and night.</li>
            <li>This product is my first ever cellulite erasing product, and I will admit that I won&#x27;t try any other product as long as I can get my hands on Finulite.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty upset when I started developing cellulite a few years ago.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the small investment.  </li>
            <li>I massage it in pretty firmly</li>
            <li>It needs to be used consistently and everyday to see the results but it works.</li>
            <li>I first tried Finulite a few months ago.</li>
            <li>Only thing that I wish which is super minor is that the ingredients on the bottles were a little easier to read.  </li>
            <li>After rubbing the AM cream on this morning, I noticed two large dimples in the front of my thigh that had not been there previously.  </li>
            <li>some reviews complain about there being a small amount of finulite in the bottles, but you use them separately, so it&#x27;s actually eight ounces of cream, which is more than some  other skin systems come with!</li>
            <li>Never went up and down that much in weight</li>
            <li>I covered from my hip down to my knee with the stuff and really worked it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old, very active, eat well, and overall, try to take good care of myself, but age usually prevails, and in the last few years I have noticed some imperfections emerging, and I wanted to take a proactive approach to improve my skin&#x27;s appearance and prevent future imperfections.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a little over 2 weeks every morning and night pretty religiously</li>
            <li>If you have major cellulite, surgery is the only thing that will make a big difference.</li>
            <li>losing so much weight so suddenly, I was left with \\&quot;battle scars\\&quot; aka loose stomach skin, cellulite, and very deep red stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the positive reviews seem to be by reviewer&#x27;s with one or few reviews in the past; though, they are noted as \\&quot;amazon verified purchase\\&quot;, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Expensive, great cream, very little quantity.</li>
            <li>My legs are firmer, and I hardly see any more cellulite, even if I bunch up my legs or sit down.</li>
            <li>I bought due to the high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using finulite for the past 2yrs and my body looks much sexier - wow.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it... not sure as to how much it is working yet.  </li>
            <li>umm i pretty much got tired of rubbing smelly lotion on my legs after a week, its a rigorous process, and</li>
            <li>I noticed a positive change after about 10 days, but now it&#x27;s been a couple of months, and the difference it pretty dramatic.  </li>
            <li>after reading a few reviews on Finulite, while skeptical at first, decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so, so glad I made that purchase 2 months ago.</li>
            <li>I am 40ish, average sized, weighing about 130, and starting to really notice the cellulite on the back of my thighs.</li>
            <li>the past, the only products that really worked always ended up being discontinued - Avon CelluSculpt in the early 2000s and Avon Lipo AM/</li>
            <li>I had a lot of expectations about this product because of former reviews but sincerely it does not work, unfortunately cellulite is very difficult to treat and like this one a lot of products in this market offer improvement in cellulite condition but most of them simply don&#x27;t have positive results, so for me this was same as others, &amp;#34;Not good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>if I kept using the Firming &amp; Toning Gel-Cream Massager daily and used the Toning Concentrate whenever I went out on the town (the effects of which washed off after showering or going in the water, so watch out when going to the beach with that one), finishing off the look with a drop of the Toning Massage Oil, but beware, all the SpaFit Body Shop products are yellow/orange in color, and they will stain your clothing yellow too, and leave wet marks on certain fabrics if you don&#x27;t wait for them to dry after application,</li>
            <li>I had high hopes due to all the reviews and thought that finally I found something that may actually work!</li>
            <li>The smaller less noticeable ones have improved but are not gone and my deep one is not improving much at all.</li>
            <li>(remember it takes a few months) as you will certainly see improvement in the smoothing and texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>Being a fitness competitor and getting to a very lean physique, there is always a little cellulite that hangs on for dear life on my thighs and butt.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much cellulite, and was hoping this might get rid of the little bit I had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using finulite for a little over a week straight now</li>
            <li>Seriously, every time I use this on my arms and legs, not only does my cellulite disappear, but my bumpy skin also gets very smooth and the KP is less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It spreads on very thickly, and seems to plump and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sad that the product did not work for my cellulite, but I did enjoy the scents and it left my skin soft.    </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s working beautifully</li>
            <li> I saw great results without changing my diet or exercising (at all).</li>
            <li> I was hoping after all the great reviews that this product would work.  </li>
            <li> May be a great product for others, just not for me</li>
            <li> It smells great and works wonders.</li>
            <li> I am so happy i did.</li>
            <li> My cellulite has greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> this one does I am so happy I found this</li>
            <li> So, I was expecting this product to work miracles because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Finulite is a great moisturzer but that is all it does.</li>
            <li> It has improved greatly the texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great creams.</li>
            <li> LOL)</li>
            <li> But I am so happy with this product I will.  </li>
            <li> Great buy for all of us girls who suffer from the dreaded cellulite.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price....</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t holding out any great hopes.</li>
            <li> Now I can go to the pool, proudly.</li>
            <li> But this one, stood out to me and I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> Finulite is s great product I have been using it for a while now</li>
            <li> However anything that will boost my confidence in wearing shorts or a swimsuit in 30 days is a WIN for me.</li>
            <li> Plus the smell was not that great.  </li>
            <li> This product had great reviews</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see great results.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> The cellulite on my thighs is not gone, however it is greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> Great combo together.</li>
            <li> The effects have made me really happy.  </li>
            <li> I was using Avon before and it was great but its discontinued.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I did this.</li>
            <li> lol thats all they did .</li>
            <li> The product smells great.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product, I have been using for two weeks and combined with exercising it has made my skin look firmer and the texture smoother.</li>
            <li> I also used the finulite brush which i think helps with the great results.</li>
            <li> Lol</li>
            <li> And bonus it smells great...</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I find that working out on the bicycle at the gym and going to tanning salons help a great deal with minimizing the appearance as well.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s nothing great.</li>
            <li> AND YOU COULD WIN A YEARS SUPPLY&amp;#34; but</li>
            <li> consistencey and quality of the lotion is great.</li>
            <li> Great job with this product,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave reviews often but when a product is great and works so well for me</li>
            <li> happy with the results</li>
            <li> I am def happy with the product and have already purchced another shippment.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> but I am still getting great results.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> Turns out it was a great product i noticed improvement in my cellulite not in two weeks</li>
            <li> This product works great to tighten up those problem areas.</li>
            <li> The seller always delivers promptly and is great to work with.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about six weeks now and have experienced a smoother surface around my thighs.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this product and I have to say, they were great.</li>
            <li> It smelt great</li>
            <li> and it is great.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a great product, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll find out since I can&#x27;t get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can tell this is a great company.</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It smells great</li>
            <li> Also, the price is great for the results that you get.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just a happy side-effect though, I would use it regardless.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use finulite for three consecutive months and I can say it works great.</li>
            <li> both lotions glide on great.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great and makes your skin smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I must say, if I am to continue to use this product, (no matter how great it is)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with any improvement</li>
            <li> Great smell too.</li>
            <li> The customer service is also great.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, that I will say.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from cellulite for years, and now I am happy that I can end it by using this product.</li>
            <li> Hoping for great results with continued use paired with my exercise routine.  </li>
            <li> I have seen great results, it has not all gone away</li>
            <li> What a great product!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing!</li>
            <li> These are amazing!</li>
            <li> Not to mention the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> But this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure after almost two months of use its one of the best.</li>
            <li> I love this product for its results but it also smells great!</li>
            <li> &quot; I have a nice figure - with my clothes off is another story!</li>
            <li> After using 4 weeks I  received many compliments and comments regarding how great I looked-even some wanting to know if I had lost weight!</li>
            <li> I really liked it!&lt;br /&gt;Gotta use the massager too!</li>
            <li> It even smells nice!</li>
            <li> What a nice surprise!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely Awesome!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the results as the dimples on my bottom and thighs are smoothing out and firming up!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled !</li>
            <li> Along with  some patience, a good diet and excercise the results are great.</li>
            <li> But what i am most impressed with is the customer service from the company that distibutes the product.  </li>
            <li> I would almost still buy it just for the smell :P</li>
            <li> It seems to do wonders for tone and am loving it and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I like that the creams are not greasy and they both have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Lotion is not greasy and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> they both smell citrusy and pleasant.</li>
            <li> a pleasant odor and are agreeable to use.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> If this eliminates or significantly decreases my cellulite I will be a faithful customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> Of course I do exercise and eat very healthy but this product is a great complement ..</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle but is as good as any much pricier cellulite maintnence treatment, including wonderful Murad, is enriched with skin-nourishing vitamins and smells excellent.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and feels silky good.</li>
            <li> Ok about the product, it works very very good.</li>
            <li> My arms look amazing, and my stomach is greatly improving.</li>
            <li> Honestly I decided to try this product because it had great reviews</li>
            <li> It smells really good</li>
            <li> I want my cellulite gone for good.</li>
            <li> Good product I refer to my friend</li>
            <li> This cream smells really good.  </li>
            <li> The End to Cellulite after reading all the good reviews,</li>
            <li> ; wise.  </li>
            <li> It is also good for releasing and comforting muscles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels just like lotion and smells good too.</li>
            <li> This product is good.</li>
            <li> Might be why some aren&#x27;t having good results.  </li>
            <li> I used to use another product and thought based on the reviews this might be good to try and this shows me that some reviews might be padded on here.  </li>
            <li> Even with my good diet and exercise, I still couldn&#x27;t stop the scale from going up a pound or two every morning</li>
            <li> It smells good and it works.</li>
            <li> I wanted to look good for the summer.</li>
            <li> which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Good product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a fair chance</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I saw no results after finishing both bottles.</li>
            <li> Smells like medicine and doesn&#x27;t do any good that I can tell.</li>
            <li> I loved the Diva Stuff Cellulite bar I&#x27;ve been using though.</li>
            <li> For starters, it smells really good.</li>
            <li> My thighs have never looked this good.</li>
            <li> It also smells really good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just cream that smells good.</li>
            <li> Quality is good.</li>
            <li> The price is affordable &amp; it smells really good.</li>
            <li> A GOOD REVIEW</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell good either.</li>
            <li> smells good - that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> it smells really good...</li>
            <li> Guess I will just keep exercising and eating a good diet.</li>
            <li> and they could not stop raving about how good I looked</li>
            <li> I am a person that has been struggling with weight for a good portion of my life and after I had my son I had gained and now lost 80 pounds.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, too.  </li>
            <li> It does smell good though.</li>
            <li> Creams smell good, and my skin feels so silky.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of products and frankly don&#x27;t have the money or time to burn.</li>
            <li> good price....</li>
            <li> I am planing on taking a trip to Mexico and do want to look good in my shorts..</li>
            <li> So give it a try and good luck to all.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good creme/lotion for Cellulite.</li>
            <li> I work out and eat fairly well</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t afford to have the cellulaze treatment, this is a good, temporary fix.</li>
            <li> Just like with every thing else that&#x27;s good in life, you have to be patient and keep at it.</li>
            <li> But I might say they both smell so good.</li>
            <li> it seemed like a good idea to try.</li>
            <li> I guess if you like the fragrant smell then they are good for you.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> I bought it as gift for my mom and sister and they also loved it.</li>
            <li> ,  I think the price  is fair, for what It does , as for my cellulite  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the Finulite because it had some good reviews.</li>
            <li> good luck to all...........</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how good the results are yet</li>
            <li> its so good</li>
            <li> Is it fair</li>
            <li> Smells good tho</li>
            <li> My legs have always been the one part of my body that I actually loved about myself.</li>
            <li> this smells really good.</li>
            <li> I also actually loved the smell of both of these.  </li>
            <li> Everything on pinterest pointed me toward this product and it has a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li> This definitely is a good addition to a cellulite care regimen-it smells good and has a number of good ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soo cool!!!</li>
            <li> The product does smell great (both Am and PM), very easy to apply, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> &amp; Honestly This Product Is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I can confidently say that this product has greatly reduced my cellulite.</li>
            <li> , I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it and a great cream!!!!</li>
            <li> I use it with a massager to better absorption and it works great.</li>
            <li> and everything is safe as well which is especially important to me.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months now and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy and now have more confidence to wear shorts again.</li>
            <li> It smells good and feels nice, but I can&#x27;t say it worked for me.</li>
            <li> The lotion was nice and creamy and did smell good though.</li>
            <li> Finulite cream and soap also has a mild but very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product smells beautiful and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Mine is more so my genes (which I just love my family for!!</li>
            <li> the price is a huge bonus, under 30 bucks with shipping!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Well, I am extremely pleased that I made that decision!  </li>
            <li> Much better smell,and seems to be working even faster!</li>
            <li> That is what most of the stored up toxins are from - sugars!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many!</li>
            <li> Do not lose hope, does take time to work as most things do!</li>
            <li> The thing is, I knew better but fell for it anyway - shame on me!</li>
            <li> Oh, and its the most affordable one out there!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a month now and love it!</li>
            <li> Been wearing shorts- feeling sexy!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have told family and friends to put it on their list!</li>

            <li> The lotions smell great and absorb quickly!</li>
            <li> day and night creams apply easily and have a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> I used this creams lo g time ago with amazing results, but after fighting with the bottle to squeeze the cream out, I gave up and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> and I saw amazing changes.</li>
            <li> The results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really an amazing feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finulite is amazing, it truly does work.</li>
            <li> Smells great and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> I got amazing results with this cellulite treatment.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the smell &amp; formula was changed, but hoped the result would be just as amazing.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice now and will continue to, works amazing.  </li>
            <li> All in all amazing,</li>
            <li> and this product worked amazingly.  </li>
            <li> makes your thighs look great and smooth.</li>
            <li> Its smooth, creamy and smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and the results are amazing...</li>
            <li> I am going to look amazing for my honeymoon</li>
            <li> There are some amazing purification properties in this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> and I got an amazing result</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing amazing results.  </li>
            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the product is also nice and it leaves your skin</li>
            <li> It has honestly toned, softened, and erased my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I think the Mitt is supposed to be some kind of knock off &amp;#34;body brushing&amp;#34; technique, but that too is a joke.</li>
            <li> but the creams smell good &amp; I&#x27;m enjoying using them.</li>
            <li> But it dries nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you all tacky &amp; sticky adsorbs well.</li>
            <li> As the bottle says, no cream in itself is effective as I well know.</li>
            <li> Each bottle lasts about one month; it smells nice; and also works as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it does get results, but you have to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest..</li>
            <li> However, they smell really nice</li>
            <li> I noticed an honest decrease in the appearance in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s as effective as the cream.</li>
            <li> kind of attitude.</li>
            <li> also found so nice from the company that they send me a personalized letter, giving me the opportunity to review their product.</li>
            <li> but honestly, I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything out there for firmer skin and cellulite reduction and NOTHING has worked as fast and as wonderfully as finulite!!!</li>
            <li> fast service and great product!</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this product, I&#x27;ve ordered it 3 times now:)  </li>
            <li> The smell has changed a bit, but it is still a nice suttle smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly saw no improvement.</li>
            <li> and I liked it</li>
            <li> /&gt;They hit a homerun on the formulation and I am guessing that is why it is so popular.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, not medicinal at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to take the time to submit an honest, but informative review of [[ASIN:B004WSXD4</li>
            <li> When I came across this cream I liked that it does not tingle your skin</li>
            <li> The cream consistency and smell is nice.</li>
            <li> and it really is the best cellulite product i have ever come across.</li>
            <li> It smelled really nice.</li>
            <li> and I think does just as good of a job while smelling better.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a hassle putting it on morning and night</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think their is a product that can take away cellulite.</li>
            <li> it smells nice.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but did not change a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it a kind of trick?</li>
            <li> I also liked their smell and feel.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Its citrus like - kind of like the smell of a vitamin C supplement but lighter.</li>
            <li> I feel like it works to soften the skin nicely and stimulate the areas - theophylline and theobromine are used in medicine for this type of stuff</li>
            <li> Can be used just as a lotion with nice essence.</li>
            <li> Losing this much weight is great but seeing results is keeping me going!</li>
            <li> Thanks for an amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She tray this nice product and........</li>
            <li> I had the orange peel kind of cellulite, not the lumpy kind.  </li>

            <li> It has a pleasant smell and is easily applied.  </li>
            <li> The product smells great, has a nice texture and is quickly delivered.</li>

            <li> and she is also seeing a difference!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the cream smells great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It works quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply and smells good.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that Finulite absorbs quickly and smells great.  </li>
            <li> I maintain my healthy weight, work out, eat right and take very good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I also, love that its animal cruelty free!!</li>
            <li> Excellent so far!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different creams and supplements for cellulite and have not been impressed by any of them, but I have noticed quite a remarkable improvement in my cellulite since using the Finulite.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to more Finulite.....and more results!</li>
            <li> It is very smooth to apply and smells nice.</li>
            <li> As for how it feels on, very light, not sticky or oily, and moisturizes without \\&quot;sticking\\&quot;, spreads on nice.</li>
            <li> As for how it feels on, very light, not sticky or oily, and moisturizes without \\&quot;sticking\\&quot;, spreads on nice.</li>
            <li> this is great stuff and smells wonderful unlike other anti cellulite creams.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how happy I am with the results I&#x27;ve seen from using my first set of bottles!</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t saw much in the way of losing inches, this product is very good for moisterizing your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I am amazed with all the positive review!!!!</li>
            <li> and wow what an awesome difference!!!</li>
            <li> They were more effective than I thought.</li>
            <li> By far the best product for cellulite.  </li>
            <li> and I also felt better circulation and a warm feeling on my legs.</li>
            <li> I will keep it up because I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li> As far as anything can help improve the appearance of cellulite (and I&#x27;ve used a lot of things), this product is about the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very happy with the changes so far.</li>
            <li> Even cheap products can astonish you when they have good ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the reduction of my waistline so far.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and I have seen amazing results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to be keeping a good diet while using the product.</li>
            <li> This one I have noticed is much more effective.</li>
            <li> So results aside, I am going to tell you the best things about this product so far.</li>
            <li> This product has shown me the best results so far.  </li>
            <li> This by far is the best product I have found.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product...smells great...feels nice...</li>
            <li> It was important to me that I knew someone who used finulite and loved it</li>
            <li> year I tried The Body Shop&#x27;s Spa Fit collection, which seemed to work (but not as good as Finulite)</li>
            <li> If I am to continue to use a product it has to be more effective than this.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll see what happens in the meantime, I&#x27;m hoping but seeing as cellulite hasn&#x27;t been able to be effectively treated by any product</li>
            <li> I have to admit that it has been the most effective anti-cellulite combat I have come across.</li>
            <li> Will buy again, helped tone up the skin after having 2 babies, which then made me more comfortable in my own skin!</li>
            <li> My wife says she would use it just for the smell, as it is very captivating, better than most if not all perfumed skin lotions I have smelled, no alcohol scent at all either.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a nice texture, it smells good, absorbs quickly and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Great when used with working out and eating right.</li>
            <li> Now is so easy to squeeze!.</li>
            <li> I will definetly continue using this easy product!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE !</li>
            <li> and I looked great in my bathing suit and got so many compliments thanks to Finulite!!</li>
            <li> and I love all natural products and this lotion is the best!!</li>
            <li> This product is non-greasy and it absorbs quickly into the skin, not forgetting that it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it on its own without proper diet and exercise.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite creams and Finulite by far is the very best, I will continue to use it and recommend to everyone I know who is looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> and I am super excited about my beach trip this summer!!!</li>
            <li> great product...recieved it very fast.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and my husband even noticed a difference the first time I was using it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results and am ready for my trip!</li>
            <li> The best product ever, I tried different cellulite lotions so far the best!</li>
            <li> I saw a great difference in my thighs and stomach just after my first order.  </li>
            <li> believe the great reviews---Finally, a product that really shows results!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, absorbs really fast, and WORKS!</li>
            <li> Too good to be true</li>
            <li> I am a very fit 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like a very cheap lotion and doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very smooth and feels silky (not sticky) when it goes on.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really happy about trying more than one product for day and night and should have followed my instincts in the first place.</li>
            <li> If so, I strongly advise caution if trying this product when you are taking any kind of medication.</li>
            <li> First let me say I really liked the scent and the non-greasy feel, but I didn&#x27;t pay thirty dollars for a good smelling lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fragance is good, it absorbs quickly as well...</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good, and in conjuncture with results it is nice to find a product that I believe in.</li>
            <li> This product works very effectively when used consistently as directed.  </li>
            <li> I have to say too that I think diet, exercise and drinking lots of water is very important in conjunction with this product to develop even better results.</li>
            <li> Are you doing something to them?&amp;#34;  Its not a miracle cream that will get rid of every bit of cellulite, but it certainly does a GREAT job of minimizing it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order some more tomorrow..</li>
            <li> Customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> There is a notable reduction in cellulite although not 100%.  </li>
            <li> and I love it, it in not a miracle of course</li>
            <li> its really nice to wear something and feel totally comfortable.</li>
            <li> am pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> I love that there is an AM and PM bottle.</li>
            <li> (love it)</li>
            <li> I bought cause many people recommended it but still wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s gonna work.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much better then before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it another try for another month but will start using a massager with it to see it works better.</li>
            <li> I got to the lowest weight I could with still being healthy, and</li>
            <li> Love this product helps with the soap too more results you see.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> AS SOON I FINISH THIS PRODUCT ,,AND THEN I WILL GIVE YOU A MORE ACCURATE REVIEW ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li> I have tried many, MANY cellulite products, procedures and treatments.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not awful either</li>
            <li> I noticed better results once I started doing this.</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams before this.</li>
            <li> Note: I have not increased amount of excercise since beginning use of this product, but I&#x27;m sure it will help boost your results.</li>
            <li> Then I purchased it for myself twice and used it whenever I had an important event, including my own wedding.</li>
            <li> I still use them as I think it&#x27;s more of a long-term effect rather than immediate.</li>
            <li> I thought with all the good reviews it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> I saw better results within two days of using this product than a month of finulite.</li>
            <li> The smell was okay, but you can get better smelling and more moisturizing lotion anywhere for 1/5 the price.</li>
            <li> I like Evelyn Cosmetics product better.</li>
            <li> It smells okay</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> If I did it twice a day, as instructed, I&#x27;m sure my results would be even better.</li>
            <li> I Love this product have ordered 3x.</li>
            <li> I am gonna go ahead with 2 and 2 more</li>
            <li> im getting more</li>
            <li> i love this product</li>
            <li> My legs look alot more toned and It gives me a lot more confidence.</li>
            <li> best part is my husband can see a big difference on how my legs look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost count of how many miracle creams i&#x27;ve bought to try and tackle my cellulite problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy and will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> and it costs a lot more..</li>
            <li> It smells ok but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here to buy one more round--i&#x27;m going abroad for a month in May</li>
            <li> You had better do massage after applying the product.</li>
            <li> Expecially 2 pronounced dimples on the top of 1 leg.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works fabulously!</li>
            <li> more veggies and more water), bikram yoga</li>
            <li> Great product it really works</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing even better results and will update when I finish the bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy even after all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I for sure recommend using with the mitt.</li>
            <li> I just ordered 3 more months supply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing mesotherapy, corporal massages, eating healthy walking 3 times a week and using this.</li>
            <li> I guess for better results</li>
            <li> Not a miracle worker but does ok.</li>
            <li> , they are smoother and have given me more confident for wearing shorts again.</li>
            <li> Much better than others</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be trying to sell these instead of risking more dimples.  </li>
            <li> The doctor told me it would contour my legs and butt more, and help reduce the appearance of my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results whit way cheaper products.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> What can be better than this???</li>
            <li> I would not even wear shorts unless they went to my knees, but I will gladly show off my shorty-shorts any time now.</li>
            <li> While my cellulite isn&#x27;t gone, I can say that after 6 weeks the depth of my dimples is improved and my skin is smoother and more taut in those areas where I apply the cream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is going to magically eliminate your cellulite, but I think it can improve the appearance of problem areas.</li>
            <li> this product was ok.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I use the product most of the time as directed</li>
            <li> It still seems to look better than before I started.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m reordering some more today.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what i thought was going to happen when i purchased this</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I eat healthy, workout 4-5 times a week and had a bit of cellulite that I could notice.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this product works wonders.</li>
            <li> You must keep a healthy diet too and drink plenty of water.</li>
            <li> love the scent of it, almost could eat it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not too sure this is working.</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite on and off for over a year and it works wonders, and when combined with diet and exercise its even better.</li>
            <li> heating up,  makes me sweat allot more,  </li>
            <li> I love the mitt also,  </li>
            <li> she enjoys using it more than competing products.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to Finulite as in my opinion it works the best.  </li>
            <li> My thighs feel firmer, my dimples are no longer as prominent, and I can just tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;I think that with continuous use, the dimples I have left will be 99.99% gone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Finulite, for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> im definiltly going to order more.</li>
            <li> She says she doesn&#x27;t even try to look for something different since this product works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Did not do much more than moisturize.  </li>
            <li> If you are going to try Finulite, make sure to decide about the refund before 60 days from the purchase date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more and will update on progress.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> With regular exercise and good diet this product works great.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin is much better.</li>
            <li> I say give it a try, the price is a lot more cheaper than then</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t choose anything else :)</li>
            <li> The skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It seems to work quicker on the dimples more than the ripples.</li>
            <li> I think I had more cellulite than this product could handle.</li>
            <li> and it is one of the better cellulite creams I have used.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when it was confirmed for me that this product works!  </li>
            <li> but I do recommend to use this when you do workouts,if you truly want this product to be supra magical</li>
            <li> It works OK I guess, but it has a perfume type odor that I and others could smell when wearing it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and I will be purchasing more in the future, as I am almost out.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> My cellulite continues to get better.  </li>
            <li> my legs look alot better.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fantastic!</li>
            <li> If you have time to detox area before use (scrub/brush) even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably going to give it away because I&#x27;ve found another product that works so much better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how most everyone who reviewed this stuff gave it 5 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> When rubbed in vigorously with the massager it definitely works best and results are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> however the best part about this product is that it actually works!!!  </li>
            <li> And yes in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise program you will get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This customer stated that he got better results after one month with this combination than the lotion alone.</li>
            <li> The Vichy lotions for cellulite are much better...</li>
            <li> I read the results get better the longer you use it</li>
            <li> Make sure to stick with it</li>
            <li> and I was more confident to wear shorts during summer.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and hope I see even greater improvement.</li>
            <li> I love that it blends into the skin and does not leave a greasy feel</li>
            <li> and I had to order more.</li>
            <li> I will say that I love the way both AM and PM lotions smell (esp AM),</li>
            <li> You are better off doing something else.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if there were more product one would see results.</li>
            <li> I loved from the minute I put it on my legs were soft and smooth and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> This product combined with working out and a healthy diet is helping me achieve the look I want.  </li>
            <li> I ordered again and I will continue using for more results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My legs are a lot smoother &amp; more toned looking.  </li>
            <li> I have used many of the Nivea products.</li>
            <li> I love the two separate lotions to work on one problem.</li>
            <li> legs looks better and I am buying more because I can see the difference</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Smells really good and fresh on.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and fresh on.</li>
            <li> I love the way it seems to tighten up the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love to wear it in summer with shorts or skirts</li>
            <li> After reading really good reviews on this product I knew it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help with my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I used one bottle of the night and day creams but didn&#x27;t feel like wanting more.</li>
            <li> Love it .</li>
            <li> do think this product would work better if in jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a forever customer, unless someone develops a magic pill.</li>
            <li> It smoothed out most everything, minimizing my cellulite appearance but it did not get rid of it, just made it look 90% better.  </li>
            <li> Thankyou for such a great cellulite treatment!!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d tried several products, but this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> The title should say it all but more words are required.</li>
            <li> I like it ok.  </li>
            <li> After all the great reviews I was execting too much</li>
            <li> I wish I could purchase more than 8oz.</li>
            <li> im sure</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more because of the results.</li>
            <li> I used these for 3-4 weeks and they did work ok.</li>
            <li> Great smell, fast absortion.</li>
            <li> and I put it on many areas of my body.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and deserves a definite 5 Star Rating!</li>
            <li> so glad i tried this.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice and is smooth on the skin</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t have aminophylline, it has the sister compound theophylline which is supposed to be more potent.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have bought cream at walmart that work better than this, even coconut oil does.</li>
            <li> And still getting better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to spending my summer showing off my cellulite free legs!</li>
            <li> but l have to say Works :).  </li>
            <li> It firms your skin up for sure.</li>
            <li> I would definitely by more.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and texture of both creams.  </li>
            <li> I love it-</li>
            <li> it ensures I&#x27;m able to see my muscles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare with others, but I love this one</li>
            <li> :) Would recommend to friends for sure.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much better then before.  </li>
            <li> I love that there is an AM and PM bottle.</li>
            <li> I read most reviews about it before I order.</li>
            <li> I think works better than any cream.</li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs fast - just like scented body lotion.</li>
            <li> Even my daughter noticed that my legs look better.</li>
            <li> I would saw that it is better then nothing, and I will probably use it again in a month or two to keep my legs in shape until I find some permanent solution for the cellulite.</li>
            <li> The difference was a smoother and more hydrated look.</li>
            <li> The packaging is lovely and it smells divine.</li>
            <li> The skin feels smoother and a bit more toned.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent of these products is lovely.</li>
            <li> Spend time eating healthy and exercising because that truly works.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Not all of the cellulite is gone, but I feel better about it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I researched the ingredients to make sure there weren&#x27;t any cancer causing stuff in finulite.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product has work for me</li>
            <li> This is one of the better cellulite creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased and have used this cream for many months now.  </li>
            <li> watching somewhat better what I eat.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Planning to use it with the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt  to see more effect.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> And when I continued to use it I was feeling better that I was doing something to getting rid of my cellulite(which</li>
            <li> I love the ingredient list and how it smells, took awhile to get used to</li>
            <li> but I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> overall, this is a wonderful cellulite cream,</li>
            <li> I think its for emphasizing putting on the cremes twice a day, but to me it also seems that they can sell two bottles for more money than just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells amazing and makes my legs so smooth.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the soap and brush to help aid the cream and was pleased with results.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and looks better, more glowing.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it every day morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I use them after showering &amp; it takes just a couple minutes, at most.</li>
            <li> I noticed more definition and tone in my legs.</li>
            <li> My husband also liked the light citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> The title says it all, this product works alright, but I had significantly better results with the Bliss products.</li>
            <li> I would like a more thorough explanation of how its used in this product specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another note is that aminophylline is theophylline + 2 ethylenediamine and this formulation makes theophylline more water soluble - I suppose for medicinal purposes to increase solubility and therefore bio-availability (google it).</li>
            <li> but I think diet and exercises work better for me.</li>
            <li> Glad though that it works for some people.</li>
            <li> As cellulite is probably mostly genetic</li>
            <li> really LOVE the smell the lotions so even if it doesn&#x27;t work with the cellulite</li>
            <li> And Ive Tried MANY Products&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have not paid attention to see if my cellulite has diminished, but I do love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many of my friends and I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this to see if my legs get even better.  </li>
            <li> think all this work better together that believe that you will get that you want sit on the couch doing nothing.</li>
            <li> I think that I would defiantly see better results</li>
            <li> My skin became more tighter and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Despite working out (lifting weights &amp; cardio), I&#x27;ve struggled with cellulite for many years.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bit more considering their web site</li>
            <li> was so convincing.</li>
            <li> creams smells lovely and I would buy this over and over again!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>
            <li> but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Maybe in 6 more months my cellulite will disappear?  </li>
            <li> So I just order two more sets.</li>
            <li> so maybe this month I will have more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may order one more time just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help me with the cellulite on my gluts but have had no luck.</li>
            <li> and it is condensed more into one area.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have seen many 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I notice best results when I use in combination with regular body brushing and bellabaci cups.</li>
            <li> :) Now I also paired it with exercise and trying to eat healthy</li>
            <li> They both fit in one of my hands!</li>
            <li> this is one of many tightening products that i have invested in.  </li>
            <li> the price is more than nivea</li>
            <li> but it works a lot better than nivea...</li>
            <li> Ok, whatever.</li>
            <li> I continued to use it for the remainder of the month and reordered more</li>
            <li> I think that combining it with my weekly workout schedule is definitely the best way to go.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the derma roller because many reviewers suggested it.  </li>
            <li> I continued with the cream though and after about 2 more weeks I started seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li> Will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just slap it on and expect it to work magic.</li>
            <li> so if I see any more of a difference after using it another month I&#x27;ll write another review.</li>
            <li> and I am highly satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve had cellulite since I was 12.</li>
            <li> It seems too easy and too good to be true, but I&#x27;m feeling adventurous.</li>
            <li> I workout and eat right but was really hoping for the best that was not delivered.</li>
            <li> I was really good during my pregnancy with eating right, and I even exercised up until I was 8 month along.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, but this product earned it!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this product and was very excited about getting it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited about using this product again.</li>
            <li> But the change in formula isn&#x27;t as effective as the original.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product 3 times already and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Drink water and sweat after applying the AM cream and lay flat w/ the PM cream for best results.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> And someone having excellent results with an anti cellulite product when they had very very little cellulite to begin with isn&#x27;t surprising.</li>
            <li> Because I am very sceptical when it comes to creams and potions, these numbers are pretty impressive for me.  </li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase would  highly recommend</li>
            <li> Now, in my 40s the problem is becoming even more visible.</li>
            <li> This cream is affordable and works awesome as long as you keep using it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest giving it a try - good luck ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, soft, and</li>
            <li> hope it continues to work as good as the first time i applied it,  </li>
            <li> I use pretty good pressure when I massage in for 5 or 6 min each leg.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive at first because I thought that an inexpensive treatment could not be as good as they claimed.</li>
            <li> I have gotten into a pretty good routine of using the mitt in the shower, then following-up with the AM/ PM cream when I get out of the</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and is so easy to apply!</li>
            <li> smells wonderful, and doesnt irritate my sensitive skin, does EXACTLY what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Lotion smells nice and lasts a little over a month, so you may have to reorder for best results.</li>
            <li> and I am excited to see the results!</li>
            <li> Still there- but significant improvement!</li>
            <li> The cellulite has diminshed significantly!</li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed a huge difference, now a month later I am happily looking at my legs in the mirrror!</li>
            <li> Second of all it smells great and the ingredient content is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo glad I chose these products, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love how it does not feel greasey and abosorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I feel healthy and much more fit</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves skin looking and feeling very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It is by far the most effective cellulite cream out there! :)</li>
            <li> First, it smells wonderful and makes your skin incredibly soft and lovely.</li>
            <li> I liked this product from the very first day.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I got better results with this product, eating right,</li>
            <li> That said, I am stocking up on Finulite after I write this because the first shipment of 3 sets I purchased expire 11/2016, which is a great, long shelf-life, and I want to make sure I cover my bases for this summer and beyond....plus the price point is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other creams and gels, but I&#x27;m impressed with the results I&#x27;m achieving using Finulite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other products and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> It is also nice that the day time absorbs quickly because if I wear pants to work then they go on easily.</li>
            <li> It is very good smell, just now I received it ,I applied it on the area that have a cellulite, and I wait the result through the next days</li>
            <li> Anytime I want to look a bit better in shorts or a swim suit, 30 days makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Sure beats the huge price and no-guarantees of the alternatives.</li>
            <li> It smells great but as far as decreasing or eliminating cellulite; I don&#x27;t see the changes.  </li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any kind of &amp;#34;cellulite cream&amp;#34; on the Internet, and I have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working great so far.</li>
            <li> I have combined a well balanced diet and workout with the product and so far I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product for a great price.  </li>
            <li> The company genuinely cares if their customers are satisfied?</li>
            <li> The Finulite creams and the Finulite massage mitt have made my arms look smooth - making them look more defined.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on some of the feedback and so far its been working great.</li>
            <li> I believed the reviews but am learning that many no name companies give free products, etc... for ppsitive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am happy so far</li>
            <li> Knowing realistically that cellulite can&#x27;t really ever fully disappear, this product is about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what a month does.it smells  nice, and its worth the money to give it a try.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use that much, just a dime sized amount for problem areas, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> price is reasonable as well, 30 days treatment supply and good</li>
            <li> Really dammm good cream it has worked so well for me</li>
            <li> The new ballet barre video effective!</li>
            <li> Overall, good product, and would recommend using in conjunction with exercise and good, clean diet.</li>
            <li> The product smelled great, was very easy to apply and made my legs super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> for many people  I&#x27;m excited to use</li>
            <li> Works best in conjunction with other methods, I think it speeds up the results you see from drinking your water and excersizing.</li>
            <li> Finulite gave me the best results out of any other cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> That sounds like a lot more fun!</li>
            <li> Smells good and pleasant afterwards unlike some other creams that you want to rinse off after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Because it is a two step product, it is easy to forget some applications.</li>
            <li> Have tried it, has an orange smell, cream easily absorbs into skin.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to add into my nightly/morning routines.</li>
            <li> It easily fits into my am and pm routine.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply.</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be an easy fix.  </li>
            <li> Every body is different and I&#x27;m happy it has worked for so many</li>
            <li> Yet it is easy to spread on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In only two weeks, my legs look so much better, smoother, and my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> After only a week of using finulite and the mitt along with healthy diet and going to the gym ; I can already see great results.</li>
            <li> I just wanted an easy fix.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company, Kandance responded very quickly and sent the correct product out promptly.  </li>
            <li> but it becomes an easy routine.  </li>
            <li> It was so easy to add to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many products for reducing the appearance of cellulite and am happy to of found one that finally works!</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant at purchasing the product because it seemed too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product to everybody who has a problem with cellulite.</li>
            <li> Awesome product this stuff really works would definitely buy more from this place an fast shipment so you looking for a good celliute cream</li>
            <li> I tried so many cellulite creams but this one is really special.</li>
            <li> First off this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells great, not like most cellulite creams currently on the market and its goes on smoothly without an oily affect...</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty freakin amazing.  </li>
            <li> This treatment is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> You have to be patient and consistent with your routine, cellulite didnt build over night and it will not disappear over night,but you will see amazing results (for me</li>
            <li> My cellulite even after 5 months of clean eating and weight training had only improved from a stage 4 to a mild 3 at best.</li>
            <li> but it certainly makes me legs a lot smoother!!!  </li>
            <li> I use exactly as directed and have noticed a significant improvement on my legs!!</li>
            <li> The texture is very rich and easy to apply, and the smell of the product is light and sweet smelling which I feel is just as important.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am always more confident in shorts and a bathing suit when I&#x27;ve been consistent with applying my Finulite.</li>
            <li> I was using this product with the massage mitt and was working just fine</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a wonderful product ; )</li>
            <li> the dimples are less noticeable and the smell is wonderful .</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and combined with massage twice a day it really seems to work.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, works with massage but not as quickly as Avon did.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Besides helping with the cellulite it leaves my skin very soft and has a good smell.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is so super easy to apply with a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant odor, and it smooths and softens your skin  as well (better than regular lotion).  </li>
            <li> Product has a pleasant smell and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light, fresh smell</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it had exactly what I was looking for - Theophylline, a very strong Xanthine.</li>
            <li> I am now onto my third bottle and I am very satisfied with the result!</li>
            <li> The End to Cellulite AM/PM (8 oz)]] IS the best cellulite cream I&#x27;ve ever used hands down!  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve observed a huge improvement in my legs.</li>
            <li> have used Finullite on my tights and arms, and I have noticed improvements after 2 weeks and a huge difference after 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s huge to me.</li>
            <li> More effective in combination with Soft Bathing Body Massage Brush.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in my skin</li>
            <li> this worked to really smooth out my thighs.</li>
            <li> Product does make your skin tighten and smooth.  </li>
            <li> so the surface of the skin could then smooth out</li>
            <li> But worth every penny:)</li>
            <li> It helps keep my leg area feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I can now fit into jeans</li>
            <li> I thought I would try it because the cost was so cheap.</li>

            <li> Fantastic product-and believe me-I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> my legs are visibly free of cellulite.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin firmer and smooth.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) worth buying.</li>
            <li> Along with my order, I received a note from Finulite, which states if you like and rate the product with 5 stars, you will be added to a draw for free products.    </li>
            <li> All it does is make your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> It progressed to the point where I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing skirts or shorts.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me, and I almost killed him for doing so - LOL!!</li>
            <li> Now I feel comfortable in shorts again.  </li>
            <li> but it had such great ratings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use it morning and night to see results, but you will.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Finulite AM?Pm for the last three months and have seen great results.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;HIGHLY&amp;#34; recommend for anyone looking to smooth out and get rid of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> It has a light smell I and the silky cream itself goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> I took my vitamins, &amp; applied my Vitamin A/ Retinol Cream throughout the day available at any drug store.</li>
            <li> This is the third set of Finulite I use, and I am completely happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Now I know why it had such great views.  </li>
            <li> The skin in the area is smooth and without bumps I used to get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue with this amazing duo and recommend it to anyone looking for a product that really works.</li>

            <li> but it is also important that in doesn&#x27;t have any cancer causing ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does soften, smooth and minimize the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> We have a very close relationship and he gives his honest feedback.</li>
            <li> This product is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I am eager to see how great my skin can look after further usage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now &amp; have noticed a great improvement!</li>
            <li> In one month I felt completely comfortable In my bikini</li>
            <li> I had read some fabulous reviews about this cream</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> I am really fit, but still have cellulite.  </li>
            <li> the second order she was so happy about the results........</li>
            <li> Not only works great for cellulite, but it mosturizes</li>
            <li> My cellulite wasn&#x27;t severe, just a light dimpling to my thighs and butt.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m supposed to be getting another set free by writing this review</li>
            <li> I heard most cellulite products stink, buut this one has a lite scent that actually smells really good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> and wow this stuff is good.</li>
            <li> I am feeling good about it so far.</li>
            <li> My legs aren&#x27;t perfect, but there is so much improvement that I am actually wearing shorts that I have never had the confidence to wear before</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really soft also and has a good smell.</li>
            <li> Good old fashion exercise is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have used both as directed- morning &amp; night, and there had been no result- not even a good moisturizing action.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a great company with a terrific product, it&#x27;s nice to find something that really works.  </li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t been a miracle but still using it so far so good</li>
            <li> So far Finulite has worked and smells good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Another plus is the bottles are attractive and have the easy to use flip top, and the bright pink and purple colors will surely make it easier to remember which is night and day, and as someone who has used different \\&quot;night and day\\&quot; formula remedies, I can say that usually those work the best.</li>
            <li> It also has a very pleasant smell and it sinks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> The texture is just right, it spreads, sticks and absorbs well and the smell is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered more Finulite on Amazon right away.  </li>
            <li> The product also smells very good and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin like other creams.</li>
            <li> I hope all is well since most of the reviews are so positive!</li>
            <li> Finulite does smell great, but I ended up liking the other product better...</li>
            <li> A good value for a cream that&#x27;s effective when compared to other creams on the market</li>
            <li> Really works!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after the first week!!</li>
            <li> It really does!!!</li>
            <li> This product really works!!!</li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t noticed much difference!!!</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of time to use the mitt, but very worth it.</li>
            <li> It smells great, makes your skin soft and think all 3; together are the triple threat :) highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband has noticed the difference in my legs and said it is barely noticable now:):):)</li>
            <li> I wish that the dispenser top could be modified so that it didn&#x27;t clog up after sev uses, but I&#x27;m happy enough with the product, compared to others, that I&#x27;m willing to overlook that.</li>
            <li> The quality, cheap price and results make it all worth while!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for quick and great service.  </li>
            <li> Dries very quickly and product was packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use (just like applying lotion) and you see fast results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I HIGHLY recommend it..</li>
            <li> Very very useful，We brought 5 for friends and we&#x27;ll buy 3 more.</li>
            <li> Essentially, I have more even skin, the tightening effect is visibly noticeable and it definitively makes me more comfortable and confident while wearing a bathing suit.  </li>
            <li> I am a research scientist, getting my PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology, and I can say that I very much like the ingredients in this product and am enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the special massage brush working in lightly with knuckles worked for me.</li>
            <li> and I was super stoked when my very blunt and honest girlfriend of mine said, &amp;</li>
            <li> My skin is super smooth and 80% free of cellulite.</li>
            <li> nothing special, paid a lot of money for something that smells pretty good but does absolutely nothing for the Cellulite...</li>
            <li> The results are noticeable in a week or a few weeks, depending how diligent you are In addition, it has very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I used to be pretty self conscience wearing shorts but after using this product for a couple of weeks it gave me a HUGE confidence boost!</li>
            <li> It is worth a shot to try!  </li>
            <li> I can notice a significant difference in the apperance on my orange peel skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products before, but this  is a first time when the expectations did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Its worth a shot!</li>
            <li> The cellulite in that area has diminished significantly within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> am by no means overweight, but - as I imagine most of you reading this review - I have received the genetic curse of cellulite (gee, thanks mom!).</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin felt smoother after just one week, and with consistent use I could see more results after about one month.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was excited to try this product because of the reviews I read however</li>
            <li> I have been using this product diligently for a little over a month on my butt and thighs and can honestly say that my celulite IS going away!!  </li>
            <li> I have tried ALLOT  of cellulite creams on the market, first of all I love how there is an a.m. and p.m. cream.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for someone who doesn&#x27;t have significant amount of cellulite.</li>
            <li> when you stop the appearance returns but it is well worth the effort!</li>
            <li> After the first week or two, I wasn&#x27;t sure that I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original formula and found it reduced my cellulite appearance.</li>
            <li> The creams work ok, but they got my skin pretty greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far</li>
            <li> Although it is priced higher than the other products, I still feel that it is the best value of the creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> But when my first month&#x27;s supply was up, I decided to give it one more month&#x27;s chance.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product</li>
            <li> I have seen some changes its worth a try !</li>
            <li> I started to see a difference after about 4 weeks and a significant difference after 2 months.</li>
            <li> I work out 4 or 5 days a week and eat pretty healthy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant decrease in my cellulite in my three months of using it.  </li>
            <li> I have lost a significant amount of weight</li>
            <li> If you consistently use them, keep exercise and eat healthy, you will see the change.</li>
            <li> So Excited To Keep On Using</li>
            <li> At this price it is worth a shot!</li>
            <li> and I am confident the results will only continue to get better!</li>
            <li> I am usually a sceptic when it comes to all of these \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; creams but decided to give this one a try because all of the great reviews!</li>
            <li> It smells fine, kind of medicinal, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been working as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> It will definitely serve you well to make sure you are keeping your sugars and carbs to a minimum and eating the right foods, drinking plenty of water and getting a good multivitamin in every day.</li>
            <li> I have tried different creams before, and I think this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I found them most effective in the upper arms area and my stomach.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands and this one is by far the best one in the market.</li>
            <li> I work out and eat clean but cellulite, as you know is stubborn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot, especially for it&#x27;s great price, so give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin super smooth, but cellulite is a bitch to get rid of even with exercise</li>
            <li> My butt is tighter and we both love it :) It hasn&#x27;t completely evaporated all of my cellulite</li>
            <li> #34;Wow, your legs are looking super smooth.</li>
            <li> , I forgot to mention that this cream absorbs wonderfully fast and completely and smells great.</li>
            <li> I eat clean, drink lots of water and exercise about four times a week</li>
            <li> The cream has a light smell and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> i havent see any difference, the only good thing is that leave you skin smooth...</li>
            <li> The creams smell great not like most others I have wasted money on.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of Finullite, it feels very hydrating and smooth as it absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast and I was excited to see it in the mailbox so soon!</li>
            <li> I thought for sure with all of the positive reviews that this would work.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this product as I have read so many positive reviews on it.  </li>
            <li> By there being so many positive reviews for Finulite, it gave me the confidence to order the product, and I would say 50% of this product is using it</li>
            <li> just wanted to add 1 more positive review for Finulite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon and read many positive reviews</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my old stretch marks were looking better too!</li>
            <li> With finulite you feel your skin really nourished with the first application, the smell is great and it is a very convenient format</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice and makes your skin feel soft but that&#x27;s about all!  </li>
            <li> You will see results right away which greatly improve over time and prevent future cellulite.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> very surprised and very pleased, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The purple PM has a fantastic, clean, and light smell and while the Pink AM isn&#x27;t my type of fragrance it is still pleasant.</li>
            <li> my skin was right after the massage!</li>
            <li> I use the lotion as recommended, as soon as I get up and right before bedtime!</li>
            <li> As previously mentioned by another reviewer it is easy to use and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, and I really need it to keep cellulite away.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the cost, I&#x27;d use this as a full body lotion.</li>
            <li> (I walk on the treadmill 3-5 times a week on full incline), So I can&#x27;t 100% say that it is the cream, but I do see some improvement in the 2 weeks I have used it.</li>
            <li> what i wouldn&#x27;t do is buy the creams &amp; not the mitt as like i said it&#x27;s the mitt that&#x27;s really doing the work :).</li>
            <li> not 1.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles (must to say that that is true for ALL creams).</li>
            <li> I am hoping that combining it with body brushing, a good diet and lots of water will finally result in a reduction of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I was looking around for stretch mark creams and many sounded promising.</li>
            <li> and I just love how much it smooths my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> : I WAS GIVEN A FULL REFUNDED...</li>
            <li> It smells good when you open the cap.</li>
            <li> I would recommend SWEAT SWEET instead of this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is light and fresh so using it at night doesn&#x27;t keep you awake because of the fragrance being so strong.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate if it worked since I wasn&#x27;t able to apply it.</li>
            <li> I have been a true believer of this product</li>
            <li> At this rate, I might be able to wear shorts again really soon&lt;</li>
            <li> I was really good about using the AM daily but for the PM I may have skipped a couple Saturday nights.  </li>
            <li> I started using this to get ready for summer hoping to be able to wear shorts with confidence.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my legs in cool water to tone the skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years and this one really seems to diminish the appearance of cellulite bumps.  </li>
            <li> people only give this a good review because when it arrives it comes with a piece of paper saying &amp;#34;GIVE US</li>
            <li> so I think be sure and get that too to really see the effects.</li>
            <li> i got it for my girlfriend for the second time and she is saying some results you have to use it every day with good diet and exercise</li>
            <li> Most of them without much change.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my skin so soft, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even good as basic lotion.</li>
            <li> My legs are so much smoother and appear much more toned.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain :)</li>
            <li> Thanks you too :-)</li>
            <li> I noticed an awesome improvement to my trouble areas in no time when I used this as recommended, and not only did it get rid of the embarrassing bumps, it also had ingredients in it that my skin (KP aka &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) LOVED.</li>
            <li> I work out regularly and am in good shape.  </li>
            <li> However, I would advise to use in conjunction with exercise and a sensible diet, which created a solid combination for me for good results.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a bit more time consuming to get ready in the morning and for bed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several creams that claimed to get rid of cellulite for good, but never had any luck with them.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple good reviews, I decided to try for myself.</li>
            <li> Love Finulite, it&#x27;s getting me ready for spring❤</li>
            <li> I decided to try this not bad for the price and after reading reviews I did</li>
            <li> But not a bad product</li>
            <li> Win win.&lt;br /&gt;Update #1 - 24 hours later: Skin feels a little bit tighter yet softer, very nice feeling.</li>
            <li> It made the cellulite disappear and left skin looking smooth within a week of my first use, it also has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> You have to be consistent and make sure you use both the am and pm product daily, but if you do, you will love the results!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews others have posted on this product and was so happy and excited to finally see a cream that really seemed to work for people.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap compared to your alternatives, it has all the right ingredients and it works just as described.</li>
            <li> the morning, I used the derma-roller with strong force ( the first time my eyes were practically watering)</li>
            <li> Anywho, to those who are fit already use it and it has the same affects: tightens,makes skin soft,and has a lovely smell to it!</li>
            <li> I think finding something to completely obliterate the dimply scourge would be as rare as unicorn tears and Pegasus feathers, that being said this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with some other cellulite treatments and I&#x27;ve seen great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple other cellulite products but decided to give this one a try after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> this works so amazingly well, and its way better than your higher priced products of the same type!</li>
            <li> I made sure to rub my stomach with alcohol pads to rid of any excess dirt before applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 30 days, I noticed an honest 20% decrease in the appearance of the stretch marks, the cellulite \\&quot;deep indentations,\\</li>
            <li> receiving my dermaroller in the mail from amazon and a fresh order of Finulite cream, I was excited to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also a great value compared to other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> Like any other product where we want to see great results, weight loss has to play a role in reducing visible cellulite in problemed areas.</li>
            <li> The finulite works pretty good, you don&#x27;t see major changes, but you do get results.</li>
            <li> quick delivery too</li>
            <li> I received the package quick, and started using it immediately.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would help with the bit of cellulite I got while pregnant.</li>
            <li> The ratings and reviews of Finulite, many with before-and-after photos, were enough to convince me to hold off on spending thousands of dollars and try one more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price too for what you are getting - and the tubes are a lot more sanitary and much easier to handle than the typical jars you find out there.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream in conjunction with their massage mitt and it has made such wonderful improvements in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> The item shipped quickly as promised.</li>
            <li> Even with that, I&#x27;ve seen quick results.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping tremendously.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m following a healthy diet on top</li>
            <li> So I REALLY wish I would have taken before pictures of myself, because when I looked today after a few weeks of using this I was REALLY happy!  </li>
            <li> i have never been pregnant</li>
            <li> It is part of my anti-cellulite fight now (exercise and 10 min quick massage).  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering, but mildly floral.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mit, and can&#x27;t wait to use it as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll make these products work even better.</li>
            <li> It can only get better from here  :-)</li>
            <li> My first impression is that it actually smells nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many drugstore and high end products but nothing works as well as this.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> It goes on cleanly and does not leave a greasy residue, so no prob with putting pants on right after application.</li>
            <li> This time around, I&#x27;m very pleased with my results and definitely see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I believe in this product in conjuncture with a VERY healthy diet, and regular exersize.  </li>
            <li> , I am really liking what I see and in case, I just ordered me some more because the price is very reasonable....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes my skin super soft the moment it is put on and keeps it that way all day!</li>
            <li> Once and awhile, something new or interesting will come on the market</li>
            <li> it actually smells pretty good...</li>
            <li> I also purchased the mitt, and I strongly recommend that for really getting the product worked into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I am in pretty good physical shape</li>
            <li> It takes me 1 minute to put on my problem areas and its fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I still had some cream from the first set left, so I could make a good</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re better off buying bliss fatgirlslim or clarins high definition body lift, overall it was just a nice moisturizer</li>
            <li> I recommend using it consistently for 4-6 weeks before giving up!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and let me just say that I have already noticed a pretty significant change in the tops of my thighs and butt..</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this product!</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd order and have no doubt I will order a 4th and more!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it!!!</li>
            <li> but in just the first week!</li>
            <li> I was so amazed to start seeing results within the first two weeks!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> On my second bottles and love seeing the results!</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first week of using it!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this stuff, because the reviews I read before I purchased it sounded promising.</li>
            <li> Received this product with my hopes up very high hoping i finally found a good product for my cellulite.</li>
            <li> My thighs are so smooth and the cellulite have reduces sooo much.</li>
            <li> I started using finulite a month ago, and wow huge results!  </li>
            <li> this is a amazing product i have only been using it for about 3 months</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff that works fast.</li>
            <li> I am aiming to be 100% free of cellulite and this product is really helping with that goal.  </li>
            <li> I am finding amazing results and I am now onto my second supply of Finulite.</li>
            <li> This product really works and I have seen a huge difference in the appearance of my thighs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> The morning one is better than the night one as far as smell.</li>
            <li> I am on my second month supply of finulite, and I am happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It looks like a natural tan AND it hides cellulite a lot better.</li>
            <li> it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> its definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> I started getting a bit of cellulite in my early 30s, but I was able to keep it at bay with body brushing and exercise.</li>
            <li> But I started to notice and feel my skin change, and am SO pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth a</li>
            <li> I use about one set per month and find the prodcut to be well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and is fast absorbing,</li>
            <li> So it can be costly but the benefits have been worth it.</li>
            <li> I would love to feel not so self conscious about how I look in my shorts this summer.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the bottles were bigger!</li>
            <li> The results you see will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for two weeks now and I absolutely love it, It helps diminish the look of cellulite and makes my skin soooo silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> Ladies be honest with yourself and read medical literature - no cream will reduce cellulite.</li>
            <li> This does take some dedication, but it is well worth it when you can see the difference yourself.</li>
            <li> Still worth a try.</li>
            <li> but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will completely disappear soon</li>
            <li> I have no idea if the product is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Who wants to keep spending more &amp; more money, only to find out, it still won&#x27;t do anything?</li>
            <li> I call that a success.</li>
            <li> It may not make it completely disappear, but I saw a big difference and I am really happy about it.</li>
            <li> This lotion also works just as good or  better than more expensive creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the deep dimples &amp; bulges will smooth away over time with continued use &amp; massage, healthy diet &amp; excercise.</li>
            <li> My cellulite was not incredibly horrible to begin with, but after a month, it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
            <li> it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> what if you could get the same kind of results by melting chocolate on your body?</li>
            <li> what if you could get the same kind of results by melting chocolate on your body?</li>
            <li> It was worth a try</li>
            <li> I Have Had Cellulite For Many YEars Since I Was Young</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is worth $30.</li>
            <li> (think Nivea in the blue pump), the scent is very light but pleasant and it moisturizes my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am more comfortable going out in shorts and not feel self-conscious among all the other cellulite free girls on my college campus.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel soft and smell nice, unlike other creams of this kind...</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this lotion much better than other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> The price is also a huge plus, compared to other products of its kind.  </li>
            <li> It helps to take a before picture because then you can tell how significant the progress really is.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually really good smelling lotion as opposed to the other chemically smelly cellulite treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> , right?)</li>
            <li> Just work out and eat right.</li>
            <li> Cellulite is stubborn fat buildup under the skin that takes time to get rid of but with the right products it can be done.</li>
            <li> I do all the right things:  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll see improvement right on the 1st week..</li>
            <li> Works right away and leaves my skin feeling softer and firmer.</li>
            <li> I work out and eat right</li>
            <li> I am also exercising diligently with Core Fusion and Jillian Michael&#x27;s videos and eating right.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> And this product didn&#x27;t work right away.  </li>
            <li> but you also have to eat right, work out etc.</li>
            <li> Although I am slim and I work out 4-5 times a week and eat right</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect change right away</li>
            <li> Now the bottle said it takes up to five weeks to start noticing the changes so of course the results didn&#x27;t show right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently found Sweet Sweat body cream to work better.</li>
            <li> so I ordered my own bottle recently and the shipment was super fast.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way both lotions smell- clean and citrus based.</li>
            <li> I wish to see more improvement on my thights where I have some major issues too.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 2 star rating because the lotions do smell amazing and make the area being massaged very smooth, but obviously if you lotion the same spot twice a day.. anything will make it smoother.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to improve the cellulite issues or tone &amp; smooth skin.</li>
            <li> i would really recommend it, specially if you use it with the smoothing massage mitt.</li>
            <li> It also made my skin super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing is that both lotions smell nice.</li>
            <li> Used for more than a month, sooner or later insist, may be effective, but it is really very obvious, run out to buy these four bottles will not be used again</li>
            <li> Finulite did, however, manage to make my butt smell like the sort of cheap, fruity fragrance normally found in lip gloss marketed to 12-year olds.</li>
            <li> My skin generally feels and looks better....</li>
            <li> But this product is worth the money as it really works!</li>
            <li> #1, it arrived FAST, packed well, and the bottles were 100% full, no skimping or under filling bottles here.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products over the years, but Finulite is by far the best because it actually works!</li>
            <li> I saw smoother and worth noting pump-free skin within the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> No bad reactions, price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Works quite nicely and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have loose skin and cellulite on my stomach and backs of my thighs and this cream with the finulite massager tightened the skin and made it smooth!!</li>
            <li> I read all the different reviews on here &amp; thought \\&quot;well this product has high positive post &amp; the price seems good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also eating very clean and exercising 6 days a week, so that plays a major role in this change.</li>
            <li> Come on people be smart!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work right away, but after consistent use for 4 weeks, I did notice a difference.</li>
            <li> It smells good, which is unusual for this type of cream, it absorbs into the skin well without any greasy residue, it leaves my skin feeling really soft, and most importantly, it is definitely improving the look of my cellulite, more than any other product like this that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I will certainly continue to use it as I already saw results in a month!  </li>
            <li> I certainly recomend it to any girl struggling with cellulite!</li>
            <li> I certainly will tommorow after applying the am lotion, before hopping on my elliptical!</li>
            <li> She mentioned that she really likes the scent, describing it as similar to grapefruit; it absorbs quickly (and goes on lightly); and it leaves her skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the subtle changes already that I immediately purchased 2 more orders of the set so that I would have it available without running out.</li>
            <li> Already my skin looks better - smoother, and more firm.</li>
            <li> The creams actually have a nice smell and are very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Before I got pregnant I weighed about 120lbs, and was very toned.  </li>
            <li> I would say I saw about a 40% improvement in the look of my skin after a few months of treatment, which is great because I really needed some help.  </li>
            <li> That sounds like a lot more fun!r after I use it longer -- and if there is interest I can find out how much theophylline is in natural chocolate.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Between this, eating more vegetables and drinking fresh vegetable juice, and vacuum massaging my butt and legs, it is working.  </li>
            <li> I exercise regularly and eat right for the most part</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t give up and realize that this kind of thing is not a very fast process.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivered.</li>
            <li> They take the time to instruct the customer on how to use it in the packaging, and it is priced in a very reasonable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It definitely dimishes the look of cellulite and leaves the area very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> but I have noticed,what other customers say, as it being more smooth.</li>
            <li> The seller, however, ships super fast and usually runs some kind of promotion (free gift, etc)</li>
            <li> Hey, this cream really works, though, and it does it fast!!</li>
            <li> Will work overtime with consistent use</li>
            <li> you just gotta be consistent.</li>
            <li> I have wasted a lot of money trying different products and this product has really made me happy!</li>
            <li> It worked almost from the first week.</li>
            <li> I have just finished the second bottle and the results are better than any cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried it all, and finulite really works!</li>
            <li> Will most definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> At first I saw no difference.</li>
            <li> My skin really looks it&#x27;s smoothest ever after these shower massages!  </li>
            <li> Thanks finūlite!  </li>
            <li> do not like the smell, which does resemble a sugary tween cosmetic, but that&#x27;s pretty inconsequential.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more sets my next go around.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still in love obviously if I&#x27;m still purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent in using this product.</li>
            <li> For real!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time when my friend offered it when we were bridesmaids.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be without it ;)</li>
            <li> It works but i believe in combination with the massage mitt same company works even better and faster.</li>
            <li> By itself it was ok, results were slightly moderate.</li>
            <li> I see results in a matter of weeks and most of the time I only put the cream on in the morning.</li>
            <li> Go on a diet first, then use the product.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> I definitely will purchase more as I want to keep the cellulite off.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I have tried it all, and this product really works well!</li>
            <li> I seen results in the first week.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to put some work and money into it, trust me it does work.</li>
            <li> After attempt of two other cellulite creams brand with no luck, so thought to give this another chance along with my purchase of massage mitt and it&#x27;s showing better result!</li>
            <li> This is my second order and so far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I noticed after a month of the cream the cellulite is not the first thing my eyes are drawn to in the mirror.</li>
            <li> but it most definitely diminishes it.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of this product, because it REALLY DOES WORK!</li>
            <li> The cream smells great and has a thick consistency</li>
            <li> Within the first month of using</li>
            <li> will say that I have been dieting and working out at the same time as using Finulite, so I am sure that has helped also..</li>
            <li> Before starting to research procedures, I decided to peruse Amazon for reviews of cellulite reduction products to be sure I hadn&#x27;t missed anything.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this item again if I ever need it, and I would like to add that it works better than the Nivea cellulite treatment, which in itself does work well.</li>
            <li> This product has done absolutely nothing for me!</li>
            <li> My legs are 10x softer now thanks to this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out, going to order some more next week.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> And to look hot in a bikini.</li>
            <li> : if I get rid of it, I&#x27;ll give Finulite five stars ;-)</li>
            <li> I noticed smoother, tighter thighs after the first application.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, and I am almost done with the bottles.  </li>
            <li> but you need to be consistent.</li>
            <li> I have had increasing amounts of cellulite on the back of my legs for more than a decade.</li>
            <li> I been putting the cream on fairly consistently twice a day for three or four weeks now, and I am amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will be able to get rid of it completely by next month.</li>
            <li> I will finish using the bottles and waiting for the next magic potion.</li>
            <li> You have to use it consistently however..</li>
            <li> She tried many different products including expensive ones and this product works the best.</li>
            <li> This product really really works!</li>
            <li> I have been told by so many different people that cellulite cream doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The Zaggora Hot Pants claim to boost your calorie burn and they do make one sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat convinced that the Hot Pants worn after applying the Finulite AM Cream create smoother legs...</li>
            <li> it just helped enhance everything and get rid of my cellulite that much quicker!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> Based on the results from the first use, i was expecting continued improvement.</li>
            <li> And I am an avid Amazon shopper.</li>
            <li> Used both am and pm cremes consistently for 30 days along with an increase in exercise.</li>
            <li> The price is inexpensive, so I have ordered more, and will continue to monitor progress for the next</li>
            <li> As I said I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks but really am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement during the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Finullite almost 4 months ago, and I have placed 2 more orders since then: it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product works, just follow the directions and be consistent</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s willing to do the work and not looking for immediate/next day results.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to try something else in addition to it.</li>
            <li> I have made my second reorder as I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of it</li>
            <li> just wish the bottles were bigger and more affordable but everything has a price tag, you either like it or you don&#x27;t....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in cellulite after consistent use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over six weeks on two different occasions and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and at first I had doubts .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was a skeptic at first.  </li>
            <li> Through consuming extremely healthy foods, diet, and exercise (4x cardio a week + 3x weights with the assistance of a Nutritionist &amp; Personal Trainer</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more when I get low.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a month now and for the first time I see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I will order again because I want to see if I will have better results next month.</li>
            <li> Finulite really boosted confidence and made a difference!</li>
            <li> And believe me; I have used pretty much everything!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many products in hopes it will diminish my cellulite but haven&#x27;t seen results like I have in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products in the market and any one has gave me the results Finulite does.</li>
            <li> have worked out regularly for over 15 years, follow a healthy diet &amp; drink plenty of water.  </li>
            <li> I wanted so much to like this product!</li>
            <li> Make sure you drink plenty of water, this is a big thing in getting rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Might give it higher view later if it keeps getting better.  </li>
            <li> I eat a healthy diet &amp; exercise regularly.</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product to get rid of cellulite I&#x27;ve tried so</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did, Three weeks later not only does my skin look 100x better, but the stretch marks I got during my pregnancy are disappearing as well.</li>
            <li> I think after a couple more months I&#x27;ll have my pre pregnancy body back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd set, and will continue to use the cream to see if it makes more of a difference the longer you use it.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done using the first 2 bottles, been using it day and night but still haven&#x27;t seen any changes.</li>
            <li> This cream REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of finulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cellulite since giving birth to my first child over10 years ago and have tried everything under the sun for it.</li>
            <li> have used this for 4 months now day and night exactly as directed</li>
            <li> Thank you sooooo much Finulite!  </li>
            <li> First let me start by saying im on bottle</li>
            <li> However, it is not anything permanent, but you have to be consistent with it to continue to see results.</li>
            <li> trust me on this, as I have tried SO many different things that are out there for cellulite.  </li>
            <li> This lotion does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> When I used this product for the first time I was optimistic.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite, it&#x27;s mostly around my butt and thighs, the dimples were never that deep</li>
            <li> I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked out, drank lots of water, ate healthy, and massaged the cellulite areas daily while using this product.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me these moisturizing lotions for the first time, about a year ago, and now I buy them all the time.</li>
            <li> Two moths later most all of my cottage cheese thighs R gone.</li>
            <li> I started using this over the summer and think it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I notice it works better when you are exercising and using the product at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back on the road to smooth thighs!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I am interested to see if their is a difference.</li>
            <li> nivea concentrated firmimg serum is 100x better and only costs $9.  </li>
            <li> It REALLY works!</li>
            <li> I rubbed this on my stomach area, love handles, and back fat</li>
            <li> Firstly, this isn&#x27;t going to cause miracles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finally feel better about bikinis.</li>
            <li> Totally recommended! :-)</li>
            <li> ,after reading all the reviews I decided to try finulite, the first thing I do when I received it was take a before picture after they apply the cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty consistent with the am/pm routine, and I did buy and use an inexpensive cellulite massager which I use after the pm application, but I&#x27;ve missed a time or two.  </li>
            <li> sure you use twice daily and massage well into skin to improve circulation!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this cream for 2 more months to evaluate its results, I took pictures of before for comparing in the future.</li>
            <li> With consistent application and patience, there will be results.  </li>
            <li> I first stumbled upon finulite while on Amazon searching for creams for the cellulite.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re mostly in my buttocks and upper thigh.</li>
            <li> I havent figured out how to use this along with self tanner though to be fully summer ready!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products to battle my cellulite and it seemed like all the ones I tried just were funky lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> The product is more than simple to use and in combination with the Finulite Massage Mitt it feels like is working even faster.</li>
            <li> I should use it properly to have a better result ....</li>
            <li> For the first 4 weeks I used the cream in tandem with a massager because I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s helpful.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and different articles I decided to give Finulite a try.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for showing up in my lifetime!</li>
            <li> Since the first moment I started to use finulite ,just couple days after I noticed the improvement results surround my knees.</li>
            <li> I had seen the improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> I am an avid gym goer and my upper leg had muscle tone with dimpling around it, this product has allowed more of my muscle tone to come out.  </li>
            <li> In fact I even took before and after pictures, which I&#x27;m not going to share because thats embarrassing, but they showed it really did work!  </li>
            <li> I could see results within  the first week.</li>
            <li> Thanks Finulite!</li>
            <li> My cellulite reduced a lot the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I recommend it  because it really works!</li>
            <li> However, I think with regular use and exercise, I probably would have had better results.  </li>
            <li> Very happed with the results!</li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> If not try something cheaper first.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> and actually I think better.</li>
            <li> A review after I&#x27;ve used them for very long wouldn&#x27;t help that much any how, to be honest I don&#x27;t have very much cellulite at all</li>
            <li> They smell very good and dry faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I liked how they changed the presentation from the hard bottles to this very useful, easy to use soft cream bottle.</li>
            <li> And the most important thing for me is that this product made my stretch marks less visible.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and really love it, easy to use in the morning and evening after shower</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one other cellulite cream (Bliss Fat Girl Slim) and this is much more effective.</li>
            <li> After using it for several months I would have to say that in conjunction with other modalities it can be more effective.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews on this product I finally decided to get it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and am very please with the results I see,and this new formula is better than ever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She stated for honest results in her professional opinion to take a professional high quality Vitamin Supplement, she suggested [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> , I have tried many other products with no success and this seems to really smoothen the back of my legs the best.</li>
            <li> This product, on the other hand, has a nice smell and absorbs into skin without leaving any type of greasy residue.</li>
            <li> It goes on like any other lotion and has a nice scent, but i do not feel it did anything for my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I was proud to wear shorts this year thanks to this product and a lot of hard work.</li>
            <li> It was enough to annoy me since I work hard to look my best.  </li>
            <li> I am going to see what happens after using a second set, excited to see the results!</li>
            <li> I have been using it since the summer, and with continuous and regular use, exercise and soft massages, my cellulite has improved amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I am not expecting overnight results (I can wish though) but honestly working at desk jobs for over 30 years has really taken its toll from the back of my thighs to the mid or near top of my butt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used this with the seaweed body soap that is suppose to help with cellulite or at least increase the circulation (the soap btw is awesome) in my legs and with moderate excercise.</li>
            <li> I really like it and will continue to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if is really working or not until this moment; 2 months later, I think I need to drink more water, and use it every night and day, sometime Im working till 11 pm</li>
            <li> Now, I won&#x27;t lie and say it completely gets rid of your cellulite, but this is honestly the only product I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve even noticed a difference in the firmness of my skin, and the reduction of cellulite on my butt and thighs.</li>
            <li> and my skin get more firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I trusted the reviews because it really does work, you have to be strict when using it, following the day and night regime</li>
            <li> and i felt in the way of depression when i wanted to wear a mini short or skirt that which i love those so much</li>
            <li> The product has a fresh citrusy scent that I love ( normally , I am very sensitive to smells from moisturizers and only buy &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if all of the positive reviews came from people who truly followed the directions and added diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> So if you want a product that will give you a positive result, here you have it.</li>
            <li> I purchased it from italy , hoping and trusting in positive feedback , but it didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I wish I had a positive review to leave</li>
            <li> and I can say that I have noticed positive changes.</li>
            <li> I found this on another one of my frantic google searches and read mainly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This is the only product and I have used many, that has actually made a Huge difference.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not all in a creme, but at this point I am willing to try whatever can reasonably help.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I use it in the steam sauna shower at the gym ( the heat really opens things up) and also in hot showers at home.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You have to apply it consistently and really massage it in to the skin.</li>
            <li> omg this thing really works, i got my first set in feb 2012 and</li>
            <li> I have pretty much suffered with \\&quot;cottage cheese</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much on my whole body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month, and I have to admit that during the first couple weeks it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I have used various other cellulite creams in the past mostly for problem area under buttocks and have found this to be one of the best.  </li>
            <li> Finulite gives my legs the extra boost it needs to be able to wear shorts and still feel comfortable in public.</li>
            <li> Now if I could only stop eating junk food, I am sure I would be totally cellulite free...</li>
            <li> I have pretty much have exercised all my life.</li>
            <li> Very impress with the fast results!</li>
            <li> saw results really fast, within the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found them to be really affective when used consistently.</li>
            <li> and I believe in a long run it will help me get rid of most of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have to say over all I like the product and will continue to use it as long as I am financially able to.</li>
            <li> Will repeat as long as she&#x27;s satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly new, and would be very expensive.(I have done my homework on this!!)</li>
            <li> Its super easy Am and Pm (Pink &amp; Purple).</li>
            <li> The shipping was super quick from Simply Skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> #3 and MOST IMPORTANT by far, there was a small, typed note card within the wrapping of the bottles that states if you do not see an improvement in your cellulite after 4-6 weeks of use contact this email to get a full refund.</li>
            <li> thing that is really interesting is that the fine stretch lines on my stomach from intense exercise and weightlifting movements (like dumbell pullover for chest) have been noticably improved with Finulite --- none of the other products I used for years ever improved this condition, this was an unexpected suprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it absorbs quickly and let my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> The am/pm creams makes it easy to remember and incorporate as apart of your daily routine.</li>
            <li> also it&#x27;s been easy to incorporate the am &amp; pm into my daily routine as it comes with one bottle for day &amp; night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will admit that after going through the bottles the first time I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, however, I do know that you are supposed to give something a three month trial period before making any decisions</li>
            <li> I was really surprised on how quickly I began to notice results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and only takes a couple minutes in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> I have seen strong improvements in the overall smoothness of my skin in the areas where I&#x27;ve applied it.  </li>
            <li> The old bottle was a pain as it was very hard to squeeze the cream out, but the new tube is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I did not have a large amount of cellulite</li>
            <li> I will certainly reorder when it comes up.</li>
            <li> I did not expect it to work over night, because as they say in their pamphlet when you purchase it, cellulite certainly didn&#x27;t form overnight, and you have to be patient.</li>
            <li> I saw Finulite and after reading all the positive reviews I was really hoping it would work.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money, better to spend more but get a decent product.</li>
            <li> The main thing with these creams is you have to be diligent and consistent, which I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had an order shipped to me and it had leaked slightly, and they sent me a replacement right away:)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to get rid of cellulite-it really works!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in cellulite reduction.  </li>
            <li> Good customer service is hard to come by these days  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, absorbs quickly, and lasts longer than other cellulite creams sold at the same price.</li>
            <li> So I realize I should probably USE a product before I review it, but there are many other things I can say about this product that are positive without even using them one time.</li>
            <li> really believe that with daily usage, this will make a huge improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge difference in the look of the back of my thighs and rear end since I have been using finulite.</li>
            <li> I notice a huge difference within a week of using it and the results last even when I stop using it.</li>
            <li> and I am convinced that it&#x27;s the combination of the two that made such a huge difference.</li>
            <li> There has been a huge decrease in the look of my cellulite on my upper legs and thighs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Science stuff:&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I find the most intriguing about this product is that they advertise theophylline *from green tea (also in cocoa beans aka chocolate).</li>
            <li> It,s been few months ago that I finish with the cellulite treatment and my legs looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and it feels like a body butter but not quite as heavy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my cellulite after using both bottles.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels much smoother then before.</li>
            <li> but I was very skeptic.</li>
            <li> This has really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t really get the result I needed/wanted .</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you can tell by the smell its the real deal</li>
            <li> Going on 4 weeks, there still really wasn&#x27;t much happening.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the massaging mitt and have been using it for about 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement...</li>
            <li> I really like finlite products and have never had a problem with an order.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be ready for a Hawaiian vacation</li>
            <li> The ingredients used in Finulite really makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to those with light to moderate cellulite, like me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak for those with a lot of cellulite.</li>
            <li> depending on the time of month and how much I work out.</li>
            <li> I really think that these worked.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much firmer.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the maker/supplier.</li>
            <li> none that really work and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I bought these creams along with the finulite mitt &amp; together they are working really well.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this out not expecting much</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing, and I used it for months.</li>
            <li> I would have seen an improvement, but I had already been using a basic (and cheap) moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much firmer and looks smoother.</li>
            <li> This one really really really works.</li>
            <li> It really works!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but it has helped more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was very ashamed of my stretch marks</li>
            <li> cause I used to have very toned legs ..</li>
            <li> It does require constant use to maintain the smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> I asked my Dermatologist and there is really nothing you can do to get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> but this one has really improved the look and feel of my legs</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from the seller too</li>
            <li> And now have cellulite.i don&#x27;t like to spend too much on beauty products...</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using too much..</li>
            <li> So, the con is that the results are temporary, but they really did improve the look of my legs.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a ton of cellulite and thought this was a reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> I tried all of the creams and lotions from the drugstores, and none of them really ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> FINULITE HAS CHANGED MY WHOLE ATTITUDE ABOUT SELF-IMAGE</li>
            <li> but I expected to work better than it did.</li>
            <li> but Finulite really helped me get rid of my cellulite much faster and has allowed me to keep it</li>
            <li> The real changes started happening when I used the  FInulite mostuizers along with the Finulite massage mitt.</li>
            <li> I think it really is helping to either break up fat deposits or just drain excess fluids.</li>
            <li> Using them together has absolutely made a difference.</li>
            <li> but after i dug into what this cream is supposed to do i really looked out for the results.</li>
            <li> and it REALLY worked.</li>
            <li> This cream really works.</li>
            <li> I really feel like it is reducing the dimensions of my legs.</li>
            <li> , I am a REAL PERSON</li>
            <li> I do not see much of a change at all.  </li>
            <li> and I really feel it working and  </li>
            <li> My cellulite wasn&#x27;t really severe, but I do feel like it makes me smoother.</li>
            <li> The mitt really does help</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> These products really work.</li>
            <li> The cellulite is much reduced already.</li>
            <li> The finulite i really see results.</li>
            <li> ... it does not do absolutely anything with cellulite..</li>
            <li> But, I figured it is much cheaper than continuing endermology....</li>
            <li> very durable.我们前前后后买了5瓶了，还要再买3瓶，当然不全是自己用，还有给亲戚朋友带的。效果非常好。老婆瘦了很多。确实非常有效。想哪里瘦就涂在哪里，1周左右就能看到效果。不过美体产品也是因人而异。我大舅子用了1周腰围缩了3.5cm，嫂子用完全就没有作用。后面还要给三位同事买3瓶，看看他们效果如何我再来评价。虽然瓶子很小，但是非常耐用，我跟老婆两个人从5月假期结束开始使用，直到现在8月初了，还没用完，是两个人同时使用哦～～～～当然了我们使用面积可能不大，我用在腰腹，老婆用在腰腹大腿小腿。</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Thanks again, now I can tell my friends that this product works ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very eager to see the results.</li>
            <li> I have moderate cellulite that is primarily on my thighs.</li>
            <li> I really like Finilite</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite for about a year, and I have really noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have found that it really works for me.</li>
            <li> My thighs are much thinner</li>
            <li> It really does work at polishing and tonning the skin to eliminate signs of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Believe me if you work-out and use this your ass will look soooo juicy,plump,round that you&#x27;d give yourself a 3-syllable \\&quot;DAAAAMMMNNN!\\&quot; hahaha.</li>
            <li> I have 1 month using this product and I am really seeing and improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> and you can really tell.</li>
            <li> Save your money -- this product does absolutely nothing to reduce cellulite or even the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> but with much improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m seeing some promising results.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much tighter and firmer.</li>
            <li> highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> no matter how much I worked out.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really tell if it works yet.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give up and continued using it and much to my surprise</li>
            <li> and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> and I can really see results.</li>
            <li> And, just use what you need to cover the area, and rub it in really well.  </li>
            <li> my son said my legs were very rippley...</li>
            <li> I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  </li>
            <li> The product didnt do much for me, so didnt see a difference in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product as it directs for three days now but haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results...</li>
            <li> I really think I am noticing a difference</li>
            <li> It was shipped to me quite fast too</li>
            <li> With this product I am confident that in the next few months to come I will have eliminated most of the stubborn areas of Cellulite that I have been trying to get rid of for years.</li>
            <li> I thought this would really help with some of the cellulite on my thighs, but I not.</li>
            <li> As much as I work out, I still have celluite appearances on my thighs, but this product has helped in diminishing it within months.  </li>
            <li> Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> My tummy doesnt have that wrinkled look when I suck it in, as much anymore .</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about ordering this product I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than Revitashape</li>
            <li> It is really working for me in the 6 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I have used Finulite 3 months ago and the day and night cream had a more pronounced pink and purple color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked wonders and I was very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> REALLY NOTICED ANYTHING</li>
            <li> I felt that it was reasonably priced</li>
            <li> The cream is very lightweight with no odor.  </li>
            <li> It really makes me wonder who is really writing all those 5 star</li>
            <li> Really ?</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;5, 112 pounds and work out/eat very well.  </li>
            <li> and my cellulite is much improved.</li>
            <li> , they are much smoother and cellulite has diminished drastically.</li>
            <li> I was very dubious about thisproduct</li>
            <li> but this product really seemed to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I really reccomend trying this product.</li>
            <li> but I am a massage therapist and have spent lots of time looking at ways to make my skin look better</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks straight</li>
            <li> and I really think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> so I will be all ready for summer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t work out; I&#x27;ve always had a fast metabolism (which I have noticed</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother, firmer and cellulite is disappearing, difinitely would recommend purchasing along with the mitt really helps.</li>
            <li> he had some very noticeable improvement in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product really does reduce cellulite and even firms your skin.  </li>
            <li> The only thing to help smooth the lumps and dimpled look is Finulite.</li>
            <li> My legs are much smoother and I no longer feel embarrassed about wearing shorts or even a bathing suit.</li>
            <li> so I expected it to work better.</li>
            <li> so I really appreciated their help with the mix up.</li>
            <li> I really like the results I am getting with this cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that much cellulite before</li>
            <li> I Have Given It 5 Stars Because IT REALLY DOES</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> FAST RESULTS (ALL SMILES).</li>
            <li> i work out, i run 2-3 miles (run/walk fast with my capris) and do yoga.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I am sticking to it because I see it working</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a guy but have some cellulite problems from working out and losing too much weight too fast.</li>
            <li> Following the bi-daily application, they&#x27;re not as visible and leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me too much though.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Much of my stretch marks are visibly gone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it really felt as if my skin was tightening and smoothing itself out.</li>
            <li> Even without the diet and exercise the product works very well.</li>
            <li> it really helped allot for my cellulite.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me.  </li>
            <li> My legs and and thighs are much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Now, Finulite may have been partly responsible, who knows...</li>
            <li> It seems to really work for some people though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Finulite for almost a year now, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s really working.  </li>
            <li> Not that much improvement,</li>
            <li> It seemed to firm up my problem areas and felt nice putting it on.</li>
            <li> After using full set the first time, I can see a big difference in my legs.</li>
            <li> everyone is different,  but read the reviews carefully, because this is a good product,  some people are just  too picky</li>
            <li> and I am hoping to see even more smoothing of the more worse parts of my thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done endermologie treatments and have also used several creams to try and tackle my cellulite issues and this is by far the most affordable system that yields results.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely remove my cellulite but it does WAY better than anything else on the market and DEFINITELY reduces cellulite</li>
            <li> For about two minutes total.&lt;br /&gt;Truly the improvement in my legs is a miracle, at least as good as the plastic surgeon&#x27;s pictures</li>
            <li> I loved the smell, it was thick as well</li>
            <li> The PM solution comes out of the bottle with a good squeeze, but the AM is so thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 10 days, my cellulite has gotten 50% better on top of the previous 20% !!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have this big cellulite dimple that won&#x27;t go away on the side on my right thigh and cellulite all over my bottom and the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> All in all, this cream is seriously awesome, and if you&#x27;re like me and sick of hiding, it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of finulite cellulite solutions and have noticed that after trying so many other products for this purpose, so far, this one has come out on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month and a half, but the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li> This product will probably give faster results to those with less severe cellulite, but those of you with more severe cases of cellulite will also see results if you stay consistent.</li>
            <li> Ive used so many other products before and nothing much changed after a month or so</li>
            <li> I plan to use it more consistently to see longer lasting results, but I believe in order for this to happen, you must actually apply morning and night with an intense massaging application.</li>
            <li> The first month, I did not see much difference, the second and third month have been of more significance.</li>
            <li> my skin feels super smooth and the cellulite on my legs are less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the creams are actually adding anything as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the mitt doing most of the work...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see where I will be in the next 8 weeks!!</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of other products from famous brands to non-famous brands but nothing worked like this one.</li>
            <li> but it is a lot more noticeable than with the other product.</li>
            <li> I have recommended to other people and they feel so satisfied as well ..</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have ever found that has significantly diminished the appearance of the cellulite on my outer thighs.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other creams I have used before.</li>
            <li> I went to a dinner party the other night and wanted to wear a sleeveless top.</li>
            <li> My skin feels healthier, smoother, and beginning to feel normal!</li>
            <li> I saw better results with other cellulite creams that I have used.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different, but this is definitely worth a try because it worked for me!</li>
            <li> It will not take away every bit of cellulite, NO product can do that, but I feel there was a significant enough improvement in order for me to continue using the product.  </li>
            <li> However, this creme does more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other creams that have not seemed to make a difference over the years but feel this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> This product works better than any other like it, that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The other ingredients make sense too - cyclic AMP is interesting since the alkaloids in this products, cAMP and the adenosine receptor are inter-related.  </li>
            <li> I have read many reviews of other customers that have used it for several weeks/months and have noted a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> I have used other products in the past, but I am very happy with the results of Finulite thus far and plan to continue using it!</li>
            <li> Works way better than any other cellulite treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> , at first I was just thinking that they were being nice because they knew how hard I was working out</li>
            <li> I bought this product with some skepticism, as I have tried many over the counter lotions and potions for cellulite with very little success.</li>
            <li> one complaint, I take advantage of getting free shipping by ordering more than one set, and they keep sending me new massage mitts.</li>
            <li> I eat clean and work out regularly.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product in May and just like so MANY others I began to see results in just a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> so if you have a lot of cellulite- honestly, only exercise and clean eating can rid the appearance of that-</li>
            <li> I love this product, dont have one single comlaint, worth the price even if it were double!</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously every morning and every night until the bottles were empty and made sure to really massage it in until well absorbed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for real.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks so far, they ship the product very fast</li>
            <li> I tryed many things to get rid of these things but nothing helped and that was a surprise for me when I noticed that they really became less visible.</li>
            <li> I have gone through the bottles fairly quickly, so either I&#x27;m using too much or the bottles could be bigger!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from cheap local drug store products to expensive high end products &amp; finally have found the perfect solution!  </li>
            <li> The only thing I got out of that was a HUGE credit card bill, which i still haven&#x27;t completely paid off, and three weeks of absolute hell when it came to my pain.  </li>
            <li> I see a small improvement, but nothing out of this world amazing yet.</li>
            <li> I do eat very healthy and work out at least 4 days a week.  </li>
            <li> My cellulite came back, in full display.</li>
            <li> 80% of cellulite gone with the first purchase  and a marked difference in skin elasticity.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 something female, who is in good shape (5 foot 2, 108 lbs), was a former gymnast, and still works out regularly.</li>
            <li> I have to say finulite is the ONLY product that I have actually been able to see real results from.</li>
            <li> Not a huge amount but enough for me to not be able to fit into my size XS clothing.</li>
            <li> After a full bottle using only on the side of my thighs, not result, not a change nothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the results of this product would be on it&#x27;s own, but for me, finulite worked well in this combination.</li>
            <li> Purple bottle had an orange very fluid cream, also with a sweet fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;Set</li>
            <li> It was especially evident when I sat down in shorts.</li>
            <li> I have always had some cellulite at the tops of my thighs but afte having children, it some how seemed to spread down to the top of my knees.  </li>
            <li> I like the light pleasant scent it has to it not like the usual creams out there that have heavy medicinal scents.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin very smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> and I just ordered me a new set!</li>
            <li> Have Already Ordered My New Set Which Arrived Today!</li>
            <li> Of course I still have some cellulite but the huge craters that had tormented me for so long had dissappeared!</li>
            <li> Having tried at least three other anti-cellulite products, I can honestly say that this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mid july because it had great ratings compare to other cellulite creams and now I am back re ordering again.</li>
            <li> I live an active lifestyle, workout three times a week, eat healthy, and have a slender build.</li>
            <li> I have had mine almost a month and still have over half a bottle, more like 3/4, and I use it day AND night.</li>
            <li> After having 2 kids,I have been fighting cellulite and losing the battle even though I exercise on a regular basis and eat as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li> I am young, I work out, I eat very healthy, but being in nursing school is a stressful experience and the lack of sleep and excess of coffee has resulted in an increase in cellulite over the past year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have known for the price I wasn&#x27;t going to wake up &amp; have a super model back side</li>
            <li> but as I get older I notice some unwanted cellulite.</li>
            <li> And those are mainly for the packaging and the effort.</li>
            <li> I have enough for the next 3 or 4 days, so I have to order more.</li>
            <li> Had quick visual results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 with 3 kids and find as I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of cellulite creams ad this is the only one that seems to do ANYTHING.  </li>
            <li> I am using on my upper arms mostly because I want to wear short sleeves in the summer.</li>
            <li> , I will be definitely buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> Next, its works like a charm, just follow the directions and your cellulite will diminish quickly.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after using Finulite for about 2 weeks and saw steady improvement after that.</li>
            <li> For anyone that left a negative review, it is important to know that it is important to drink a lot of water, eat healthy and exercise regularly.</li>
            <li> I was told about Finulite by a family member, she actually gave me some that she had left in a bottle, I&#x27;m glad I got to test it before I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Its not an overnight wonder, but its gradual and steady.</li>
            <li> bottles for me lasted a decent amount of time, about a month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now feeling confident enough to wear shorts in public something I haven&#x27;t done in years..</li>
            <li> I found this particular one, reading the information on it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set 1: pink bottle had yellow/orange very fluid cream with a nice melon like fruity smell.</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference, the area I was most concerned with was my upper leg</li>
            <li> I made sure to exfoliate very well in the shower before I would apply the cream, not wasting any of the cream on dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> The main areas I focused on were my cellulite ridden butt and thighs.</li>
            <li> After consistently using Finulite day and night, my skin is much smoother, and my cellulite is now barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new to try!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new to try!</li>
            <li> and my cellulite is on the lighter side, but still it was really showing on my stomach and after using this product for awhile now it&#x27;s almost completely gone!  </li>
            <li> Now, granted I did give up after two weeks, but my upper arms are looking pretty darn good now, just from the work out, so at least there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> I love these creams I&#x27;ve been using them every day for a week and they really seem to be working and the effects appear to be long lasting.  </li>
            <li> but I really feel this made a big difference because in the past with just exercising &amp; eating good</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, this product helped with fluid retention, which I really appreciate since it is a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I see my thighs become more tight and supple when using these lotions continuously.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Something else that I&#x27;ve been doing is using a skin brush before I shower every morning to help &#x27;wake up&#x27; my skin cells, and I highly recommend it as it seems to help the process of removing the cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> It does work I still using the some cream and soap highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the brush instead.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cellulite fighting product.</li>
            <li> , I had my hopes, but I tried not to let them get too high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a cellulite solution.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Finulite to anyone who is looking for an improvement in cellulite and skin laxity.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Finulite to anyone with stubborn cellulite.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend getting the massage mitt.</li>
            <li> , my hopes aren&#x27;t high,</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone wanting to get rid of their cellulite of doom.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a cellulite problem.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s trying to battle their cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other cellulite creams and have not found them to be as effective as Finulite.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from mild cellulite on the back of my thighs for years, despite being thin and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> This product really does work and I am really surprised on how quickly I noticed improvement in the smoothness of my skin in only 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of creams, most of them ridiculously expensive, and this is the only one to date that I have been able to see results with right away.  </li>
            <li> So the key is being consistent!</li>
            <li> I feel with a little more time they too will be gone.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a little more than halfway through the bottles and dimples are gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need one set per month, but maybe a little more in the summertime.</li>
            <li> It amazes me how embarrassed we as women are about it, and anything which gives me a little more confidence whenever I have to go home to Australia and face the beach is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> mitt and the massaging action really opens up the skin to receive the cream</li>
            <li> As far as the results, my legs are so much smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I have to say, so far, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely get the mitt, I think the massaging action helps the product penetrate and stimulates circulation as well.</li>
            <li> Really does work!!I am 31 yrs old and 5&#x27;7 and weigh 135 lbs.</li>
            <li> I would completely recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce that cellulite appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks to see minor results, 8 weeks to see full results.  </li>
            <li> For a few years, I have made a practice of working out more and eating healthier, but I never noticed an improvement in my cellulite--</li>
            <li> Must use everyday as directed:)</li>
            <li> This may be the key to the product&#x27;s success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite creams over the years, and it is one of the few products that seems to work.  </li>
            <li> waste of money just work out more and drink tons of water.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all, don&#x27;t waste your money and try something better.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin looks much more firm and the cellulite has gone away almost completly.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks you do start to see a difference:)</li>
            <li> Ingredients are pretty much the same but color coding</li>
            <li> If you combine it with low-fat diet with regular intake of fresh produce and exercise 2-3 a week</li>
            <li> I had significant cellulite on my thighs and butt due in no small part to significant pregnancy weight gain and the subsequent weight loss.  </li>
            <li> It is the first lotion that i found that  makes my skin feel smooth and firm..</li>
            <li> I can tell my thighs are more firm after using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I use a shower brush to exfoliate before applying, to ensure that it&#x27;s absorbed properly.  </li>
            <li> I love it and make it part of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money and the extra TLC to those areas.</li>
            <li> even better results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Although it did small nice and made my skin soft, it didn&#x27;t solve my cellulite problem.</li>
            <li> In short, I feel this product is definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> I will update this in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> more money wasted.</li>
            <li> Used this product all spring and summer with some noticeable results as to making my skin more firm and reducing the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I normally use them after my working out</li>
            <li> Very noticeable, and has kept me from wearing shorts many times this past summer.  </li>
            <li> be using this product for at least the warm months of the year from here on out!&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> But too price to be a normal lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review my purchases</li>
            <li> I have had better results with much cheaper creams that lasted a lot longer than these 2 small bottles.</li>
            <li> It will take time, no instant results - but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> I truly believe it is a big part of my success</li>
            <li> Results were good, not great, although I used the product inconsistently.</li>
            <li> For the price though, anybody can afford to use it, so overall - very positive experience.</li>
            <li> So when I,ve done with my first finulite set,I started with the second one right away for complete the professional recommendation.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions using the pink bottle first thing in the morning and the purple bottle right before bed.  </li>
            <li> I eat right and excersise DAILY!!</li>
            <li> even if you managed to &amp;#34;get rid of&amp;#34; cellulite, if you ever stopped youd get it right back.  </li>
            <li> Only used for couple of weeks but notice the difference right away.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers have said the cellulite comes right back when they stop using it, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that in my situation.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that cellulite can ever goes away but finally found the right product for me.</li>
            <li> also think the bottles are to small other then that i am happy with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to use the cream for your whole body, or most of it, the bottle size is not big enough to last a month.</li>
            <li> so I ordered them for a second time, however this time I was pregnant and wanted to use them to reduce the large amounts of cellulite that became present during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop making this product, because I refuse to live without it.  </li>
            <li> My husband even commented that the new products were working.  </li>
            <li> now 47, and read an article about a new plastic surgery technique called Cellulaze.</li>
            <li> Its such a let down to think if it worked for so many it must work for you and see absolutely 0% change.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use finulite as long as I need it, it has worked far better than any other cream I&#x27;ve ever tried;)</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have ever used to make such a huge change.</li>
            <li> it is amazing especially when i was hiking everyday</li>
            <li> How much the cream is affecting that, I don&#x27;t really know, but in the end, there is enough improvement for me to continue the practice and have hope that this, combined with my healthier diet and exercise, will over time keep improving my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday morning/night and after 1 month using it, I can clearly see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it for sure.</li>
            <li> My legs were so much smoother by the end of the month to the touch and much of the visual cellulite</li>
            <li> I am comfortable enough to finally wear dresses and skirts again.</li>
            <li> I have to assume that people seeing a difference have never taken the time to massage their cellulite prone areas regularly, and that is likely the primary reason they are seeing some difference when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I see my skin more firm and soft...</li>
            <li> Besides the difference I see (predominantly on my outer &amp; back upper thigh), their fragrance is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different serums, patches, or antidotes and as expected, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> After using Finulite for several weeks, my thighs and butt are noticeably smooth and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item because of the main ingredients and positive product reviews--hoping I would see results.</li>
            <li> I did not think it would work, so I was very surprised at the results - and I was being hyper-critical.</li>
            <li> and it also leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> You will be very surprised by how quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very soft; however, it does not appear to take away cellulite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the full 30 days (approaching 60 days total with two treatments of Finulite), (I will upload pictures in a few more days, on day 26)</li>
            <li> The major positive that I&#x27;ve seen with this product is that it has actually completely cleared up my keratosis.</li>
            <li> I am always willing to try something new, especially homemade mixtures...I will stick with coffee grind, sugar and olive oil mixture.</li>
            <li> I had certain areas on the back of my thighs up near my buttocks that started showing signs of cellulite, and no matter how much weight I lost (5&#x27;6 at 140 pounds)</li>
            <li> First set didn&#x27;t do anything for me but did make my legs very soft... might just have to try second set ...</li>
            <li> Cellulite is diminished with consistent use, exercise, and proper diet.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have used that actually improves the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> My first reaction to the product is that the bottles are tiny.</li>
            <li> In the end this product seemed to do the exact opposite of what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this product; it really works!</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I am excited to try on other problem areas.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> but wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of similar products and this one works and smells better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I used both bottles, and my legs still look the same as they did when I first started using  Finulite, I dont</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s from being over weight most of my life, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I am almost finished with the first set of AM PM and definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Around the 3rd week I decided to apply the AM cream before putting on my Zaggora Hot Pants and running 3 miles.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the first week I was not using it daily, but once I started and of course with exercise</li>
            <li> Finulite is the first cellulite cream to actually work for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to rocking my bathing suit and not feeling se of conscious!</li>
            <li> It took some days to see a noticeable improvement, but WOW!</li>
            <li> the writing style is almost exactly the same</li>
            <li> One (or two to be exact) that I trust because it simply works</li>
            <li> Give it a try, and be consistent in using it, and I expect you will receive similar results to mine!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually fights cellulite as it says it will.  </li>
            <li> and I was so surprised!</li>
            <li> This was the first cream that I ever used where I not only started to see an improvement in my cellulite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my first month</li>
            <li> You will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I used it pretty religiously and used quite a bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how this product worked for the price!</li>
            <li> I look exactly the same as if I&#x27;ve never used any product to reduce any cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also dieting and exercising daily (hardcore like elliptical &amp; stepper for 45 minutes not feeble 15 minute walks or anything)</li>
            <li> Then I decided to try Finulite, and I actually started to see some results within the first two months.  </li>
            <li> I look exactly the same as i did when i started using it.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, last summer, I was embarrassed to wear shorts because of cellulite on my legs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many items to compare this to, as I&#x27;ve only used two other creams before.</li>
            <li> Well, I have used my first Finulite cream and have already received my second.</li>
            <li> I have little on tops of thighs that should easily burn but doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased other items from this company and I am VERY excited to try them.</li>
            <li> I apply it right after I take a shower, while in the shower i use Bliss Fat Girl Slimulator, rub it in a circular motion until my things are deep pink then apply the lotion right after.</li>
            <li> My cellulite has been pretty bad practically all my life, but now there is a great improvement.  </li>
            <li> For such a small investment, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> The effects are of course temporary but these 2 lotions do smooth slight areas of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Most products that I have previously used in the past do not have a good smell to them and were a waste of time and money,</li>
            <li> My advice to you is to eat a low sugar and sodium diet, cut down on the caffeine and eat a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> I decided to try something different because this had some positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this one a shot was because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep up with the regimine, you will most likely see results (obviously diet and exercise lifestyle is a must)!</li>
            <li> SO far it has made my skin tighter and so soft!  </li>
            <li> ordered a new set and the cream color is very faded and almost white.</li>
            <li> Got product very fast been using about 10 days on stomach area no results so far maybe to early to review update been using on stomach about 5 wks a little improvement but not much i will purchase one more time to see if its going to work</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did, as it is already helping &amp; I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week &amp; a half.</li>
            <li> I used this so far for a month I must say works well, but of course I&#x27;ve been doing my part with walking and light jogging , but the appearance of cellulite is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate \\&quot;hail damage\\&quot;, especially on my thighs...</li>
            <li> my legs feel smooth and tight  .</li>
            <li> My legs feel smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> My only caveat is that these two tubes don&#x27;t last the full month (at least for me), perhaps 3 weeks at the most.</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing, even though it had a good amount of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> But honestly combining the nivea gel cream and serum works 20x better than this and is still less expensive.</li>
            <li> only upside to this cream, it left my legs super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s the ONLY thing that truly works.</li>
            <li> , there is still a little cellulite in the back of my legs but the difference form before i started is significantly better.</li>
            <li> I will say that after using 1 both of AM and PM, it is hard to tell if there is any difference, but I am going to try it a couple more times and see.</li>
            <li> I have spent years looking for a decent cellulite creme that was not full of chemicals &amp; left my skin soft, smooth &amp; nourished, not sticky!!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t particularly care for the new scent.</li>
            <li> So in a desperate attempt to rid myself of this curse, I bought a stepper, and this product.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the great reviews</li>
            <li> I am very please with the results so far for only a month of usage.</li>
            <li> soft and much tighter!This stuff actually did what it said it would do!!</li>
            <li> Did not see any clear results</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d steer clear.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 2 years and consider it a life-saver (or at least an arm-save). :-)</li>
            <li> stars later after I use it longer -- and if there is interest I can find out how much theophylline is in natural chocolate.</li>
            <li> Tried a second bottle and absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li> its to early to say it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 18 years old, and I have had cellulite since I was 13.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old, weight anywhere from 113-120</li>
            <li> I ended up discovering Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow moisturizer (which gives you a gradual tan).</li>
            <li> With the warmer weather I opted for Jergens natural glo firming moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (diet, massage with body brash and light exercise) gives some improvements, therefore I gave it 3 points and</li>
            <li> However, I have struggled for a long time (*years*) with cellulite.  </li>
            <li> After having a baby i had some troublesome areas around my thighs and tummy that would not go away are finally disappearing thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I see no difference in cellulite at all so far.  </li>
            <li> 135 lb women, but at 45 yrs old, I have some cellulite on my legs.  </li>
            <li> After a month, early sign of cellulite disappeared.</li>
            <li> If it works on a 50+ year old grandma, it should work on anyone.</li>
            <li> This helps to smooth out those trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I do suggest trying them, and after continued use my legs look much firmer overall.  </li>
            <li> I will come back with another feedback in a month to see how much it improves my thighs</li>
            <li> I used a self tanner and wow what a difference with both products being used.</li>
            <li> but my skin was really soft.  </li>
            <li> I even went as far as spending $6,000 on liposuction.  </li>
            <li> If I had only known that these creams existed before I went through all that, I&#x27;d be a much happier woman today.  </li>
            <li> After four weeks, there was a complete difference.  </li>
            <li> I bet you will be pleasantly surprised, just like I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe that if I continue to use it for another 3 months or so, all of the cellulite that I have accumulated over 9 years will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> old woman who has always had cellulite on the backs of my legs.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, tighter and feels silky soft.  </li>
            <li> My cellulite was very noticeable on the back of my thighs.  </li>
            <li> I like this product so far.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to really massage it in a circular motion using deep penetration...</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I work out at least 4 times a week and eat well most of the time.  </li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions and stay consistent you will notice results.</li>
            <li> I used one complete set of the AM/PM cream.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions completely, and saw zero results.  </li>
            <li> I can really use until the last drop of it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a busy schedule, so I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> and wow what a differince i can already see on my legs and butt...</li>
            <li> soon I believe to see complete results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am slender yet I have SO much cellulite at the back and some on the sides of my legs.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised to find that there is a visible difference in the cellulite pockets.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about this product because I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> didnt do a thing except make skin feel soft</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a beauty brush instead to brush my skin before a shower, and months later my cellulite has gone away much.</li>
            <li> Finulite has made my skin so soft and it has toned up the skin dramatically.</li>
            <li> my skin isn&#x27;t as it was (naturally).</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and its been working really well</li>
            <li> It definitely did make my skin soft, but I can find a good organic lotion for a whole lot cheaper to do that without questionable ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Are my imperfections gone completely?  </li>

            <li> Hey, if my 10 yr old noticed, it is working.</li>
            <li> This product really works especially if you apply it as instructed&lt;br /&gt;both day and night.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m destined to have cellulite forever (thanks, genetics), but Finulite has definitely made an improvement in the look of my legs!</li>
            <li> , I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I have been battling cellulite for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li> Please note that, as much as we want for creams to work to cure/remove cellulite, THEY SIMPLY DON&#x27;T WORK.</li>
            <li> , it made my thighs so soft, but it did nothing for the cellulite.</li>
            <li> So far, this product has been helpful.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin firm and smooth</li>
            <li> Is cellulite really that different for some and not others.</li>
            <li> fast acting...</li>
            <li> It sucks that most of us have it, but often it is the fat we eat and not working out.</li>
            <li> So far, I am liking the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exercise much (as I had a hernia operation a while back).</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I go through it too fast-</li>
            <li> Fast forward 24 Hours later</li>
            <li> and I see it, loud and clear.</li>
            <li> Well I am back to say I did not experience as much a smoothing effect as i like.</li>
            <li> I am a slender 31 year old, 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and 110lbs, yet, I have cellulite.</li>
            <li> I am a mature guy and I have always used anti-fat/cellulite creams in order to reduce the fat I have at the sides of my belly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old, and I run 5 times a week.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> He even said these creams were old and told me to stop using them immediately.</li>
            <li> I recently started to get a layer of cellulite on my legs and purchased this product based on some promising reviews.</li>
            <li> Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;I am 45 years old, stand 5&#x27;2, and weigh 120 lbs.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i purchase this product, it really works.</li>
            <li> Finally after searching on amazon for cellulite products I found Finulite, and all the reviews seemed promising</li>
            <li> so far it is working just as they say it should ..</li>
            <li> So far, no reduction in BUMPS.</li>
            <li> i rather not waste my time</li>
            <li> I feel that with time my cellulite will completely disappear.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased,so I will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> Hi, I am 27 years old but have cellulite on my legs and my butt.</li>
            <li> Results are probably different for each person, but I definitely think its worth it.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the quantity of the product, but overall I think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second set of creams and plan to keep this up for a few more months.</li>
            <li> I think the area above my knees bothers me most because in the summer I wear shorts everyday</li>
            <li> I had what I considered severe cellulite which would get worse with any kind of weight gain.</li>
            <li> I swear the good reviews here are fake and this product should be removed from the market.  </li>
            <li> A minor complaint I may have though is the scent; both AM and PM bottles have a very distinct flowery, sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I did drop the weight by following Weight Watchers and exercising (as much as the little one would let me), but my legs never returned to their original beauty.  </li>
            <li> I recently read an article that cellulite and stretch marks are caused by the same problem--lack of water in the right places and broken-down</li>
            <li> But with Finulite (and their accompanying massage mitt) I have definitely noticed a difference, especially in the deeper dimples in my right thigh that have always bothered me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other similar products and wasn&#x27;t left nearly as satisfied as I am with this product.</li>
            <li> I also have an active job where I am on my feet all day, and can be physically taxing at many points (physical therapist).  </li>
            <li> I kid you not, with the addition of Finulite and consistent dry brushing before every shower, I have no visible cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have used many other products and have spent tons of money on finding the \\&quot;right\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> only because its cheap compared to other creams.</li>
            <li> I didnt think i would find a miracle cream but due to all the good feedback I was hoping for at least something but nothing.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try since the conventional diet and exercise just wasn&#x27;t giving me results in specific places that I wanted, but adding this into the equation is just amazing~ Please, before doing something unreasonable like surgery, spare a few dollars and get some real results.</li>
            <li> so they do not last very long, they absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen considerable improvement in loose skin and cellulite and have purchased their cream because you get a lot more for less.    </li>
            <li> Over the last year, I have lost weight and added a steady yet modest work out regimen to my life including weights and cardio.</li>
            <li> The only downside I can really see is that the bottles are a little small and you could easily run out quick if you are using lots of the lotion at once.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other cellulite creams over the years, without much success.  </li>
            <li> My cellulite was getting pretty bad and this product along with drinking more water and running on the treadmill have been a step in the right direction.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve had cellulite most of my life (even when I was seriously UNDER weight)</li>
            <li> What I do everyday is clean my skin with alcohol</li>
            <li> if the first pack doesn&#x27;t exceed your expectations, don&#x27;t lose faith because the second one will definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants less of the &amp;#34;cottage-cheese&amp;#34; look on your arms, legs, and/or stomach - basically the most fatty areas in your body.  </li>
            <li> i ORDERED MY SECOND SET AND THE LOOK, FEEL AND SMELL OF THE LOTION IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST SET I HAD.</li>
            <li> so I guess you can say that this had a profound impact on me.</li>
            <li> : it is the first time after trying countless products that I actually see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never wore bikini bottoms because I never wanted anyone to see the back of my legs or thighs and wore capri&#x27;s no matter how hot It was outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my skin is getting better or not, I&#x27;m not using it religiously</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of the 5 star reviews are FAKE.  </li>
            <li> At first I was thinking--ok, so I just wasted my money, because I didn&#x27;t really notice results after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to give Finulite the second chance, and again as with the first time, I see minimum into moderate improvement.</li>
            <li> And having the 2 bottles actually helps me keep a steady routine.</li>
            <li> For last time, I did not consistently apply them on my body, so I did not observe significant change of my body shape.</li>
            <li> I have been using it almost daily for the last 3 months and really see results!</li>
            <li> While the prices are reasonable, bigger bottles would be helpful for how much I put on in a single session-</li>
            <li> Most products on the market today are MUCH pricier and you only get one formulation (not day/night like Finulite offers) and there are little to no results with other products-</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to those needing that extra support in those areas that tend to store fat and excess water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a problem since the 7th grade when the boy sitting next to me in jr high school asked why I had dimples in my thighs...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone with this same problem.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this brand of cellulite cream because of all the high reviews that it had.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t leave me super sticky after application (no more than normal lotion).</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount in the areas of interest while massaging and the product is absorbed very fast.</li>
            <li> is this a fake or did they change the smell and color the first bottle I got were like a serum type and these new ones are more like a lotion last yr</li>
            <li> Only thing I hope they change is that (which they already may have since I bought them seeing how it&#x27;s different in pictures now) instead of the hard shell bottles, it would be nice for them to be in tubes</li>
            <li> Only downfall, wish the product came in larger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making my experience with finulite a positive one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at the beginning for I had tried so many products to fight my cellulite, but I got convinced to give Finulite  a try after reading the positive comments on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is only the second day &amp; I will add on to this review after this trial, but I can already say something positive about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am just not sure if too weeks is the duration in which providing a rating is accurate to suffice.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why that detail is relevant to this product and the purpose of its use.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and non-greasy, but you&#x27;re unlikely to get much improvement from anything you simply rub onto your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different cellulite creams over the past few years, and Finulite has worked the best for me by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a month with absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> we are all not super models cellulite happens, learn to live with it or be willing to put in the work.</li>
            <li> I got super busy and quit using it consistently for a while, and the cellulite got worse again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say which element has had the most affect, but I would definitely say I see a noticeable difference when I use the Finulite.</li>
            <li> I wore a short dress to a New Years party and my friends all</li>
            <li> I just received my third set of Finulite, which is now the new formula and it too seems to work well.</li>
            <li> and I simply cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li> and he mentioned that a special chemical- aminophylline--that breaks down fat when topically applied.</li>
            <li> If you wanted to really stimulate the tissues, I&#x27;d suggest dry brushing before showering and then using the AM cream.</li>
            <li> and I do think there is a slight difference although, I have also been using a wooden massager to deeply massage it in, so it could be the massage more than the actual lotions that is making the difference.  </li>
            <li> Not HUGE but compared to how much damage there is to work on, to even see the slightest difference is very encouraging.</li>
            <li> used this product for 30 days straight, at the same time in the morning and at the same time at night.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying Finulite, I must say I really did notice a big change below my butt</li>
            <li> I started using it on my upper arms and only a week in now and already seeing a much smoother muscle tone there than the dimples.</li>
            <li> Cellulite runs in my family, and while I have always been relatively fit, the last few years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to think that all of the good reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> Slowly but surely it will continue to improve my overall skin appearance.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe the least expensive is what worked the best!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical about how much good a cream will do for my cellulite</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to see if this product actually worked because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Too many products fot cellulite I was expecting at least better results, the bottles are to small I think should try other products.</li>
            <li> and I have seen major, major improvement.</li>
            <li> No other product have done this before.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 month and major improvement I have noticed is in my butt.</li>
            <li> No regrets here!</li>
            <li> just use it everyday be very consistent &amp; u will see resultz</li>
            <li> My cellulite was a progressive process so it will take time to see a major difference.</li>
            <li> only issue would be that both bottles have the exact same ingredients and the only difference in the two is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> However, the second time I got a total different product then the first time.</li>
            <li> probably worth it, especially for the summer time when you have to show your body on the beach ;-) and as long as you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m prepared to keep at it - and for such a great price you can&#x27;t really go wrong!</li>
            <li> the end, this product is great by itself, and in combination of vitamins, constantly keeping your skin moisturized, derma-rolling, and applying the cream( really rub the cream in, I rub the cream in with both hands, then press extremely hard, with slow controlled motions with my thumbs getting the cream deep deep inside the skin, until it no longer feels \\&quot;oily/moisture</li>
            <li> but what the heck, what little bit I do have is worth taking care of now</li>
            <li> I used to have large sunken holes on my thighs and butt now much improved small areas.</li>
            <li> A bit of background: I have had cellulite since I was a preteen and have tried nearly every method and cream and lotion to get rid of it with very little success.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things in the past and spent great amounts of time and money, to end up feeling frustrated, with no results.</li>
            <li> From past experiences with these types of products, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> I am exercising while using the products and in one months time, I am convinced after my second order, I shall be clear of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I am not overweight, and I was devastated to see my body ravaged with this cellulite problem at such a young age.</li>
            <li> my marks were pretty dark as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered it last year and did see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It will not remove your cellulite completely but will help minimize appearance of your cellulite.</li>
            <li> Also, I should say I have barely been working out.</li>
            <li> I gave only four stars because the amount you get in each tube is not nearly enough to last a whole month in my perspective.</li>
            <li> Not only did this product not work - at all - but it made me examine my legs so thoroughly and frequently that I saw cellulite</li>
            <li> once you have enough cellulite to see you cannot completely eliminate it without drastic life-style changes</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old female, 5&#x27;1 126lbs.</li>
            <li> Company policy is \\&quot;partial refund with the customer absorbing return shipping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have not been faithful with the dual daily application, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> 25 year old male.</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite for about a month now and have seen considerable changes in the amount of cellulite on my glutes and back of legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a youthful 50 year old and constantly struggling with cellulite.  </li>
            <li> It actually does reduce the appearance of cellutlite and makes the skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have tried numerous lotions and remedies for cellulite and nothing works like this product does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However as far as smoothing and strengthening my skin goes, I have noticed results with this product and I will keep using it for the foreseeable future in the hope that combined with exercise</li>
            <li> Now that I am a 20 year old college student that has tried almost every over the counter cellulite treatment, I am so relieved that Finulite has actually given me a break on cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 3 months now and 80% of my cellulite is barely noticable.  </li>
            <li> But after a full 8 oz of nothing I am not foolish enough to buy another round.</li>
            <li> but hey, I was game for some improvement, anything to make me feel okay in a bathing suit or</li>
            <li> in advance of starting a new diet/exercise routine on Jan 1, 2013, I purchased Finulite after doing COPIOUS amounts of research on cellulite solutions (from other creams to various types of laser surgery, which wasn&#x27;t an option for me at this time due to cost), and began using is just before the 1st of the year (this is important to note, because the results cannot be attributed to the new routine, as I hadn&#x27;t been doing it long</li>
            <li> have recently bought a new cellulite cream by a different company.</li>
            <li> Description made me think it would have a nice herbal smell but this is strong and sickening.  </li>
            <li> Finulite not only decreases the appearance like other products it really works on the fat cells directly.</li>
            <li> I am half way through my first set of lotion</li>
            <li> Using the AM in the morning and the PM at night is much less of a cumbersome ritual than I first thought.</li>
            <li> Using it twice a day with exercise, I notice a small decrease in cellulite, which is more than other products have done for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a cellulite cream, so I cannot compare Finulite to any other product.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my thighs are smoother after several months of use.  </li>
            <li> My body is more firm and tight.</li>
            <li> The smaller more numerous cellulite lines disappeared in about two weeks, but the bigger thick lines on the sides of my belly prove to be trickier.</li>
            <li> year, there is less actual exercise temporary however, but I&#x27;m very consistent with manual hand massage tools, electric massage use, and I am definitely getting results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> big part of those positive reviews must be fake, as it happens more and more on Amazon... sad.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried other very pricey cellulite creams that promise you will see results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overweight at all, I just have a few spots that are a little more cottage cheese looking than I&#x27;d like (stomach and butt/</li>
            <li> One IMPORTANT tip is to rub it in very deep and hard.</li>
            <li> Not too highly scented, so it won&#x27;t mess with your regular scent of perfume or deodorant or what ever it is you wear normally.</li>
            <li> Not too highly scented, so it won&#x27;t mess with your regular scent of perfume or deodorant or what ever it is you wear normally.</li>
            <li> im sooo happy and shocked that this cream is actually working..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say my experience the second time around isn&#x27;t as amazing.</li>
            <li> for someone has had a gorgeous pair of cellulite free legs, this was just devastating.</li>
            <li> The cottage cheese look on my thighs began to disappear slowly and surely enough it became a HUGE improvement over the months I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many cellulite products,very expensive ones,too,that have not done anything near to what this one does.</li>
            <li> Although it hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared  (I don&#x27;t expect it to), the overall appearance has definitely improved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all gone, obviously, and I don&#x27;t expect it to ever completely disappear, but after a month, the results are definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was in my early teens I have been plagued with cellulite even with being only 130 pounds throughout my teen years.</li>
            <li> I am not 100% cellulite free but the back of my thighs looks way way smoother and my butt the dimples are slowly being diminished</li>
            <li> Some very expensive creams smell only nice and cost a lot money.........but don&#x27;t work !&lt;</li>
            <li> I was so excited about receiving this product since the reviews were so good, but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> would have given this product 5 Stars, and I might come back and do just that after I&#x27;ve finished up the bottles (I&#x27;m barely two weeks into using the stuff!),</li>
            <li> so it did bruise me a little the first 2 days -</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a miracle in pretty little bottles.</li>
            <li> Other than having your skin a little smooth when you apply it this products is just another gimmick</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets on my first order and I am nearly half way through the second set.</li>
            <li> but I figured if I was researching this product I would like to see all the reviews good or bad.(I&#x27;m also starting to wonder why bad reviews/experiences are being marked as not helpful...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m beyond shocked and thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li> In addition to regular leg and rear exercises, I had tried nearly every topical product on the market to reduce cellulite on my upper thighs and rear.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no excuse to not work out.</li>
            <li> This was apparent after only 2 weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased four sets since May, and plan to continue buying this lotion as long as I keep getting the results I&#x27;ve gotten thus far.</li>
            <li> Strangely not running or diet changes.)</li>
            <li> Remember, you can&#x27;t completely get rid of your cellulite, though diet and exercise will also help with that, but Finulite will drastically reduce the appearance of your cellulite, as long as you use it every morning and night.</li>
            <li> This product is my first ever cellulite erasing product, and I will admit that I won&#x27;t try any other product as long as I can get my hands on Finulite.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty upset when I started developing cellulite a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the small investment.  </li>
            <li> I massage it in pretty firmly</li>
            <li> It needs to be used consistently and everyday to see the results but it works.</li>
            <li> I first tried Finulite a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Only thing that I wish which is super minor is that the ingredients on the bottles were a little easier to read.  </li>
            <li> After rubbing the AM cream on this morning, I noticed two large dimples in the front of my thigh that had not been there previously.  </li>
            <li> some reviews complain about there being a small amount of finulite in the bottles, but you use them separately, so it&#x27;s actually eight ounces of cream, which is more than some  other skin systems come with!</li>
            <li> Never went up and down that much in weight</li>
            <li> I covered from my hip down to my knee with the stuff and really worked it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, very active, eat well, and overall, try to take good care of myself, but age usually prevails, and in the last few years I have noticed some imperfections emerging, and I wanted to take a proactive approach to improve my skin&#x27;s appearance and prevent future imperfections.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over 2 weeks every morning and night pretty religiously</li>
            <li> If you have major cellulite, surgery is the only thing that will make a big difference.</li>
            <li> losing so much weight so suddenly, I was left with \\&quot;battle scars\\&quot; aka loose stomach skin, cellulite, and very deep red stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the positive reviews seem to be by reviewer&#x27;s with one or few reviews in the past; though, they are noted as \\&quot;amazon verified purchase\\&quot;, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, great cream, very little quantity.</li>
            <li> My legs are firmer, and I hardly see any more cellulite, even if I bunch up my legs or sit down.</li>
            <li> I bought due to the high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using finulite for the past 2yrs and my body looks much sexier - wow.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it... not sure as to how much it is working yet.  </li>
            <li> umm i pretty much got tired of rubbing smelly lotion on my legs after a week, its a rigorous process, and</li>
            <li> I noticed a positive change after about 10 days, but now it&#x27;s been a couple of months, and the difference it pretty dramatic.  </li>
            <li> after reading a few reviews on Finulite, while skeptical at first, decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so, so glad I made that purchase 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> I am 40ish, average sized, weighing about 130, and starting to really notice the cellulite on the back of my thighs.</li>
            <li> the past, the only products that really worked always ended up being discontinued - Avon CelluSculpt in the early 2000s and Avon Lipo AM/</li>
            <li> I had a lot of expectations about this product because of former reviews but sincerely it does not work, unfortunately cellulite is very difficult to treat and like this one a lot of products in this market offer improvement in cellulite condition but most of them simply don&#x27;t have positive results, so for me this was same as others, &amp;#34;Not good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> if I kept using the Firming &amp; Toning Gel-Cream Massager daily and used the Toning Concentrate whenever I went out on the town (the effects of which washed off after showering or going in the water, so watch out when going to the beach with that one), finishing off the look with a drop of the Toning Massage Oil, but beware, all the SpaFit Body Shop products are yellow/orange in color, and they will stain your clothing yellow too, and leave wet marks on certain fabrics if you don&#x27;t wait for them to dry after application,</li>
            <li> I had high hopes due to all the reviews and thought that finally I found something that may actually work!</li>
            <li> The smaller less noticeable ones have improved but are not gone and my deep one is not improving much at all.</li>
            <li> (remember it takes a few months) as you will certainly see improvement in the smoothing and texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> Being a fitness competitor and getting to a very lean physique, there is always a little cellulite that hangs on for dear life on my thighs and butt.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much cellulite, and was hoping this might get rid of the little bit I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using finulite for a little over a week straight now</li>
            <li> Seriously, every time I use this on my arms and legs, not only does my cellulite disappear, but my bumpy skin also gets very smooth and the KP is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It spreads on very thickly, and seems to plump and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that the product did not work for my cellulite, but I did enjoy the scents and it left my skin soft.    </li>
            <li> The results did seem to slow slightly after the second month, but I am extremely happy to say that (unless I am sitting down where there are still some little dents)</li>
            <li> I honestly ordered this product with the expectation to minimally decrease the appearance of my scars, cellulite, and tighten up my loose skin; dramatic results were unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the \\&quot;random junk\\&quot; ranging from $5-$40 in CVS, Walgreens, and Sephora I decided to take a turn to amazon since I order most of my items from here</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and have noticed some slight differences in the appearance of my skin...not too much as I haven&#x27;t used it as long as recommended</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, and because of the number of positive reviews, I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Eating a clean diet really helps too - expecially cutting out refinded white sugar and starches.  </li>
            <li> When I exercise I do see an improvement in the overall appearance of my cellulite but it won&#x27;t improve past a certain point.</li>
            <li> Every other cellulite treatment comes no where near to what they promise except finulite.</li>
            <li> So, I am unsure if this is due to the product, or the action of massaging the area.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I didn&#x27;t do as well the last 3 weeks and instead of using BOTH products once a day, I was able to remember to use at least ONE once a day (usually the daytime formula).</li>
            <li> Definitely less lumpy, and my skin is FAR smoother and tighter, and the appearance of the cellulite, which not entirely gone (especially on the back of my thighs), has noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 25 days I noticed mystretch marks are almost COMPLETELY GONE, my cellulite no longer shows unless \\&quot;I suck in my stomach, and even then it is very very minimal indentations,\\</li>
            <li> The older lotion packaging is annoying (with the dispenser at the top of the bottle), it&#x27;s hard to get the product out of the bottle, even when it&#x27;s full.</li>
            <li> For th eprice I paid for the two small (very small) bottles, I could have bought a couple of large (very large) bottles of lotion that would do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that that the bottles are small so you have to reorder very often</li>
            <li> maybe its how much Im using at one time but the small bottles could be bigger in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I randomly stumbled across this product on amazon and bought it just to experiment because I figure the price was pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> Only down side so far for me is the price.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple products like this with limited or no results, this stuff is different.</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old, 117 pounds, 5&#x27;2, very active but all my life i had cellulite in my upper thighs.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when the personal trainer at the gym finally told me I needed to slow down and quick the gym until after I gave birth.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure I was really seeing a difference myself, but one day my husband commented &amp;</li>
            <li> The only negative side is the size of the bottle, 4 oz don&#x27;t last much.</li>
            <li> The product indeed reduces the appearance of cellulite, but only as long as you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> as it says on the bottle massage with long deep strokes,so here you go</li>
            <li> I know everyone is different but with diligence it is working for me - it does not completely get rid of cellulite</li>
            <li> I even waited almost 2 months to write a review to see if I just hadn&#x27;t been using it long enough</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know if they will last, and how long can I continue to use these lotions.  </li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t used it long enough to discern the cellulite diminishing; nevertheless, this has become a go-to</li>
            <li> The NIVEA serum works just as well for a fraction of the price and can be purchased locally without additional shipping costs or strange odors.</li>
            <li> I still have the deep diples &amp; minor \\&quot;orange</li>
            <li> The color was totally different, the smell was totally different and the texture was absolutely not the same.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I&#x27;m one of those people who will try just about anything that could potentially improve my appearance, even if I feel that the likelihood that it will work is very small.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, but the effort that u have to give to apply this every morning and night is exhausting.</li>
            <li> I was wearing shorts down to my knees because I was self conscious of the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I mean i wasn&#x27;t even consistent as i should be</li>
            <li> , because I would have had to wait a couple months due to my schedule to have it done, I decided to try a few cellulite home treatments in the meantime, just for fun, not really expecting them to work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not going to last very long.</li>
            <li> Per the previous comments, her skin remains soft and supple, and she enjoys using it for the moisturizing qualities</li>
            <li> have already been doing dry brushing, massage, and essential oil rubs for years now...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Applying the product to wet, dirty, skin is defeating the purpose, give it an honest effort and you WILL see</li>
            <li> Needless to say, there was a BIG difference, although I was tone from working out, my cellulite did not look as smooth as it did when I used the finulite.</li>
            <li> endermologie, dry brushing, etc, with mixed results.</li>
            <li> The bottle was only palm size, much smaller than what I expected...</li>
            <li> I spent countless minutes massaging the cream into the back of my thighs</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know long term results, but I am optimistic.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, and I was doubtful that a topical solution could really achieve much results, but WOW, this stuff really is working!!  </li>
            <li> I am not rich by any means &amp; today&#x27;s middle class income standards (based on ridiculous &amp; outlandish annual \\&quot;cost of living increases\\&quot;) are still considered rich to me</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product and thought that it might help at least a little bit.</li>
            <li> the only thing you got to loose is those dimpling yucky legs....</li>
            <li> It gave me the confidence to wear my short shorts because it smooths and tightens loose skin.</li>
            <li> but I had a baby 10 months ago and was left with kinda droppy loose skin on my stomach.</li>
            <li> The product is too thick to come out easily; it should have been packaged in a small jar for easier access.</li>
            <li> and it only takes a very small amount because it blends very well.  </li>
            <li> but there is the cellulite that only goes away when I go into crazy person mode working out 7 days a week and eating pure as pure can be.</li>
            <li> i had a baby over 4 years ago and even though i am back to pre pregnancy weight, i eat well, and exercise, there is just this constant little layer of fat and loose skin on my upper arms, inner thighs and lower tummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are consistant and follow the directions on the package, you will really see less dimples and smoother skin in less than 30 days.</li>
            <li> I am 18, and I have been plagued with serious cellulite for as long as I can remember thanks to my constantly yo-yoing weight.  </li>
            <li> I went to the beach for the first time in 3 years a few weeks ago, and had no anxiety or shame about running around in my little bikini with my 5 year-old.  </li>
            <li> Its very unprofessional and rude to blame your customer by emailing them that--\\&quot;your review is</li>
            <li> i am a \\&quot;stink a phobe\\&quot; and always afraid of overwhelmingly scented products, but this smells good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far its nothing other then any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I only have minimal cellulite and still did not see any results.  </li>
            <li> I think I will continue to use this product as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to purchase this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it religiously morning/night until the bottles were empty</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a long term fix, unless you continue to use.  </li>
            <li> I still have a long way to go</li>
            <li> Does anyone know how long you should stay on this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider this a complete waste of money and a gimmick.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for a minor change.</li>
            <li> long did it take?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and so far I have lost 4 inches from my hips alone.</li>
            <li> Im not a professional about this</li>
            <li> I used the Nivea cellulite serum for a long time and decided to give Finulite a try.  </li>
            <li> I spent money on numerous products ranging from $5.00 to $30 to paying in the $100s for the laser cellulite treatment (which I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference afterwards).</li>
            <li> In a few weeks I and my boyfriend noticed that my cellulitis was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> and i will continue to use it as long as they sale it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is simple to use: purple bottle at night, pink in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds trying different creams</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been two weeks, and what had been a case of severe cellulite is now minor.</li>
            <li> The information is not clear and also the bottles are disaster specialy</li>
            <li> It can really diminish your celllulite slowly.</li>
            <li> Been researching for a while for a good product to help with this annoying problem.  </li>
            <li> I have found that this product works MUCH better than Nivea&#x27;s cellulite serum and lotion, although they are much less expensive, so you pay for what you get.  </li>
            <li> It seems less expensive than a lot of the reputable cellulite creams out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently started up again; am doing Endermologie, eating cleanly as possible (less cheese, pasta, bread, alcohol and sugar...</li>
            <li> /&gt;As noted previously, the only factor going against 5 stars is that the tubes could be larger.</li>
            <li> and I only apply it to half of my upper thigh area.</li>
            <li> I was promised my product on a certain day and it got to my home earlier than expected!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I mean if there are changes they are so minute I can&#x27;t really tell..</li>
            <li> I mean really can a cream remove cellulite forever?</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing a cellulite cream at first, but after reading some positive reviews I decided to give Finulite a try.</li>
            <li> Fortunately my cellulite isn&#x27;t bad, but it has made it almost completely disappear!</li>
            <li> I will order this product again and can&#x27;t wait to see the results with long term use!</li>
            <li> It appeared to be just like any other generic lotion.</li>
            <li> but this product is the same as other product on the market..</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take too long to see results!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product due to stretch marks I have on my legs.</li>
            <li> This product also came wwith other helpful reviews from people with the same problem I was having.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any other reason why these should have suddenly shown up.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have commented, you do need to continue with toning exercises, use a stimulator before applying the creams, and apply them twice a day religiously to see results.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t even have too much cellulite, just a few little spots on my upper thighs that show a little bit when I wear my short shorts or my bathing suit, and it still haven&#x27;t done anything.</li>
            <li> Other than hydrating initially</li>
            <li> my cellulite is due to gaining and losing weight several times</li>
            <li> In other words, if it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims...get your money back.</li>
            <li> I use it not only on my thighs and butt, but on my arms, stomach and other areas of my body too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I found the analog of this compound in 60% cocoa chocolate bar from the grocery store (theobromine) and at the time I was not looking for theophylline but since they are structural analogs the second peak in my chromatogram may have been that compound (smaller amount) - I did not have the standard at the time for both compounds.</li>
            <li> Ordered This Product and It Lasted Me 3 Weeks Due To The Fact That I Have Very Big Thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In about the span of 18 months, I went from a six 4 to a six 8 and then back to a size 4 due to illness</li>
            <li> the past year, I did everything it took go from 260 pounds back down to my normal weight of 180 pounds;</li>
            <li> no mess, no strong fragrance</li>
            <li> The amount of cream you get is very minimal and if you have larger areas you are applying it to</li>
            <li> Along with that I use the finulite cream, dry brush and this soap.</li>
            <li> I try to remember to do dry brushing before using the PM cream.</li>
            <li> Along with the Finulite, I dry brush my skin every morning</li>
            <li> They all tend to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> i can feel the tightening effects but it doesn&#x27;t hurt or dry out your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> started talking glucosamine supplements, dry brushing my legs once a day with a Tampico skin brush, and got a 1.5mm micro needling roller and Finulite along with the Finulite mitt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a different yet in the appearance of my cellulite, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days...</li>
            <li> I would say that the bottles last approximately 2.5 months, depending on how much you put on.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using the products for a few weeks, but the difference is minimal (even after exercising, and watching my diet).</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;ve barely nothing, but I&#x27;ve lost a little weight also</li>
            <li> so I do not miss a single day.</li>
            <li> Now I do not know how finulite works without exercise, because I always try to stay fit as its not easy for me to stay naturally thin, but I recommend this product to boost workout results.</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad just like other products in fact it has a really nice smell and also moistures the area you apply.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small, so don&#x27;t be surprised by that.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple creams, diets and exercises to get rid of cellulite with no success, but I have already started to notice results with finulite.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product because it was so cheap compared to other cellulite products out there</li>
            <li> I am not able to give the product 5 stars yet, Still too early to tell.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered the product I ordered two sets which lasted approximately six weeks</li>
            <li> The only thing which has ever made a dramatic difference for me is very intensive, strength-based exercise (ballet, pilates, etc.</li>
            <li> I was down to a size 6, but felt you could still see my dimples through the back of my pants.  </li>
            <li> I have confidence in this product and how it works because it has medically proven components that break down cellulite</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long before I saw an improvement!!  </li>
            <li> However, a forced sedentary lifestyle following a major car accident 3 years ago has caused my cellulite to run rampant.</li>
            <li> At night, I lightly used the roller, (sanitized with alcohol after each time I use it) and applied the \\&quot;PM\\&quot; cream; instead of a burning sensation I felt a new very cold feeling in my stomach from the PM</li>
            <li> I am on to my third bottle in two and a half months</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for less than two weeks</li>
            <li> I have noticed less cellulite and definitely my skin is firmer.  </li>
            <li> I went through two rounds of this stuff along side of dry brushing and using the dermaroller and had absolutely no improvement whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and half</li>
            <li> was just not realistic.</li>
            <li> I did think I noticed a slight tightness in an area or two, so that was enough to give me hope!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and my deep stretch marks have gotten smoother and even are less visible.</li>
            <li> After several weeks I am seeing a slight improvement of the tightness of the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been losing weight over the past few years but the backs of my legs and outer thighs still had dimples regardless of how much muscle I gained.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and a half, and have seen a noticable reduction in the cellulite on the back of my legs!</li>
            <li> Getting old stinks and watching my body turn to jello is such a terrible experience; I&#x27;m doing my best to fight back!</li>
            <li> I have been using it religiously for the past 3 weeks and have only missed 1 time applying the PM treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams now and then, but results seemed to take so long to achieve.</li>
            <li> I began applying this daily, morning and night, no special technique during the summer.  </li>
            <li> I have many slight dimples and one deep one that bothers me really bad on each leg.</li>
            <li> I am close to finishing my first month and have noticed a dramatic difference, I have been doing cellulite removal</li>
            <li> But you need to be little bit patient and regular in use.</li>
            <li> The bottles were a little smaller than I was expecting also.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the bottles are too little.</li>
            <li> I saw my belly get a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I have just purchases a second set of lotions and will continue to use this little miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been doing step and cardio classes for several years with little improvement on the outer thigh.  </li>
            <li> That was last November, and still to this day in September of the following year, I still have pain at the incision sites and I&#x27;m even numb in certain parts of my backside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also decided to try it on my upper inner thighs to see if it would help firm them a little</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to make it, using with different products and at different times, never did a thing.</li>
            <li> I am above average when it comes to the average women.</li>
            <li> I will go back to the product I used before because at least it was starting to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I get about 6 weeks of use from the set using only on trouble areas.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this stuff for a few days and already see some improvements...</li>
            <li> I am not a big person by any means, at 5&#x27;1 and 113 lbs, and I work out everyday</li>
            <li> Never really saw any changes.</li>
            <li> its now may im on my 2nd round now</li>
            <li> Just use the pink bottle in the morning or after shower and use the purple bottle before bed.</li>
            <li> I think the mitten helps too--I only massage a few minutes where needed and use the creams as directed.</li>
            <li> I did not really expect it to work, but I figured that I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been buying it ever since (roughly 5 months).</li>
            <li> Fatgirlslimulator Stimulating Massage Tool&amp;#34; and saw absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> My bottles are almost empty and</li>
            <li> (pink bottle on the morning, purple bottle before going to sleep) for two months but didn&#x27;t see any improvement on the cellulite appearance, so</li>
            <li> Total waste.  </li>
            <li> Bottles are empty but cellulite is still there with no signs of reduction.  </li>
            <li> After I dried off I would apply finulite and massage it deep into the skin for several minutes focusing on the trouble spots.</li>
            <li> did absolutely no difference</li>
            <li> This product does not really work.</li>
            <li> I have some cellulite on my arms, and not a whole lot of it.</li>
            <li> and I find this curious..</li>
            <li> Aged Skin</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 3 weeks ago, pink bottle in the morning after my shower.</li>
            <li> Not much product to use liberally.</li>
            <li> This is my second round with this product.</li>
            <li> I am always weary of cellulite-reducing products because I&#x27;ve tried others with absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> im on my second round of finulite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been analyzing the reviews for a few of the different cellulite cream-all of which I&#x27;ve tried and purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon, discounted at about 50% of the website rate about 6 weeks ago and both bottles are now nearly empty.</li>
            <li> This is my second round of using Finulite.</li>
            <li> I use the pink bottle in the morning and the purple bottle in the evening.  </li>
            <li> three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had saggy messy cellulite all over my legs (front back &amp; side)</li>
            <li> put on the AM pink cream and do some reps of squats and lunges.</li>
            <li> It takes a few months of regular use in order to see improvement.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect so dont expect 100% success overnight but rubbing it in throughly and continuing to use it every day will give you results.</li>
            <li> This product couldn&#x27;t be simpler to use...purple bottle at night, pink in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have seen an over increase in my cellulite reduction in the last few months.</li>
            <li> I fell for the empty promises advertising.</li>
            <li> Since last Monday, I tried to apply them on my body everyday, two times a week.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no change in my cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have noticed smoother skin when I use both lotions every day (pink in the am, purple in the pm)</li>
            <li> In all, the results are minimal.</li>
            <li> but it is harder to see it now</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I noticed some of the cellulite starting to disappear.  </li>
            <li> I did not really know if I had what is considered to be cellulite</li>
            <li> As I expected the lotion helped to release trapped toxins under the skin (a big part of celluite)</li>
            <li> I do notice a difference in cellulite appearance already, not a huge difference, but it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> The 2 step cream paired with dry brushing before showering and using my finulite massager during my shower has drastically changed the tone of my skin!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these creams for about a week and a half and even inconsistently, but I must say that it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Finulite and have purchased at least 4 sets!</li>
            <li> very expensive products, easy to put in and</li>
            <li> I have no want or need to even be curious about other products because this one does the job.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and hard to squeeze out of the bottles, so I added a little water and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I am not certain as I was also doing other things like lipomassages and exercising with dieting.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My big dimple on my thigh that has been a constant annoyance since I was 16 was hardly noticeable!</li>
            <li> i will admit, the packaging appeared a little juvenile and i was not sure how well it would really work.  </li>
            <li> But regarding to the stubborn fat and ugly skin on my inner thigh, I believe this product is super</li>
            <li> but I cut bottles in half and transferred am stuff in an empty jar I had and pm stuff in another empty jar.</li>
            <li> but nothing like other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> only drawback is the bottles are small and the price tag is not.</li>
            <li> Once you stop (also because the bottles are quite small), it comes back again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;it makes skin tighter and smoother and together with other measures</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first about buying this product</li>
            <li> I had not changed anything in my routine other than this.</li>
            <li> Other cellulite creams leave you feeling sticky but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and these past 3 months i totally can see a change in apperance and smoothness!!!</li>
            <li> The other reviews said it diminishes cellulite.  </li>
            <li> compared to other sites.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a miracle cream that the other reviews bragged about.</li>
            <li> after spending so much on other products</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I decided to try Finulite.</li>
            <li> Give it time, as you would do with any other product, but you will see results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first since nothing else has worked to include ultrasonic cavitation, as well as strict diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase the scrubbing brush because I did not want to bruise my legs - as other reviewers had mentioned</li>
            <li> Nor will I ever try other ones.</li>
            <li> some other brands which have not worked for me.</li>
            <li> and I prefer the other one I bought - slim extreme 3d.</li>
            <li> Maybe my cellulite is extremely stubborn.</li>
            <li> other things were used?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things but they either smell not to my liking or</li>
            <li> I feel I owe it to other users to share my happiness.&lt;br /&gt;Finulite works.</li>
            <li> Then I got mine in the other day ....</li>
            <li> She stated to use the roller every other day depending on my tolerance level of the pain.</li>
            <li> I am normal weight to thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was thinking expecting a lotion to help something that really only exercise and diet</li>
            <li> but I gave it a shot after reading other product reviews.</li>
            <li> I decided also that if it can work on my thighs, it can work on any other part of my body too.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but then I kept at it</li>
            <li> I do not have bruising like other</li>
            <li> I used other creams before and was disappointed,  but decided to try this product because many people recommended it.  </li>
            <li> I might just try other product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but kept applying it morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to do a lot of massaging to see results as some of the other customers have claimed to have to do.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order again when I need assistance keeping any excessive cellulite at bay.</li>
            <li> Unlike every other cellulite cream I&#x27;d tried in the past (several!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and even running and working out 5 days a week.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and they don&#x27;t even come close to the results of this one.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m usually up and out the door in 10 minutes and am not used to spending extra time to just put on lotion)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as to getting this</li>
            <li> The bottles are small but they last about a month</li>
            <li> Because The Appearance Of&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite Has Extremely Diminished</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I was hopeful this would help</li>
            <li> The only problem with this is that the bottles are so small, that by the time it starts working, you&#x27;ve run out....</li>
            <li> With proper exercise, diet and this product cellulite can be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> When I received the cream I followed some of the advice I read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Also as mentioned in other reviews, the smell is another</li>
            <li> First of all, I am an extremely skeptical person.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other cellulite products with no results.  </li>
            <li> Finulite mitt I use in the shower once a day, and the other time a day I just use it with the cream.</li>
            <li> Like Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Slimming Serum Anti-Cellulite Fat Burner and Slim Extreme 3D Spa Active Sculpting Stomach and Buttocks (used them both twice) which felt sticky and made you sweat...and did not burn any fat (for me</li>
            <li> And let me tell you, I weigh about 127, but I always had the worst cellulite on my legs, since I was young, and i tried everything and nothing worked and now, they have never looked better.</li>
            <li> am a 32 active woman with cellulite.</li>
            <li> The bottle is half empty</li>
            <li> Her feedback after roughly three months is that her skin is starting to appears tighter, and therefore cellulite is slowly smoothing out.</li>
            <li> I am not very diligent at using this both day and night, but I at least apply it once daily.</li>
            <li> After about 2  weeks of using it twice a day I started to notice that it was smoothing out the dimples on the front and back of my legs, way worse on the back of my legs then</li>
            <li> In order to see a difference, you have to apply it everyday morning and night in a circular motion, rub it in all the way until its dry on the skin.</li>
            <li> I still have a few trouble spots on back of thighs that seem resistant to exercise.  </li>
            <li> As a consumer that has used many cellulite creams this has to be by far the worst.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a tiny negative is that the bottles are so small but other</li>
            <li> The bottle is hard to squeeze though (hard plastic) and the cream is super thick, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was a coincidence or not; however, I started noticing a slight difference in the appearance of my upper legs.</li>
            <li> thought I had been working out extra hard.</li>
            <li> Derma-rolling is a system in which a roller is used to \\&quot;break up hard fat, open clogged pores, and increases collagen production.</li>
            <li> I no longer feel comfortable wearing shorts because the cellulite is so bad.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad cellulite, especially on the sides of my thighs.</li>
            <li> but i did have one area that was getting pretty bad on my left thigh.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s, and a former college athlete who continues to stay in shape (hitting the gym 4 to 5 times a week).  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I got tired of the routine and gave up.</li>
            <li> Also, for the price, the amount that you get and the results that you see it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting on a dark bronzer to hide the cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> unfortunately don&#x27;t see any real improvement.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice, and I believe it made a slight improvement  but very subtle and disappointing for how often it has to be applied.</li>
            <li> This sucks im going to send it back</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of different lotions to get rid of cellulite for at least 6 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been less active, and have noticed a lot of cellulite building on my thighs.  </li>
            <li> Sad to say it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe, maybe not, because I don&#x27;t know which one is the real product, there gotta be a fake one out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I stopped using the derma roller because it was small and took too long.</li>
            <li> , I would not recommend this product, it is not worth the money does not meet my espectations</li>
            <li> Good luck to all who are fighting this annoying battle!</li>
            <li> but I am starting to slowly see some results.</li>
            <li> In other words these are not special compounds in terms of rarity.</li>
            <li> is starting to slow down on me in my mid-30s)</li>
            <li> I started seeing all the positive reviews of Finulite on Amazon, being a little skeptical, I decided to give it a try, and am completly sold on this product.</li>
            <li> It has kept the appearance down some</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product every time the bottles get down to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I sat down, you could see it, and when I stood up, you could see the lumps and grooves.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to wear them down to my knees.</li>
            <li> This is the pattern for the -Slim Extreme 3D, Slim Fat Girl Bliss &amp; Finulite-all of which I have tried with little to no improvement.  </li>
            <li> I think maybe a little, but not as much as other people who have reviewed.</li>
            <li> I started to diet very poorly these last 2 to 3 years due to a lot of financial stress that was pushed on to me.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have not a big problem but at least I was hopping to reduce a little</li>
            <li> Not perfect but for a cream and little to no exercise, I really cannot complain.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m over half way through the bottle already.</li>
            <li> If you look at the website, it looks extremely gimmicky and dishonest (especially the testimonial photos).</li>
            <li> Unable to get product out of bottle without total physical approach of banging the bottle....repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and can see a slight improvement.  </li>
            <li> It seems tighter, and my cellulite is less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I used it for two consecutive cycles now and although no miracles there, i do believe there might be a slight improvement...</li>
            <li> I have slight cellulite on the backs of my legs since I&#x27;ve had my 2 boys.</li>
            <li> I am going to Cancun in a month and a half</li>
            <li> But, if you put it on every day, exfoliate, and not eat for a half hour after in the morning (as directed on bottle)</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t even work on slight cellulite.</li>
            <li> , it looks firmer, a lot less cellulite</li>
            <li> NEVER FINISHED USING THE TUBES AS ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH NEVER</li>
            <li> my cellulite diminished about 85% in less 2weeks..</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot less dimpled.  </li>
            <li> I took a before picture of the back of my legs (scary stuff) and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if this stuff actually worked.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not a quick fix.</li>
            <li> After one months use and about a week in on my second bottles, I have noticed serious results as my thighs have smoothed out and seem firmer.</li>
            <li> applied and less noticeable cellulite dimples.  </li>
            <li> In the last year or so, I ended a very stressful, ugly relationship.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about purchasing cellulite lotions, because most are fraudulent and useless products.</li>
            <li> I half hearted thought I was wasting my money</li>
            <li> I have used about half bottle</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s already less noticeable cellulite on my legs.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a slight change.  </li>
            <li> I did this for about a week and a half and didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> Less dimple in the thighs, and butt.</li>
            <li> I have had cellulite for years and as I get older it gets worse!</li>
            <li> I had tried Nivea Cellulite lotion in the past and saw absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> After surviving cancer and going through early menopause from the multiple rounds of chemo and radiation treatments, I felt as if my cellulite was getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little less than 2 months now and nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other products that produced no results whatsoever!</li>
            <li> That in conjunction with yoga, I saw a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;I got very busy at work and was unable to keep up the routine and saw things return to less than desirable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just a little little less cellulite</li>
            <li> With in a few days I noticed my legs looked alot less lumpy.</li>
            <li> Shockingly, when I applied the cream, I felt a very hot/burning sensation from applying the cream I didn&#x27;t feel the first time around.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be disappointed in the size of the bottles (I was worried when I first saw them) because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very small and only apply on the back and side of my thighs.im only afraid that if I stop using it..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product of as little as 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream just for a little over one week, and already see noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a little smoother to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for a little over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> For the little time I&#x27;ve been using it, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The little dimples seem to be smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was using this product and saw a little difference</li>
            <li> There is no significant result for the money your having to dish out.</li>
            <li> when I ordered this little miracle lotion they HAD to have some.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little think for a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 4 weeks now</li>
            <li> Maybe it just takes a little while longer?</li>
            <li> and I saw little to NO difference.  </li>
            <li> I thought I noticed a little improvement</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little cream that could allow me to endulge every once in awhile without the fear of the cellulite being there....</li>
            <li> Also, the bottles have so little product for the price.</li>
            <li> I started to see some improvement in the structure of my skin, it seems a little smoother.</li>
            <li> After having my son 2 years ago, the small amount of cellulite I had got dramatically worse, and eating healthy and exercising just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> My wife has a little bit cellulite</li>
            <li> I do see a little bit of a difference which is why I gave the product 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> It has always made me extremely self-conscious, usually barring me from wearing shorts during the summer (which of course is never comfortable.)  </li>
            <li> and I would not use one without the other!!</li>
            <li> I use this lotion in conjunction with a hand massager that I got on Amazon for about $8.00, so honestly to me to see a difference in disgusting cellulite for so little money, I just cannot pass it by.  </li>
            <li> 2: pink bottle had a pink very thick cream that smelled like citrus.</li>
            <li> I am noticing my stretch marks have faded to my natural skin color ( and are not visible unless stretching my skin with my fingers from  deep painful when I touched them red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have spent countless amounts of money on expensive products that promise to do the trick, but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use the cream everyday and night on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> and I have missed a few days, but I have already notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Even though I used up all the seaweed soap I still use a loofah everyday to increase skin circulation and exfoliate with the Jergens.</li>
            <li> I have just about finished round 1 of these products.</li>
            <li> For those of us who already thin by proper diet and exercise, there was no difference.</li>
            <li> I need a few gift sets, please email me.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> its just the same cream separated in 2 bottles so it can look like they have a secret formula,which they dont..</li>
            <li> I have used almost everyday morning and night.</li>
            <li> So it took me a few weeks to stick to the routine.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just slap it on like a body lotion and expect it to work, use your fist to massage it into the trouble areas.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on the lotion.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> If I had a time machine, I&#x27;d slap this terrible product out of my own hand before I ever put it on.</li>
            <li> (lots of thin people I know have cellulite, so it&#x27;s definitely not a fat people thing).</li>
            <li> waste of money...</li>
            <li> She used it as instructed everyday</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvements in my stretch marks, seemed like a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of my money and time</li>
            <li> You can see the results withing a few days.</li>
            <li> This might work for someone with a very small area to treat, but I would recommend you try other things first, no matter how desperate you are.</li>
            <li> waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I was obsessed with who could see it, and conscious about wearing shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally went through approximately 2 sets a month.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money time and effort.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks</li>
            <li> I swear I could feel it tingling and working after a few applications.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Money wasted</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just a waste.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the combination of working out and using Finulite or just the Finulite itself, but after using it for approximately two months, there was a much, much smaller amount of dimples on my rear and thighs.  </li>
            <li> In fact I am sending a set to my sister who lives in Spain cause there is not available yet.&lt;br /&gt;Esta</li>
            <li> I also bought some neoprene workout pants and decided to apply the finulite AM on my thighs and butt everyday before my workout with the neoprene pants and then apply the finulite PM one after my nighttime shower.</li>
            <li> Makes me think they are not genuine at all.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and noticed and difference in just a few days, and</li>
            <li> I go to the gym a few times a week and still have cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive professional aesthetic cellulite systems but with no luck....</li>
            <li> It was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I tried a few over the counter creams and gels from the drugstore with no luck.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a cream that works for a few years now</li>
            <li> I have used a few cellulite reducing creams including nivea for a while with no results.</li>
            <li> I have used this everyday as instructed and I have not seen a difference in the pits in my leg.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few products here and there.</li>
            <li> Its been a few weeks</li>
            <li> and I can see it smoothing out my trouble areas.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money</li>
            <li> But for now, it&#x27;s been a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and it absorbs within a few minutes into my skin, and it does not come off on my clothing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have had celulite for few years now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product .....</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> You stop for a few days, and it seems the effect is gone..</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> The reason I make mention of that is because in my despair, I started eating way too much fatty, sugared foods, which increased the amount of cellulite I have as well as the area it is located.</li>
            <li> I keep looking everyday, as we all do, and am hoping it continues to diminish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my progress again in a few months.</li>
            <li> It is just a matter of an everyday routine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a guy that exercises everyday.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I use a body brush to remove dead skin, then apply Finulite.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal</li>
            <li> I used the lotion faithfully (as directed: morning and night, on an empty stomach) until both bottles were empty (approximately a month).</li>
            <li> I am a little overweight, but hardly wore shorts or skirts due to cellulite.</li>
            <li> So I can truly say the cellulite on my thighs is less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I also started using the PM cream on the stretch marks on my breasts because it helps build collagen and elasticity, its made my breasts firmer and stretch marks less noticible!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin firming up a bit and can tell a slight improvement over the past month.</li>
            <li> I think my results were due to all my hard work in losing body fat as well as massaging in this product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I would recommend at least giving it a try before you move on to other products.</li>
            <li> It might as well been plain hand cream.</li>
            <li> it  even helps with a stiff neck.  </li>
            <li> the price needs to come down a little bit at least (without compromising quantity or quality of the product).</li>
            <li> Also there is no strong odor (like some)</li>
            <li> and I would see dramatic results the second time around.</li>
            <li> Too bad, but give it a try, the first month I used it everyday</li>
            <li> cellulite massager and the small dimples on the back of my legs have definitely decreased in size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties, I grew up in competitive sports, I eat well, and I lead an active life.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will keep everything at least looking a little less aweful.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous drug store and expensive creams and get no real result!!</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad cellulite on my legs that I had been trying to get rid of by working out for a couple of months, but that just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.</li>
            <li> so my cellulite was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting on this cellulite cream everyday (morning and night) for the past month or so.</li>
            <li> and although I worked out briefly for periods of time in the past (10-15 years ago), I have suffered from cellulite since my mid-20s and it has progressively gotten worse over the past 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the past 6 weeks, I&#x27;ve been religiously using both AM and PM bottles and have noticed a dramatic change.</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable, I started seeing a difference in my skin after about 10 days, it was smoother and with less cellulite!</li>
            <li> At night, it gets so late sometimes that I just go ahead and put the cream on without any previous area cleaning or washing.</li>
            <li> Every little bit helps!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottles are small and if you get a bad packaging job you are likely to loose half of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hands down!!</li>
            <li> I had very little cellulite on the front side of my thighs, and now it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li> you are like me and used other products that just didn&#x27;t cut it, TRY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> My thighs were really that bad.</li>
            <li> Since, I hadn&#x27;t had any time to exercise for the past 6 months</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> They are relatively small bottles</li>
            <li> They usually say cremes don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Because if I&#x27;ve seen some small changes within 3 1/2 weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually (ever) do product reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have had procedures done in the past to help reduce the appearance of cellulite but nothing ever seems to give me the results I am looking for.</li>
            <li> And I am a small person, but as an RN I know that cellulite is a battle the majority of us women have to deal with.</li>
            <li> In closing, it is no magic in a bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this is not a miracle cure, I have seen a decrease in my cellulite the past month.</li>
            <li> I had been reading that there was no magic cream to get rid of cellulite</li>
            <li> I have been using finulite for the past 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> Not magical, but I do see a difference.</li>
            <li> After using this product for the past 3-4 weeks, along with the Finulite Anti Cellulite Treatment Skin Exfoliating Soap I have been seeing noticeable difference in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> the bottles are small too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the 5 star reviews this product has received.</li>
            <li> Had cavi-lipo also before this for cellulite but not sure lany of it works.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to continue, but I am not sure that I will.</li>
            <li> However,  you must follow the directions and use it EVERYDAY!  </li>
            <li> There is no magic cream to get rid of cellulite (I&#x27;ve tried them all), but I do think that this cream along with diet and exercise (tons of leg lifts and glut focused workout-DVD) and skin brushing does help to &amp;#34;reduce the appearance of cellutite&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I find that if I don&#x27;t use it I am prone to small cellulite bumps on the backs of my thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s working, but I like the way it smells and feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I only wish that it wasn&#x27;t so difficult to squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Finulite lotions for about 4 weeks and have seen a small improvement in the appearance of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I been using finulite for the past 3 months</li>
            <li> My cellulite isn&#x27;t getting better or worst.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem was, but discarded the product.</li>
            <li> With the PM I would usually massage the area as well.</li>
            <li> a scale if 1-10, 10 being the most horrific (think cover of trashy celeb magazine)</li>
            <li> Small bottles.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the packaging as the bottles are too small it made my jaw drops when I received them in the mail.</li>
            <li> And a small warning, these bottles are small.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up with the AM solution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I think this cream is working.  </li>
            <li> It has helped me lose my belly fat, get firmer thighs and a tighter butt - with no more cellulite.</li>
            <li> I used alot of products in the past but will never trade this for anything.</li>
            <li> No cellulite will dissapear quickly in a few days!</li>
            <li> Have been using for past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Need to do it everyday and you will see results!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did nothing for my stubborn cellulite, even after using it religiously morning and night for weeks on end.</li>
            <li> For the past month, I have taking between 5-10 minutes per day to massage each cream into my skin.</li>
            <li> Plus the bottles are way too small for the price.</li>
            <li> I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT USING FINULITE~ CELLULITE</li>
            <li> I spent over $60 to get rid of this itchy, irritating rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cellulite lotions in the past and couldn&#x27;t stick to it because they didn&#x27;t absorb well</li>
            <li> used different and expensive creams before with no results, but after using Finulite for for 2 weeks I started noticing changes and now after 2 months I would say about 75% is gone from my legs and tights.  </li>
            <li> am now past my 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product works</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for the past couple weeks now</li>
            <li> have tried other cellulite creams, and was not happy with the results and cost.</li>
            <li> PEG-100 stearate and other artificial chemicals whose names are so long and complex</li>
            <li> I had used other creams that tingled and smelled so bad that I would wait several hours before I would leave home.</li>
            <li> It is no better than a common moisturizer,  so</li>
            <li> I have been only using this product for 4 days, but I am afraid to continue using it because I feel that it has actually made my cellulite worse!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed considering the amount of money I spent for such a small amount of cream that doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> and I believe these positive reviews are fake!!</li>
            <li> Also I found the bottles to be very stiff in squeezing out the creams.</li>
            <li> The smell is not very pleasant</li>
            <li> Look cheap and small disgusting.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment and waste of money!</li>
            <li> I am quite small already and only have a little cellulite (i would give it 2/10) and was shocked to see no difference seeing as i have used it every day correctly.</li>
            <li> I work out hard, run, eat</li>
            <li> The Mitt just has plastic hard knobbies on it and according to the directions you&#x27;re supposed to push and twist into your skin.</li>
            <li> I have hard time to get the cream out of bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard to squeeze out of the bottle</li>
            <li> are hard to squezze product out</li>
            <li> The plastic is really hard, it takes both hands to get the cream out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s based solely on the fact that I couldn&#x27;t hardly get the product out of the tube.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get the amount you need when it is closer to the end.  </li>
            <li> My cellulite is hardly noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li> It is hard to squeeze the bottle to get the cream out.</li>
            <li> Itz hard to squeeze</li>
            <li> I am pushing hard,</li>
            <li> and I figure I won&#x27;t need to push as hard as the cellulite continues to disappear.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m thin, 103lbs, with just a little but of bumpiness on the backs and sides of my thighs and bottom.</li>
            <li> Awful product.....smells cheap, hard to get product out of bottle, no results on cellulite reduction.  </li>
            <li> I am a 33 year old woman,  I have really bad cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend that you use it with the Finulite Massager and you follow the instructions and use it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> I now wish I had taken \\&quot;before\\&quot; photos, and am commited to using the product for at least another 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this product is working for me, a change in diet and at least 20-25 minutes of exercise assist in the process of reducing cellulite.</li>
            <li> It has reduced the visible signs of cellulite by at least 50%.</li>
            <li> But, I wish i could have at least seen some improvement.</li>
            <li> That is disappointing, for the price, both bottles should have enough to use on arms and legs.</li>
            <li> what the heck, I&#x27;ll give this a try and at 26 bucks, I can afford to at least try it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> but sadly it did not reduce even the minimal amount of cellulite I was hoping to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I have lost over 135lbs with diet and exercise in 12 months and am quite unhappy with how my skin has been left.</li>
            <li> At least I tried it</li>
            <li> I had been trying everything before for to attack and improve my cellulite in my legs and button,and nothing worked at all lately.</li>
            <li> ugh, sucks.</li>
            <li> I cold see a difference in the tone in my legs, but not necessarily a reduction in the cellulite.</li>
            <li> but I will work on those after I use this product for at least 6 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> it works really slow.  </li>
            <li> but it started to get pricey with no amazing results.</li>
            <li> The deeper pockets are slow to respond.</li>
            <li> I did notice that once I ran out of this lotion that my legs (problem area) slowly started to look the way they did pre-lotion.</li>
            <li> Both creams are so thick you have to twist the cap off to get it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but these new ones I don&#x27;t see any change :( .</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Stay away from fatty foods and avoid a lot of carbonated drinks which contribute to cellulite!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price compared to other expensive cellulite creams.  </li>
            <li> Only wish the bottles weren&#x27;t so difficult to squeeze!</li>
            <li> In saying that I mean that I have always cared about my appearance.</li>
            <li> When I do loose weight its all over, so my bad shape remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the creams for about two weeks I started to notice a slight reduction in the amount of fat on my stomach.</li>
            <li> I did get horrible bruises on the the first few massages</li>
            <li> I have had a major issue with my thighs and that ugly word &amp;#34;CELLULITE&amp;#34;for awhile now</li>
            <li> I tried this for 2 months and while it made my legs soft, my cellulite is still there :(</li>
            <li> I use a small amount (approximately one tablespoon per leg) and massage it into my legs for about two minutes until the product disappears.</li>
            <li> , they are very stiff and its very hard to get the cream out of the bottle..</li>
            <li> They smell like some low-priced artificial toilet air freshener that really makes you sick!</li>
            <li> but it is seriously reduced.</li>
            <li> Showing subtle yet noticeable results in just one week.</li>
            <li> But, if you want a less expensive product, this one does work, just not as well.</li>
            <li> However, the cream is thick and very hard to squeeze from the bottle.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is sticky and very thick and doesn&#x27;t work well with hard bottle that you can&#x27;t squeeze.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to anyone, I already ordered my next month to keep the progress going, I don&#x27;t have really bad skin to begin with, but what I do have is vanishing in combination with the finulite cellulite  remover mitt.</li>
            <li> My thighs were looking really bad and the skin was starting to sag.</li>
            <li> I stopped for a few days, and my troubled spots returned to what they were when I started.  </li>
            <li> I am not good at this</li>
            <li> this product is not good for cellulite</li>
            <li> Only painful legs with no change at all.  </li>
            <li> &quot; in my stomach transformed into thin layers of scarred skin, from thick layers of rippled skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My cellulite was very bad in some spots but only in those spots is it still slightly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, never really saw as big of a difference as when I used the Nivea brand.</li>
            <li> This sucks!  </li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> after the first time I used it I ended up having horrific bumps all over my butt and thighs and discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I think the collagen building complex in the pm cream is filling them in!</li>
            <li> Over the past 10 years I&#x27;ve spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on expensive cellulite creams and treatments but nothing seemed to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> For this price, it is also a hope it is helping, that at least I am doing something!</li>
            <li> In my late 20&#x27;s and cant seem to get rid of it!</li>
            <li> I used it until the last drop, nothing happened :-(</li>
            <li> Im normally very hard to please so for me to say something works</li>
            <li> It is very hard to use it.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t name names, but some of them smell bad and flake when they dry.  </li>
            <li> &quot; my skin is 75% tighter over all, before I could pull my stomach skin out a few disgusting inches, now I barely can even pinch my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had no skin irritation or any other unpleasant experience with the product consistency and smell.</li>
            <li> Purple bottle had a very thick purple cream in it.</li>
            <li> Although I am thin and I exercised I have always had cellulite.</li>
            <li> This product truly is lifechanging after struggling with cellulite and even trying velashape which in my case made me look worse</li>
            <li> I wil recommend this product to anyone who is tired of cottish cheese on their body.</li>
            <li> To me it looks like my cellulite has gotten worse.</li>
            <li> i knew i was tired of my cellulite</li>
            <li> I made some poor eating choices throughout those times and, of course...</li>
            <li> Alas.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t noticed before and now feel worse about my legs than before I used this.</li>
            <li> I am a thin woman</li>
            <li> If I forget to put it on at night or morning a couple times you can see a change for the worse in your legs.  </li>
            <li> I follow the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and would estimate that I use the product approximately 6-8 times per week.  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of cellulite on my legs that got even worse after having my son.</li>
            <li> Not a great deal.</li>
            <li> I am thin, work out, eat well, but have some cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The severity of the cellulite has decreased, the skin is smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> I started using Finulite approximately 3 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I am plum skinny, but no matter how thin you are esp during swim suite season</li>
            <li> The product does not smell bad like other reviews said.</li>
            <li> It seems impossible, but I would estimate 65-75% less cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid when I opened the package at 1st as I saw 2 tiny &amp; yet very expensive bottles inside.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after about 1 week, and now almost a month in I see a dramatic change.</li>
            <li> This product works well: within three days of use, I noticed a dramatic difference in the appearance and texture of the fat deposits, and the results have lasted since I finished the Finulite 6 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I use these day and night and have noticed a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> I can see a dramatic difference in my problem areas.  </li>
            <li> I have severe cellulite, so it&#x27;s not gone, but it has made a dramatic difference in just one month.</li>
            <li> but recently I developed really nasty cellulite on my nutt and thighs and this product definately decreased the appearance of it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product after seeing all the hype from the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It is also very thick and difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> small thing but its annoying (to me at least).</li>
            <li> and you can clearly see my terrible cellulite.</li>
            <li> so if your cellulite is very bad I can&#x27;t say you&#x27;ll have the same experience</li>
            <li> Not great, but for $20 and not using it the entire 6 weeks as directed, it wasn&#x27;t terrible results either.</li>
            <li> I saw some slight toning effects but  I couldn&#x27;t get past the horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> I have hated my cellulite for some time and although it is not completely gone yet</li>
            <li> I mean this stuff works!!</li>
            <li> but ill keep using and watch the results</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!</li>
            <li> needless to say</li>
            <li> ; And he was standing behind me!  </li>
            <li> As an RN, I was skeptical that it would help but wanted to try just in case.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided that I was only going to look in the mirror every 7 days...to avoid disappointment... ,,,!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too expensive since it does work for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try yet another cream......</li>
            <li> Beware these fake products, this stuff should be boycotted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Difficult to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> you saved my life from this cheese cellulite, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of creams and none of them worked , sad</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about the product, but I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> For the cost of the how can you go wrong..</li>
            <li> Perhaps some fake reviewers trying to mark as unhelpful so that this review is not seen?)</li>
            <li> Sorry folks.</li>
            <li> , I thought I couldn&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this</li>
            <li> the price is just way out there expensive.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical at the comparitive results Finulite would offer.  </li>
            <li> , I just want to warn people here about the fake reviews posted.</li>
            <li> , I suppose I was just insecure and vulnerable at the moment of purchase here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a review on here saying this could be a fake or a change in lotion</li>
            <li> wondering, like others, if they could be fake.</li>
            <li> I expensively obtained my goal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical about this product, but have an upcoming beach vacation and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I will be 43 in December ,needless to say, my thighs have noticeable cellulite.</li>
            <li> sad reality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive to replenish every month, but I have seen a difference and will continue using it until stop seeing results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the 4oz expensive creams that claim they do it.</li>
            <li> On the contrary i would say that after I stopped using it for some time my cellulite became worse than ever!</li>
            <li> Basically, I paid for expensive, nice-smelling lotions.</li>
            <li> please try it,I swear by it!no need to use expensive useless creams or åay expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> I feel really silly for buying thinking it would work because it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The five stars review on the Amazon is fake?</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now and unless I am doing something wrong</li>
            <li> No cream will get rid of your cellulite, that is a sad realization for me.</li>
            <li> I was &amp; still am somewhat skeptical</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is difficult for me to notice changes with my body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read tons of articles saying that cellulite creams are a waste of money, and yet I stupidly bought this product anyway.</li>
            <li> I placed an order and received the wrong product by mistake.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying any cellulite reduction cream</li>
            <li> Loreal, Nivea, really expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> All these reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moreover I just got an email from some &#x27;Pete&#x27; blaming my comment as fake.</li>
            <li> I have been using finulite for about 3 months (not every day unfortunately, I was travelling)</li>
            <li> and I am addicted!</li>
            <li> What a lousy way to treat your customer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work for me, maybe it will for you.</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical about this.</li>
            <li> not even a little bit and is bad for you!</li>
            <li> The disappointing part is that I got even worst cellulite in the next two months when I didn&#x27;t use the cream.</li>
            <li> The plus side of this product is it doesn&#x27;t have the awful smell some of the other products do.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the tingle or horrible menthol smell like other creams.</li>
            <li> Maybe if my skin were dried out and nasty to start with</li>
            <li> It was a terrible waste of money for me.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unhappy with.</li>
            <li> Another disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am been using  finulite for one month and l can see the results  don&#x27;t be afraid to buy you</li>
            <li> I have been working out like crazy</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in that  the liquid in both bottles of Finulite is too thick to dispense.</li>
            <li> is that the bottles are very difficult to use</li>
            <li> Of course I was very skeptical, but after seeing the reviews here on Amazon</li>
            <li> very sad of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ilary</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some very expensive cellulite treatments and they don&#x27;t come close to beating this product.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am very skeptical about every product that says, &amp;#34;Will end Cellulite&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product is very difficult to use-</li>
            <li> I realize cellulite is very difficult to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I have leftover cellulite areas and stretch marks that make me feel very insecure.</li>
            <li> I was getting some info about some very expensive laser treatments that they couldn&#x27;t to guarantee me about the results that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands so this is impossible for me.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s impossible to get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I will admit that I did not have that bad of a cellulite problem, but I had visible cellulite around my thighs and buttox.</li>
            <li> the appearance of my cellulite increased soo bad</li>
            <li> on counter  to get it out...just gave up on the frustration of trying to use ...too bad really...waste of money .</li>
            <li> and my cellulite is so bad.</li>
            <li> but I do have bad cellulite (Genetics).</li>
            <li> I think I have bad circulation throughout my legs and that contributes to the problem.</li>
            <li> and I had bad cellulite that made me so depressed</li>
            <li> and I could not afford to continue the painful treatment.</li>
            <li> It is a PAIN in the butt to do it every night and every morning, scrubbing with the somewhat painful glove I bought with it.</li>
            <li> cellulite began rear its ugly head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any weight issues but still have ugly cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I happened to catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and was shocked to see that even my deepest pockets were minimalized.  </li>
            <li> Cellulite is almost impossible to rid of unless you lose a lot of weight or have it sucked out :(</li>
            <li> This product made me sick immediately.</li>
            <li> :( but I still believe in the product</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this and have always been disappointed, that is until now.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;:(</li>
            <li> Once again, disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use to see if there&#x27;s any improvement. :-(</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but its there, and its going to stay. :(</li>
            <li> I can not tell any difference since I purchased these product :(.</li>
            <li> disappointed with your company.</li>
            <li> Conclusion: lousy product , horrible customer &#x27;service&#x27;</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> and I was going to have it done, even though I was disappointed in the before</li>
            <li> but Finulite has proved me wrong!!</li>
            <li> This is scary!!</li>
            <li> I am not going to purchase any of these worthless products again because they do not work.</li>
            <li> Maybe this cream just didn&#x27;t work on me because I was doubtful..?</li>
            <li> So &amp;#34;Finulite&amp;#34; comments saying otherwise are crap.</li>
            <li> that had a horrific menthol-y smell, these smell like an expensive body lotion!</li>
            <li> I have lost 90 pounds and it&#x27;s still very bad.  </li>
            <li> I had a very painful cellulite treatment done at a medi spa</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had a lot of cellulite. ..this worked to really smooth out my thighs.</li>
            <li> It seemed to firm up my problem areas and felt nice putting it on. I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my cellulite after using both bottles.</li>
            <li> I am actually starting to see improvement. Not HUGE but compared to how much damage there is to work on, to even see the slightest difference is very encouraging. I have been using this for about 2 weeks,and I admit, I have missed some am or pm applications, but I am seeing some improvement.  I am not expecting overnight results (I can wish though) but honestly working at desk jobs for over 30 years has really taken its toll from the back of my thighs to the mid or near top of my butt.&lt;br /&gt;I really believe that with daily usage, this will make a huge improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to use this product for the next several months and will give an updated review at that time.</li>
            <li> I used this creams lo g time ago with amazing results, but after fighting with the bottle to squeeze the cream out, I gave up and stopped using it. My cellulite came back, in full display. I decided to give it a try and to My surprise, they changed the bottle!! Now is so easy to squeeze!. Love this cream, and I really need it to keep cellulite away.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is my second time ordering it and will order again. It has a great smell and my husband even noticed a difference the first time I was using it.</li>
            <li> Did not see any improvement used it faithfully for over 6weeks with the scrub brush...I work out hard, run, eat run always have, I a m a 7/8...no results</li>
            <li> Some improvement noticed. Will work overtime with consistent use</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and after 3 hours my thighs feel tighter I&#x27;m going to order some more tomorrow.. awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying this product for the 2nd time.  Cellulite is diminished with consistent use, exercise, and proper diet. The lotions smell great and absorb quickly! Would highly recommend.  Customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> It worked after 3 weeks. Dont stop using it or the issues show again.</li>
            <li> Between this, eating more vegetables and drinking fresh vegetable juice, and vacuum massaging my butt and legs, it is working.  There is a notable reduction in cellulite although not 100%.  I am going to purchase my second pair of bottles now.</li>
            <li> This is my second pack of finulite and I love it, it in not a miracle of course, there is still a little cellulite in the back of my legs but the difference form before i started is significantly better. Before finulite I wouldn&#x27;t dare to wear shorts outside my house because i was so self-conscious about the cellulite on my legs but now i don&#x27;t have to worry about it!. its really nice to wear something and feel totally comfortable. i would really recommend it, specially if you use it with the smoothing massage mitt. if the first pack doesn&#x27;t exceed your expectations, don&#x27;t lose faith because the second one will definitely do the trick. you just gotta be consistent.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product, works wonders. Just like anything else, with consistency, it pays off.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. Only downfall, wish the product came in larger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making my experience with finulite a positive one.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product because the claims.  I should have known better.  I only have minimal cellulite and still did not see any results.  I CANNOT BELIEVE I GOT FOOLED AGAIN!! I eat right and excersise DAILY!! Ifigured this would benefit me!! NOPE!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of skin care products. I am a size 2 and work out but still have some pesky bumps on my legs that just won&#x27;t go away! I bought the cream and the massage mitt and after one month am already starting to see results! I love that there is an AM and PM bottle. Great formula! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new to try!</li>
            <li> After years of trying different types of creams, massages, exercises, etc. I have found a product that helps decrease the visibility of cellulite while giving a smoother, toned look to my body.  I use the cream everyday and night on my arms and legs.  I have noticed after using the product for 4 weeks a reduction in the visibility of my cellulite on my legs and arms.  It is worth a shot to try!  I recommend using it consistently for 4-6 weeks before giving up!  I have wasted a lot of money trying different products and this product has really made me happy!</li>
            <li> Omg Ladies this is it!!!! I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, every morning and night before bed time and I can see very impressive result!! My skin looks and feels much smoother then before. Just order another bottles!!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly I decided to try this product because it had great reviews but I was very skeptic. I wanted it because I had a trip to the beach in two weeks and summer was coming (shorts, skirts). It was unbelievable, I started seeing a difference in my skin after about 10 days, it was smoother and with less cellulite! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and I won&#x27;t stop using it because my cellulite is like 90% improved. And let me tell you, I weigh about 127, but I always had the worst cellulite on my legs, since I was young, and i tried everything and nothing worked and now, they have never looked better. I started with the product without exercising or dieting, just the finulite and I saw amazing changes. I just got the smoothing massage mitt and It helps a ton! The skin looks even smoother and firmer and it&#x27;s very easy to use ( the only thing is that a side of the handle got unattached after a week, but still works). If you&#x27;re thinking about getting it, I definitely recommend you do. Results are probably different for each person, but I definitely think its worth it.</li>
            <li> Although I am thin and I exercised I have always had cellulite. Now, in my 40s the problem is becoming even more visible. I have tried different creams before, and I think this one is the best so far. It worked almost from the first week. I have just finished the second bottle and the results are better than any cream I have ever tried. The only drawback is the quantity of the product, but overall I think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> This has really worked for me.  It took 3 weeks to see minor results, 8 weeks to see full results.  I did not think it would work, so I was very surprised at the results - and I was being hyper-critical. I have to admit, I&#x27;ve missed mornings or evenings here or there.  And if you stop using it, you&#x27;ll see your cellulite come back.  It has a pleasant odor, and it smooths and softens your skin  as well (better than regular lotion).  If it weren&#x27;t for the cost, I&#x27;d use this as a full body lotion. I followed the directions re: eating before/after application, even if I wasn&#x27;t as diligent as I should have been with the daily application.  The bottles are small, so don&#x27;t be surprised by that.  I get about 6 weeks of use from the set using only on trouble areas.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6\\&quot;, about 140lbs.  I saw great results without changing my diet or exercising (at all). My cellulite isn&#x27;t as stubborn as some people&#x27;s - if I exercise regularly it goes away.  Since, I hadn&#x27;t had any time to exercise for the past 6 months this was a huge find for me. I like it (love it) enough that I&#x27;ve reordered, which is the ultimate testimonial for this type of product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and already notice a big difference! Even my boyfriend noticed the amazing difference! I also decided to try it on my upper inner thighs to see if it would help firm them a little and wow what an awesome difference!!! Ive used so many other products before and nothing much changed after a month or so but like I said after two weeks its already a big difference!</li>
            <li> Come on people be smart! NONE of these creams get rid of cellulite! Not a damn one. The only way to get rid of cellulite is to massage your skin to dispute the water build up that is causing your skin to look bubbly. The people who make these creams know this so they make these lotions that don&#x27;t absorb into the skin so that people will keep massaging the area thinking that the product worked when it didn&#x27;t only the massage did. Money lost and another customer fooled!</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product! I bought cause many people recommended it but still wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s gonna work. I don&#x27;t regret at all! My skin looks much better then before. And the most important thing for me is that this product made my stretch marks less visible. I tryed many things to get rid of these things but nothing helped and that was a surprise for me when I noticed that they really became less visible. So I ordered Finulite again and recommend women to try it.</li>
            <li> I thought this product does what it claims. I did notice a smoother look where I applied this cream. Because it is a two step product, it is easy to forget some applications.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, this product helped with fluid retention, which I really appreciate since it is a problem for me. Using it twice a day with exercise, I notice a small decrease in cellulite, which is more than other products have done for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint, I take advantage of getting free shipping by ordering more than one set, and they keep sending me new massage mitts. I only need one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  I maintain my healthy weight, work out, eat right and take very good care of my skin.  I am always willing to try something new, especially homemade mixtures...I will stick with coffee grind, sugar and olive oil mixture.</li>
            <li> I was hoping after all the great reviews that this product would work.  It doesnt.  Ive used it for a month and all it has done is make my skin softer.  I dont understand how everyone with these reviews is seeing results and I am not, but i was hopeful.  Cellulite is almost impossible to rid of unless you lose a lot of weight or have it sucked out :(</li>
            <li> Its a good product just not instantainious like we ll want it to be!  but ill keep using and watch the results A product i do recamend ;0)</li>
            <li> I loved the smell, it was thick as well but i didn&#x27;t really get the result I needed/wanted . May be a great product for others, just not for me and I&#x27;ve had this problem since I was 12</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have used that actually improves the appearance of cellulite. You have to be consistent and make sure you use both the am and pm product daily, but if you do, you will love the results!</li>
            <li> I have almost finished both bottles and I can maybe see some change but nothing like other reviewers said. the smell is nice. I haven&#x27;t decided whether or not I am going to try it again.</li>
            <li> I am on to my third bottle in two and a half months and I have seen major, major improvement. My cellulite is almost gone! For faster results I started eating a low fat diet and massaging my problem areas before applying the cream. Finulite has been amazing for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now. It seems to help in reducing the appearance of cellulite. It smells really good and I like the fact that there&#x27;s a different cream for day vs. night. I&#x27;ve never seen that in a cellulite cream before.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product of as little as 2 weeks.  I can notice a significant difference in the apperance on my orange peel skin.  No other product have done this before.  I will greatly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Still in progress with it. I&#x27;m on my 3rd set. This cellulite is no joke.:( but I still believe in the product</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 month and major improvement I have noticed is in my butt. It leaves the skin very smooth and tight. I wish to see more improvement on my thights where I have some major issues too. I am very please with the results so far for only a month of usage. I&#x27;ll give it another try for another month but will start using a massager with it to see it works better. Haaa also I work out 3-4 times a week And trying to drink more water!!</li>
            <li> I think finding something to completely obliterate the dimply scourge would be as rare as unicorn tears and Pegasus feathers, that being said this stuff is pretty good. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week so I can&#x27;t speak of lasting results but once I put finulite on my cellulite looks dramatically reduced for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is that of a mid-weight lotion (think Nivea in the blue pump), the scent is very light but pleasant and it moisturizes my dry skin. It leaves my skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the bottles are small and the price tag is not. I will repurchase though. I&#x27;ve only tried one other cellulite cream (Bliss Fat Girl Slim) and this is much more effective.</li>
            <li> quick delivery too and you can tell by the smell its the real deal</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have tried it all, and finulite really works! I noticed a difference after about 1 week, and now almost a month in I see a dramatic change. I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Smoother skin, but it doesn&#x27;t make your cellulite dissapear...</li>
            <li> Have been using a month now. Give it time.I see some results. Its not alot but enough to know its working. Some people may take longer than others depending on the amount of cellulite you have.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any changes from using this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product for a month now and I am seeing some improvement on my skin. I just recently received my second sets of supply. I want my cellulite gone for good. Will most definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle and don&#x27;t see any change.  It smells great but as far as decreasing or eliminating cellulite; I don&#x27;t see the changes.  Tried a second bottle and absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li> Over the last year, I have lost weight and added a steady yet modest work out regimen to my life including weights and cardio. I was hoping to lose all the cellulite with the weight, but that didn&#x27;t happen. I got to the lowest weight I could with still being healthy, and even though a lot of the cellulite smoothed out as my body toned, there is still plenty. I know it&#x27;s not all in a creme, but at this point I am willing to try whatever can reasonably help.&lt;br /&gt; At first I saw no difference. Going on 4 weeks, there still really wasn&#x27;t much happening. This is when I decided to buy the finulite massage mitt. I use it in the steam sauna shower at the gym ( the heat really opens things up) and also in hot showers at home.&lt;br /&gt;This mitt and the massaging action really opens up the skin to receive the cream and I also noticed a big difference in how smoothed out my skin was right after the massage! My skin really looks it&#x27;s smoothest ever after these shower massages!  How much the cream is affecting that, I don&#x27;t really know, but in the end, there is enough improvement for me to continue the practice and have hope that this, combined with my healthier diet and exercise, will over time keep improving my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the massaging mitt and have been using it for about 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement... I&#x27;m going to keep up with it and hopefully I will see a change soon.</li>
            <li> Love this product helps with the soap too more results you see.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! It smells great and works wonders. I have had 2 children and accumulated lots of fat cells and cellulite.  I exercise regularly and eat right for the most part but nothing was working. I read all the reviews for this product and decided to order it. I am so happy i did. It&#x27;s so worth it. I am a lifetime buyer.  Thanks finūlite!  :)</li>
            <li> I WILL SEE IF IT WORKS ..AS SOON I FINISH THIS PRODUCT ,,AND THEN I WILL GIVE YOU A MORE ACCURATE REVIEW ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li> The title sums it up all. The product indeed reduces the appearance of cellulite, but only as long as you&#x27;re using it. Once you stop (also because the bottles are quite small), it comes back again.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is also nice and it leaves your skin all soft.&lt;br /&gt;So probably worth it, especially for the summer time when you have to show your body on the beach ;-) and as long as you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Product does make your skin tighten and smooth.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money, better to spend more but get a decent product. Didn&#x27;t work at all for me, and I followed instructions and used it twice p/day.&lt;br /&gt;A big part of those positive reviews must be fake, as it happens more and more on Amazon... sad.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd set of this product. Because I&#x27;ve had cellulite most of my life (even when I was seriously UNDER weight) I have tried many, MANY cellulite products, procedures and treatments. I was skeptical at first, and because of the number of positive reviews, I decided to give this product a try. I&#x27;m glad I did! It didn&#x27;t work right away, but after consistent use for 4 weeks, I did notice a difference. I got super busy and quit using it consistently for a while, and the cellulite got worse again. So the key is being consistent! I will order this product again and can&#x27;t wait to see the results with long term use!</li>
            <li> Amazon Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;I am a 32 active woman with cellulite. I eat clean and work out regularly. Along with that I use the finulite cream, dry brush and this soap. My cellulite has greatly diminished. I really like finlite products and have never had a problem with an order.</li>
            <li> The bottle was only palm size, much smaller than what I expected... Have tried it, has an orange smell, cream easily absorbs into skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cellulite product for a while now, and this was the cheapest and highest rated reviews. I received the package quick, and started using it immediately. It was so easy to add into my nightly/morning routines. It smells good too! I heard most cellulite products stink, buut this one has a lite scent that actually smells really good. I haven&#x27;t noticed a different yet in the appearance of my cellulite, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days...I will definetly continue using this easy product!</li>
            <li> This definatley  wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;the end of my cellulite\\&quot; like it claims, however with my diet and exercise routine, combined with the daily and nightly use of Finulite, it has lessened the look of my cellulite. I wanted to be ready for a Hawaiian vacation so I started using it 3 months prior. It smells nice and dries quickly. It easily fits into my am and pm routine. I am happy with the results and am ready for my trip!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my cruise that I am going on in two weeks. My first reaction to the product is that the bottles are tiny. I have been using it for a little over 2 weeks every morning and night pretty religiously and I&#x27;m over half way through the bottle already. As far as the results, my legs are so much smoother to the touch. I have pretty bad cellulite, especially on the sides of my thighs. I have many slight dimples and one deep one that bothers me really bad on each leg. The smaller less noticeable ones have improved but are not gone and my deep one is not improving much at all. I am tanning as well as working out (I walk on the treadmill 3-5 times a week on full incline), So I can&#x27;t 100% say that it is the cream, but I do see some improvement in the 2 weeks I have used it. The smell is not very pleasant but it&#x27;s not awful either, I came to bed and my fiance thought I had put on tanning lotion :/ so I guess some may think it smells similar to that. The morning one is better than the night one as far as smell. One IMPORTANT tip is to rub it in very deep and hard. Almost to the point where it hurts. I noticed better results once I started doing this. Remember that cellulite is a genetic thing, there will never be an overnight fix. Be patient and don&#x27;t get discouraged.</li>
            <li> I purchased Finulite AM/PM hoping that it would complement my diet and exercise routine!  It has -- I noticed a difference in the tone of my skin and decrease of the appearance of cellulite.  The consistency is moisturizing and non-sticky.  The results were amazing.  Highly recommend to those needing that extra support in those areas that tend to store fat and excess water.</li>
            <li> I used this every day and never saw a difference</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream just for a little over one week, and already see noticeable results.  I have tried many products before, but this  is a first time when the expectations did not disappoint. Great product.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I did not have that bad of a cellulite problem, but I had visible cellulite around my thighs and buttox. It was especially evident when I sat down in shorts. So, the results might vary in people with different levels of cellulite. This product is my first ever cellulite erasing product, and I will admit that I won&#x27;t try any other product as long as I can get my hands on Finulite. It has honestly toned, softened, and erased my cellulite. I use the AM formula as soon as I wake up, and the PM formula as soon as I go to bed. The ingredients used in Finulite really makes all the difference. I recommend this product to those with light to moderate cellulite, like me. I can&#x27;t really speak for those with a lot of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams before this. I can actually feel it working after application. Best product I have used.</li>
            <li> I have being using the product for a couple of days and I think its to early to say it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say at this point is that the bottles are very difficult to use, they are very stiff and its very hard to get the cream out of the bottle.. small thing but its annoying (to me at least).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this product.  Any drug store brand would work just as well.  Also one of the bottles had a lid that would  not open.  Not a huge deal I just unscrewed the cap each time instead of flipping the lid up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and I was pretty upset when I started developing cellulite a few years ago. I had a very painful cellulite treatment done at a medi spa and I could not afford to continue the painful treatment. This cream is affordable and works awesome as long as you keep using it. With in a few days I noticed my legs looked alot less lumpy. I&#x27;m a bit over weight and hope to keep using the regimine as I lose weight. I would reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Before using this product I had moderate cellulite on my outer and back thighs.  After only 2 days of use, I began to see a difference - smoother, firmer skin.  I rub this product in vigorously, just using my hands for massage.  I am about 3 weeks into the routine, and I still have cellulite, but especially on my outer thighs it is substantially reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the smell, which does resemble a sugary tween cosmetic, but that&#x27;s pretty inconsequential.  I have found that this product works MUCH better than Nivea&#x27;s cellulite serum and lotion, although they are much less expensive, so you pay for what you get.  I am planning on purchasing the three-month supply next.  Also, I have found that 1 month supply (2 bottles: AM &amp; PM) lasts longer than a month - probably about 1.5 months the way I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> The best product ever, I tried different cellulite lotions so far the best! it works.</li>
            <li> Used for more than a month, sooner or later insist, may be effective, but it is really very obvious, run out to buy these four bottles will not be used again</li>
            <li> I am 18 years old, and I have had cellulite since I was 13. I am not overweight, and I was devastated to see my body ravaged with this cellulite problem at such a young age. I considered my cellulite a 7 on a scale of 1-10. Since using this product, I can confidently say that this product has greatly reduced my cellulite. It is very smooth to apply and smells nice. It also absorbs quickly into the skin. This product will probably give faster results to those with less severe cellulite, but those of you with more severe cases of cellulite will also see results if you stay consistent. I am on my second month supply of finulite, and I am happy so far with the results. I can see my cellulite gradually decreasing. I now consider my cellulite a 3-4. This is not a miracle lotion and needs time and dedication to work. It does work. Note: I have not increased amount of excercise since beginning use of this product, but I&#x27;m sure it will help boost your results. It can&#x27;t hurt!&lt;br /&gt;I truly recommend getting this product if you are struggling with cellulite, it will definitely help. It is by far the most effective cellulite cream out there! :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how happy I am with the results I&#x27;ve seen from using my first set of bottles! I have used numerous products and tried several at home remedies. I&#x27;m 27 years old, weight anywhere from 113-120 depending on the time of month and how much I work out. I had a child almost 7 years ago. Never went up and down that much in weight but cellulite runs in the women in my family! This product will work if you use it. I could see dimples and cellulite all over my thighs even on the front. It was reallllyyy getting to me. I started using Finulite around the end of March 2012 and already have noticed a difference. The cellulite is really only noticeable on the back of my thighs towards my butt now. I just ordered another set and I&#x27;m going to keep at it! Good luck girls! Give this a try. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I really think that these worked. I am not certain as I was also doing other things like lipomassages and exercising with dieting. I need to purchase again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have only been using this product for less than two weeks and I have missed a few days, but I have already notice a difference in my skin. My skin is so much firmer. I started out just using it on my thighs and now have decided to use it on my arms and stomach area. Can&#x27;t wait to see my results after six months. I think I will continue to use this product as long as they keep making it. I will be purchasing more sets my next go around. A must try you won&#x27;t regret it. I have tried plenty of products that prove to do the job but none like this one. I&#x27;m a fan of finulite!!!!!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This is my four purchase of Finulite and I&#x27;m still in love obviously if I&#x27;m still purchasing it again. You have to be consistent in using this product. This product has been the only product that has done the trick on my cellulite. Of course it&#x27;s not going to make your cellulite totally disappear but because it makes your skin so toned it gives that illusion. Like I said in my last post I am a fan and I will continue to purchase this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I will continue to purchase this product. I am def a fan. I will never try another cream because I know this product works. Thanks to the maker/supplier.</li>
            <li> This product truly is lifechanging after struggling with cellulite and even trying velashape which in my case made me look worse I decided to try this not bad for the price and after reading reviews I did and wow this stuff is good. I am not 100% cellulite free but the back of my thighs looks way way smoother and my butt the dimples are slowly being diminished I also exercise 2x a week that should help too, but overall this product does what it says I will definitely keep this one up and I have tried lots of different products but none that really work and this one does I am so happy I found this cuz I didnt want to look dimply anymore Jessica Heredia</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it religiously morning/night until the bottles were empty (tiny bottles). I had zero improvement with my cellulite. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8\\&quot; and only weigh about 125lbs, I have cellulite on my outer thighs and buttocks that I can not get rid of. If I had to rate my cellulite on a scale of 1-10 and 10 being the worst. I would say my cellulite is about a 5. So, I was expecting this product to work miracles because of the great reviews. Sadly, I was disappointed. I gave this product a 2 star rating because the lotions do smell amazing and make the area being massaged very smooth, but obviously if you lotion the same spot twice a day.. anything will make it smoother. The smoothness does not last however once you stop using the product. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Finulite is a great moisturzer but that is all it does. I did not see any difference in any of my smallest celluite. I would spend the money again.</li>
            <li> Leaking all over when I got them. Look cheap and small disgusting. For real! They smell like some low-priced artificial toilet air freshener that really makes you sick! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time when my friend offered it when we were bridesmaids. Then I purchased it for myself twice and used it whenever I had an important event, including my own wedding. They were more effective than I thought. I found them most effective in the upper arms area and my stomach. I still use them as I think it&#x27;s more of a long-term effect rather than immediate. I think it also matters how regularly you apply them alternating night and day. I would recommend it to anyone who wants less of the &amp;#34;cottage-cheese&amp;#34; look on your arms, legs, and/or stomach - basically the most fatty areas in your body.  Only thing I hope they change is that (which they already may have since I bought them seeing how it&#x27;s different in pictures now) instead of the hard shell bottles, it would be nice for them to be in tubes so it&#x27;s easier to squeeze out the cream.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but it works. 80% of cellulite gone with the first purchase  and a marked difference in skin elasticity. Have tried every lotion and potion on the planet and this is the only product giving me such visible results in such a short period of time. Won&#x27;t be without it ;)</li>
            <li> I saw no results. If you look at the website, it looks extremely gimmicky and dishonest (especially the testimonial photos). It also irritated my skin after a while and caused breakouts. I ended up discovering Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow moisturizer (which gives you a gradual tan). It looks like a natural tan AND it hides cellulite a lot better. I recommend checking out that product instead of this junk.</li>
            <li> It works but i believe in combination with the massage mitt same company works even better and faster. It has improved greatly the texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this and have always been disappointed, that is until now.  By far the best product for cellulite.  Not only does it help with the removal of cellulite, but it helps with the tightening of the skin.  I saw a great difference in my thighs and stomach just after my first order.  Definitely a must for anyone suffering from cellulite.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Waste of money!! Does not work!</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite for 2 1/2 weeks now, and I am already noticing a difference!  I am in my late 20&#x27;s, and a former college athlete who continues to stay in shape (hitting the gym 4 to 5 times a week).  I also have an active job where I am on my feet all day, and can be physically taxing at many points (physical therapist).  I had certain areas on the back of my thighs up near my buttocks that started showing signs of cellulite, and no matter how much weight I lost (5&#x27;6 at 140 pounds) or what exercises I did...it was still there.  I am starting to see my teenage thighs again!!!  I am going to purchase another set soon so I do not miss a single day.</li>
            <li> I thought with all the good reviews it was worth trying. I used this with the seaweed body soap that is suppose to help with cellulite or at least increase the circulation (the soap btw is awesome) in my legs and with moderate excercise. I doubt is was the combo but the appearance of my cellulite increased soo bad I was too embarassed to even take off my pants in front of anyone. I thought maybe it was just the process of actually pulling it to the surface so the surface of the skin could then smooth out but it never did. I used up the bottles and soap. With the warmer weather I opted for Jergens natural glo firming moisturizer. I saw better results within two days of using this product than a month of finulite. Even though I used up all the seaweed soap I still use a loofah everyday to increase skin circulation and exfoliate with the Jergens. In the end this product seemed to do the exact opposite of what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Good product I refer to my friend</li>
            <li> I have just about finished round 1 of these products. I&#x27;ve definitely seen improvement regarding some smoothing of my cellulite but by no means to my satisfaction. Because I have seen some improvement I&#x27;m going to try a second set.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure with all of the positive reviews that this would work. It does not. It&#x27;s just an overpriced lotion. It&#x27;s not even very moisturizing. The smell was okay, but you can get better smelling and more moisturizing lotion anywhere for 1/5 the price. I&#x27;m wondering if all of the positive reviews came from people who truly followed the directions and added diet and exercise. Of course  you&#x27;ll notice a difference if you do this. For those of us who already thin by proper diet and exercise, there was no difference. I&#x27;ve used OTC creams that have a temporary instant effect. This did not even have that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for 4 weeks. Never missed a morning or night and used in combination with the Mitt. I think the Mitt is supposed to be some kind of knock off &amp;#34;body brushing&amp;#34; technique, but that too is a joke. The Mitt just has plastic hard knobbies on it and according to the directions you&#x27;re supposed to push and twist into your skin. OUCH! I did still use it, but I used it with soap and did a circular motion on my outer thigh so that it didn&#x27;t tear my skin open as the instructed method would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller twice to find out what the return policy was and got no response. Finally, I just requested a refund through Amazon and got an authorization. Once the product was received back, the seller did not refund all of my money. The deducted a shipping cost that I didn&#x27;t even pay to begin with. What a rip-off!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this stuff for a few days and already see some improvements...Also there is no strong odor (like some) it actually smells pretty good...I will be buying some more!!</li>
            <li> I bought these creams along with the finulite mitt &amp; together they are working really well. I&#x27;m not sure if the creams are actually adding anything as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the mitt doing most of the work...but the creams smell good &amp; I&#x27;m enjoying using them. They are relatively small bottles so they do not last very long, they absorb quickly. But if you are going to purchase the Mitt I would definitely buy the creams too....what i wouldn&#x27;t do is buy the creams &amp; not the mitt as like i said it&#x27;s the mitt that&#x27;s really doing the work :).</li>
            <li> I am 18, and I have been plagued with serious cellulite for as long as I can remember thanks to my constantly yo-yoing weight.  It has always made me extremely self-conscious, usually barring me from wearing shorts during the summer (which of course is never comfortable.)  For a few years, I have made a practice of working out more and eating healthier, but I never noticed an improvement in my cellulite--that is, until I tried Finulite!  I ordered it on a whim, deciding I wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere and I figured for thirty bucks it was worth a try.  Well, I am extremely pleased that I made that decision!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and let me just say that I have already noticed a pretty significant change in the tops of my thighs and butt.. needless to say, I am very pleased.  Something else that I&#x27;ve been doing is using a skin brush before I shower every morning to help &#x27;wake up&#x27; my skin cells, and I highly recommend it as it seems to help the process of removing the cellulite.  All in all, this cream is seriously awesome, and if you&#x27;re like me and sick of hiding, it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This cream smells really good.  I have seen a difference and my skin seems firmer.  Of course no cream is going to get rid of cellulite, but it helps.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a long term fix, unless you continue to use.  I stopped for a few days, and my troubled spots returned to what they were when I started.  It is one of the best creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! Makes your skin as smooth as silk!!! Must use everyday as directed:) But worth every penny:)</li>
            <li> Great creams. Smell isn&#x27;t strong and its a pleasant smell. Just got the Finulite mitt to use with this. Will be ordering again. I also, love that its animal cruelty free!!</li>
            <li> I like Evelyn Cosmetics product better. The cream itself is sticky and very thick and doesn&#x27;t work well with hard bottle that you can&#x27;t squeeze. I have hard time to get the cream out of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;it makes skin tighter and smoother and together with other measures (diet, massage with body brash and light exercise) gives some improvements, therefore I gave it 3 points and not 1.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles (must to say that that is true for ALL creams).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement on my cellulite.</li>
            <li> It smells okay but did nothing for me I guess is like everything else you gotta usetons of it before it does anything</li>
            <li> I love this product. The best in skin smoothing results. I need a few gift sets, please email me. Tammyschnurr@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and checked out the ingredients which were quite impressive. I&amp;#34;m a licensed esthetician in Southern California  and have tried numerous anti-cellulite products as well as various machines. After using it for several months I would have to say that in conjunction with other modalities it can be more effective. By itself it was ok, results were slightly moderate.</li>
            <li> They usually say cremes don&#x27;t work but I must say, this creme, coupled with exercise, works well. My skin is softer and I see a difference. I will use this for several months and submit an update.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! I see results in a matter of weeks and most of the time I only put the cream on in the morning. If I did it twice a day, as instructed, I&#x27;m sure my results would be even better. The only cellulite product I will ever use!!</li>
            <li> I Love this product have ordered 3x. I have loose skin and cellulite on my stomach and backs of my thighs and this cream with the finulite massager tightened the skin and made it smooth!! I&#x27;m amazed!</li>
            <li> Some info on me: Im 25 yrs and have cellulite!! Mine is more so my genes (which I just love my family for!! LOL) I have tried numerous drug store and expensive creams and get no real result!! I have been testing creams since highschool!! So I decided to try this out not expecting much but I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and have noticed some slight differences in the appearance of my skin...not too much as I haven&#x27;t used it as long as recommended but I did just purchase my 2nd set to keep going with it!! Hoping for the results to continue!! I also purchased the Cellulite smoothing massage mitt to use in the shower before I apply the cream. Its super easy Am and Pm (Pink &amp; Purple). I don&#x27;t mind the smell of the lotion at all which is a bonus!! Sometimes these lotions can be very overwhelming!! But it dries nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you all tacky &amp; sticky adsorbs well. Hope this will help some of you make your decision... its definitely worth a try but you must give it those 8 weeks!! Because if I&#x27;ve seen some small changes within 3 1/2 weeks I&#x27;m excited to see where I will be in the next 8 weeks!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually (ever) do product reviews.  But I am so happy with this product I will.  I have been using Finulite in conjunction with body brushing.  I started both body brushing and finulite three weeks ago, so I cannot say Finulite by itself has made the difference in my thighs, but the combination has.  I was not sure I was really seeing a difference myself, but one day my husband commented &amp;#34;Wow your legs look great!&amp;#34; And he was standing behind me!  So I can truly say the cellulite on my thighs is less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I am a 20 something female, who is in good shape (5 foot 2, 108 lbs), was a former gymnast, and still works out regularly. However, I have struggled for a long time (*years*) with cellulite.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product totally gets rid of the problem, but I have found it helpful.  Having tried at least three other anti-cellulite products, I can honestly say that this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> A bit of background: I have had cellulite since I was a preteen and have tried nearly every method and cream and lotion to get rid of it with very little success. I recently started working out and making a shift to a healthier lifestyle in February 2013 but still felt like I needed that extra help. If you have done your research, you know that cellulite requires a varied plan of attack to even improve the condition, let alone rid yourself of it. My cellulite even after 5 months of clean eating and weight training had only improved from a stage 4 to a mild 3 at best. I kid you not, with the addition of Finulite and consistent dry brushing before every shower, I have no visible cellulite. I have never in my 27 years of life worn shorts in public until this summer... EVER. I was proud to wear shorts this year thanks to this product and a lot of hard work. It will definitely serve you well to make sure you are keeping your sugars and carbs to a minimum and eating the right foods, drinking plenty of water and getting a good multivitamin in every day. I also take a Lecithin supplement which has been known to reduce cellulite as well. All in all, yes I would, have and will continue to recommend this product to anyone looking to rid themselves of cellulite. It&#x27;s so cheap compared to your alternatives, it has all the right ingredients and it works just as described. Do no hesitate to buy!!!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 and 2 of each and I have run out, seems like the appereance of cellulite is diminishing. I am gonna go ahead with 2 and 2 more and then have my final verdict. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first about buying this product but im seeing immediate results after a week.After having a baby i had some troublesome areas around my thighs and tummy that would not go away are finally disappearing thanks to this product.I like the light pleasant scent it has to it not like the usual creams out there that have heavy medicinal scents. after i run out of this im getting more i love this product</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing, and I used it for months. It appeared to be just like any other generic lotion. Will definitely not buy this again. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great buy for all of us girls who suffer from the dreaded cellulite. The am &amp; pm formula go on easy and smell&#x27;s good to  which is a plus) I definetly  see a difference. My legs look alot more toned and It gives me a lot more confidence. Great product for a great price....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 months now. And I just recieved my second 3 month supply and Finulite massage mitt. The shipping was super quick from Simply Skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other cellulite creams, and was not happy with the results and cost. I started seeing all the positive reviews of Finulite on Amazon, being a little skeptical, I decided to give it a try, and am completly sold on this product. It WORKS!&lt;br /&gt; I can truly tell the difference in the apperance of my problem areas. My legs and butt are firmer and smoother. The lotion also moisturizes your skin and is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is my husband can see a big difference on how my legs look. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost count of how many miracle creams i&#x27;ve bought to try and tackle my cellulite problem. I started getting a bit of cellulite in my early 30s, but I was able to keep it at bay with body brushing and exercise. However, a forced sedentary lifestyle following a major car accident 3 years ago has caused my cellulite to run rampant. I decided to try Finulite - The End to Cellulite after reading all the good reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t holding out any great hopes. HOWEVER, I have to say, so far, I really like this product. It smells good, which is unusual for this type of cream, it absorbs into the skin well without any greasy residue, it leaves my skin feeling really soft, and most importantly, it is definitely improving the look of my cellulite, more than any other product like this that I have tried. I am hoping that combining it with body brushing, a good diet and lots of water will finally result in a reduction of my cellulite. I&#x27;m very happy and will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2-3 weeks now can see a difference. Can&#x27;t wait to see a bigger difference soon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything.  I know you can&#x27;t actually get rid of cellulite without losing weight and toning up, but I thought this would help &amp;#34;short term&amp;#34; wise.  But I never noticed a difference and I did the morning and night cream religiously for a month.  Skip it.</li>
            <li> i got Finulite/Cellulite cream about 2 months ago..i stopped using it couple of weeks ago..but before that i have used it for about 1 month  and i can tell u there was no big different..just a little little less cellulite but i can still see it..so i dont know why everybody is raving about it..but this product is the same as other product on the market..its just the same cream separated in 2 bottles so it can look like they have a secret formula,which they dont..they smell the same and they feel the same,its just different color bottles..and it costs a lot more..as it says on the bottle massage with long deep strokes,so here you go thats what helps u get rid of it the MASSAGE not the cream,so my opinion..waste of money and no results..just use a smoothing cream and massage you thighs and exercise,and u will see results..</li>
            <li> It smells ok but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Nothing improves. I was so excited about this product and thought that it might help at least a little bit. I have no luck here.</li>
            <li> I have had procedures done in the past to help reduce the appearance of cellulite but nothing ever seems to give me the results I am looking for. I am not a big person by any means, at 5&#x27;1 and 113 lbs, and I work out everyday but i could never get the results I am looking for. I decided to try this product based on all of the reviews and I can honestly say that I got better results with this product, eating right, an exercising then I did with a 300 dollar treatment. This product is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for that added boost in reducing cellulite. I recently purchased other items from this company and I am VERY excited to try them.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday morning/night and after 1 month using it, I can clearly see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it for sure. Very fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star rating because it&#x27;s the best product that I have used for my stubborn cellulite. I am in the over 60 age group and  I would recommend that you use it with the Finulite Massager and you follow the instructions and use it at least twice a day. The only drawback is that that the bottles are small so you have to reorder very often</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! Really works!!! My skin is soft and much tighter!This stuff actually did what it said it would do!! Love it !!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice a day religiously for a month and saw no improvement in my cellulite.  Maybe if my skin were dried out and nasty to start with I would have seen an improvement, but I had already been using a basic (and cheap) moisturizer.  Finulite did, however, manage to make my butt smell like the sort of cheap, fruity fragrance normally found in lip gloss marketed to 12-year olds.</li>
            <li> Didnt make any difference. The smell is terrible!! I would like to know if I can get my money back what a rip off!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product made me sick immediately. The morning after I had applied it the night before, I awoke with a searing pain in my stomach, radiating up my back. Antacids, advil, etc. did not help. I had not changed anything in my routine other than this. This happened the second night as well. After removing the product, even after overnight, the pain immediately resolved. It may have been interacting with medications I am on. If so, I strongly advise caution if trying this product when you are taking any kind of medication. I am writing to the manufacturer as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and am very please with the results I see,and this new formula is better than ever! Much better smell,and seems to be working even faster! I have tried many cellulite products,very expensive ones,too,that have not done anything near to what this one does. After having 2 kids,I have been fighting cellulite and losing the battle even though I exercise on a regular basis and eat as healthy as possible. And I am a small person, but as an RN I know that cellulite is a battle the majority of us women have to deal with. I have seen a huge difference in the look of the back of my thighs and rear end since I have been using finulite. This is the only one I have ever used to make such a huge change. My skin is much firmer and looks smoother. I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to get rid of cellulite-it really works!</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of other products from famous brands to non-famous brands but nothing worked like this one. This one really really really works. I have been using it for 2 weeks and the cellulite is visibly going away. I used to see a lot of it at the back of my thighs when I looked at them through the mirror but it is seriously reduced. Moreover, the stretch marks that I have on the sides of my thighs are visibly reduced too. I recently read an article that cellulite and stretch marks are caused by the same problem--lack of water in the right places and broken-down cells-- so I guess it worked for the stretch marks too.&lt;br /&gt;  I have used almost everyday morning and night. The bottle is half empty so I guess one bottle is for about a month. I&#x27;m here to buy one more round--i&#x27;m going abroad for a month in May and I&#x27;m taking it with me.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Finulite AM/PM daily as per instructions.  I see no difference in cellulite at all so far.  The product smells beautiful and is easy to apply.  My skin is a little smoother to the touch.  Maybe I was expecting a miracle!</li>
            <li> I only use the product for four days. It really works!&lt;br /&gt;  I applied the cream on my inner thighs, then did massage. Now I can tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;  I never trust any slim-product. I lose weight through diet and exercise. But regarding to the stubborn fat and ugly skin on my inner thigh, I believe this product is super helpful.&lt;br /&gt;  You had better do massage after applying the product. I bought Phat QR Body &amp; Cellulite Massager. It is also good for releasing and comforting muscles.&lt;br /&gt;  Go on a diet first, then use the product.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second set of Finulite. I haven&#x27;t used it in a couple of weeks and Gash do I miss it!! I definitely noticed a difference in my legs. I used to be pretty self conscience wearing shorts but after using this product for a couple of weeks it gave me a HUGE confidence boost! I 100% recommend this product. It works and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HELPPP! i ORDERED MY SECOND SET AND THE LOOK, FEEL AND SMELL OF THE LOTION IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST SET I HAD. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT COLOR THE ACTUAL LOTION IS!! THE FIRST TIME THE LOTION WAS LIKE A PEACH COLOR.. THIS TIME IT IS WHITE!!</li>
            <li> I wish I was writing a different review. As the bottle says, no cream in itself is effective as I well know. Which I why I have a strict diet, rigorous exercise, and skin brushing routine. I bought this product to try instead of FatGirlSlim. It doesn&#x27;t do the job. It might as well been plain hand cream.</li>
            <li> I like this product alot and have just received my second order.  I am a very fit 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; 135 lb women, but at 45 yrs old, I have some cellulite on my legs.  Expecially 2 pronounced dimples on the top of 1 leg.  As I expected the lotion helped to release trapped toxins under the skin (a big part of celluite) and I have notice a 75% reduction in my 2 stubborn dimples.  It smells like lemons but I like lemon and it didn&#x27;t leave me super sticky after application (no more than normal lotion). Both bottles lasted about a month using as directed am and pm.  Eating a clean diet really helps too - expecially cutting out refinded white sugar and starches.  That is what most of the stored up toxins are from - sugars!  In closing, it is no magic in a bottle but it has helped more than I expected.</li>
            <li> They work. I like the smell of the products. However, 2 bottles for am and pm to me is a hassle. So it took me a few weeks to stick to the routine. I also used Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt at the same time. After a month, early sign of cellulite disappeared. Now I can go to the pool, proudly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. After everything i&#x27;ve tried over the years, and spending a lot of money, this is the best treatment that has worked to get rid of my cellulite. I like that it&#x27;s affordable and it doesn&#x27;t take too long to see results!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this product; it really works! I have tried several brands and this one is by far the best one in the market.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product due to stretch marks I have on my legs. I was very ashamed of my stretch marks cause I used to have very toned legs .. my marks were pretty dark as well. I finally decided that I had to do something. I was looking around for stretch mark creams and many sounded promising. But this one, stood out to me and I&#x27;m so happy Ipurchased it. Its inexpensive and lasts about a month or so depending on your usage. I noticed after two days that my marks were fading. This product also came wwith other helpful reviews from people with the same problem I was having. This product is very easy to use (just like applying lotion) and you see fast results. This product isn&#x27;t the cheapest or the most expensive but I&#x27;m sure after almost two months of use its one of the best. I have no want or need to even be curious about other products because this one does the job. Also the shipping was even earlier than the estimated arrival date, that&#x27;s always a plus!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!  As an RN, I was skeptical that it would help but wanted to try just in case. I am so glad I did, as it is already helping &amp; I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week &amp; a half. If it works on a 50+ year old grandma, it should work on anyone. I love this product for its results but it also smells great! I definitely will purchase more as I want to keep the cellulite off.</li>
            <li> Never really saw any changes. Gave up and started using the gym every day and that&#x27;s where I got my results from.</li>
            <li> This stuff works fabulously! I rubbed it on every day and night for a month and noticed immediate results! Every day my cellulite diminished and I also felt better circulation and a warm feeling on my legs. The product also smells very good and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin like other creams. I really like it and will continue to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Finulite is s great product I have been using it for a while now and it helps reduce the appearance of cellulite. It feels just like lotion and smells good too. Other cellulite creams leave you feeling sticky but this one doesn&#x27;t. If you are wanting to get rid of cellulite give it a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! Being a fitness competitor and getting to a very lean physique, there is always a little cellulite that hangs on for dear life on my thighs and butt. This helps to smooth out those trouble spots. You have to apply it consistently and really massage it in to the skin. You can&#x27;t just slap it on like a body lotion and expect it to work, use your fist to massage it into the trouble areas. Anytime I want to look a bit better in shorts or a swim suit, 30 days makes a HUGE difference. Of course you have to keep applying for results ( I apply every couple days to maintain once I like where I&#x27;m at), it isn&#x27;t a permanent solution. However anything that will boost my confidence in wearing shorts or a swimsuit in 30 days is a WIN for me.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased Bella Baci Cups and was using them with almond oil.  After I was done, I&#x27;d wipe off the oil and use the Finulite.  That in conjunction with yoga, I saw a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;I got very busy at work and was unable to keep up the routine and saw things return to less than desirable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently started up again; am doing Endermologie, eating cleanly as possible (less cheese, pasta, bread, alcohol and sugar... more veggies and more water), bikram yoga and just started TRX, along with my second order of Finulite as well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say which element has had the most affect, but I would definitely say I see a noticeable difference when I use the Finulite.</li>
            <li> Description made me think it would have a nice herbal smell but this is strong and sickening.  No way I could sleep with this on.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a year ago and used as directed and NO RESULTS!!!!!  DO NOT waste your money on this product!!!! Just drinks lots of water and exercise vigorously!!! Stay away from fatty foods and avoid a lot of carbonated drinks which contribute to cellulite!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for several months now and I just love how much it smooths my cellulite.  It helps keep my leg area feel silky smooth. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised! Skin smoothed out in about 2 weeks! I use it on my arms and they are smoother than ever! Not visibly but also to the touch. Will reorder! Use sparingly as directed. If you don&#x27;t have the special massage brush working in lightly with knuckles worked for me.</li>
            <li> didnt see any results with this.  Plus the smell was not that great.  i would not recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Since I started using these creams (about 6 weeks ago) I&#x27;ve dropped from a size 29 to a 27-28! I can now fit into jeans I wore over 2 yrs ago (pre-pregnancy). From past experiences with these types of products, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But I started to notice and feel my skin change, and am SO pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far. I highly recommend it. Its worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I am 40ish, average sized, weighing about 130, and starting to really notice the cellulite on the back of my thighs. This product had great reviews so I gave it a try. First let me say I really liked the scent and the non-greasy feel, but I didn&#x27;t pay thirty dollars for a good smelling lotion. I used this product religiously every morning and every night until the bottles were empty and made sure to really massage it in until well absorbed. In the end I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in the cellulite on my thighs whatsoever. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I don&#x27;t have enough cellulite OR maybe it will take another month to see results - but I&#x27;m not betting my money on it!</li>
            <li> It is very good smell, just now I received it ,I applied it on the area that have a cellulite, and I wait the result through the next days but really I am very excited to know the result ,and I will post a gain !  ,</li>
            <li> Buy the finulite mitt. Don&#x27;t waste your time on the lotion. Combine coconut oil and the mitt and you&#x27;ll see great results.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I have tried it all, and this product really works well! If you are consistant and follow the directions on the package, you will really see less dimples and smoother skin in less than 30 days. I have ordered three sets of the lotions, and will continue to use this product as part of my regiman. I ordered the finulite mitt recommended with this product and I would not use one without the other!! Being a fitness trainer, I have recommended this product, and will continue to do so!!</li>
            <li> Great product it really works and I will definitely order again . Fast shipping great price</li>
            <li> Works great. Very fast delivered. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> omg this thing really works, i got my first set in feb 2012 and its now may im on my 2nd round now and these past 3 months i totally can see a change in apperance and smoothness!!! its almost time for my vacation and for the bikini!!</li>
            <li> This product is good. I used it the second night that  I received it. I seen results in the first week. Its easy to apply. Just use the pink bottle in the morning or after shower and use the purple bottle before bed. I wil recommend this product to anyone who is tired of cottish cheese on their body.</li>
            <li> I started using this item on May 25, 2012 and I noticed a difference about two weeks later. The cellulite on my thighs is not gone, however it is greatly diminished. My daughter even made a comment about how that cream I was using was working. I was wearing shorts down to my knees because I was self conscious of the cellulite. Yesterday I wore shorts that went to mid thigh. I have tried a lot to diminish the appearance of the cellulite on my legs over the years and nothing ever worked. I will order this product again and keep using it. It does require constant use to maintain the smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improv of skin</li>
            <li> The other reviews said it diminishes cellulite.  I did not see any difference.  I thought I would try it because the cost was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I can see a huge difference. I did not have a large amount of cellulite but i did have one area that was getting pretty bad on my left thigh. The cellulite in that area has diminished significantly within 2 weeks. I just apply the cream in the morning and at night with my hands. I will definitely be purchasing more of this product!</li>
            <li> I bought the Finulite and have been using it for about a month. Of course I was very skeptical, but after seeing the reviews here on Amazon I thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am by no means overweight, but - as I imagine most of you reading this review - I have received the genetic curse of cellulite (gee, thanks mom!). I am young, I work out, I eat very healthy, but being in nursing school is a stressful experience and the lack of sleep and excess of coffee has resulted in an increase in cellulite over the past year.&lt;br /&gt;Although this is not a miracle cure, I have seen a decrease in my cellulite the past month. I am using the cream in combination with the finulite smoothing massage mitt to increase blood flow and absorption into the tissues. I am also combining it with Chinese cupping to increase lymphatic drainage and get rid of toxins.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a set for my sister as well and she is also seeing a difference!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the cream smells great and absorbs quickly. I would say that the bottles last approximately 2.5 months, depending on how much you put on. I will definitely be ordering another set and I am excited to see the results!</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas and have been using since then so it&#x27;s only been a week. Already my skin looks better - smoother, and more firm. I wore a short dress to a New Years party and my friends all thought I had been working out extra hard. It&#x27;s pretty incredible..I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing even better results and will update when I finish the bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was very hesitant to buy even after all the great reviews. I am glad I did! Have used this product for a little over 2 weeks. I see a noticeable difference I&#x27;m my cellulite.  I also use the finulite mitt. Great combo together. Takes a bit of time to use the mitt, but very worth it. I recently added the finulite soap.  It smells great, makes your skin soft and think all 3; together are the triple threat :) highly recommend.  All you have to lose by buying is your cellulite! I for sure recommend using with the mitt. Might be why some aren&#x27;t having good results.  Also something you should definitely use twice a day every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my third set of bottles and I have to say I am impressed. Like they say, you didn&#x27;t get the cellulite in a month, so how can you expect it to resolve in a month, but I do see definite improvements. I still have a long way to go and I don&#x27;t expect this product to do it alone, but it has helped a lot with smoothing everything out. I will keep it up because I&#x27;m very happy so far. Absolutely get the mitt, I think the massaging action helps the product penetrate and stimulates circulation as well. Every little bit helps! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work to reduce the appearance of cellulite.  It is a great lotion tho and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> i bought this product from another website  i like the results that i see in finulite website  for many people  I&#x27;m excited to use</li>
            <li> Been researching for a while for a good product to help with this annoying problem.  Appreciate the day/night application.  This may be the key to the product&#x27;s success. This product is worth the small investment.  Sure beats the huge price and no-guarantees of the alternatives.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any kind of &amp;#34;cellulite cream&amp;#34; on the Internet, and I have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  I noticed my skin felt smoother after just one week, and with consistent use I could see more results after about one month.  Definitely worth it and a great cream!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream as directed on the package for two months now, and I definitely see improvement in the appearance of the cellulite on my thighs.  I also purchased the mitt, and I strongly recommend that for really getting the product worked into the skin.  I just ordered 3 more months supply.  While I do not believe this will get rid of all my cellulite forever (why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars - the package says the end to cellulite), it is helpful.  Each bottle lasts about one month; it smells nice; and also works as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite creams over the years, and it is one of the few products that seems to work.  My cellulite isn&#x27;t gone, but it has definitely improved.  The AM formula makes my legs look firmer immediately and I often use it before wearing shorts or a dress.  I do suggest trying them, and after continued use my legs look much firmer overall.  The creams actually have a nice smell and are very moisturizing.  I do wish that the sizes were larger for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with some other cellulite treatments and I&#x27;ve seen great results. I don&#x27;t give it a 5 stars because I don&#x27;t think that by themselves they will work 100%. To hide cellulite it has to be a combination of different treatments. I&#x27;ve been doing mesotherapy, corporal massages, eating healthy walking 3 times a week and using this. If you are willing to put some work and money into it, trust me it does work.</li>
            <li> After attempt of two other cellulite creams brand with no luck, so thought to give this another chance along with my purchase of massage mitt and it&#x27;s showing better result! I will come back with another feedback in a month to see how much it improves my thighs</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Unable to get product out of bottle without total physical approach of banging the bottle....repeatedly. ..on counter  to get it out...just gave up on the frustration of trying to use ...too bad really...waste of money .</li>
            <li> I think this a very good product. It worked for me but once you finish the lotion it comes back you have to keep using it I guess for better results</li>
            <li> Does not work,  not enough of the needed ingredient.  I used to use another product and thought based on the reviews this might be good to try and this shows me that some reviews might be padded on here.  This sucks!  It is no better than a common moisturizer,  so I will go back to my Skinactives cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any results. The smell is good and it made my skin smooth and soft, but thats about it. I asked my Dermatologist and there is really nothing you can do to get rid of cellulite. All these cosmetics are just ways of spending extra money.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was excited to try this product because of the reviews I read however I am disappointed in the product. I should have known for the price I wasn&#x27;t going to wake up &amp; have a super model back side however I hoped it would reduce some of the bumps. I have been using revitol for about 6 months but because of the holidays I needed to find a cheaper product so I gave this a shot. Lets just say it&#x27;s no revitol. It has kept the appearance down some what but it is a lot more noticeable than with the other product. I have also been using this product with the massager. The plus side of this product is it doesn&#x27;t have the awful smell some of the other products do. It actually smells pretty good. I also like the consistancy of the product. Not a miracle worker but does ok.</li>
            <li> After using full set the first time, I can see a big difference in my legs. I am a little overweight, but hardly wore shorts or skirts due to cellulite. I am exercising while using the products and in one months time, I am convinced after my second order, I shall be clear of cellulite. I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and so far I am very pleased with the results. I know there is not such a thing like a miracle cellulite cream but this one has really improved the look and feel of my legs, they are smoother and have given me more confident for wearing shorts again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product and works! Much better than others very expensive products, easy to put in and smell is very good too!</li>
            <li> The cream obviously doesn&#x27;t get rid of cellulite but I have noticed,what other customers say, as it being more smooth. I just had a baby and my cellulite is so bad. I noticed after a month of the cream the cellulite is not the first thing my eyes are drawn to in the mirror. I used a self tanner and wow what a difference with both products being used. I ordered another set and hopefully it will keep everything at least looking a little less aweful.  Fast shipping from the seller too</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my cellulite but my skin was really soft.  Not enough in the bottles for the price.</li>
            <li> waste of money just work out more and drink tons of water. I got this thinking it would help with the bit of cellulite I got while pregnant. I work out and eat clean but cellulite, as you know is stubborn. Bottom line, there are no short cuts or miracle creams out there. P.s. we are all not super models cellulite happens, learn to live with it or be willing to put in the work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple other cellulite products but decided to give this one a try after reading all the great reviews. And it worked GREAT! I noticed a difference in a couple weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and there has been a drastic change and decrease of cellulite. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I have been only using this product for 4 days, but I am afraid to continue using it because I feel that it has actually made my cellulite worse!  After rubbing the AM cream on this morning, I noticed two large dimples in the front of my thigh that had not been there previously.  I am dieting and running 4 days a week, so I can&#x27;t think of any other reason why these should have suddenly shown up.  I think I&#x27;ll be trying to sell these instead of risking more dimples.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you want immediate result this cream is for you. I apply this before Islip into my shorts. The result? My legs look so beautiful and flawless!!!!!</li>
            <li> Did not see any results</li>
            <li> Omg. Ladies try it!!! It might work for you !!!!im sooo happy and shocked that this cream is actually working.. I&#x27;m on day 11 of using the cream. I&#x27;ve miseed. 2 morning applications. I have been so miserable with cellulite after having my child in February. 2014.. But I lost the weight.. And now have cellulite.i don&#x27;t like to spend too much on beauty products... But this cream was my last hope for cellulite... I&#x27;m very happy to say. The cream is working. I&#x27;ve decided that I was only going to look in the mirror every 7 days...to avoid disappointment... ,,,!!!! So I dint see my legs til day 7!!!!!and omg!! I almost cried.. I&#x27;ve ordered my second bottle . It&#x27;s on its way.. But Im almost finished the bottle and it&#x27;s been 11 days.. Maybe I&#x27;m using too much..I&#x27;m very small and only apply on the back and side of my thighs.im only afraid that if I stop using it.. It will all come back..I&#x27;m hoping to show a before after photo in the future.give it a try!!!good luck!</li>
            <li> As far as anything can help improve the appearance of cellulite (and I&#x27;ve used a lot of things), this product is about the best I&#x27;ve tried. It smells nice and it does get results, but you have to continue using it. So, the con is that the results are temporary, but they really did improve the look of my legs. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too expensive since it does work for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all, don&#x27;t waste your money and try something better. I won&#x27;t buy it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I run ultra marathons and still fight cellulite.  This product helps and I am dedicated to its daily use.</li>
            <li> This is my second order. It works !!!</li>
            <li> I bought the set along with the smoothing mitten that I use in the shower. After just a week, there is a definite difference in the texture and firmness of my skin. It is smoother and some of the dimples have gone down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a ton of cellulite and thought this was a reasonably priced product. The bottles are small, but a little goes a long way. I am excited to try on other problem areas. I think the mitten helps too--I only massage a few minutes where needed and use the creams as directed.</li>
            <li> I had been reading that there was no magic cream to get rid of cellulite but I tried Finulite anyway and it worked!!! I went on an extravagant vacation and I looked great in my bathing suit and got so many compliments thanks to Finulite!! People couldn&#x27;t believe I am in my mid-thirties!</li>
            <li> This cream works! I am 5&#x27; 5\\&quot; and 118 pounds with my clothes on it \\&quot;appears\\&quot; I have a nice figure - with my clothes off is another story! I have had cellulite for years and as I get older it gets worse! I have tried EVERY cream, gel, rollers, etc. and nothing has worked - this actually does! I know everyone is different but with diligence it is working for me - it does not completely get rid of cellulite but it most definitely diminishes it. Oh, and I don&#x27;t work out at all! To the naysayers it just might work for you I would suggest giving it a try - good luck ;)</li>
            <li> I started using the cream two days ago. I am feeling good about it so far. My skin is feeling smoother. I can&#x27;t say the cellulite are vanishing because it&#x27;s only been two days. But I will do this for a couple of weeks and get back to you guys. But for now I have no complaints, I am really liking what I see and in case, I just ordered me some more because the price is very reasonable.... compared to other sites.&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a couple of weeks maybe with before and after pics. ;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;09.15.12, Update&lt;br /&gt;It has been 3 weeks using this product and i have to say it is AMAZING!!!! My thighs are so smooth and the cellulite have reduces sooo much. My husband is amazed. I cannot believe how well this cream works. Well, you have to know how to use it. What I do everyday is clean my skin with alcohol (i got this idea from another buyer&#x27;s review) then I put the cream and rub for about a minute each leg, I then massage my leg for another minute with my massager roller. I am recommending this cream to everyone I know. Finullite please don&#x27;t change!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of this product, because it REALLY DOES WORK! I tried all of the creams and lotions from the drugstores, and none of them really ever worked for me. I am a 28 year-old female who never had problems with cellulite until after I had my daughter in 2007. Before I got pregnant I weighed about 120lbs, and was very toned.  I was really good during my pregnancy with eating right, and I even exercised up until I was 8 month along. That&#x27;s when the personal trainer at the gym finally told me I needed to slow down and quick the gym until after I gave birth.  Even with my good diet and exercise, I still couldn&#x27;t stop the scale from going up a pound or two every morning it seemed.  In the end I delivered my daughter weighing in at 199lbs!  As you can guess, my body didn&#x27;t go back to the way it was pre-pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I did drop the weight by following Weight Watchers and exercising (as much as the little one would let me), but my legs never returned to their original beauty.  The back of my thighs just seemed to have cellulite all over them.  I was down to a size 6, but felt you could still see my dimples through the back of my pants.  I even went as far as spending $6,000 on liposuction.  The doctor told me it would contour my legs and butt more, and help reduce the appearance of my cellulite.  WHATEVER, LIAR!........ The only thing I got out of that was a HUGE credit card bill, which i still haven&#x27;t completely paid off, and three weeks of absolute hell when it came to my pain.  That was last November, and still to this day in September of the following year, I still have pain at the incision sites and I&#x27;m even numb in certain parts of my backside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If I had only known that these creams existed before I went through all that, I&#x27;d be a much happier woman today.  FINULITE IS AWESOME!!!  Within a week or two, I noticed results.  After four weeks, there was a complete difference.  I&#x27;m not saying all the cellulite was gone, but probably about97% is gone.  There are days when I will forget to use it at night, but it never sets me back.  I went to the beach for the first time in 3 years a few weeks ago, and had no anxiety or shame about running around in my little bikini with my 5 year-old.  It was the greatest feeling ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you have tried all the other products and even gone as far as I did with liposuction, GET THIS PRODUCT!  FINULITE HAS CHANGED MY WHOLE ATTITUDE ABOUT SELF-IMAGE AND IT&#x27;S GIVEN ME MY CONFIDENCE BACK!!!  I will continue to buy this product every time the bottles get down to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s worth a shot, especially for it&#x27;s great price, so give it a try.  I bet you will be pleasantly surprised, just like I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  BEST OF LUCK TO YOU!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think Finulite would be a miracle but I expected to work better than it did. I used it every day, every night, but didn&#x27;t get any results. It smells good and feels nice, but I can&#x27;t say it worked for me. I&#x27;ve had better results whit way cheaper products.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a miracle cream that the other reviews bragged about. I don&#x27;t have much cellulite, and was hoping this might get rid of the little bit I had. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> I have been using finulite for the past 6 months or so. I am in pretty good physical shape but as I get older I notice some unwanted cellulite. I have used many other products and have spent tons of money on finding the \\&quot;right\\&quot; product. I have to say finulite is the ONLY product that I have actually been able to see real results from. I have been applying the cream as instructed - once in the morning and once at night. I massage it in pretty firmly and I have personally seen great results. The cream smells great and has a thick consistency and it also leaves your skin feeling very soft. I feel like my skin looks much more firm and the cellulite has gone away almost completly. I was skeptical to try yet another cream...... after spending so much on other products but I am so glad I did. I use about one set per month and find the prodcut to be well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! Fantastic product-and believe me-I have tried them all. This one truly appears to work.(and that is what matters, right?) After using 4 weeks I  received many compliments and comments regarding how great I looked-even some wanting to know if I had lost weight! What can be better than this??? Obvious cellulite reduction in the thigh area as well as improved skin firmness and  texture -YAY! I am on my 3rd order and have no doubt I will order a 4th and more! Finulite is now a part of my daily routine. believe the great reviews---Finally, a product that really shows results!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I decided to try Finulite. I&#x27;ll be honest..I did not really expect it to work, but I figured that I would give it a try. I was amazed at the results. I had pretty bad cellulite on my legs that I had been trying to get rid of by working out for a couple of months, but that just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. Within the first month of using Finulite I noticed drastic results. My legs were so much smoother by the end of the month to the touch and much of the visual cellulite had reduced. I have been buying it ever since (roughly 5 months). The results did seem to slow slightly after the second month, but I am extremely happy to say that (unless I am sitting down where there are still some little dents) my legs are visibly free of cellulite. I LOVE IT! I felt so self-conscious because of the cellulite before- I would not even wear shorts unless they went to my knees, but I will gladly show off my shorty-shorts any time now. It&#x27;s really an amazing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I have been dieting and working out at the same time as using Finulite, so I am sure that has helped also.. but Finulite really helped me get rid of my cellulite much faster and has allowed me to keep it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 months and I must say that it DEFINITELY works!!! After 2 weeks, you see improvement. I believe that if I continue to use it for another 3 months or so, all of the cellulite that I have accumulated over 9 years will be completely gone. Great product! Thank you Finulite!</li>
            <li> In addition to regular leg and rear exercises, I had tried nearly every topical product on the market to reduce cellulite on my upper thighs and rear.  Recently I read that the only proven way to reduce cellulite was a medical procedure, costing about $2500.  Before starting to research procedures, I decided to peruse Amazon for reviews of cellulite reduction products to be sure I hadn&#x27;t missed anything.  The ratings and reviews of Finulite, many with before-and-after photos, were enough to convince me to hold off on spending thousands of dollars and try one more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I glad I did!  As other reviewers have commented, you do need to continue with toning exercises, use a stimulator before applying the creams, and apply them twice a day religiously to see results.  While my cellulite isn&#x27;t gone, I can say that after 6 weeks the depth of my dimples is improved and my skin is smoother and more taut in those areas where I apply the cream.  I now wish I had taken \\&quot;before\\&quot; photos, and am commited to using the product for at least another 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one criticism is that I cannot find anywhere if the product must to be used for maintenance or not, once optimal results are reached.</li>
            <li> Not magical, but I do see a difference. I don&#x27;t think it is going to magically eliminate your cellulite, but I think it can improve the appearance of problem areas. It makes my skin firmer and smooth. I&#x27;ll keep using...</li>
            <li> This product works well: within three days of use, I noticed a dramatic difference in the appearance and texture of the fat deposits, and the results have lasted since I finished the Finulite 6 weeks ago. The product is very thick and hard to squeeze out of the bottles, so I added a little water and it worked fine. I will definitely purchase this item again if I ever need it, and I would like to add that it works better than the Nivea cellulite treatment, which in itself does work well.</li>
            <li> This product has done absolutely nothing for me! I&#x27;m starting to think that all of the good reviews are fake. If you guys don&#x27;t believe me I can take a picture holding this product to prove to you guys that I bought it and you can clearly see my terrible cellulite. It hasn&#x27;t removed one percent of it! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I&#x27;ve even been exercising and it hasn&#x27;t worked. To me it looks like my cellulite has gotten worse. Beware these fake products, this stuff should be boycotted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-UPDATE: I WAS GIVEN A FULL REFUNDED...EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
            <li> this product was ok. it works really slow.  It say day and night cream, but I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference, only the color, thts abt it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if necessarily reduces cellulite but it certainly makes me legs a lot smoother!!!  My legs are 10x softer now thanks to this! This is my 3rd order and I will order again !!</li>
            <li> I used the product as recommended and even bought the Finulite massage mitt and still no results. I spent countless minutes massaging the cream into the back of my thighs and I saw no change in the appearance of my cellulite. I even waited almost 2 months to write a review to see if I just hadn&#x27;t been using it long enough but it appears that it wasn&#x27;t my patience but rather this product that was the problem. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed considering the amount of money I spent for such a small amount of cream that doesn&#x27;t even work. All in all I would NOT recommended!</li>
            <li> I use this product about a month now. i love it. I see the different in my legs and everytime i put it on. I feel the sore in my legs thats how i know its working. i recommend to buyer. this is the best product i ever used compare to the nivea goodbye cellulite. I&#x27;m almost out, going to order some more next week. &#x3D;) worth buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approx. 3 months. The product has a fresh citrusy scent that I love ( normally , I am very sensitive to smells from moisturizers and only buy &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products). I have noticed a change of texture and firmness on the backs of my legs, front legs above knees,stomach and upper arms since using the Finulite product. I am a slender 40 yr. old woman who has always had cellulite on the backs of my legs. I use the product most of the time as directed but sometimes I don&#x27;t have time for one of the applications. It still seems to look better than before I started. The real changes started happening when I used the  FInulite mostuizers along with the Finulite massage mitt. I think it really is helping to either break up fat deposits or just drain excess fluids. Using them together has absolutely made a difference. I did get horrible bruises on the the first few massages but I kept with it and lightened my pressure. It&#x27;s not 100% gone but I&#x27;m very happy with the changes so far. I will continue using both products.</li>
            <li> Luvin&#x27; it !!!!!!  These lotions smell so nice-I especially love the P.M. one.  I use the Finulite along with a &amp;#34;Diva Stuff Cellulite Reducing Coffee Scrub Bar&amp;#34;  &amp; I am in heaven!  The effects have made me really happy.  I just don&#x27;t know if they will last, and how long can I continue to use these lotions.  Does anyone know how long you should stay on this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;m hooked on my combination.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now and I&#x27;m reordering some more today.  I hope this is helpful for someone seeking help with cellulite reduction.  The reviews I read before buying Finulite was spot on ...peace.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what i thought was going to happen when i purchased this i knew i was tired of my cellulite but after i dug into what this cream is supposed to do i really looked out for the results. I have only had this cream for two weeks or so but wow! I mean i wasn&#x27;t even consistent as i should be but i&#x27;ve been using this cream with the &amp;#34;Touch Me&amp;#34; cellulite massager and the small dimples on the back of my legs have definitely decreased in size. My BMI is 30 but no matter size i&#x27;ve had this issue. If your considering than definitely try it.</li>
            <li> I was using it for 2 months but I didn&#x27;t see any change what so ever, best thing is to use machines.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I decided to give this product a try and I must say that I hadn&#x27;t seen any difference at all. I workout and eat right but was really hoping for the best that was not delivered. I wasn&#x27;t really happy about trying more than one product for day and night and should have followed my instincts in the first place. Will not purchase again!!</li>
            <li> It took awhile, but I did see some results, I just wish the bottles were bigger. Works best in conjunction with other methods, I think it speeds up the results you see from drinking your water and excersizing.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd order. This product does help if you follow directions and apply pm formula 2 hours after meal and am formula 1 hour before you eat. It is hard to squeeze out of the bottle but I cut bottles in half and transferred am stuff in an empty jar I had and pm stuff in another empty jar. Don&#x27;t have to deal with that anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Drink plenty of water with lemon and don&#x27;t skip applications. I took before and after photos last time I ordered it last year and did see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It will not remove your cellulite completely but will help minimize appearance of your cellulite. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Purchased this about two months ago and noticed a difference in about three weeks. I eat healthy, workout 4-5 times a week and had a bit of cellulite that I could notice. This cream has worked like a charm and I will definitely re-order!</li>
            <li> After using this product for the past 3-4 weeks, along with the Finulite Anti Cellulite Treatment Skin Exfoliating Soap I have been seeing noticeable difference in my cellulite. I have been contemplating buying it for some time now and finally decided to purchase it. I&#x27;m very happy I did and also recommended it to some of my friends who have also ordered it. Finulite cream and soap also has a mild but very pleasant fragrance. Although this product is working for me, a change in diet and at least 20-25 minutes of exercise assist in the process of reducing cellulite. My skin generally feels and looks better....I have have already ordered again. ..</li>
            <li> It works!!!  Noticed a difference after just a few weeks.  I&#x27;m now wearing my bikini with confidence.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I have used this religiously, day and night with the &amp;#34;bliss Fatgirlslimulator Stimulating Massage Tool&amp;#34; and saw absolutely no change. Will not purchase again...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and really love it, easy to use in the morning and evening after shower no mess, no strong fragrance, it absorbs quickly and let my skin soft.  I have noticed less cellulite and definitely my skin is firmer.  Of course I do exercise and eat very healthy but this product is a great complement .. I have recommended to other people and they feel so satisfied as well .. definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I was using Avon before and it was great but its discontinued. This product is ok, works with massage but not as quickly as Avon did.</li>
            <li> I gave Finulite 5 stars because I think this product is just GREAT! I have been using it for 3 months and my results are incredible. I was skeptical at the beginning for I had tried so many products to fight my cellulite, but I got convinced to give Finulite  a try after reading the positive comments on Amazon. I am so happy I did this. After 12 weeks of constant use I cannot recognize my legs. I used the cream religiously twice a day for 12 weeks and it REALLY worked. I think the key words for this product are regularity and perseverance. The only negative side is the size of the bottle, 4 oz don&#x27;t last much. But this product is worth the money as it really works!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend asked me to get her cellulite cream and I found this one online. She loves it! It smells good and it works. It needs to be used consistently and everyday to see the results but it works.</li>
            <li> im an expert on cellulite creams this seemed legit but it didnt work. the bottles are small too. you&#x27;re better off buying bliss fatgirlslim or clarins high definition body lift, overall it was just a nice moisturizer lol thats all they did .</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this product works wonders. You must keep a healthy diet too and drink plenty of water. Must use with massage mitt</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I am a repeat customer and I found this to be&lt;br /&gt;very helpful for me, especially after the winter thru spring and summer!&lt;br /&gt;I used it last year for 4-6 months. Exercising with it consistently.&lt;br /&gt;This year, there is less actual exercise temporary however, but I&#x27;m very consistent with manual hand massage tools, electric massage use, and I am definitely getting results.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent of it, almost could eat it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Aromatherapy Massage practitioner and I totally approve!&lt;br /&gt;Also great along with with de tox herbs and or detoxing herbal teas!</li>
            <li> After using it for a month and forgetting to apply it every now and then, I still think it is working. No harmful ingredients - that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I have used this product it works . It increases your metabolism rate and helps in achieving your goal. But you need to be little bit patient and regular in use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any differences. Did it twice a day like instructed. I massaged, drybrushed, dermarolled, and exercised. Was hoping for temporary results atleast!</li>
            <li> Too many products fot cellulite I was expecting at least better results, the bottles are to small I think should try other products.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of expectations about this product because of former reviews but sincerely it does not work, unfortunately cellulite is very difficult to treat and like this one a lot of products in this market offer improvement in cellulite condition but most of them simply don&#x27;t have positive results, so for me this was same as others, &amp;#34;Not good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one month now.  I can definitely see a difference on the areas I am putting it on.  My skin is smoother, tighter and feels silky soft.  I was eager to try this product as I have read so many positive reviews on it.  You can&#x27;t beat the price compared to other expensive cellulite creams.  I am a huge fan and will continue to use this product.  I highly recommend trying it!!!</li>
            <li> Difficult to use twice a day. Before bed, I just want to brush my teeth and get into bed. I don&#x27;t feel like rubbing this cream on my thighs. It is also very thick and difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Finulite is amazing, it truly does work. I started using finulite, because i had cellulite that i didnt like. I wanted to look good for the summer. And to look hot in a bikini. Now i can do that with the help of finulite!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and can see a slight improvement.  I do wish only had to apply once a day. I don&#x27;t always remember to put it on of an evening.</li>
            <li> I used these two products together - one in the AM, and one in the PM faithfully until it was gone.  I saw or felt no improvement with my cellulite.  Also I found the bottles to be very stiff in squeezing out the creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Finulite for two months (one set per month) and my skin is now firmer, smoother and softer. The cream has a nice texture, it smells good, absorbs quickly and is not sticky. I&#x27;ve seen and &amp;#34;touched&amp;#34; an improvement so I will keep on using this product to reduce my cellulite as much as possible: if I get rid of it, I&#x27;ll give Finulite five stars ;-)</li>
            <li> I faithfully used these two products as directed and had no results in terms of improvement of my cellulite.  I am not going to purchase any of these worthless products again because they do not work.</li>
            <li> This cream really works. I&#x27;ve been massaging it in just with my hands, but I&#x27;m getting the mitt to use to amp up the results. I noticed smoother, tighter thighs after the first application. I really feel like it is reducing the dimensions of my legs. I try to remember to do dry brushing before using the PM cream. If you wanted to really stimulate the tissues, I&#x27;d suggest dry brushing before showering and then using the AM cream. I&#x27;m planning on using the mitt after showering and applying the cream in the morning. I&#x27;ve tried lots of similar products and this one works and smells better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very good texture, great scent and does something but you know the rest is diet and exercise, is not miracle but like it</li>
            <li> Just work out and eat right. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work and the mitt leaves bruises everywhere. I won&#x27;t ever purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product. It smells good when you open the cap. However, the cream is thick and very hard to squeeze from the bottle. I have arthritis in my hands so this is impossible for me. Sorry I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I could see a definite improvement in my skin tone and texture. Just gotta keep it up! I really liked it!&lt;br /&gt;Gotta use the massager too!</li>
            <li> It does work I still using the some cream and soap highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like a very cheap lotion and doesn&#x27;t work.  I would recommend SWEAT SWEET instead of this stuff.</li>
            <li> After using both bottles day and nite, there is no change in the appearance of my cellulite.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the 5 star reviews this product has received. Along with my order, I received a note from Finulite, which states if you like and rate the product with 5 stars, you will be added to a draw for free products.    So far I&#x27;ve been using the products for a few weeks, but the difference is minimal (even after exercising, and watching my diet). I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the lotion that does the trick, but the massaging.    The older lotion packaging is annoying (with the dispenser at the top of the bottle), it&#x27;s hard to get the product out of the bottle, even when it&#x27;s full.</li>
            <li> Did not see any clear results</li>
            <li> Wife says this cream stuff does not work. My wife is not a liar. Therefore, this cream stuff does not work.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed for three weeks. The shape of my skin on my butt became flatter, and I still had cellulite. Awful. If I had a time machine, I&#x27;d slap this terrible product out of my own hand before I ever put it on. &amp;#62;:(</li>
            <li> Not too sure this is working. Had cavi-lipo also before this for cellulite but not sure lany of it works.</li>
            <li> I used both bottles, and my legs still look the same as they did when I first started using  Finulite, I dont no what all the HYPE is about in the REVIEWS, I am a REAL PERSON and this did NOTHING for my the cellulite on my legs and I am 120 lbs and work out daily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the reviews.  I followed the directions exactly, and I am almost done with the bottles.  I do not see much of a change at all.  Maybe I need to continue, but I am not sure that I will.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004WSXD4G Finulite - The End to Cellulite AM/PM (8 oz)]] IS the best cellulite cream I&#x27;ve ever used hands down!  Of course you didn&#x27;t get celulite overnight, so don&#x27;t expect to get rid of it overnight.  The key is to be patient and keep at it.  I have been using this product diligently for a little over a month on my butt and thighs and can honestly say that my celulite IS going away!!  Yay!!  I have pretty much suffered with \\&quot;cottage cheese thighs,\\&quot; since having children, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on \\&quot;plastic surgery\\&quot;  fixes.  So I promised myself that I would try a product and give it a chance, and boy am I happy that I found FINULITE!!  I am so confidant that if I continue with this cream, I wil not be embarrassed to wear short shorts this summer.  Give it a try, be patient and you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer. This product came to me in a timely manner as estimated. Most products that I have previously used in the past do not have a good smell to them and were a waste of time and money, This product, on the other hand, has a nice smell and absorbs into skin without leaving any type of greasy residue. I noticed a change in the texture of my skin after about two weeks of using this product. I do work out which is always a plus in conjunction with the product. So if you want a product that will give you a positive result, here you have it. Give it time, as you would do with any other product, but you will see results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 1/2 months now. I just recently ordered another set of this.  I have been using it morning and night and I can definitely can see a difference. I use it on the back of my thighs, stomach, and hips.  I would definitely recommend trying this out but you need to be consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this currently I can&#x27;t see the difference just yet but with diet change and exercise it&#x27;s possible will update</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite on and off for over a year and it works wonders, and when combined with diet and exercise its even better. I notice a huge difference within a week of using it and the results last even when I stop using it.</li>
            <li> I am a 33 year old woman,  I have really bad cellulite.  Whether it&#x27;s from being over weight most of my life, I&#x27;m not sure.  I have lost 90 pounds and it&#x27;s still very bad.  I started using finulite a month ago, and wow huge results!  However,  you must follow the directions and use it EVERYDAY!  IF YOU WANT GoOD RESULTS!  Consistency is key!</li>
            <li> I have tried ALLOT  of cellulite creams on the market, first of all I love how there is an a.m. and p.m. cream. some reviews complain about there being a small amount of finulite in the bottles, but you use them separately, so it&#x27;s actually eight ounces of cream, which is more than some  other skin systems come with! the morning cream I put on after I shower before I get dressed,  it takes about an hour and I really feel it working and  heating up,  makes me sweat allot more,  which is a good thing.  the p.m. cream smells like lavender so it&#x27;s relaxing and  doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals. I am close to finishing my first month and have noticed a dramatic difference, I have been doing cellulite removal a while now from losing weight and this stuff  does what it says it does. I recommended it to anyone, I already ordered my next month to keep the progress going, I don&#x27;t have really bad skin to begin with, but what I do have is vanishing in combination with the finulite cellulite  remover mitt. I love the mitt also,  it  even helps with a stiff neck.  everyone is different,  but read the reviews carefully, because this is a good product,  some people are just  too picky and/ or not patient</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and have noted some difference- enough for me to order another set and keep going with it.  My cellulite was very noticeable on the back of my thighs.  I have made dietary changes and am using the finulite mitt along with the product and have seen a lessening of the cellulite.  Good product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my SO...she enjoys using it more than competing products. She mentioned that she really likes the scent, describing it as similar to grapefruit; it absorbs quickly (and goes on lightly); and it leaves her skin feeling smooth. She hasn&#x27;t used it long enough to discern the cellulite diminishing; nevertheless, this has become a go-to product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JULY 13 UPDATE: Her feedback after roughly three months is that her skin is starting to appears tighter, and therefore cellulite is slowly smoothing out. Per the previous comments, her skin remains soft and supple, and she enjoys using it for the moisturizing qualities alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted previously, the only factor going against 5 stars is that the tubes could be larger.</li>
            <li> The main thing with these creams is you have to be diligent and consistent, which I wasn&#x27;t. It is a PAIN in the butt to do it every night and every morning, scrubbing with the somewhat painful glove I bought with it. It did make my skin super smooth, but cellulite is a bitch to get rid of even with exercise (lots of thin people I know have cellulite, so it&#x27;s definitely not a fat people thing). Long story short, I got tired of the routine and gave up.</li>
            <li> Excellent results.  Best one I have tried, and I have tried many! Great price too for what you are getting - and the tubes are a lot more sanitary and much easier to handle than the typical jars you find out there. No regrets here!</li>
            <li> Once again, disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried them all and get no results. I think I need to save my money and head to a spa for advance treatment.</li>
            <li> Knowing realistically that cellulite can&#x27;t really ever fully disappear, this product is about as good as it gets. I am always more confident in shorts and a bathing suit when I&#x27;ve been consistent with applying my Finulite. My cellulite wasn&#x27;t really severe, but I do feel like it makes me smoother. It smells nice, absorbs quickly, and lasts longer than other cellulite creams sold at the same price.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different cellulite products, including Finulite.  I keep coming back to Finulite as in my opinion it works the best.  It has a great scent and absorbs quickly.  Great product! Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this with the finulite mit and have had no luck what so ever.  On to the next product</li>
            <li> I tried this and it just does not work.  All it does is make your skin silky smooth.  For th eprice I paid for the two small (very small) bottles, I could have bought a couple of large (very large) bottles of lotion that would do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a scam and anyone who thinks it actually works is just kidding themself.  I took before and after photos and there was no difference.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite so I thought it would be an easy fix.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It just made my wallet lighter.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far. I am going to purchase another set of the AM and PM cellulite lotion. It will work well over a log period of time. Cellulite is stubborn fat buildup under the skin that takes time to get rid of but with the right products it can be done. Exercise and work out too please and PLENTY OF WATER!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for this cream. Not only does it work but their customer service is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I already bought 2 sets of creams and their smoothing massage mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I have used it on and off for 2 years - do to being out of the country and finances.  The product smells great.  I am always please with the results I have seen despite my lack of consistency. Over the next 3 months, I plan to use it religiously and take before and after pics - so I will update then!</li>
            <li> Good product. Do not lose hope, does take time to work as most things do! Will buy again, helped tone up the skin after having 2 babies, which then made me more comfortable in my own skin!</li>
            <li> For the last 2 or 3 years, I have found myself combating cellulite every way I possibly could. I started to diet very poorly these last 2 to 3 years due to a lot of financial stress that was pushed on to me. Working two jobs, still going to university... taking care of my mother and brother... I made some poor eating choices throughout those times and, of course... cellulite began rear its ugly head. It progressed to the point where I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing skirts or shorts. My thighs were really that bad. I spent countless hours scouring the internet for natural remedies and no matter what I did, nothing work.&lt;br /&gt;However... after reading a few reviews on Finulite, while skeptical at first, decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so, so glad I made that purchase 2 months ago. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s been an overnight MIRACLE but I definitely see improvement from before. My thighs feel firmer, my dimples are no longer as prominent, and I can just tell it&#x27;s working. I love this product. It smells fantastic and is so easy to apply! The mitt really does help too!&lt;br /&gt;I think that with continuous use, the dimples I have left will be 99.99% gone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Finulite, for this wonderful product. I am comfortable enough to finally wear dresses and skirts again. Will continue buying and recommend to all!</li>
            <li> It is a great product, I have been using for two weeks and combined with exercising it has made my skin look firmer and the texture smoother. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> These products really work. I&#x27;ve used these creams during the last 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve observed a huge improvement in my legs. I&#x27;ll say that around 50% of my cellulitis is gone. I totally recommend these products</li>
            <li> The finulite works pretty good, you don&#x27;t see major changes, but you do get results. I recommend this for someone who doesn&#x27;t have significant amount of cellulite.</li>
            <li> do not buy. waste of money...not what i expected....did not see even the slightest bit of results. too bad..i was hoping</li>
            <li> Seen no differene n I did wear it evety night and morning and bottle are hard to squezze product out</li>
            <li> I have had increasing amounts of cellulite on the back of my legs for more than a decade. I live an active lifestyle, workout three times a week, eat healthy, and have a slender build. I always thought there was nothing I could do about the cellulite short of plastic surgery. Over the years, the cellulite worsened. Summer was coming up, and I thought: why not try one of those creams. It seems too easy and too good to be true, but I&#x27;m feeling adventurous. I researched different products on Amazon.com and decided to give this one a try. I been putting the cream on fairly consistently twice a day for three or four weeks now, and I am amazed by the results. The cellulite is much reduced already. I purchased the Finulite massage mit too, and I use that with the PM cream. I just bought my second set of creams and plan to keep this up for a few more months. I wish I had started this years ago!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and has reduced my cellulite by 80% I would say. Hopefully I will be able to get rid of it completely by next month. Also, I should say I have barely been working out. This is a life saver!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a fair chance so I waited to write the review.  I have used in for 3 months am and pm.  Even used a massage brush before applying in the pm.  It did make the skin softer but I don&#x27;t see any tightening.  I also started drinking 8 glasses of water to help it along.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I will finish using the bottles and waiting for the next magic potion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother purchasing this product. Did not help me what so ever!!!! I did not even want to put 1 star but had to.</li>
            <li> The finulite i really see results. My bottles are almost empty and im definiltly going to order more. I also used the finulite brush which i think helps with the great results. Im normally very hard to please so for me to say something works trust me it does!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have ever found that has significantly diminished the appearance of the cellulite on my outer thighs. I was skeptical at first since nothing else has worked to include ultrasonic cavitation, as well as strict diet and exercise. You have to use it consistently however..when you stop the appearance returns but it is well worth the effort!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these AM/PM creams in combination with the exfoliating soap and mitt and have definitely noticed a difference on my thighs!  These are amazing! Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> ... it does not do absolutely anything with cellulite.. So in case it claims it does, here are only 2 stars for it. And those are mainly for the packaging and the effort. But those who are looking for &amp;#34;cellulite cure&amp;#34; - this is NOT the one. Alas.</li>
            <li> I purchased it from italy , hoping and trusting in positive feedback , but it didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sad of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ilary</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase would  highly recommend</li>
            <li> I got it for my wife who had been using it for a while and she loves it. She says she doesn&#x27;t even try to look for something different since this product works wonderful. She tried many different products including expensive ones and this product works the best. Will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that these products did anything for me. However, they smell really nice and I like the smell and the lotion.. just don&#x27;t expect a miracle using these as a routine.</li>
            <li> Did not do much more than moisturize.  I would not buy again I can use vitamin E cream and get same results.</li>
            <li> There is no magic cream to get rid of cellulite (I&#x27;ve tried them all), but I do think that this cream along with diet and exercise (tons of leg lifts and glut focused workout-DVD) and skin brushing does help to &amp;#34;reduce the appearance of cellutite&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and this works well to help diminish cellulite. I find that if I don&#x27;t use it I am prone to small cellulite bumps on the backs of my thighs. If I use this faithfully they are never there and the look of cellulite is fainter than when I forget to use this. I will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> This product really really works! Within a day I saw a difference within my cellulite. I tell everyone about this product. I have been told by so many different people that cellulite cream doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t believe them! This stuff works. I buy this cream as a gift to my friends because I know they will use it.</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant at purchasing the product because it seemed too good to be true.  But, I figured it is much cheaper than continuing endermology....so I bought it along with some cellulite workout pants.  Well, IT DOES WORK!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light and fresh so using it at night doesn&#x27;t keep you awake because of the fragrance being so strong.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try....the only thing you got to loose is those dimpling yucky legs....</li>
            <li> I bought this for a girl.  She used it as instructed everyday (pink bottle on the morning, purple bottle before going to sleep) for two months but didn&#x27;t see any improvement on the cellulite appearance, so this gets one star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller for a refund, but the seller said that refund cannot be issued because it has been over 60 days since the purchase.  If you are going to try Finulite, make sure to decide about the refund before 60 days from the purchase date.</li>
            <li> Very very useful，We brought 5 for friends and we&#x27;ll buy 3 more.One week you can see the result.And it‘s very durable.我们前前后后买了5瓶了，还要再买3瓶，当然不全是自己用，还有给亲戚朋友带的。效果非常好。老婆瘦了很多。确实非常有效。想哪里瘦就涂在哪里，1周左右就能看到效果。不过美体产品也是因人而异。我大舅子用了1周腰围缩了3.5cm，嫂子用完全就没有作用。后面还要给三位同事买3瓶，看看他们效果如何我再来评价。虽然瓶子很小，但是非常耐用，我跟老婆两个人从5月假期结束开始使用，直到现在8月初了，还没用完，是两个人同时使用哦～～～～当然了我们使用面积可能不大，我用在腰腹，老婆用在腰腹大腿小腿。</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overweight at all, I just have a few spots that are a little more cottage cheese looking than I&#x27;d like (stomach and butt/back of legs). I used these religiously for over 4 weeks and saw no change in these areas at all. I&#x27;d consider this a complete waste of money and a gimmick.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this to work , but it does.I would say after using this product for 2 weeks it  made 50 percent go away. I can&#x27;t wait to see what a month does.it smells  nice, and its worth the money to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, but the effort that u have to give to apply this every morning and night is exhausting. You are supposed to really massage it in a circular motion using deep penetration...well, by the time I&#x27;m done, my arms need a massage. Plus, I don&#x27;t even have too much cellulite, just a few little spots on my upper thighs that show a little bit when I wear my short shorts or my bathing suit, and it still haven&#x27;t done anything. Now, granted I did give up after two weeks, but my upper arms are looking pretty darn good now, just from the work out, so at least there&#x27;s that. Lol</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Finulite you saved my life from this cheese cellulite, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of creams and none of them worked , sad I didn&#x27;t get to take a before and after picture. I&#x27;ve stocked up on my sets so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out. Thanks again, now I can tell my friends that this product works .. Team Finulite !</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I saw no results after finishing both bottles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 weeks and it works.  It has reduced the visible signs of cellulite by at least 50%. The bottles only last me 2 weeks and I only apply it to half of my upper thigh area.</li>
            <li> will order again before my next trip</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvements in my stretch marks, seemed like a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of creams, most of them ridiculously expensive, and this is the only one to date that I have been able to see results with right away.  I use it once a day when I remember, so I do not even follow the AM/PM regimen all that strictly. The old bottle was a pain as it was very hard to squeeze the cream out, but the new tube is perfect.  I use it with a massager to better absorption and it works great.</li>
            <li> i didnt see any results using this product to me it was a waste of my money and time but it did arrive on time form the courier</li>
            <li> Do not recommend, product does nothing to help cellulite. Do not waste your money. I used it as directed, and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was allergic to this product.  I can&#x27;t really rate if it worked since I wasn&#x27;t able to apply it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and goes on smooth.  Only time and consistency will tell if it gives any improvement. The bottle is hard to squeeze though (hard plastic) and the cream is super thick, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as instructed for almost a month now, and I don&#x27;t see any improvements yet.  I decided to try this product based on the reviews that I read.  Well, I&#x27;m not totally convinced that it will reduce the cellulite.  I do all the right things:  I work out at least 4 times a week and eat well most of the time.  I&#x27;ll continue to use to see if there&#x27;s any improvement. :-(</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product because it actually showed results. Every other cellulite treatment comes no where near to what they promise except finulite. I&#x27;ve tried so many drugstore and high end products but nothing works as well as this. Give it a try! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> First off this stuff is amazing. I have tried other similar products and wasn&#x27;t left nearly as satisfied as I am with this product. I will certainly reorder when it comes up. I noticed an honest decrease in the appearance in my stretch marks. As long as you follow the directions and stay consistent you will notice results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to see if this product actually worked because I have very sensitive skin n after the first time I used it I ended up having horrific bumps all over my butt and thighs and discontinued use. I am going to start it up again after bathing suit season so I don&#x27;t have to be worried about getting bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s working, but I like the way it smells and feels on my skin.  However, be warned the bottles are TINY so I&#x27;d buy two or three if you&#x27;re actually looking for results.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and not damaged. I have been using it for about a week and I have noticed some improvement. My cellulite was getting pretty bad and this product along with drinking more water and running on the treadmill have been a step in the right direction. I only wish that it wasn&#x27;t so difficult to squeeze the bottle. The plastic is really hard, it takes both hands to get the cream out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Finulite lotions for about 4 weeks and have seen a small improvement in the appearance of cellulite.  I know that it will take some time to see results in addition to working out and eating a balanced diet.  The major positive that I&#x27;ve seen with this product is that it has actually completely cleared up my keratosis.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me, and I almost killed him for doing so - LOL!! I am almost finished with the first set of AM PM and definitely notice a difference. My butt is tighter and we both love it :) It hasn&#x27;t completely evaporated all of my cellulite but it has improved it after only a month. I&#x27;ll be ordering more and will update on progress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before so I guess you can say that this had a profound impact on me. I saw a difference after the first week!! I gave only four stars because the amount you get in each tube is not nearly enough to last a whole month in my perspective. But that didn&#x27;t stop me from reordering. I also ordered the mitt. Hope it&#x27;s as effective as the cream. Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> The tubes are smaller than I imagined. They smell very good and dry faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great so far. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know long term results, but I am optimistic.</li>
            <li> Patience is a virtue -  Finulite does work.  I started to see results within 2 weeks.  You just have to be patient and apply it every evening and morning.  I did not purchase the scrubbing brush because I did not want to bruise my legs - as other reviewers had mentioned happened to them after using the brush.  I still get results simply by rubbing it into my legs in a circular motion until the product evaporated into my skin.</li>
            <li> This  product now allows me to wear sleeveless tops and have a tighter bra line. I also use on inner thighs and they are firmer. It has firmed my neck line as well. Yea! I have been using this product over a year and will never not. Nor will I ever try other ones. And bonus it smells great...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product last 3 months and just bought my second pack. I started seeing the improvement 2 weeks after i have used. It does not smell bad just like other products in fact it has a really nice smell and also moistures the area you apply. I strongly recommend this product to everybody who has a problem with cellulite. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I used one complete set of the AM/PM cream. After the first week or two, I wasn&#x27;t sure that I noticed a difference. Around the 3rd week I decided to apply the AM cream before putting on my Zaggora Hot Pants and running 3 miles. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a coincidence or not; however, I started noticing a slight difference in the appearance of my upper legs. The Zaggora Hot Pants claim to boost your calorie burn and they do make one sweat a lot. I&#x27;m somewhat convinced that the Hot Pants worn after applying the Finulite AM Cream create smoother legs...I only wish that I&#x27;d taken before and after photos. I also use a roller/massager on my legs after applying the PM Cream. Hoping it helps too. I like that the creams are not greasy and they both have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I been using finulite for the past 3 months this would be my 3rd time ordering finulite I&#x27;m very eager to see the results. I was using this product with the massage mitt and was working just fine you&#x27;ll see improvement right on the 1st week.. Now I use it be for I do my insanity work out I&#x27;m going 2 my 3rd week and it&#x27;s working beautifully I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll stop using it any time soon Thank you for making such a wonderful product ; )</li>
            <li> So I got this with a &amp;#34;what the hell&amp;#34; kind of attitude. I have moderate cellulite that is primarily on my thighs. I am not very diligent at using this both day and night, but I at least apply it once daily. Its been about 2-3 weeks and I was super stoked when my very blunt and honest girlfriend of mine said, &amp;#34;Wow, your legs are looking super smooth. Are you doing something to them?&amp;#34;  Its not a miracle cream that will get rid of every bit of cellulite, but it certainly does a GREAT job of minimizing it. I find that working out on the bicycle at the gym and going to tanning salons help a great deal with minimizing the appearance as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  At first I was a little skeptical about how much good a cream will do for my cellulite but I am defiantly a believer that this product makes a difference.  With regular exercise and good diet this product works great.  I have seen a big difference in cellulite appearance on my thighs.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions completely, and saw zero results.  I&#x27;m never buying this product again and will not recommend it for anyone else.</li>
            <li> I tried so many cellulite creams but this one is really special. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I am working out a lot and together with Finulite I noticed that my skin is much better. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I really like Finilite, I have tried many other products with no success and this seems to really smoothen the back of my legs the best. I really like the smell of it too. I say give it a try, the price is a lot more cheaper than then some other brands which have not worked for me.</li>
            <li> this is my second order of this product and it is probably the only thing i have ever used that actually works! it is amazing especially when i was hiking everyday it just helped enhance everything and get rid of my cellulite that much quicker! wouldn&#x27;t choose anything else :)</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  After surviving cancer and going through early menopause from the multiple rounds of chemo and radiation treatments, I felt as if my cellulite was getting worse and worse. I was looking for a cream that was non carcinogenic, but did the trick.  The ingredients in Finulite are safe, anti animal cruelty and works!!!  I even checked up all the ingredients in www.ewg.org and everything is safe as well which is especially important to me.  I will certainly continue to use it as I already saw results in a month!  Only thing that I wish which is super minor is that the ingredients on the bottles were a little easier to read.  But thumbs up for this product!!!</li>
            <li> Works well with massager</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite for about a year, and I have really noticed a difference in my skin.  It seems tighter, and my cellulite is less noticeable.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not only did this product not work - at all - but it made me examine my legs so thoroughly and frequently that I saw cellulite I hadn&#x27;t noticed before and now feel worse about my legs than before I used this. The thing is, I knew better but fell for it anyway - shame on me!</li>
            <li> Total waste.  Smells like medicine and doesn&#x27;t do any good that I can tell.</li>
            <li> I have been a true believer of this product and I have found that it really works for me. I have been using it since the summer, and with continuous and regular use, exercise and soft massages, my cellulite has improved amazingly well. I liked how they changed the presentation from the hard bottles to this very useful, easy to use soft cream bottle. I can really use until the last drop of it!&lt;br /&gt;I also found so nice from the company that they send me a personalized letter, giving me the opportunity to review their product. I think this gesture it&#x27;s so nice.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I hope you find this review helpful!</li>
            <li> You can see the results withing a few days. The skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing, even though it had a good amount of positive reviews. The amount of cream you get is very minimal and if you have larger areas you are applying it to, it&#x27;s not going to last very long. This lasted me about a week. It was a terrible waste of money for me.    I loved the Diva Stuff Cellulite bar I&#x27;ve been using though. It cost around $6.00 and will probably last about me about 2-3 months on treatment areas, or 1 month as a full-body, detoxing soap. I&#x27;ve seen considerable improvement in loose skin and cellulite and have purchased their cream because you get a lot more for less.    This might work for someone with a very small area to treat, but I would recommend you try other things first, no matter how desperate you are. Even cheap products can astonish you when they have good ingredients.</li>
            <li> waste of money.  another product that claims to work but doesn&#x27;t.  I would not recommend this.  Save your money.  There is no getting rid of cellulite, not in a bottle</li>
            <li> I got amazing results with this cellulite treatment. Been using this product for a month now and my cellulite is about 50% improved. It seems to work quicker on the dimples more than the ripples. Will purchase again &amp; recommend to all my friends. At this rate, I might be able to wear shorts again really soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 7/27/12***&lt;br /&gt;I just completed my second set of Finulite. I immediately noticed the smell &amp; formula was changed, but hoped the result would be just as amazing. I&#x27;m sad to say my experience the second time around isn&#x27;t as amazing. My cellulite isn&#x27;t getting better or worst. Based on the results from the first use, i was expecting continued improvement. But the change in formula isn&#x27;t as effective as the original. I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing a 3rd set.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to see some change but honestly, I didn&#x27;t.  The lotion was nice and creamy and did smell good though. I think I had more cellulite than this product could handle. The bottles were a little smaller than I was expecting also.</li>
            <li> Di not see a difference.</li>
            <li> The ONLY cellulite and firming cream I&#x27;ve ever used that delivered on it&#x27;s promise! Smells great, easy to apply, results are amazing. I have tried almost everything out there for firmer skin and cellulite reduction and NOTHING has worked as fast and as wonderfully as finulite!!! Love, love, love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I think it is working! Its only been 1 week. I notice softer skin and it is one of the better cellulite creams I have used. For starters, it smells really good. Secondly, it absorbs into the skin. I have used others that don&#x27;t absorb and I end up feeling sticky all night. It is also nice that the day time absorbs quickly because if I wear pants to work then they go on easily. I will update my post in a month to see how the results look! So far, so good! Oh, and its the most affordable one out there!</li>
            <li> Works right away and leaves my skin feeling softer and firmer.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT WORKING AT ALL............</li>
            <li> The Finulite cream is awesome!  This is my second time to purchase this product.  I have been using the cream in conjunction with their massage mitt and it has made such wonderful improvements in a short period of time.  I use the product on my thighs and arms.  I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product and I love it I&#x27;ve noticed great results! The item shipped quickly as promised. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice now and will continue to, works amazing.  I&#x27;ve tried some very expensive cellulite treatments and they don&#x27;t come close to beating this product.  If used as instructed you will see results!  I work out and eat right and my cellulite is on the lighter side, but still it was really showing on my stomach and after using this product for awhile now it&#x27;s almost completely gone!  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This review has nothing to do with whether this product works or not...it&#x27;s based solely on the fact that I couldn&#x27;t hardly get the product out of the tube. Not sure what the problem was, but discarded the product. Waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> fast service and great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Finulite for only 12 days. I have a busy schedule, so I don&#x27;t use it every day. Out of the 12 nights that I&#x27;ve used the product, I&#x27;ve missed about 5 already. I also remember not putting the AM cream on a couple of times. At night, it gets so late sometimes that I just go ahead and put the cream on without any previous area cleaning or washing. Even with that, I&#x27;ve seen quick results. My thighs are much thinner and I&#x27;ve lost 1/2 inch on my waist (what I actually bought this product for). I had very little cellulite on the front side of my thighs, and now it&#x27;s all gone. I just have stubborn cellulite on the back of my legs (buttocks), which I still need to work on. I watch what I eat and exercise regularly (3 to 4 times a week). This month of June, though, it&#x27;s been so hectic for me that I haven&#x27;t worked out at all. Despite of that, Finulite has been doing its work. For the little time I&#x27;ve been using it, I have no complaints. Going back to working out tomorrow to see how faster it gets in the reduction of my remaining cellulite. I&#x27;m very impressed with the reduction of my waistline so far. My goal is to reduce another 1 1/2 inch. I believe that, with some consistency, Finulite will take me there. I&#x27;ve also seen my skin tighter, especially on my thighs and stomach. The only thing is that the bottles are too little. They are supposed to last a month. I believe that is when there is one or two areas we want to target. I use it pretty much on my whole body. I have enough for the next 3 or 4 days, so I have to order more. If you want to use the cream for your whole body, or most of it, the bottle size is not big enough to last a month. Hey, this cream really works, though, and it does it fast!! It&#x27;s worth the purchase. It hasn&#x27;t been two weeks yet, and I&#x27;ve already seen changes in my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these creams for about a week and a half and even inconsistently, but I must say that it&#x27;s working! I&#x27;ve tried other creams now and then, but results seemed to take so long to achieve. I was somewhat skeptical about the product, but I can tell it&#x27;s working. They smell good too!</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this product, I&#x27;ve ordered it 3 times now:)  I&#x27;ve used the original formula and found it reduced my cellulite appearance. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, but after a few weeks you do start to see a difference:) It smells great, not like most cellulite creams currently on the market and its goes on smoothly without an oily affect...The am/pm creams makes it easy to remember and incorporate as apart of your daily routine. Even my husband has noticed the difference in my legs and said it is barely noticable now:):):) That&#x27;s when it was confirmed for me that this product works!  I just received my third set of Finulite, which is now the new formula and it too seems to work well. The smell has changed a bit, but it is still a nice suttle smell.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service and communication from this company is absolutely fantastic!!!! I had an order shipped to me and it had leaked slightly, and they sent me a replacement right away:) I will continue to use finulite as long as I need it, it has worked far better than any other cream I&#x27;ve ever tried;)</li>
            <li> I experienced excellent results with Finulte! It gave me the confidence to wear my short shorts because it smooths and tightens loose skin. Lotion is not greasy and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> this is a amazing product i have only been using it for about 3 months and wow what a differince i can already see on my legs and butt... For the cost of the how can you go wrong..</li>
            <li> I am so inlove wilth this product! It really does work at polishing and tonning the skin to eliminate signs of cellulite. It does not melt fat away, and that is not the reason I bought this,  but it does help the dimples alot! My thighs have never looked this good. Buy this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Fantastic stuff that works fast.</li>
            <li> It is indeed almost a miracle product. All in all amazing,but I do recommend to use this when you do workouts,if you truly want this product to be supra magical you have to EXERCISE!! Yes indeed you do if your kinda chubby,or had kids...there&#x27;s no excuse to not work out. Believe me if you work-out and use this your ass will look soooo juicy,plump,round that you&#x27;d give yourself a 3-syllable \\&quot;DAAAAMMMNNN!\\&quot; hahaha. Anywho, to those who are fit already use it and it has the same affects: tightens,makes skin soft,and has a lovely smell to it! Put an update after November and tell you or have pics of the results! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. yes you could use this product on any part of the body and has that plumping effect.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate \\&quot;hail damage\\&quot;, especially on my thighs...so I began to look for something to help with the cellulite that was still there.  I saw Finulite and after reading all the positive reviews I was really hoping it would work.  Bottles are empty but cellulite is still there with no signs of reduction.  I was really good about using the AM daily but for the PM I may have skipped a couple Saturday nights.  I would put the AM on after showering and put the pm on at night when I was in bed. With the PM I would usually massage the area as well. I&#x27;m sad that the product did not work for my cellulite, but I did enjoy the scents and it left my skin soft.    I wish I had a positive review to leave but it just did not work for me. I almost didn&#x27;t leave this one but I figured if I was researching this product I would like to see all the reviews good or bad.(I&#x27;m also starting to wonder why bad reviews/experiences are being marked as not helpful...Hmmm. Perhaps some fake reviewers trying to mark as unhelpful so that this review is not seen?) Every body is different and I&#x27;m happy it has worked for so many but It did not work for me.    Good luck to all who are fighting this annoying battle!</li>
            <li> It works OK I guess, but it has a perfume type odor that I and others could smell when wearing it. Also, for the price, the amount that you get and the results that you see it is not worth it. The NIVEA serum works just as well for a fraction of the price and can be purchased locally without additional shipping costs or strange odors.</li>
            <li> I went through two rounds of this stuff along side of dry brushing and using the dermaroller and had absolutely no improvement whatsoever.  Such a disappointment and waste of money!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Finulite and have been using it for 3 weeks. I do see&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some improvement in my outer thigh area. To soon I believe to see complete results.&lt;br /&gt;I also think the bottles are to small other then that i am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering my next batch soon... Consistency should pay off.[[ASIN:B004WSXD4G Finulite - The End to Cellulite AM/PM (8 oz)]]</li>
            <li> It may work for some people but it definately did not work for me and I prefer the other one I bought - slim extreme 3d. This one left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews on this product I finally decided to get it. I am slender yet I have SO much cellulite at the back and some on the sides of my legs. I honestly saw no improvement. I did exercise from time to time along with the use of the cream and still saw NO difference. Maybe my cellulite is extremely stubborn. But, I wish i could have at least seen some improvement. I used this product almost every morning and night. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it might work for you! But, it&#x27;s nothing great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with some skepticism, as I have tried many over the counter lotions and potions for cellulite with very little success. I have been pleasantly surprised to find that there is a visible difference in the cellulite pockets. I have been using the Finuite for about two months and can see a noticable change the skin. The little dimples seem to be smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;The day and night creams apply easily and have a very nice smell. I am very happy with the product and I will be purchasing more in the future, as I am almost out.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 2 months ago.  Love it.  My cellulite continues to get better.  I don&#x27;t have any weight issues but still have ugly cellulite.  Now I feel comfortable in shorts again.  So happy I tried it and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderfull. My thighs were looking really bad and the skin was starting to sag. I noticed an improvement after 3 weeks. this is my second time purchasing this product. Cellulite not totally gone but my legs look alot better. Im not ashamed to wear shorts. The fragrance is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Smells good and pleasant afterwards unlike some other creams that you want to rinse off after 5 minutes. I used it for two consecutive cycles now and although no miracles there, i do believe there might be a slight improvement...</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle but is as good as any much pricier cellulite maintnence treatment, including wonderful Murad, is enriched with skin-nourishing vitamins and smells excellent. Supply lasts 1-2 months, depending on usage. Ingredients are pretty much the same but color coding helps to remind you to do it am and pm. If you have time to detox area before use (scrub/brush) even better. If you combine it with low-fat diet with regular intake of fresh produce and exercise 2-3 a week (about 30 mins cardio that includes moving your legs) you will see the results. I use word \\&quot;maintnence\\&quot; because you probably know by now once you have enough cellulite to see you cannot completely eliminate it without drastic life-style changes (read Murad&#x27;s book on science about cellulite). Yet this staff really targets fat trapped under the skin even with 1x day use if you have mild-moderate cellulite. The only reason I gave it 4 is I had an issue with CS but was persistent and once I reached them they compensated me trifold, so kudos to them for working on improving their CS effort</li>
            <li> I have 1 month using this product and I am really seeing and improvement on my skin. I have to say that the first week I was not using it daily, but once I started and of course with exercise it was an improvement on the week No. 3. My cellulite didn&#x27;t went away 100% but I can say about a 15% on it and you can really tell. About to purchase my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Sorry folks. Can&#x27;t say much about this product because I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times. I&#x27;m probably going to give it away because I&#x27;ve found another product that works so much better.</li>
            <li> So I have never written a review for any product on Amazon before. Ever. And I am an avid Amazon shopper. But this stuff is spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2, and 130 lbs. Definitely not a stick, nor am I obese. But I did have that pesky cellulite on my upper thighs. When I sat down, you could see it, and when I stood up, you could see the lumps and grooves. I was obsessed with who could see it, and conscious about wearing shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product, and saw results after only a week, tops. My legs are firmer, and I hardly see any more cellulite, even if I bunch up my legs or sit down. This stuff worked immediately, and I even forgot to use it on some days. You don&#x27;t have to use that much, just a dime sized amount for problem areas, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> didnt do a thing except make skin feel soft</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a month now and love it! Works better than any other creams I have used before. Have continued to see results as I continue to use these creams. Only wish the bottles weren&#x27;t so difficult to squeeze!</li>
            <li> its the second set I just bought. It works, I do see some improvement on my legs area. My skin is smoother and i will continue to use it. I dont now if theres any miracle for cellulite ever but this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and I have seen amazing results. I live in Hawaii and I love all natural products and this lotion is the best!!</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old female, 5&#x27;1 126lbs. I&#x27;ve always been relatively thin and cellulite free.. but have had issues with my body image for years. After I turned 30, I began gaining weight. Not a huge amount but enough for me to not be able to fit into my size XS clothing. It turned out that I have a thyroid illness. After I was diagnosed is when the gross cellulite began to appear. It&#x27;s all over my butt, thighs, legs.. for someone has had a gorgeous pair of cellulite free legs, this was just devastating. I&#x27;ve had to pack away all of my mini skirts and short dresses. So in a desperate attempt to rid myself of this curse, I bought a stepper, and this product.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the great reviews, I thought I couldn&#x27;t really go wrong. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but I was hoping for a minor change. I applied this stuff religiously and used muscle when massaging it into my legs.&lt;br /&gt;WeLL, I&#x27;ve finished the two bottles and not one dimple is gone. It&#x27;s not even smoothed out.&lt;br /&gt;I know everyBODY is different. Maybe this cream just didn&#x27;t work on me because I was doubtful..? I don&#x27;t understand how most everyone who reviewed this stuff gave it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The only upside to this cream, it left my legs super soft.</li>
            <li> Save your money -- this product does absolutely nothing to reduce cellulite or even the appearance of cellulite. Used both am and pm cremes consistently for 30 days along with an increase in exercise. Muscles are tighter but cellulite masses did not change AT ALL. Company policy is \\&quot;partial refund with the customer absorbing return shipping\\&quot;. This product does not work and there is no way to recoup the cost after you use it for the \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; period of time. I would never recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Finulite is the first cellulite cream to actually work for me. It&#x27;s important to be keeping a good diet while using the product. Although I have seen results from just using the cream and not eating so well. It has to be used every day as suggested and massaged in the skin in order to work. I will continue to use it. It also smells really good so that is another plus. Thanks finulite!!!</li>
            <li> It does not work I guess it no body would have cellulite. I would not recommend it to my friends it&#x27;s just cream that smells good.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this but it had such great ratings. I only used it once and I liked it but it is pricey. I have not purchased it again.</li>
            <li> this works so amazingly well, and its way better than your higher priced products of the same type! smells wonderful, and doesnt irritate my sensitive skin, does EXACTLY what it says it will do! love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks.  My skin does seem smoother and softer.  I love the smell and texture of this lotion much better than other products I have used.  The smell and texture make it easier for me to stay compliant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream in conjunction with Skinny Cream for about two months. I have not been faithful with the dual daily application, but so far I like it. It spreads on very thickly, and seems to plump and smooth the skin. When rubbed in vigorously with the massager it definitely works best and results are more noticeable. So, I am unsure if this is due to the product, or the action of massaging the area.  I plan to use it more consistently to see longer lasting results, but I believe in order for this to happen, you must actually apply morning and night with an intense massaging application. The price is inexpensive, so I have ordered more, and will continue to monitor progress for the next I will continue to use this product, as it smells great and works as a wonderful moisturizer for my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting on this cellulite cream everyday (morning and night) for the past month or so. I can feel it tingle and assume it&#x27;s working, however I haven&#x27;t noticed any lessening of my cellulite. It smells fine, kind of medicinal, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been working as well as I&#x27;d hoped. My skin feels a bit smoother though, so it appears to work well as a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> My cellulite is severe- it&#x27;s been a problem since the 7th grade when the boy sitting next to me in jr high school asked why I had dimples in my thighs... Can you say mortified? #someoneshootmeplease&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 years later- I&#x27;m a personal trainer, athlete, lean and toned (5&#x27;3 about 110 lbs) - and guess what??? Horrible cellulite! Even with a six pack... Still cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try this and I am very impressed.  Quality is good. Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would. Seems to be helping tremendously. I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with Finulite anti- cellulite Massaging mitt for about a month now. Celulite is noticeably reduced. Still there, but with much improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a scale if 1-10, 10 being the most horrific (think cover of trashy celeb magazine) cellulite you&#x27;ve ever seen, and 1 being virtually none, I&#x27;d say prior to this product I was an 8/9. Now I&#x27;d give myself a 3/4. Still there- but significant improvement! Especially on the sides of my thighs where I had orange slice sized craters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to be perfect- just want to feel like the rest of my body matches my legs somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Will buy again. Been wearing shorts- feeling sexy!</li>
            <li> Helps reduce the appearance of cellulite - on my second order already and do see a difference</li>
            <li> I am on my second set of bottles of Finulite so that is proof that this stuff works!  It made the cellulite disappear and left skin looking smooth within a week of my first use, it also has a pleasant smell.  I love this product and have told family and friends to put it on their list!</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and is fast absorbing, however the best part about this product is that it actually works!!!  Had quick visual results.</li>
            <li> Follow instructions and it works! It takes some time so have patience. Im really starting to notice a difference on my legs and hips.</li>
            <li> been on this 3 months now and it works, please buy this if nothing else it will get the job done!</li>
            <li> The creams work ok, but they got my skin pretty greasy.  I was using this product and saw a little difference but it started to get pricey with no amazing results. I ended up buying a beauty brush instead to brush my skin before a shower, and months later my cellulite has gone away much. I would highly recommend the brush instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3-4 months now. And yes in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise program you will get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long did it take?&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I did not start to see any changes until about 60 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What other things were used?&lt;br /&gt;I used the Microneedle Derma Roller (Medical Grade 1.00 mm). And my choice to use that product with the Finulite system was based on another customer review on a different site. This customer stated that he got better results after one month with this combination than the lotion alone. And I must agree after about one month of the same combination made a larger difference than the lotion alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, definitely so. Especially for individuals who do have a regular fitness routine but cannot get rid of those dimpled areas that are caused by cellulite. I personally went through approximately 2 sets a month. So it can be costly but the benefits have been worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both bottles until they were gone with &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; result.......and yes, I AM a certified Amazon purchase. So &amp;#34;Finulite&amp;#34; comments saying otherwise are crap. I&#x27;d simply avoid this product all together. There is no significant result for the money your having to dish out.</li>
            <li> Pretty small bottles. I started hating the smell after a while. I did not see much of a difference. The Vichy lotions for cellulite are much better...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now &amp; I&#x27;m seeing some promising results. I have slight cellulite on the backs of my legs since I&#x27;ve had my 2 boys. I would love to feel not so self conscious about how I look in my shorts this summer. I&#x27;ve tried other things but they either smell not to my liking or the price is just way out there expensive. I read all the different reviews on here &amp; thought \\&quot;well this product has high positive post &amp; the price seems good so I&#x27;ll give it a try.\\&quot; I want know if it works unless I try it! As I said I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks but really am pleased with it. I ordered a 2nd order because I was going to be out of town for a while &amp; didn&#x27;t want to run out. I will post farther results the longer I use it. I read the results get better the longer you use it also it&#x27;s been easy to incorporate the am &amp; pm into my daily routine as it comes with one bottle for day &amp; night. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to improve the cellulite issues or tone &amp; smooth skin. The price is affordable &amp; it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I Love this product! I have tried multiple products like this with limited or no results, this stuff is different. I am so glad a happened upon this product! I used the infulite AM/PM creams along with the infulite smoothing massage mit and started noticing results within about two weeks. Keep in mind that results take time, and diligence. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this product and I am not disappointed. If you use it twice a day and be patient you will see results. I am a thin woman but recently I developed really nasty cellulite on my nutt and thighs and this product definately decreased the appearance of it. I am going to Cancun in a month and a half and I&#x27;m looking forward to rocking my bathing suit and not feeling se of conscious!</li>
            <li> save your money...doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money time and effort. I use this product every day and night with no results. This is a con and I believe these positive reviews are fake!! This cream DOES NOT WORK!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now. I started using this to get ready for summer hoping to be able to wear shorts with confidence. I have not worn shorts in years because of my cellulite. This year I braved it several times and I do believe that finulite is the reason why. I have dieted and exercised along with using this product. I started my morning with a body brushing before my shower. I rinsed my legs in cool water to tone the skin. After I dried off I would apply finulite and massage it deep into the skin for several minutes focusing on the trouble spots. Finulite has made my skin so soft and it has toned up the skin dramatically. My skin looks so much tighter and firmer. My cellulite was very bad in some spots but only in those spots is it still slightly noticeable. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to get rid of cellulite. With proper diet, exercise and some body brushing you can get rid of cellulite with this product. It takes time and dedication but it is possible. I have used several products out there and this is the only one that I have noticed any results which is why I kept buying it. My advice to you is to eat a low sugar and sodium diet, cut down on the caffeine and eat a healthy diet. Get on the treadmill or go running and add finulite to your regiment. Make sure to stick with it and you will see results. Massage it in as much as possible, don&#x27;t just apply it like a lotion. I think my results were due to all my hard work in losing body fat as well as massaging in this product. I wish the best to you all in the battle to defeat cellulite.</li>
            <li> I had significant cellulite on my thighs and butt due in no small part to significant pregnancy weight gain and the subsequent weight loss.  I have used this product for over 30 days and I see a reduction in the cellulite.  I am also exercising diligently with Core Fusion and Jillian Michael&#x27;s videos and eating right.  It helps to take a before picture because then you can tell how significant the progress really is.  I like this product also because it is a cream instead of a gel and it seems to moisturize my skin too.</li>
            <li> This product is non-greasy and it absorbs quickly into the skin, not forgetting that it has a pleasant smell. When I first tried this product, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement during the first 2 weeks. However I diligently applied them day and night for a month, and I must say that the appearance of cellulite on my thighs have definitely improved.It looked like I have smoother and tighter skin on the back of my thighs and I was more confident to wear shorts during summer. I am now onto my third bottle and I am very satisfied with the result!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Finullite almost 4 months ago, and I have placed 2 more orders since then: it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;I have used Finullite on my tights and arms, and I have noticed improvements after 2 weeks and a huge difference after 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I will say have reduced cellulite about 80%...I&#x27;m doing Pilates to help tonify and I&#x27;m following a healthy diet on top-I have used it religiously, in the morning and before bed-. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far and I plan on keep using it for maintainanc: it is the first time after trying countless products that I actually see results.&lt;br /&gt;Fragance is good, it absorbs quickly as well...price is reasonable as well, 30 days treatment supply and good results.&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been persistent and using Finulite 2 times a day as indicated along with massage. It&#x27;s been a month already and I do see some improvement in my cellulite. I have combined a well balanced diet and workout with the product and so far I am happy with the results. I will continue to use and hope I see even greater improvement. Optimistic!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years and this one really seems to diminish the appearance of cellulite bumps.  It&#x27;s important to use it morning and night to see results, but you will.  I am on my 2nd purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Finulite AM?Pm for the last three months and have seen great results. The dimpling on my legs and butt are almost gone. I have also changed my diet.</li>
            <li> Being 22, 5&#x27;7 and 135 pounds no one believes I would have cellulite, but its been a constant in my life since I was a teen no matter how much I worked out. I never wore bikini bottoms because I never wanted anyone to see the back of my legs or thighs and wore capri&#x27;s no matter how hot It was outside. Ive been using finulite for a month now and am SO HAPPY! Within a week I noticed a huge difference, now a month later I am happily looking at my legs in the mirrror! My skin is firmer and all the &#x27;cottage cheese&#x27; is gone. I also noticed that my old stretch marks were looking better too! I think the collagen building complex in the pm cream is filling them in! My legs look like a 22 year olds legs should! I also started using the PM cream on the stretch marks on my breasts because it helps build collagen and elasticity, its made my breasts firmer and stretch marks less noticible! I love this product, dont have one single comlaint, worth the price even if it were double! It even smells nice!</li>
            <li> I started using Finulite after having my daughter as I ended up with cellulite after the pregnancy.  I use these day and night and have noticed a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I love it!!! It doesn&#x27;t have the tingle or horrible menthol smell like other creams. It has a very light, fresh smell so I feel like I can apply it, get dressed and leave the house. I had used other creams that tingled and smelled so bad that I would wait several hours before I would leave home. The 2 step cream paired with dry brushing before showering and using my finulite massager during my shower has drastically changed the tone of my skin!! It&#x27;s beautiful, soft, and oh sooooo smooth!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> people only give this a good review because when it arrives it comes with a piece of paper saying &amp;#34;GIVE US A GOOD REVIEW AND YOU COULD WIN A YEARS SUPPLY&amp;#34; but has anyone ever actually won that? Anyway it didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I tried really hard to make it, using with different products and at different times, never did a thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as indicated in the instructions for 2 weeks. I have had a major issue with my thighs and that ugly word &amp;#34;CELLULITE&amp;#34;for awhile now and this product worked amazingly.  I also used it on my buttocks and lower back as well and have seen improvement in those areas as well.  It took some days to see a noticeable improvement, but WOW! My skin is super smooth and 80% free of cellulite. I am aiming to be 100% free of cellulite and this product is really helping with that goal.  I love that it blends into the skin and does not leave a greasy feel and it only takes a very small amount because it blends very well.  Thanks for such a great product for a great price.  I &amp;#34;HIGHLY&amp;#34; recommend for anyone looking to smooth out and get rid of cellulite.  This product works, just follow the directions and be consistent and you will see the results.</li>
            <li> I just finished one set and I had to order more. Smells great and works for me!</li>
            <li> did absolutely no difference and i used all of it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and half so I can&#x27;t really tell if it works yet. I will say that I love the way both AM and PM lotions smell (esp AM), consistencey and quality of the lotion is great. Delivery was very fast and I was excited to see it in the mailbox so soon! I&#x27;ll try to update again when I finish these bottles - hopefully with awesome results!</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It works quickly and smells great. It would be nice if the bottles were bigger!</li>
            <li> This product does not really work. You are better off doing something else. Other than having your skin a little smooth when you apply it this products is just another gimmick</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d try this product on a whim and it&#x27;s something that has worked for me. I&#x27;m 37 with 3 kids and find as I&#x27;m getting older my skin isn&#x27;t as it was (naturally). When  I purchased Finulite I took my measurements and continued my workouts. It took a few weeks but my skin felt taunt as when I was younger and additional inches were coming off. I would recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s willing to do the work and not looking for immediate/next day results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Small bottles. I ordered 2. Perhaps if there were more product one would see results. Purchased months ago. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t saw much in the way of losing inches, this product is very good for moisterizing your skin.  I do like it and plan to continue to use it.  Biggest problem for me and losing weight is eating habits.  There&#x27;s nohing any product can do about that.  I believe this product will help if I stay on the routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month, and I have to admit that during the first couple weeks it didn&#x27;t do much. But, hey I didn&#x27;t get cellulite overnight so getting rid of it in just two weeks was just not realistic. I didn&#x27;t give up and continued using it and much to my surprise I&#x27;m seeing improvement as each day passes.  I highly recommend this cellulite fighting product. Be persistent and don&#x27;t give up. The results you see will be worth it.</li>
            <li> they both smell citrusy and pleasant. I&#x27;m not sure if my skin is getting better or not, I&#x27;m not using it religiously and my cellulite is severe. I am not a fan of the packaging as the bottles are too small it made my jaw drops when I received them in the mail. The product is too thick to come out easily; it should have been packaged in a small jar for easier access. You will definitely  need  a beauty spatula to scoop the product out of bottles. Yet it is easy to spread on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;m not giving up on this product yet but I&#x27;m willing to try something else in addition to it. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Finally a product you can tell is working.  I loved from the minute I put it on my legs were soft and smooth and it smells great.  I swear I could feel it tingling and working after a few applications.  This product combined with working out and a healthy diet is helping me achieve the look I want.  I ordered again and I will continue using for more results.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the drug store brand cellulite creams and before purchasing another, I researched this product. I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a difference in the softness of my skin and the appearance of cellulite. Also, it smells delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I have used some hardcore bodybuilding fat burning topical rubs and creams so I was skeptical at the comparitive results Finulite would offer.  Easiest to start the review with I have made my second reorder as I am so pleased with this product. My skin is simply smoother than it was before I started using it.  It took about three weeks to see results, but I actually did, and have not turned back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is really interesting is that the fine stretch lines on my stomach from intense exercise and weightlifting movements (like dumbell pullover for chest) have been noticably improved with Finulite --- none of the other products I used for years ever improved this condition, this was an unexpected suprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They hit a homerun on the formulation and I am guessing that is why it is so popular. The texture is just right, it spreads, sticks and absorbs well and the smell is outstanding.  My wife says she would use it just for the smell, as it is very captivating, better than most if not all perfumed skin lotions I have smelled, no alcohol scent at all either.  Great job with this product, very surprised and very pleased, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so don&#x27;t waste your time and money. I been using it for a month and didn&#x27;t see any change</li>
            <li> Been using it 3 weeks now, don&#x27;t see any difference yet. Hopefully it&#x27;ll start to work soon.  I&#x27;m using it along with some cardio. Results are guaranteed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now &amp; have seen noticable results.  My legs are a lot smoother &amp; more toned looking.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from cheap local drug store products to expensive high end products &amp; finally have found the perfect solution!  Not to mention the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the reviews.... I did not expect it to work over night, because as they say in their pamphlet when you purchase it, cellulite certainly didn&#x27;t form overnight, and you have to be patient. I will say that after using 1 both of AM and PM, it is hard to tell if there is any difference, but I am going to try it a couple more times and see. I did think I noticed a slight tightness in an area or two, so that was enough to give me hope!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of cellulite creams ad this is the only one that seems to do ANYTHING.  That is, only when you use it as directed.  After using this product about 2 weeks I started to notice a difference.  If I forget to put it on at night or morning a couple times you can see a change for the worse in your legs.  But, if you put it on every day, exfoliate, and not eat for a half hour after in the morning (as directed on bottle) it works perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month ago, have used it religiously along with the massage mit that it came with. I have some cellulite on my arms, and not a whole lot of it. I am going to be in a wedding overseas and my dress has no sleeves, so I thought that this product would work based on the reviews. Well, I can&#x27;t even begin to express how disapointed I am with this product. NOTHING has changed with the tone of my arms , or my cellulite. I eat well, excersise, and I&#x27;m a size 7, I just want to warn people here about the fake reviews posted. This product works on cellulite craters? please... this didn&#x27;t even work on slight cellulite. save your money and time and DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other cellulite creams and have not found them to be as effective as Finulite.  Although it is priced higher than the other products, I still feel that it is the best value of the creams I have tried.  I am on my third order.</li>
            <li> I first tried Finulite a few months ago. I have used many of the Nivea products. This one I have noticed is much more effective. It also smells wonderful!!! I have continued using this product, definitely a summer must have!!!</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with cellulite on the back of my thighs. I NEVER would have believed that Finulite would actually work, but IT DOES!!! I bought it after reading the reviews, I had my hopes, but I tried not to let them get too high. My legs aren&#x27;t perfect, but there is so much improvement that I am actually wearing shorts that I have never had the confidence to wear before and I am super excited about my beach trip this summer!!!</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for two weeks now and I absolutely love it, It helps diminish the look of cellulite and makes my skin soooo silky and soft.  I use it for my stretch marks too and it works wonders for them too!  I&#x27;ve never found a product as good as this one!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty freakin amazing.  I have cellulite for YEARS and it has done wonders for minimizing the dimples in my thigh area. I also bought the mitt that goes with it so I think be sure and get that too to really see the effects.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave reviews often but when a product is great and works so well for me I feel I owe it to other users to share my happiness.&lt;br /&gt;Finulite works. It has a light smell I and the silky cream itself goes on so smooth. I have three daughters 22, 21,19 and when I ordered this little miracle lotion they HAD to have some. Alright, it took me about two weeks to see big results. I would wake up every morning put on the am cream rub it in and in two minuets i was done. At night the same for the pm lotion which by the way I love the two separate lotions to work on one problem. I have hated my cellulite for some time and although it is not completely gone yet Im well on my way with Finulite. I used to have large sunken holes on my thighs and butt now much improved small areas. I feel with a little more time they too will be gone. I recommend this to my family and anyone else who has cellulite.</li>
            <li> This cream did not wrl for me. It goes on like any other lotion and has a nice scent, but i do not feel it did anything for my cellulite.</li>
            <li> After a full bottle using only on the side of my thighs, not result, not a change nothing.  Other than hydrating initially it did nothing for me.  It doesnt smell good either. I will not repurchase this one.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and its been working really well my cellulite is due to gaining and losing weight several times and I finally decided to treat it before it gets worse.&lt;br /&gt;My legs looks better and I am buying more because I can see the difference :)&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results</li>
            <li> Really dammm good cream it has worked so well for me just use it everyday be very consistent &amp; u will see resultz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using finulite for a little over a week straight now and I have noticed a difference in the cellulite appreace. I use the massage mit along with it as well. I am def happy with the product and have already purchced another shippment.</li>
            <li> So I realize I should probably USE a product before I review it, but there are many other things I can say about this product that are positive without even using them one time. A review after I&#x27;ve used them for very long wouldn&#x27;t help that much any how, to be honest I don&#x27;t have very much cellulite at all, I suppose I was just insecure and vulnerable at the moment of purchase here but what the heck, what little bit I do have is worth taking care of now, right? And someone having excellent results with an anti cellulite product when they had very very little cellulite to begin with isn&#x27;t surprising. So results aside, I am going to tell you the best things about this product so far. #1, it arrived FAST, packed well, and the bottles were 100% full, no skimping or under filling bottles here. #2 The smell is nice, not medicinal at all. #3 and MOST IMPORTANT by far, there was a small, typed note card within the wrapping of the bottles that states if you do not see an improvement in your cellulite after 4-6 weeks of use contact this email to get a full refund. In other words, if it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims...get your money back. And this isn&#x27;t from one of those cheesy 4 am infomercials, they don&#x27;t even say it on Amazon currently to get more sales. The company genuinely cares if their customers are satisfied? That&#x27;s huge to me. Another plus is the bottles are attractive and have the easy to use flip top, and the bright pink and purple colors will surely make it easier to remember which is night and day, and as someone who has used different \\&quot;night and day\\&quot; formula remedies, I can say that usually those work the best. Our bodies work differently at night than they do during the day so obviously a product that is catering to that is going to work best.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update once I&#x27;ve used it, but for now, my initial review, is a definite 5 stars...because even if it doesn&#x27;t work, I get my money back. Win win.&lt;br /&gt;Update #1 - 24 hours later: Skin feels a little bit tighter yet softer, very nice feeling. How&#x27;s that for next day results?? Husband complimented me on how my skin felt \\&quot;nice\\&quot; today, had not told him yet that I used finulite. As for how it feels on, very light, not sticky or oily, and moisturizes without \\&quot;sticking\\&quot;, spreads on nice. Smells really good and fresh on. Not too highly scented, so it won&#x27;t mess with your regular scent of perfume or deodorant or what ever it is you wear normally. Excellent so far!ter yet softer, very nice feeling.

            <li> On my second purchase of Finulite and it is defiantly working. I do notice a difference in the smoothness and tightening of my skin. It took a few weeks to really notice the difference but now i do and i will defiantly be continuing use of this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I havent saw any results. It made it worst if anything. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> I used it the way it&#x27;s supposed to be used, no results. smells good - that&#x27;s all. Ladies be honest with yourself and read medical literature - no cream will reduce cellulite. Diet and exercise that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li> It can really diminish your celllulite slowly. But you still have to do exercise and proper diet to totally remove your cellulite.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference with the lotion.  The massage mitt is great!</li>
            <li> It is the first lotion that i found that  makes my skin feel smooth and firm.. I love the way it seems to tighten up the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it continues to work as good as the first time i applied it,  I will definitely be buying more of it just wish the bottles were bigger and more affordable but everything has a price tag, you either like it or you don&#x27;t....I believe it works...so I would definitely give it a try and see how it works for you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Only have used it for about 2 weeks coupled with diet/exercise and am already seeing results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in cellulite after consistent use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Just another fad!! Don&#x27;t be fooled. Weight training and resistance training is the only way to get rid of cellulite !!</li>
            <li> i got it for my girlfriend for the second time and she is saying some results you have to use it every day with good diet and exercise</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over six weeks on two different occasions and I love it.  I have used various other cellulite creams in the past mostly for problem area under buttocks and have found this to be one of the best.  I love to wear it in summer with shorts or skirts makes your thighs look great and smooth. Even the areas that are not problematic feel firmer.  The texture is very rich and easy to apply, and the smell of the product is light and sweet smelling which I feel is just as important.&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JW</li>
            <li> After reading really good reviews on this product I knew it was worth the try. Now I just bought my second set of this stuff. I have been using it for a month and my deep stretch marks have gotten smoother and even are less visible. It makes my skin really soft also and has a good smell. It takes me 1 minute to put on my problem areas and its fast and easy. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a review on here saying this could be a fake or a change in lotion and at first I had doubts . Then I got mine in the other day ....now its starting to make me wonder is this a fake or did they change the smell and color the first bottle I got were like a serum type and these new ones are more like a lotion last yr they sent me the serum bottles and I did see a change in my cellulite but these new ones I don&#x27;t see any change :( . Money wasted</li>
            <li> I used these for one month religiously, morning and night, along with the Bliss Lean Machine....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No difference.  I have to assume that people seeing a difference have never taken the time to massage their cellulite prone areas regularly, and that is likely the primary reason they are seeing some difference when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already been doing dry brushing, massage, and essential oil rubs for years now... so there was no difference to be seen with this product.  It definitely did make my skin soft, but I can find a good organic lotion for a whole lot cheaper to do that without questionable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d steer clear.  Look into homemade cellulite rubs using essential oils that encourage detox, circulation and fat burning (cypress, grapefruit etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have to say that the majority of 5 star reviews are written very similarly...the writing style is almost exactly the same and I find this curious..wondering, like others, if they could be fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was a skeptic at first.  I didn&#x27;t think anything could truly reduce the appearance of cellulite outside of medical procedures.  And this product didn&#x27;t work right away.  But when my first month&#x27;s supply was up, I decided to give it one more month&#x27;s chance.  I&#x27;m certainly glad I did.  I happened to catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and was shocked to see that even my deepest pockets were minimalized.  Are my imperfections gone completely?  Of course not, but they are reduced enough to have me considering wearing shorts this summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Finulite for almost two years now. I can tell when I&#x27;ve run out because my legs start to look dimply again. Finulite gives my legs the extra boost it needs to be able to wear shorts and still feel comfortable in public. I will try almost anything but I keep coming back to this product.</li>
            <li> just not enough in the bottle</li>
            <li> These products did not work for me. I should have never bought them.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Worked as described and I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. I saw no results with this product.</li>
            <li> great product...recieved it very fast. works excellent....it smells really good...its not sticky at all i would totally order the product again!</li>
            <li> Very good product for cellulite, The effects are seen in a short time. More effective in combination with Soft Bathing Body Massage Brush.</li>
            <li> I never saw improvement and it even made my skin drier. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I don&#x27;t care for the smell either.</li>
            <li> I wanted to take the time to submit an honest, but informative review of [[ASIN:B004WSXD4G Finulite - the End to Cellulite AM/PM]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 25 year old, 180 pound 5&#x27;11 male and below is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past year, I did everything it took go from 260 pounds back down to my normal weight of 180 pounds; 25 year old male. Through consuming extremely healthy foods, diet, and exercise (4x cardio a week + 3x weights with the assistance of a Nutritionist &amp; Personal Trainer I expensively obtained my goal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From losing so much weight so suddenly, I was left with \\&quot;battle scars\\&quot; aka loose stomach skin, cellulite, and very deep red stretch marks. I honestly ordered this product with the expectation to minimally decrease the appearance of my scars, cellulite, and tighten up my loose skin; dramatic results were unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the \\&quot;random junk\\&quot; ranging from $5-$40 in CVS, Walgreens, and Sephora I decided to take a turn to amazon since I order most of my items from here anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following is what I did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for 30 days straight, at the same time in the morning and at the same time at night. I made sure to rub my stomach with alcohol pads to rid of any excess dirt before applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 30 days, I noticed an honest 20% decrease in the appearance of the stretch marks, the cellulite \\&quot;deep indentations,\\&quot; in my stomach transformed into thin layers of scarred skin, from thick layers of rippled skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month&#x27;s use, I visited my Dermatologist to get a professionals opinion and advice for further treatment. Since my Derm is a family friend, she told me about a method I was unaware of called \\&quot;derma-rolling.\\&quot; She suggested I purchase a 1.5m derma-roller, I ended up getting this one[[ASIN:B004EFF3DG Derma Roller By Rejuveness (1.5 mm) Gold Plated Titanium Alloy Needles, A Common Cosmetic Procedure for Treating Many Conditions By Stimulating Collagenand Elastin Production. Repairs * Aged Skin * Acne Scarring * Wrinkles * Stretch Marks * Celluite * ...]] with the Finulite cream again and I would see dramatic results the second time around. She stated to use the roller every other day depending on my tolerance level of the pain. Derma-rolling is a system in which a roller is used to \\&quot;break up hard fat, open clogged pores, and increases collagen production. Some individuals use \\&quot;numbers\\&quot; before using a roller, I decided to stand in front of the mirror, and basically roll away on my stomach until it turned deep red/purple, and microscopic pricks of \\&quot;blood\\&quot; appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She stated for honest results in her professional opinion to take a professional high quality Vitamin Supplement, she suggested [[ASIN:B000GOT54C Universal Animal Pak Sports Nutrition Supplement, 44-Count]]to assist in additional production of collagen, in combination with natural skin tightening/assistance ingredients. (Vitamin A + Biotin + others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;m taking my Animal Pack Vitamins, Applying my Finulite Cream, Drinking a Gallon of water a day, and Using my Dermaroller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving my dermaroller in the mail from amazon and a fresh order of Finulite cream, I was excited to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I used the derma-roller with strong force ( the first time my eyes were practically watering) and then I applied the \\&quot;AM\\&quot; cream. Shockingly, when I applied the cream, I felt a very hot/burning sensation from applying the cream I didn&#x27;t feel the first time around. I took my vitamins, &amp; applied my Vitamin A/ Retinol Cream throughout the day available at any drug store. At night, I lightly used the roller, (sanitized with alcohol after each time I use it) and applied the \\&quot;PM\\&quot; cream; instead of a burning sensation I felt a new very cold feeling in my stomach from the PM cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 days, my cellulite has gotten 50% better on top of the previous 20% !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 25 days I noticed mystretch marks are almost COMPLETELY GONE, my cellulite no longer shows unless \\&quot;I suck in my stomach, and even then it is very very minimal indentations,\\&quot; my skin is 75% tighter over all, before I could pull my stomach skin out a few disgusting inches, now I barely can even pinch my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the full 30 days (approaching 60 days total with two treatments of Finulite), (I will upload pictures in a few more days, on day 26) I am noticing my stretch marks have faded to my natural skin color ( and are not visible unless stretching my skin with my fingers from  deep painful when I touched them red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this product is great by itself, and in combination of vitamins, constantly keeping your skin moisturized, derma-rolling, and applying the cream( really rub the cream in, I rub the cream in with both hands, then press extremely hard, with slow controlled motions with my thumbs getting the cream deep deep inside the skin, until it no longer feels \\&quot;oily/moisture texture.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this review provided insight to men, and women alike. By there being so many positive reviews for Finulite, it gave me the confidence to order the product, and I would say 50% of this product is using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the product to wet, dirty, skin is defeating the purpose, give it an honest effort and you WILL see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to add 1 more positive review for Finulite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-K-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the product CORRECTLY and you WILL obtain results.</li>
            <li> I have been using different type of creams and scrubs to treat cellulite. When I came across this cream I liked that it does not tingle your skin and it works very well.  The results are noticeable in a week or a few weeks, depending how diligent you are In addition, it has very pleasant smell.  One thing that I would change is the bottle.  It is hard to get the amount you need when it is closer to the end.  Otherwise, I have been using this product and I am satisfied with its quality!</li>
            <li> So I REALLY wish I would have taken before pictures of myself, because when I looked today after a few weeks of using this I was REALLY happy!  I noticed a change, but wish I had taken a picture so I could show people.  I use this lotion in conjunction with a hand massager that I got on Amazon for about $8.00, so honestly to me to see a difference in disgusting cellulite for so little money, I just cannot pass it by.  I plan on ordering more when I get low.  Don&#x27;t be disappointed in the size of the bottles (I was worried when I first saw them) because a little goes a long way.  I have had mine almost a month and still have over half a bottle, more like 3/4, and I use it day AND night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second set.  I used it daily after my shower, sometimes I forget to apply at night but I am still getting great results. My cellulite is hardly noticeable anymore. I will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have been religiously using this product for over a year and I simply cannot live without it.  I use it daily and even if I travel, this always comes with me simply because the results are almost immediate.  Essentially, I have more even skin, the tightening effect is visibly noticeable and it definitively makes me more comfortable and confident while wearing a bathing suit.  Try it, you&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference when I use this product.  I can tell my thighs are more firm after using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help with my cellulite.  Most of them without much change.  Finulite has changed all that. I have used it for a month now and for the first time I see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> The cream consistency and smell is nice. However, I did not notice any affect on cellulite. I used one bottle of the night and day creams but didn&#x27;t feel like wanting more.</li>
            <li> Only downer is that you have to use it twice a day and I would never remember to use it in the PM. I just started using a mixture of both in the morning. Did help improve my cellulite but you also have to eat right, work out etc.</li>
            <li> the product did not work, did not see any results.  Don&#x27;t bother buying, no cream will do the trick when you have cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;The seller delivered the product on time.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week now and i see the difference! It the anti cellulite roller helps with it too</li>
            <li> Love it . And delivered on time ..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as directed (along with a diet and exercise program) for going on 6 weeks now, and it&#x27;s working!  I have seen strong improvements in the overall smoothness of my skin in the areas where I&#x27;ve applied it.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 3 weeks ago, pink bottle in the morning after my shower. Purple bottle in the evening before going to bed. I am using on my upper arms mostly because I want to wear short sleeves in the summer. I see a small improvement, but nothing out of this world amazing yet. I went to a dinner party the other night and wanted to wear a sleeveless top. I ended up putting on a dark bronzer to hide the cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this product would work better if in jar. It&#x27;s a little think for a bottle. And a small warning, these bottles are small. Not much product to use liberally. That is disappointing, for the price, both bottles should have enough to use on arms and legs. I will order again because I want to see if I will have better results next month.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only cellulite creams that I actually got results from.  Great product</li>
            <li> I tried this for 2 months and while it made my legs soft, my cellulite is still there :( I had high hopes due to all the reviews and thought that finally I found something that may actually work! Guess I will just keep exercising and eating a good diet.</li>
            <li> Really does work!!I am 31 yrs old and 5&#x27;7 and weigh 135 lbs. I am not overweight but I do have bad cellulite (Genetics). I no longer feel comfortable wearing shorts because the cellulite is so bad. I have been using this for a little over 4 weeks now and I can really see results. My legs look smoother and I actually wore a summer dress, something I have not done because I am always hiding my upper legs. This does take some dedication, but it is well worth it when you can see the difference yourself. I use pretty good pressure when I massage in for 5 or 6 min each leg. I&#x27;m also trying the rolling pin method too, as this gives very good massage pressure.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products over the years, but Finulite is by far the best because it actually works! It also makes my skin so soft, and smells nice. I noticed a positive change after about 10 days, but now it&#x27;s been a couple of months, and the difference it pretty dramatic.  I use a shower brush to exfoliate before applying, to ensure that it&#x27;s absorbed properly.  And, just use what you need to cover the area, and rub it in really well.  Don&#x27;t slather it on like regular lotion - that&#x27;s just a waste.  I&#x27;m a forever customer, unless someone develops a magic pill.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff definately works realy well if it is used daily and nightly, yet i use it once a day to make it last longer. I certainly recomend it to any girl struggling with cellulite!</li>
            <li> One (or two to be exact) that I trust because it simply works fast.&lt;br /&gt;- From someone who tried lots of cellulite creams</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical about this product, but have an upcoming beach vacation and decided to give it a try.  What a nice surprise!  I am in my mid-40s, never had kids, but had a moderate amount of cellulite.  I have been working out moderately since February of 2012, and am on my second installment of using Finulite.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the combination of working out and using Finulite or just the Finulite itself, but after using it for approximately two months, there was a much, much smaller amount of dimples on my rear and thighs.  I follow the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and would estimate that I use the product approximately 6-8 times per week.  It seems impossible, but I would estimate 65-75% less cellulite.  I hope they never stop making this product, because I refuse to live without it.  Give it a try, and be consistent in using it, and I expect you will receive similar results to mine!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually fights cellulite as it says it will.  I got it about 6 weeks before a beach vacation and it made a noticeable difference in my skin. Im a pretty fit person but still have some small areas on my upper thighs I&#x27;m unhappy with. Even all my running and strength training couldn&#x27;t fight them. Finulite really boosted confidence and made a difference!</li>
            <li> I have cellulite however it is not severe, on back of legs and sides.  I began applying this daily, morning and night, no special technique during the summer.  At the pool in July my son said my legs were very rippley...ugh.  It is end of September, as we are at the park my son said \\&quot;Mom, that rippley that used to be on your legs is gone.\\&quot;. Hey, if my 10 yr old noticed, it is working. It smoothed out most everything, minimizing my cellulite appearance but it did not get rid of it, just made it look 90% better.  The deeper pockets are slow to respond. I also wear the Delfin Spa shorts once daily during cardio, so maybe that is helping too.  Amazed and convinced, I&#x27;m ordering again.</li>
            <li> So I have been using this for about six months. I use it all over my lower body, thighs, calves and butt. It has made a huge difference in my skin, it looks firmer, a lot less cellulite and I feel that I have lost inches, although I didn&#x27;t measure before I started. My thighs and butt are transformed however. And that&#x27;s what counts! I had what I considered severe cellulite which would get worse with any kind of weight gain. I am normal weight to thin but my butt and thighs have always been the most difficult part of my body. I think I have bad circulation throughout my legs and that contributes to the problem. I bought Finulite after reading the reviews and it&#x27;s the best product I have used for this purpose! And believe me; I have used pretty much everything! Along with the Finulite, I dry brush my skin every morning and I am convinced that it&#x27;s the combination of the two that made such a huge difference. I definitely will continue this regiment. Now if I could only stop eating junk food, I am sure I would be totally cellulite free...&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention that this cream absorbs wonderfully fast and completely and smells great. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Awful product.....smells cheap, hard to get product out of bottle, no results on cellulite reduction.  I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of the 5 star reviews are FAKE.  I used the product for a month and didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> Received this product with my hopes up very high hoping i finally found a good product for my cellulite. Turns out it was a great product i noticed improvement in my cellulite not in two weeks but in just the first week! I was very impressed and couldnt believe my eyes. Wonderful cream and would recommend it to anyone and i already have. I even bought a set for my friend and she also likes it. Thankyou for such a great cellulite treatment!!</li>
            <li> I am above average when it comes to the average women. In saying that I mean that I have always cared about my appearance. I have pretty much have exercised all my life. But through it all age does a number on our bodies!  I will be 43 in December ,needless to say, my thighs have noticeable cellulite. I learned about this product through a coworkers. I noticed a big difference on her legs and.decided to try it myself! Of course I can&#x27;t expect a miracle in one or even two months. My cellulite was a progressive process so it will take time to see a major difference. I have noticed a big difference in only two months. Slowly but surely it will continue to improve my overall skin appearance.</li>
            <li> 1 year after giving birth to my daughter, my wife has been trying to get rid of these cellulites on thigh.  She&#x27;d tried several products, but this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Nice smell and non-greasy, but you&#x27;re unlikely to get much improvement from anything you simply rub onto your skin.</li>
            <li> The title should say it all but more words are required. Don&#x27;t waist your money on this product. It doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s not even good as basic lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks.. unfortunately don&#x27;t see any real improvement. I&#x27;ll adjust my review if that changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was thinking expecting a lotion to help something that really only exercise and diet can help but I gave it a shot after reading other product reviews. Save your money!!</li>
            <li> This product really works especially if you apply it as instructed&lt;br /&gt;both day and night. You will be very surprised by how quickly&lt;br /&gt;you will notice a difference in your skin. The white creams&lt;br /&gt;have  a pleasant odor and are agreeable to use. They are neither&lt;br /&gt;sticky nor oily and do not stain clothes.  I would definitely&lt;br /&gt;recommend this rapidly acting double cellulite formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion</li>
            <li> This is my second round with this product. I like it ok.  It has a pleasant smell and is easily applied.  I think it is helping though it is not the only \\&quot;means to an end\\&quot;  that i do.</li>
            <li> Before trying Finulite I used every cream under the sun but nothing seemed to work. I was obviously discouraged but I decided to keep looking, which is how I found this product. I was very skeptical but I can honestly say it works!!!!! It really does!!! For me, the results did not happen instantaneously but within 2 weeks I was noticing the dimples beginning to fade! Massaging while you rub in the lotion definitely helps, along with any massage you can do throughout the day. I am also working out and eating well, which is a must when it comes to fighting cellulite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and used other products that just didn&#x27;t cut it, TRY THIS!!! Just don&#x27;t give up and realize that this kind of thing is not a very fast process. Good luck!!!</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;4 and 115lbs and workout all the time but I have stubborn spots of cellulite. This product works great to tighten up those problem areas. I love it and make it part of my everyday routine. The seller always delivers promptly and is great to work with.</li>
            <li> I am not amazed about the results. After all the great reviews I was execting too much I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not a big problem but at least I was hopping to reduce a little and I can´t tell I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Very impress with the fast results! It seems to melt away the fat as well... The only problem is the size of the product. I wish I could purchase more than 8oz.</li>
            <li> I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  Thanks so much for quick and great service.  The product didnt do much for me, so didnt see a difference in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I saw some slight toning effects but  I couldn&#x27;t get past the horrible smell.  I would not  buy this product again.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I have purchased many products in hopes it will diminish my cellulite but haven&#x27;t seen results like I have in a short period of time. I have been using this product for about six weeks now and have experienced a smoother surface around my thighs. I eat clean, drink lots of water and exercise about four times a week so I just have stubborn fat deposits. I can&#x27;t wait to see the result I experience in the months to come.</li>
            <li> I havent seen this cream do any miracles but i do feel like it reduces them temporarily but if you stop using this i feel like they are visible again i have never been pregnant i just had stretch marks on my hips because i had gained weight and lost i dont know my stretch marks are still there . it hasnt done any miracles.</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite for about a month now and have seen considerable changes in the amount of cellulite on my glutes and back of legs. I&#x27;m also eating very clean and exercising 6 days a week, so that plays a major role in this change. I do feel the product is helping. No bad reactions, price is reasonable.  Overall, good product, and would recommend using in conjunction with exercise and good, clean diet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other creams and gels, but I&#x27;m impressed with the results I&#x27;m achieving using Finulite.  I&#x27;m a youthful 50 year old and constantly struggling with cellulite.  In only two weeks, my legs look so much better, smoother, and my skin feels great.  I&#x27;m looking forward to wearing shorts again.  This is an amazing product and I plan to buy more to keep my cellulite under control!</li>
            <li> is it working?? umm i pretty much got tired of rubbing smelly lotion on my legs after a week, its a rigorous process, and im sure even if you managed to &amp;#34;get rid of&amp;#34; cellulite, if you ever stopped youd get it right back.  I wish i stopped falling for these type of things, the only way your gonna stop cellulite is to exercise, these type of products dont work....sad reality, cuz i wish they did</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this product and was very excited about getting it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and I do think there is a slight difference although, I have also been using a wooden massager to deeply massage it in, so it could be the massage more than the actual lotions that is making the difference.  Still worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 5 days and already see and feel a difference in my thighs. As previously mentioned by another reviewer it is easy to use and smells great. It works into the skin well and there is no greasy, sticky residue. I plan on buying more because of the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties, I grew up in competitive sports, I eat well, and I lead an active life. Yet...I have cellulite! I am always weary of cellulite-reducing products because I&#x27;ve tried others with absolutely no results. But with Finulite (and their accompanying massage mitt) I have definitely noticed a difference, especially in the deeper dimples in my right thigh that have always bothered me. I have gone through the bottles fairly quickly, so either I&#x27;m using too much or the bottles could be bigger! It&#x27;s a bit expensive to replenish every month, but I have seen a difference and will continue using it until stop seeing results. Perhaps I&#x27;m destined to have cellulite forever (thanks, genetics), but Finulite has definitely made an improvement in the look of my legs!</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying Finulite, I must say I really did notice a big change below my butt, that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve been applying the cream, I don&#x27;t have severe case of cellulite but it&#x27;s been vanishing, I will be definitely buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> I used these for 3-4 weeks and they did work ok. I saw my belly get a little smaller. Though by the 4th week the lotion started getting clumpy in their bottles. I would have to stick my finger all the way through the bottle to whip some up or get something in there to get some out. I&#x27;ve recently found Sweet Sweat body cream to work better. Its smooth, creamy and smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product as it directs for three days now but haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results... Maybe it just takes a little while longer? I mean if there are changes they are so minute I can&#x27;t really tell..</li>
            <li> im on my second round of finulite and it really is the best cellulite product i have ever come across. i have tried everything and this product you use am and pm and ur skin looks smother rite away. i will keep buying this product again and again. and it smells like  fruity pebbles which is a extra bonus.</li>
            <li> I have been using the day and night cream the bottle is almost gone I really think I am noticing a difference the dimples are less noticeable and the smell is wonderful . Dries very quickly and product was packaged well and arrived quickly. this is no miracle cure but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the third set of Finulite I use, and I am completely happy with the results. I have tried many different products in the market and any one has gave me the results Finulite does. Fairy price and accesible for my budget. Great smell, fast absortion. At this time the appearence of my legs has improved in a 75%. I recommend it!! In fact I am sending a set to my sister who lives in Spain cause there is not available yet.&lt;br /&gt;Esta es mi tercera compra de Finulite y estoy completamente satisfecha con los resultados. He tratado muchos productos para combtir la celulitis y ninguno e ha dado los resultados de este. Precio justo y accesible. Huele bastante rico y se absorbe muy rapido. Hasta ahora la apariencia de mis piernas ha mejorado en un 75%. Lo recomiendo a ojos cerrados. De hecho estoy mandando el producto a mi hermana que vive en Espana porque alla no esta disponible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and I started to see results.. o would definitely recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been analyzing the reviews for a few of the different cellulite cream-all of which I&#x27;ve tried and purchased through Amazon.  I&#x27;ve noticed the positive reviews seem to be by reviewer&#x27;s with one or few reviews in the past; though, they are noted as \\&quot;amazon verified purchase\\&quot;, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.  This is the pattern for the -Slim Extreme 3D, Slim Fat Girl Bliss &amp; Finulite-all of which I have tried with little to no improvement.  Note: I am in my mid-30&#x27;s have worked out regularly for over 15 years, follow a healthy diet &amp; drink plenty of water.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been plagued with cellulite since my teen years-thank you to my parents-for passing along that gene :).  I&#x27;ve been diligently using the AM &amp; PM cream for about two weeks and have seen no improvement.  Another disappointment.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible in every way. First, it smells wonderful and makes your skin incredibly soft and lovely. Next, its works like a charm, just follow the directions and your cellulite will diminish quickly. You will see results right away which greatly improve over time and prevent future cellulite. Lastly, the product helps to burn fat and boost metabolism and I put it on many areas of my body. Awesome product and deserves a definite 5 Star Rating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month and a half, but the results are amazing!  I can see a dramatic difference in my problem areas.  It&#x27;s worth the money and the extra TLC to those areas.</li>
            <li> Legs still look the same. I used it faithfully and was hopeful but didn&#x27;t work. My belly still looks the same too. I&#x27;m not overweight and do exercise.</li>
            <li> not even a little bit and is bad for you!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well, not sticky our greasy.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am very skeptical about every product that says, &amp;#34;Will end Cellulite&amp;#34;. I have tried many things in the past and spent great amounts of time and money, to end up feeling frustrated, with no results. I read all the reviews on this product and I have to say, they were great. I thought, what the heck, I&#x27;ll give this a try and at 26 bucks, I can afford to at least try it. It was shipped to me quite fast too, I was surprised. The product smelled great, was very easy to apply and made my legs super smooth and soft. After about 2  weeks of using it twice a day I started to notice that it was smoothing out the dimples on the front and back of my legs, way worse on the back of my legs then the front. I just started my second month and I am hoping to see even more smoothing of the more worse parts of my thighs. I decided also that if it can work on my thighs, it can work on any other part of my body too. I started using it on my upper arms and only a week in now and already seeing a much smoother muscle tone there than the dimples. I have to say too that I think diet, exercise and drinking lots of water is very important in conjunction with this product to develop even better results. I&#x27;ve lost about 30 lbs since December, dieting and exercising, so I am doing whatever I can to help me achieve the body I have always wanted. With this product I am confident that in the next few months to come I will have eliminated most of the stubborn areas of Cellulite that I have been trying to get rid of for years. I will try to keep up with posting as my results progress. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with stubborn Cellulite like mine. Thank again Finulite!!</li>
            <li> miracle stuff. i&#x27;m a little more than halfway through the bottles and dimples are gone. the only reason i tried this is because  i was using epsom salts in the bath tub to relieve aches (just from inactivity, i don&#x27;t workout) if that can pass through my skin and make a difference in my muscles than perhaps a cream could actually do something for my dimples. so glad i tried this.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a week, every morning and every night and i see no results. It does smell nice and is smooth on the skin but so far its nothing other then any other lotion. Maybe with time i will see results, that is my hope..</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have this big cellulite dimple that won&#x27;t go away on the side on my right thigh and cellulite all over my bottom and the back of my legs. I have been battling cellulite for nearly 10 years. I have bought tons of creams, gels, ointments, whatever, but nothing has worked. When I exercise I do see an improvement in the overall appearance of my cellulite but it won&#x27;t improve past a certain point. I was watching Dr. Oz one day and he mentioned that a special chemical- aminophylline--that breaks down fat when topically applied. So I did some research and bought finulite. Although it doesn&#x27;t have aminophylline, it has the sister compound theophylline which is supposed to be more potent. I also bought some neoprene workout pants and decided to apply the finulite AM on my thighs and butt everyday before my workout with the neoprene pants and then apply the finulite PM one after my nighttime shower. At first I was thinking--ok, so I just wasted my money, because I didn&#x27;t really notice results after 2 weeks. But then I went to the beach (dread!) with a couple of friends and they could not stop raving about how good I looked, at first I was just thinking that they were being nice because they knew how hard I was working out but then later a looked  at myself in pictures and I was so surprised! My big dimple on my thigh that has been a constant annoyance since I was 16 was hardly noticeable! Also, my thighs and butt looked about 50% smoother!&lt;br /&gt;Being the skeptic that I am, I decided to stop using the product and just work out with my neoprene pants. Needless to say, there was a BIG difference, although I was tone from working out, my cellulite did not look as smooth as it did when I used the finulite. Now I do not know how finulite works without exercise, because I always try to stay fit as its not easy for me to stay naturally thin, but I recommend this product to boost workout results.</li>
            <li> Please note that, as much as we want for creams to work to cure/remove cellulite, THEY SIMPLY DON&#x27;T WORK. Don&#x27;t fall for the 4oz expensive creams that claim they do it. They don&#x27;t and I am amazed with all the positive review!!!! Makes me think they are not genuine at all. DON&#x27;T waste your money.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about the Finulite line!! I am a repeat purchaser because like most women, I am fairly insecure about my arms. The Finulite creams and the Finulite massage mitt have made my arms look smooth - making them look more defined. I have been using this product for nearly 2 years and consider it a life-saver (or at least an arm-save). :-) Bring on the tank tops!</li>
            <li> I wanted so much to like this product! It smelt great, it made my thighs so soft, but it did nothing for the cellulite. On the contrary i would say that after I stopped using it for some time my cellulite became worse than ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Finulite now for 3 weeks and I began seeing an improvement by the end of week 1.  I love this product!  The cream has a light smell and absorbs quickly.  Just ordered another 2 month supply!</li>
            <li> I started using this product and noticed and difference in just a few days, and even better results in a few weeks. I use this product everyday and so far I have lost 4 inches from my hips alone.</li>
            <li> I love these creams I&#x27;ve been using them every day for a week and they really seem to be working and the effects appear to be long lasting.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a cellulite solution.</li>
            <li> nothing special, paid a lot of money for something that smells pretty good but does absolutely nothing for the Cellulite... just my perception</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I thought would. It smelled really nice. I thought this would really help with some of the cellulite on my thighs, but I not.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes to wear shorts and bathing suits  without having to worry about how my legs look.  I go to the gym a few times a week and still have cellulite.  Well after a week of use myself and others noticed a reduction in the appearance of cellulite.  I have been wearing dresses with confidence and have started wearing shorts around the house.  I have just purchases a second set of lotions and will continue to use this little miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an aesthetician and I&#x27;ve had an issue with cellulite since I had my daughter nine years ago .... I&#x27;ve tried expensive professional aesthetic cellulite systems but with no luck.... I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and the results are amazing... My cellulite is almost gone and I&#x27;m sure it will completely disappear soon</li>
            <li> It truly works! I was skeptical at first, but then I kept at it and it is great. The cellulite has diminshed significantly! It is almost gone. Make sure you drink plenty of water, this is a big thing in getting rid of cellulite. I use with the massage mit. It is fabulous! I do not have bruising like other say while using the massage mit.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months now and am very pleased.  As much as I work out, I still have celluite appearances on my thighs, but this product has helped in diminishing it within months.  Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about receiving this product since the reviews were so good, but I am very disappointed. It has not worked at all on my cellulite and I&#x27;m not a big person. The only positive thing is that both lotions smell nice. Basically, I paid for expensive, nice-smelling lotions.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product but I used it daily, followed the directions, was also working out on a regular but notice zero change.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am already re-ordering. My cellulite has been since the age of 14 or 15, and I have always struggles with wearing shorts and bathing suits. It&#x27;s been about a week, and I am already seeing a difference. Even my stretch marks are diminishing. I also use it on my upper arms, and they look thinner! It&#x27;s soo cool!!! My tummy doesnt have that wrinkled look when I suck it in, as much anymore . I&#x27;m very happy :-) I hope to continue the product with a scrub and coffee soap now because I am inspired that it works.</li>
            <li> Yes, I read all the reviews before purchasing, and yes I used it as recommended. It was just a waste of money. I have bought cream at walmart that work better than this, even coconut oil does. It does smell nice, and I believe it made a slight improvement  but very subtle and disappointing for how often it has to be applied.</li>
            <li> Only used for couple of weeks but notice the difference right away. And still getting better.  Now I know why it had such great views.  Might give it higher view later if it keeps getting better.  But best I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using finulite for several weeks and I LOVE it!  I have suffered from mild cellulite on the back of my thighs for years, despite being thin and in good shape.  I have tried multiple creams, diets and exercises to get rid of cellulite with no success, but I have already started to notice results with finulite.  I&#x27;m looking forward to spending my summer showing off my cellulite free legs! If you are on the fence about ordering this product I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the finulite am and pm creams for 8 weeks now and I can say that even though my cellulite is not gone, I can see a difference. I am a person that has been struggling with weight for a good portion of my life and after I had my son I had gained and now lost 80 pounds. So mind you, not only do I have cellulite issues, I have extra skin too. I have used every cream and lotion out there and I was farly impressed with this one. This was the first cream that I ever used where I not only started to see an improvement in my cellulite but I also started to see an improvement in my skin and its elasticity.  My skin feels healthier, smoother, and beginning to feel normal!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in that  the liquid in both bottles of Finulite is too thick to dispense. I have to open the bottles and hit repeatedly to get some of the cream to even try.  I have no idea if the product is worth the effort. Please advise.</li>
            <li> This product has shown me the best results so far.  I’ve tried other very pricey cellulite creams that promise you will see results and I saw little to NO difference.  I have stubborn cellulite on my thighs and butt that with diet and exercise will not fully go away!!  This cream (when used properly) definitely has tightened and improved my skin tone on these areas.  But, when you stop using it, you stop seeing the results.  So, you have to use it faithfully day and night, repeatedly.  If you do so, over the couple of weeks you will start to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don’t have to slather a lot on either, just enough to moisturize the areas.  Only down side so far for me is the price.  You will need to re-up about every month.  It gets pricey, so I usually only buy it in the summer months when I will be wearing shorts, dresses and bathing suits.</li>
            <li> I am not good at this but l have to say Works :).  I am been using  finulite for one month and l can see the results  don&#x27;t be afraid to buy you will love it  !!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far, this product has been helpful. I can tell a difference after a few uses. It firms your skin up for sure. It is something that you have to keep using though to keep the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item and I must say I kove the way it smells and how it soaks in the skin. I would definitely by more. I have seen some changes its worth a try !</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of cellulite products.  This by far is the best product I have found.  It actually does reduce the appearance of cellutlite and makes the skin soft and supple.  It is also a great value compared to other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up with the AM solution.  The PM solution comes out of the bottle with a good squeeze, but the AM is so thick, it&#x27;s impossible to get it out of the bottle.  Maybe it&#x27;s a great product, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll find out since I can&#x27;t get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and can already see some improvement! I can&#x27;t wait to see my legs in 2 more weeks! I have tried others and not gotten results. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this product for 6 weeks and have continued to see a great improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li> This product in no way claims what it states it will do. I saw better results with other cellulite creams that I have used. And there&#x27;s only enough product to last for a couple weeks. Who wants to keep spending more &amp; more money, only to find out, it still won&#x27;t do anything? I eat a healthy diet &amp; exercise regularly. I used the product as instructed, but there was no change at all in my cellulite. I will go back to the product I used before because at least it was starting to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Showing subtle yet noticeable results in just one week. Would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and texture of both creams.  There is a noticeable difference after application and altho it doesn&#x27;t CURE cellulite it reduces the appearance by a bunch.  It is much cheaper than Revitashape and I think does just as good of a job while smelling better.  For the price, a definite try.</li>
            <li> I can tell this is a great company. They take the time to instruct the customer on how to use it in the packaging, and it is priced in a very reasonable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it is probably not traditional. I use it on my midsection to reduce puffyness from the female herbs I take. I love it- it ensures I&#x27;m able to see my muscles. The skin in the area is smooth and without bumps I used to get. This is incredible!</li>
            <li> The product has a great scent and glides on perfectly.  It is really working for me in the 6 weeks of use.  I see smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Finulite now for 2 months. I started to see a difference after about 4 weeks and a significant difference after 2 months. I love it and will definitely keep using it. It makes my skin firm and smooth and I love the smell of it! Kind of a hassle putting it on morning and night but once you get into a routine it just because a part of your day. This is the first product to get rid of cellulite I&#x27;ve tried so I can&#x27;t compare with others, but I love this one so I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cellulite since my teens and have tried everything to get rid of it: endermologie, dry brushing, etc, with mixed results. I have ordered this product 3 times already and so far, so good! Although it hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared  (I don&#x27;t expect it to), the overall appearance has definitely improved. My only caveat is that these two tubes don&#x27;t last the full month (at least for me), perhaps 3 weeks at the most. The seller, however, ships super fast and usually runs some kind of promotion (free gift, etc)</li>
            <li> Surprisingly very effective!! I&#x27;m totally happy with this products performance. :) Would recommend to friends for sure.</li>
            <li> This sucks im going to send it back</li>
            <li> This made a noticeable difference for me! I am buying my second set. I also used the the Bliss Fat Girl reducting circle in the shower during the same period of time.</li>
            <li> I have used Finulite 3 months ago and the day and night cream had a more pronounced pink and purple color.&lt;br /&gt;It worked wonders and I was very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a new set and the cream color is very faded and almost white. It looks like either the formula has been changed or this one cream is fake.&lt;br /&gt;I am not seeing the same result as 3 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone run into the same problem?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I used other creams before and was disappointed,  but decided to try this product because many people recommended it.  My skin looks much better then before.  After one month I started to see results! I love that there is an AM and PM bottle. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new to try!</li>
            <li> NEVER FINISHED USING THE TUBES AS ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH NEVER REALLY NOTICED ANYTHING</li>
            <li> After looking online for a while in search of a product to reduce or eliminate cellulite on my stomach, I came across the Finulite AM and PM cream.  I felt that it was reasonably priced so I gave it a try.  The cream is very lightweight with no odor.  A little goes a long way so the product does last a while and you don&#x27;t need to pile it on to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that after going through the bottles the first time I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, however, I do know that you are supposed to give something a three month trial period before making any decisions so I went ahead and ordered the set again.  This time around, I&#x27;m very pleased with my results and definitely see the difference.  My cellulite on my stomach is fading away as each day passes and I fully believe that I will achieve the results I&#x27;m looking for.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to fix their cellulite problem.  I know that I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of cellulite on my legs that got even worse after having my son. I tried a few over the counter creams and gels from the drugstore with no luck. From the reviews, I decided to give this 24 hour system a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did, Three weeks later not only does my skin look 100x better, but the stretch marks I got during my pregnancy are disappearing as well. At the rate it&#x27;s going I think after a couple more months I&#x27;ll have my pre pregnancy body back.</li>
            <li> I wish this product worked for me like I hoped. Although it did small nice and made my skin soft, it didn&#x27;t solve my cellulite problem. What DID help was exercise. I honestly don&#x27;t think their is a product that can take away cellulite. Good old fashion exercise is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for a couple of months day and night and it does work at all. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used 2 sets ( one of each ) and nothing happened.I read most reviews about it before I order. I don&#x27;t know should I stop it or continue . The information is not clear and also the bottles are disaster specialy The AM bottle. It is very hard to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I think this cream is working.  It smells really good, too.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd set, and will continue to use the cream to see if it makes more of a difference the longer you use it.  I wish they would use a different type of plastic bottle.  It is hard to squeeze the bottle to get the cream out.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon, discounted at about 50% of the website rate about 6 weeks ago and both bottles are now nearly empty. I had lost about 15 pounds through running and calorie reduction since January (5&#x27;6\\&quot; and 138lbs currently)but still felt I had a moderate amount of cellulite on my thighs. I used the product as directed for the first 3 weeks and noticed a small amount of difference on my upper thighs. Admittedly, I didn&#x27;t do as well the last 3 weeks and instead of using BOTH products once a day, I was able to remember to use at least ONE once a day (usually the daytime formula). Overall, I would say I&#x27;ve had about a 20% improvement in the appearence of my legs. Not great, but for $20 and not using it the entire 6 weeks as directed, it wasn&#x27;t terrible results either.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t not find any improvement in my cellulite at all . I am giving it 2 stars bc it smells nice. It really makes me wonder who is really writing all those 5 star reviews.(That is why I purchased it). The company or friends of workers? Really ? Is cellulite really that different for some and not others. I found something on amazon I think works better than any cream. The barre  videos. I have been doing step and cardio classes for several years with little improvement on the outer thigh.  The new ballet barre video effective! Not instant for me but have seen improvement over several weeks.</li>
            <li> The BEST! I have been using finulite for the past 2yrs and my body looks much sexier - wow. My husband even noticed the difference. It has helped me lose my belly fat, get firmer thighs and a tighter butt - with no more cellulite. Now that I know it&#x27;s around, I won&#x27;t have to worry anymore about cellulite or gaining belly fat. I used alot of products in the past but will never trade this for anything. Believe me, it is the best. Try it and you will see. Smells great, absorbs fast - just like scented body lotion. I will always use this - finulite is my idol!</li>
            <li> This is my second round of using Finulite. First time I used it 4 months ago. I saw improvement in my skin condition after a month of usage by about 30% - 40%. Because I am very sceptical when it comes to creams and potions, these numbers are pretty impressive for me.  The disappointing part is that I got even worst cellulite in the next two months when I didn&#x27;t use the cream. Then I decided to give Finulite the second chance, and again as with the first time, I see minimum into moderate improvement. Even my daughter noticed that my legs look better. I would saw that it is better then nothing, and I will probably use it again in a month or two to keep my legs in shape until I find some permanent solution for the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with the chunky cellulite on the back of my thighs ever since I can remember and have lived in pants and longer shorts because of it. Nothing has ever worked for me until I found Finulite. Over the past 6 weeks, I&#x27;ve been religiously using both AM and PM bottles and have noticed a dramatic change. My legs are so much smoother and appear much more toned. I now have the confidence to wear shorter styles. I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a cream that works for a few years now and I have spent countless amounts of money on expensive products that promise to do the trick, but don&#x27;t. I came across Finulite and decided to try it. I was so amazed to start seeing results within the first two weeks! I have a smaller figure and I am not over weight, but I was feeling out of shape because of the cellulite on my thighs. Once I started using this product, I noticed the skin start to tighten up and the bumps become smaller! I use the lotion as recommended, as soon as I get up and right before bedtime! I have been using it for about 8 weeks and I plan on continuing to stick with this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different creams and supplements for cellulite and have not been impressed by any of them, but I have noticed quite a remarkable improvement in my cellulite since using the Finulite. The difference was a smoother and more hydrated look. This was apparent after only 2 weeks of using the product. I have since ordered another set and will probably keep using it indefinitely. Finally, a good  product for cellulite!!</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply and smells good. I have seen a difference but continuous use is necessary as miracles do not happen overnight.  Like any other product where we want to see great results, weight loss has to play a role in reducing visible cellulite in problemed areas. I am on weight loss, am using this regimen faithfully and am seeing results. I will continue to use it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that actually delivered it&#x27;s promise. I have used a few cellulite reducing creams including nivea for a while with no results. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to give this product a go.. and what do you know?? it works!! I have been using this product for over six months and I will never go without it. The cellulites are not 100% gone but they are 75% reduced. I call that a success. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret your decision. Just keep using as directed.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried this product and i bought 2 of them. I&#x27;m almost done using the first 2 bottles, been using it day and night but still haven&#x27;t seen any changes. I might just try other product.</li>
            <li> Finulite is a great cellulite product.  I am finding amazing results and I am now onto my second supply of Finulite. I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in cellulite reduction.  I am going to look amazing for my honeymoon and I looked great for my wedding too!</li>
            <li> I have used this everyday as instructed and I have not seen a difference in the pits in my leg. It does smell good though.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on all the great reviews it has. It did not work for me at all. It smells nice but did not change a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have notice the change after 1mo of use. It is part of my anti-cellulite fight now (exercise and 10 min quick massage).  AM and PM creams are enough for about 1mo. Creams smell good, and my skin feels so silky. Good buy. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything at all. I was constant and patience but I never saw any results. The packaging is lovely and it smells divine. Too good to be true</li>
            <li> my cellulite diminished about 85% in less 2weeks..please try it,I swear by it!no need to use expensive useless creams or åay expensive treatments.This cream REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I swear the good reviews here are fake and this product should be removed from the market.  This doesn&#x27;t work even after proper diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> This product is very difficult to use- the tubes are quite firm &amp; it takes some intense shaking to even get the cream out of them. I have used both as directed- morning &amp; night, and there had been no result- not even a good moisturizing action.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get results yet but they say it takes 3 months. I&#x27;m only in my first month so we&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use.  I use the pink bottle in the morning and the purple bottle in the evening.  They both have a very pleasant scent, which is a plus.  I see my thighs become more tight and supple when using these lotions continuously.  I have purchased this product twice and I am a very happy customer.  I will continue to be a repeat customer for Finulite.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This treatment is pretty amazing. I was a bit apprehensive at first because I thought that an inexpensive treatment could not be as good as they claimed. I have been using the creams for about 4 weeks now and I can say that I have noticed positive changes. The skin feels smoother and a bit more toned. Also, the scent of these products is lovely. I will definitely keep using it and I would recommend it to anyone who has problem areas that need toning.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me and I used it faithfully.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of finulite. No cellulite will dissapear quickly in a few days! But I do see improvement and will continue to buy. Don&#x27;t forget to buy the massage works even better!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Finulite to anyone who is looking for an improvement in cellulite and skin laxity. I am 5&#x27;5, 112 pounds and work out/eat very well.  However, after children I definitely noticed a light-medium amount of cellulite on my legs and a loss of skin firmness around my knees. I noticed results after using Finulite for about 2 weeks and saw steady improvement after that. For anyone that left a negative review, it is important to know that it is important to drink a lot of water, eat healthy and exercise regularly. Finulite gave me the best results out of any other cream I have tried. I especially liked the tightening around the knee area. Give it a try, be patient and don&#x27;t forget the water!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this…. I feel really silly for buying thinking it would work because it doesn&#x27;t. Spend time eating healthy and exercising because that truly works. Also exfoliate and drink plenty of water and you will see the cellulite diminish.</li>
            <li> If you can read the exceptionally tiny print on the bottles, you&#x27;ll see that Finulite creams contain: PEG-100 stearate and other artificial chemicals whose names are so long and complex I won&#x27;t take the time to list them here. If Finulite had listed these chemicals under &amp;#34;product description&amp;#34; on the Amazon website, I&#x27;d never have purchased them. Truth in advertising, please.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;m almost done with both bottles and No Change. Working out is the only thing to take away cellulite.</li>
            <li> I was left with stretch marks and cellulite after gaining then losing over 50lbs during my pregnancy. I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of products and frankly don&#x27;t have the money or time to burn. As an RN, I decided to look for a product that made medical sense - one with a chance of working based on science. A dermatologist at my hospital recommended finding something with a Xanthine. This compound enhances the efficiency of messenger molecules in charge of regulating fat metabolism, increasing lipolysis to speed up the fat burning process. I tried this product because it had exactly what I was looking for - Theophylline, a very strong Xanthine. While researching Xanthines I also found that they work best when used apart from meal times because the insulin produced during meal times shuts off the fat burning process. I use this product before breakfast and before sleep. It&#x27;s been about a month and my cellulite is much improved. I have confidence in this product and how it works because it has medically proven components that break down cellulite and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> this product is not good for cellulite i havent see any difference, the only good thing is that leave you skin smooth...</li>
            <li> I have been use this product for almost 2 weeks. It has no effect on me at all. Isn&#x27;t it a kind of trick? The five stars review on the Amazon is fake?</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoyed this product. I felt I&#x27;ve seen results after about 2 weeks, after regular use.  Would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This product really works!!! I had tried Nivea Cellulite lotion in the past and saw absolutely no change. I noticed a difference about a week into using Finulite. It will definitely become part of my summer regimen! I was able to wear shorts and a swimsuit again! I only used one set, but with that one set, I&#x27;d say that about 75% of the cellulite went away. I am going to see what happens after using a second set, excited to see the results! I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product really does work and I am really surprised on how quickly I noticed improvement in the smoothness of my skin in only 3 weeks. In fact, even my husband noticed and complimented me. The creams smell great not like most others I have wasted money on. And having the 2 bottles actually helps me keep a steady routine. It&#x27;s really simple to use, AM in the morning and PM at night.  I&#x27;ll continue with this amazing duo and recommend it to anyone looking for a product that really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cellulite since giving birth to my first child over10 years ago and have tried everything under the sun for it. Nothing has ever worked until now. LOVE this product...smells great...feels nice...good price....fast acting...I really can&#x27;t complain :)</li>
            <li> Within two (2) weeks I have witnessed a smoothness. I am just not sure if too weeks is the duration in which providing a rating is accurate to suffice.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product because it was so cheap compared to other cellulite products out there but I am glad I did. I&#x27;ve been struggling with cellulite since 18, now 34 and I weigh 120 lbs. Over the past 10 years I&#x27;ve spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on expensive cellulite creams and treatments but nothing seemed to get rid of it. I purchased this product mid july because it had great ratings compare to other cellulite creams and now I am back re ordering again. This product really works and I have seen a huge difference in the appearance of my thighs, they are much smoother and cellulite has diminished drastically. In order to see a difference, you have to apply it everyday morning and night in a circular motion, rub it in all the way until its dry on the skin. I apply it right after I take a shower, while in the shower i use Bliss Fat Girl Slimulator, rub it in a circular motion until my things are deep pink then apply the lotion right after.You have to be patient and consistent with your routine, cellulite didnt build over night and it will not disappear over night,but you will see amazing results (for me it was 3 weeks)I couldnt be happier with this product!!!!! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I was told about Finulite by a family member, she actually gave me some that she had left in a bottle, I&#x27;m glad I got to test it before I purchased it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked so I ordered my own bottle recently and the shipment was super fast.  It seems to be a great company with a terrific product, it&#x27;s nice to find something that really works.  Buy with confidance and enjoy the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Tom P.</li>
            <li> I was very dubious about thisproduct I mean really can a cream remove cellulite forever? Well the answer is YES!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for 4 months now day and night exactly as directed I have alsi increased my excercise and improved my diet no sugary or junks foods, no alcohol!&lt;br /&gt;My cellulite has just vanished, I cannot believe it, I am still using this product until I finish the tub&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Finulite, My Hubby Thanks you too :-)</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, but this product earned it!!! I use exactly as directed and have noticed a significant improvement on my legs!! I am so happy and now have more confidence to wear shorts again. Thank you sooooo much Finulite!  :)  I&#x27;m so glad I found you!  Everyone is different, but this is definitely worth a try because it worked for me! I highly recommend Finulite and have purchased at least 4 sets! I noticed changes after the 1st week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely Awesome!  :)</li>
            <li> Finulite helped to decrease the cellulite on my thighs.  I was skeptical at first but kept applying it morning and night.  My legs were noticeably smoother after one month and I will continue to use this product.  A lot of reviewers have said the cellulite comes right back when they stop using it, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that in my situation.  If I stop for a couple weeks my legs look the same just drier, but a skin brushing regimine helps that. Not all of the cellulite is gone, but I feel better about it.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend and so I  thought I would try finulite. I am so glad I did.  I researched the ingredients to make sure there weren&#x27;t any cancer causing stuff in finulite. It was important to me that I knew someone who used finulite and loved it but it is also important that in doesn&#x27;t have any cancer causing ingredients.I have been using it for  about 2 weeks and I can  already see results. My legs look and feel smoother.The best part is that my husband noticed a difference too. I just love it. I can&#x27;t wait to share it with friends.</li>
            <li> This is the third order of Finilite Cellulite AM/PM I have purchased.  I have sensitive skin and this product is so super easy to apply with a very nice smell. I follow the directions using the pink bottle first thing in the morning and the purple bottle right before bed.  There has been a huge decrease in the look of my cellulite on my upper legs and thighs.  My legs look so much younger than before I started using this product. I can say I will keep using this product until I can no longer see any cellulite. I am planing on taking a trip to Mexico and do want to look good in my shorts..&lt;br /&gt;Try it and see how you like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Finulite AM &amp; PM for awhile, and have already noticed a difference, stretch marks are fading.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 6 months. I think that it has helped some. Not a great deal. I am thin, work out, eat well, but have some cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;I do not think any product will EVER take it away. For this price, it is also a hope it is helping, that at least I am doing something! I think it is alright... If you have major cellulite, surgery is the only thing that will make a big difference. This is a fairly new, and would be very expensive.(I have done my homework on this!!) It sucks that most of us have it, but often it is the fat we eat and not working out. For me it is also my age...</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying im on bottle three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had saggy messy cellulite all over my legs (front back &amp; side) Ive tried it all (endo treatments,creams, scrubbers etc.) Nothing works like this!&lt;br /&gt;I put on the AM pink cream and do some reps of squats and lunges. Dont hesitate to TRY this product, you will notice a difference. There are some amazing purification properties in this product. Drink water and sweat after applying the AM cream and lay flat w/ the PM cream for best results.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of finulite cellulite solutions and have noticed that after trying so many other products for this purpose, so far, this one has come out on top. So far, I am liking the results. However, it is not anything permanent, but you have to be consistent with it to continue to see results. I don&#x27;t have to do a lot of massaging to see results as some of the other customers have claimed to have to do.</li>
            <li> I actually tried this product to burn belly fat rather than reduce cellulite (as it contained ingredients which destroyed fat cells). I tried lots of products which were supposed to stimulate fat burning but they did nothing. Like Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Slimming Serum Anti-Cellulite Fat Burner and Slim Extreme 3D Spa Active Sculpting Stomach and Buttocks (used them both twice) which felt sticky and made you sweat...and did not burn any fat (for me anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Finulite creams actually did help to reduce my belly fat. I also liked their smell and feel. The scent is not overpowering, but mildly floral. The texture is very smooth and feels silky (not sticky) when it goes on. My problem is that I&#x27;m slim with a pot belly which I got after pregnancy. When I do loose weight its all over, so my bad shape remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the creams for about two weeks I started to notice a slight reduction in the amount of fat on my stomach. By the end of the month my sister noticed too. That was when I finally realized that it wasn&#x27;t just wishful thinking. I&#x27;ve bought the creams again for myself and my daughter. My belly fat is about fifty percent reduced. For me that&#x27;s a lot! Its not an overnight wonder, but its gradual and steady. So I&#x27;m continuing buying it. I don&#x27;t exercise much (as I had a hernia operation a while back). But I&#x27;m going to try some standing ab exercises in the future. So give it a try and good luck to all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now and unless I am doing something wrong i have not seen any difference. It smells great but thats about it. Just feel as though im putting extra lotion on. I didnt think i would find a miracle cream but due to all the good feedback I was hoping for at least something but nothing. I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> This product will get you results, but it is not a cure for cellulite.  It takes a few months of regular use in order to see improvement.  What I like is that there is one bottle for morning application and another formula for night time application.  I would say I saw about a 40% improvement in the look of my skin after a few months of treatment, which is great because I really needed some help.  It will not take away every bit of cellulite, NO product can do that, but I feel there was a significant enough improvement in order for me to continue using the product.  Also, the price is great for the results that you get.  Most products on the market today are MUCH pricier and you only get one formulation (not day/night like Finulite offers) and there are little to no results with other products- trust me on this, as I have tried SO many different things that are out there for cellulite.  In short, I feel this product is definitely worth a try (remember it takes a few months) as you will certainly see improvement in the smoothing and texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product has work for me and I had bad cellulite that made me so depressed hasn&#x27;t been a miracle but still using it so far so good</li>
            <li> This product works very effectively when used consistently as directed.  I have purchased four sets since May, and plan to continue buying this lotion as long as I keep getting the results I&#x27;ve gotten thus far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 6 months. I have tried a bunch of different lotions to get rid of cellulite for at least 6 years. I know that you can&#x27;t get rid of it all but this product really seemed to make a difference. The smell is great too! I really reccomend trying this product. You will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> This is one of the better cellulite creams I have tried.  Although I am slim and I work out 4-5 times a week and eat right I still have a few trouble spots on back of thighs that seem resistant to exercise.  I have purchased and have used this cream for many months now.  I like the smell and consistency of cream and feel that it has made my thighs feel firmer and makes them look smoother.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 2 months.  My thighs are smoother and somewhat tighter.  My husband even commented that the new products were working.  I must add that I also walk on the treatmill 3 times per week and&lt;br /&gt;am watching somewhat better what I eat.  I also periodically use the 3D Eveline cellulite gel with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good creme/lotion for Cellulite. I work out 4 or 5 days a week and eat pretty healthy. No kids. In my late 20&#x27;s and cant seem to get rid of it! I have tried a few products here and there. I ordered this based on some of the feedback and so far its been working great. Its been a few weeks and I can see it smoothing out my trouble areas. It&#x27;s not perfect so dont expect 100% success overnight but rubbing it in throughly and continuing to use it every day will give you results. So far Finulite has worked and smells good. I suggest getting some sort of product to help rub it in. This helps circulation which also allows celluite to break up and loosen. Im not a professional about this but I am a massage therapist and have spent lots of time looking at ways to make my skin look better so hopefully this helps you!</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks straight and it did help me reduce the way my skin looked in almost like 60%. It may not make it completely disappear, but I saw a big difference and I am really happy about it.</li>
            <li> I used it following directions and you could not tell any difference whatsoever after weeks of using it!! Will not recommend!</li>
            <li> This lotion does exactly what it promises. I noticed an awesome improvement to my trouble areas in no time when I used this as recommended, and not only did it get rid of the embarrassing bumps, it also had ingredients in it that my skin (KP aka &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) LOVED. Seriously, every time I use this on my arms and legs, not only does my cellulite disappear, but my bumpy skin also gets very smooth and the KP is less noticeable. That&#x27;s just a happy side-effect though, I would use it regardless. It also has a very pleasant smell and it sinks into the skin quickly. This lotion also works just as good or  better than more expensive creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After only a week of using finulite and the mitt along with healthy diet and going to the gym ; I can already see great results. Finulite not only decreases the appearance like other products it really works on the fat cells directly. Also I combine using the mitt in the shower with regular soap.  I&#x27;m very excited about using this product again. Looking forward to the the end of the month to see results !</li>
            <li> Have been using for past 3 weeks. Could see difference . My stretch marks and cellulite have reduced. Planning to use it with the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt  to see more effect.&lt;br /&gt;My cons are about the size and material of the bottle. Itz hard to squeeze so I have to remove the bottle cap fully and use it.</li>
            <li> I just started using it. I like the way the lotions feel and smell. Hopefully they will work great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different cellulite creams over the past few years, and Finulite has worked the best for me by far. I&#x27;ve used a few other products that produced no results whatsoever! I do see results with Finulite if I use it regularly. It is a joy to see those cellulite marks disappear! It goes on cleanly and does not leave a greasy residue, so no prob with putting pants on right after application. I wish that the dispenser top could be modified so that it didn&#x27;t clog up after sev uses, but I&#x27;m happy enough with the product, compared to others, that I&#x27;m willing to overlook that. I would imagine that the Finulite developers will improve on that over time.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Yet another product that promises everything yet delivers nothing.  I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a month with absolutely no difference.  I&#x27;ll continue until the product is gone and if anything changes I&#x27;ll change my review.  But for now, it&#x27;s been a waste of money.  Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li> Awesome product this stuff really works would definitely buy more from this place an fast shipment so you looking for a good celliute cream I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use finulite for three consecutive months and I can say it works great. I will recommend finulite.</li>
            <li> When I used this product for the first time I was optimistic. And when I continued to use it I was feeling better that I was doing something to getting rid of my cellulite(which is my worst enemy I still battle every day) I love the ingredient list and how it smells, took awhile to get used to but I enjoyed using it. The only problem is that I go through it too fast- maybe its how much Im using at one time but the small bottles could be bigger in my opinion. While the prices are reasonable, bigger bottles would be helpful for how much I put on in a single session- hence the four star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, this is a wonderful cellulite cream, hands down!!</li>
            <li> First set didn&#x27;t do anything for me but did make my legs very soft... might just have to try second set ...</li>
            <li> No creme will ever 100% rid you of cellulite. However, this creme does more than any other I&#x27;ve tried. It actually has the correct ingredients that is necessary to diminish cellulite such as caffeine. It also has enough of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite, it&#x27;s mostly around my butt and thighs, the dimples were never that deep so if your cellulite is very bad I can&#x27;t say you&#x27;ll have the same experience I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked out, drank lots of water, ate healthy, and massaged the cellulite areas daily while using this product. I used it pretty religiously and used quite a bit at a time. I covered from my hip down to my knee with the stuff and really worked it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw results really fast, within the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles for me lasted a decent amount of time, about a month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue would be that both bottles have the exact same ingredients and the only difference in the two is the fragrance. I think its for emphasizing putting on the cremes twice a day, but to me it also seems that they can sell two bottles for more money than just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m purchasing another two bottles because like I said... it works!</li>
            <li> The lotions smell wonderful. The moring one reminds me of a citrusy blend of oranges and lemons which wakes my skin up. the PM lotion is calming, with a white tea scent. both lotions glide on great. I have only had them for two days, so i dont see a differece in my skin texture-- yet. I will update this in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> NOTHING has ever worked for me with the backs of my legs and cellulite. I found this on another one of my frantic google searches and read mainly positive reviews. This was my last shot. I have been using it for over a month now and I really think it&#x27;s working. My legs look a lot smoother. It&#x27;s not all gone, obviously, and I don&#x27;t expect it to ever completely disappear, but after a month, the results are definitely noticeable. I bought another set so I will be all ready for summer.</li>
            <li> This is the closest thing to a miracle product. I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s the ONLY thing that truly works. I use these with the Finulite cellulite smoothing massage mitt. I have gotten into a pretty good routine of using the mitt in the shower, then following-up with the AM/ PM cream when I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells amazing and makes my legs so smooth. A little goes a long way. I can see a difference. Hallelujah!</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I have ordered these creams. I found them to be really affective when used consistently. I was happy with the results so I ordered them for a second time, however this time I was pregnant and wanted to use them to reduce the large amounts of cellulite that became present during my pregnancy. I also ordered the soap and brush to help aid the cream and was pleased with results. After my pregnancy my cellulite subsided and I credit the products as well as my genes. I will definitely order again when I need assistance keeping any excessive cellulite at bay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on Day 20 and I am finally seeing drastic results! You have to be patient, your body needs to get used to the formula...I saw ZERO results after 2 Weeks and on Day 19 I thought I noticed a little improvement but I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure. Fast forward 24 Hours later and I see it, loud and clear. All of the unsightly cellulite that started appearing below my upper thigh and above my knees in recent years is GONE. I look toned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a size 0/XS/25 but skinny girls have cellulite too. I don&#x27;t work out; I&#x27;ve always had a fast metabolism (which I have noticed is starting to slow down on me in my mid-30s) and although I worked out briefly for periods of time in the past (10-15 years ago), I have suffered from cellulite since my mid-20s and it has progressively gotten worse over the past 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, the only products that really worked always ended up being discontinued - Avon CelluSculpt in the early 2000s and Avon Lipo AM/PM about 5 years ago or so, which had similar separate formulas for day and night which is what stood out about Finulite, but both Avon solutions disappeared almost as soon as I started using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year I tried The Body Shop&#x27;s Spa Fit collection, which seemed to work (but not as good as Finulite) if I kept using the Firming &amp; Toning Gel-Cream Massager daily and used the Toning Concentrate whenever I went out on the town (the effects of which washed off after showering or going in the water, so watch out when going to the beach with that one), finishing off the look with a drop of the Toning Massage Oil, but beware, all the SpaFit Body Shop products are yellow/orange in color, and they will stain your clothing yellow too, and leave wet marks on certain fabrics if you don&#x27;t wait for them to dry after application, especially the Toning Concentrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea&#x27;s Q10 Cellulite Serums and Gels, which I (which have now been renamed to remove the word Cellulite) didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I saw ZERO results with Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that all of these products MAY be legitimate cellulite-fighting formulas, but what works for some may not work for others. It probably has to do with how your body&#x27;s chemistry reacts with the ingredients in these formulas. That said, I am stocking up on Finulite after I write this because the first shipment of 3 sets I purchased expire 11/2016, which is a great, long shelf-life, and I want to make sure I cover my bases for this summer and beyond....plus the price point is great. No way I am paying department store prices for something I can get results with for around $20-$25 a set. Awesome. Happy happy happy! Figure I&#x27;ll need one set per month, but maybe a little more in the summertime. Good luck girls!!</li>
            <li> On my second bottles and love seeing the results! Skin is smoother, firmer and cellulite is disappearing, difinitely would recommend purchasing along with the mitt really helps. Need to do it everyday and you will see results!</li>
            <li> My husband bought me these moisturizing lotions for the first time, about a year ago, and now I buy them all the time. I am a research scientist, getting my PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology, and I can say that I very much like the ingredients in this product and am enjoying the results. I am 30 years old, very active, eat well, and overall, try to take good care of myself, but age usually prevails, and in the last few years I have noticed some imperfections emerging, and I wanted to take a proactive approach to improve my skin&#x27;s appearance and prevent future imperfections. So I use this product, almost every day. I like its texture. It is not greasy and it absorbs within a few minutes into my skin, and it does not come off on my clothing. It has a pleasant smell. My skin feels smoother and looks better, more glowing. I use it not only on my thighs and butt, but on my arms, stomach and other areas of my body too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keryn</li>
            <li> Did n I t work, used it am and pm as instructed, I even bought a body scrubber to maximize the skin absorption still nothing. I used it until the last drop, nothing happened :-( more money wasted.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did nothing for my stubborn cellulite, even after using it religiously morning and night for weeks on end.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great and makes your skin smoother and softer. After several weeks I am seeing a slight improvement of the tightness of the skin.</li>
            <li> Great when used with working out and eating right. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on its own without proper diet and exercise.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I he had some very noticeable improvement in the texture of my skin.  It does soften, smooth and minimize the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you but IT WORKED FOR ME!!! I first bought this product in May and just like so MANY others I began to see results in just a few days of using it. Two moths later most all of my cottage cheese thighs R gone. My skin is softer and firmer as well. I recently started applying it on my upper arms and I&#x27;m noticing results there as well.I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I&#x27;m now feeling confident enough to wear shorts in public something I haven&#x27;t done in years..I defenetly recommend these creams oh and there message brush mitt</li>
            <li> I started using this over the summer and think it works pretty well. It definitely dimishes the look of cellulite and leaves the area very smooth. I notice it works better when you are exercising and using the product at the same time. [[ASIN:B004WSXD4G Finulite - The End to Cellulite AM/PM (8 oz)]]</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for a while before leaving my review.  I used the Nivea cellulite serum for a long time and decided to give Finulite a try.  I used it for one month and then switched back to Nivea and I noticed the difference immediately.  So I ordered more Finulite on Amazon right away.  This product really does reduce cellulite and even firms your skin.  I do eat very healthy and work out at least 4 days a week.  I do not have a lot of cellulite but this has helped me out on the areas where I do have it.  Make sure you use it every day morning and night.  I rub it in and count to 30 for each section I am applying the cream to.  I also recommend putting the day time cream on before your workout.  I have noticed a significant decrease in my cellulite in my three months of using it.  Thank you finiulite!  I only wish you sold this in larger portions and offered it as an Amazon Prime product.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me whatsoever. And I&#x27;m thin, 103lbs, with just a little but of bumpiness on the backs and sides of my thighs and bottom.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if is really working or not until this moment; 2 months later, I think I need to drink more water, and use it every night and day, sometime Im working till 11 pm so when i come home, all I wanna do it sleep... Too bad, but give it a try, the first month I used it everyday and I see my skin more firm and soft...</li>
            <li> No cream will get rid of your cellulite, that is a sad realization for me. I used this religiously, even bought 2 months supply just incase....no hope. I work out and eat fairly well but there is the cellulite that only goes away when I go into crazy person mode working out 7 days a week and eating pure as pure can be. I was hoping for a little cream that could allow me to endulge every once in awhile without the fear of the cellulite being there....but its there, and its going to stay. :(</li>
            <li> I was afraid when I opened the package at 1st as I saw 2 tiny &amp; yet very expensive bottles inside. I was &amp; still am somewhat skeptical but I am also optimistic &amp; you never know if something is going to work for you or not if you don&#x27;t suck it up &amp; give a try. This is only the second day &amp; I will add on to this review after this trial, but I can already say something positive about this stuff. It smells great &amp; absorbs very quickly, my skin loves it &amp; already shows improvement in firmness &amp; smootheness. Hopefully the deep dimples &amp; bulges will smooth away over time with continued use &amp; massage, healthy diet &amp; excercise. No cellulite lotion is to bear all the wieght of cellulite removal entirely, but I can already tell that this is a formidable aide in my cellulite prevention &amp; treatment regime. I also bought the Delphin Anti-cellulite shorts too but haven&#x27;t used them yet. I certainly will tommorow after applying the am lotion, before hopping on my elliptical! I must say, if I am to continue to use this product, (no matter how great it is) the price needs to come down a little bit at least (without compromising quantity or quality of the product). I am not rich by any means &amp; today&#x27;s middle class income standards (based on ridiculous &amp; outlandish annual \\&quot;cost of living increases\\&quot;) are still considered rich to me lol! All women deserve to look &amp; feel their best regardless of status or income level!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 2013: Well I am back to say I did not experience as much a smoothing effect as i like. I still have the deep diples &amp; minor \\&quot;orange peel\\&quot; look. If I am to continue to use a product it has to be more effective than this.</li>
            <li> this product works  I ran out and switched to another product and noticed within weeks(in the target dressing room!) that I must reorder the finulite immediately.  I&#x27;m back on the road to smooth thighs!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells great, easy to apply, and you can see results within weeks. (about 3 weeks for me). Also this leaves your legs/body feeling SO SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with delfin spa pants and a dermaroller for max effect. I would completely recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce that cellulite appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for price, smell, smoothness, and RESULTS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 pairs of these bottles.  I believe that the cream has made a difference in reducing cellulite, tightening and smoothing my legs.  The cellulite has not disappeared but it has improved which is probably all we can ask for in a cream.  I&#x27;m happy with any improvement so plan to continue purchasing Finulite and using it. I&#x27;ve tried many other creams that have not seemed to make a difference over the years but feel this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how this product worked for the price! As long as you keep up with the regimine, you will most likely see results (obviously diet and exercise lifestyle is a must)! This is my second set of bottles I will be buying, and I&#x27;m thinking about the smoothing massage mitt as well...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly! This product works miracles! My cellulite is disappearing and it&#x27;s only been two weeks! I&#x27;m loving the results as the dimples on my bottom and thighs are smoothing out and firming up! I will definitely continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> This was my second order.  I was faithful with its use.  I work out regularly and am in good shape.  Zero results.  This does not work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> On my second set and I definitely see a difference.  My skin is a lot less dimpled.  Not perfect but for a cream and little to no exercise, I really cannot complain.  Smells nice, not overpowering.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical! But this product is amazing! It does exactly what it says it does. I am thrilled !</li>
            <li> This product couldn&#x27;t be simpler to use...purple bottle at night, pink in the morning.  I use them after showering &amp; it takes just a couple minutes, at most. Besides the difference I see (predominantly on my outer &amp; back upper thigh), their fragrance is fantastic.  Unlike every other cellulite cream I&#x27;d tried in the past (several!) that had a horrific menthol-y smell, these smell like an expensive body lotion!</li>
            <li> I have tried it every day for weeks and see NO DIFFERENCE in my skin. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since may 1 2011. I have lost a significant amount of weight so my cellulite was pretty bad. I have seen an over increase in my cellulite reduction in the last few months. Sometimes it is difficult for me to notice changes with my body so I ask my husband. We have a very close relationship and he gives his honest feedback. He told me the thought the cream was making a big difference. I noticed more definition and tone in my legs. My husband also liked the light citrus fragrance. It does make your skin very soft and smooth. I would recommend this product. I bought due to the high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently bought a new cellulite cream by a different company. I am interested to see if their is a difference. I plan on reporting back the details.</li>
            <li> I am a slender 31 year old, 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and 110lbs, yet, I have cellulite. I have it on the backs of my thighs and the front just above the knee. I think the area above my knees bothers me most because in the summer I wear shorts everyday and I don&#x27;t want to wear them down to my knees. I&#x27;ve tried other products and even running and working out 5 days a week. Nothing helped. The only thing to help smooth the lumps and dimpled look is Finulite. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 months now. It hasn&#x27;t all disappeared, but I&#x27;ve been about an 85% improvement. My legs are much smoother and I no longer feel embarrassed about wearing shorts or even a bathing suit. I&#x27;ll be a Finulite user for life!</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite for about 8 months and I love it! This product works better than any other like it, that I&#x27;ve tried. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t particularly care for the new scent.</li>
            <li> Used this product all spring and summer with some noticeable results as to making my skin more firm and reducing the appearance of cellulite. However, I would advise to use in conjunction with exercise and a sensible diet, which created a solid combination for me for good results.  I&#x27;m not sure what the results of this product would be on it&#x27;s own, but for me, finulite worked well in this combination. A good value for a cream that&#x27;s effective when compared to other creams on the market (as I&#x27;ve tried plenty !). I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I liked this product from the very first day. First of all it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and combined with massage twice a day it really seems to work. Second of all it smells great and the ingredient content is amazing. I have had celulite for few years now. Don&#x27;t expect change right away thought. I saw a difference after a month of using the product. I keep using it still. It is my second month now and I believe in a long run it will help me get rid of most of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months. I did notice a difference with firming of my skin and it did help reduce the appearance of cellulite.  You just have to use it on a regular basis to maintain these results as it is only a topical application.  If you can&#x27;t afford to have the cellulaze treatment, this is a good, temporary fix.</li>
            <li> I used this product day and night.  No difference for me.  I look exactly the same as if I&#x27;ve never used any product to reduce any cellulite.  If you want to see a change, try Nivea&#x27;s product.  I decided to try something different because this had some positive reviews.  I even paired it with the needle brush.  NOPE.  Only painful legs with no change at all.  I realize cellulite is very difficult to get rid of. It not only involves rubbing with product, but it also involves changing your diet and exercise habits.  Do not think for one moment that using this product alone will make any difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have tried other products and they don&#x27;t even come close to the results of this one. Along with  some patience, a good diet and excercise the results are great.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have noticed SOME change in the way my nastiness looks, however, it&#x27;s not as drastic as others have mentioned in their reviews. I&#x27;m also dieting and exercising daily (hardcore like elliptical &amp; stepper for 45 minutes not feeble 15 minute walks or anything) so I expected it to work better. Also, the bottles have so little product for the price. I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I&#x27;m one of those people who will try just about anything that could potentially improve my appearance, even if I feel that the likelihood that it will work is very small. I&#x27;ve read tons of articles saying that cellulite creams are a waste of money, and yet I stupidly bought this product anyway. Well, I purchased this in conjunction with the Finulite smoothing massage mitt. For the past month, I have taking between 5-10 minutes per day to massage each cream into my skin. My cellulite was not incredibly horrible to begin with, but after a month, it&#x27;s nearly gone. Yes, gone!! Was it the massaging mitt? Was it the cream? Was it the combination of both?? Who cares! This product is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd set of Finulite &amp; can say that there&#x27;s a noticible difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend to others. Great smell too.</li>
            <li> Doesnt do a thing...  nivea concentrated firmimg serum is 100x better and only costs $9.  I believed the reviews but am learning that many no name companies give free products, etc... for ppsitive reviews.  Wish it worked but no.such luck...  going to try clarins next and go back to my nivea until then</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It REALLY works! I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months now and I can see an &#x27;infinite&#x27; difference!!! Just use each morning and night! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I am 2 months into using this product and it does wonders. I took a before picture of the back of my legs (scary stuff) and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if this stuff actually worked. I&#x27;ve been losing weight over the past few years but the backs of my legs and outer thighs still had dimples regardless of how much muscle I gained. Although it is a bit more time consuming to get ready in the morning and for bed (I&#x27;m usually up and out the door in 10 minutes and am not used to spending extra time to just put on lotion) it is well worth it. I apply it with the Smoothing Massage Mitt *don&#x27;t use it in the shower, the water will get inside it and you&#x27;ll spend and extra 20 minutes after trying to shake the water out*, but you can FEEL IT WORKING! And it smells so great! I have noticed my skin firming up a bit and can tell a slight improvement over the past month. I am eager to see how great my skin can look after further usage! Obviously, results won&#x27;t come over night. Just like with every thing else that&#x27;s good in life, you have to be patient and keep at it. So far, I have tried numerous lotions and remedies for cellulite and nothing works like this product does. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several creams that claimed to get rid of cellulite for good, but never had any luck with them. I won&#x27;t name names, but some of them smell bad and flake when they dry.  Then I decided to try Finulite, and I actually started to see some results within the first two months.  I&#x27;ve cellulite all my life, so I don&#x27;t expect it to go away overnight, but I&#x27;m starting to see smoother skin on my knees, thighs, and upper arms.  And my legs appear to be thinner even though I haven&#x27;t changed my diet or exercise routine.  An added bonus is that Finulite absorbs quickly and smells great.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I followed directions on this product. The only thing it did for me was moisturize. There was no visible reduction of cellulite. It did not \\&quot;shrink\\&quot; or \\&quot;eliminate\\&quot; any cellulite whatsoever. I fell for the empty promises advertising. This product does NOT do what it claims it can do.</li>
            <li> I used this so far for a month I must say works well, but of course I&#x27;ve been doing my part with walking and light jogging , but the appearance of cellulite is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The title says it all, this product works alright, but I had significantly better results with the Bliss products. But, if you want a less expensive product, this one does work, just not as well.</li>
            <li> I got this about a week ago. The smell is alright. Its citrus like - kind of like the smell of a vitamin C supplement but lighter. I feel like it works to soften the skin nicely and stimulate the areas - theophylline and theobromine are used in medicine for this type of stuff (google it), so that makes sense. The other ingredients make sense too - cyclic AMP is interesting since the alkaloids in this products, cAMP and the adenosine receptor are inter-related.  cAMP is (c&#x3D; cyclic) involved in cell signaling pathways - you should Google that. I would like a more thorough explanation of how its used in this product specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are small and if you get a bad packaging job you are likely to loose half of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science stuff:&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I find the most intriguing about this product is that they advertise theophylline *from green tea (also in cocoa beans aka chocolate). In the past I found the analog of this compound in 60% cocoa chocolate bar from the grocery store (theobromine) and at the time I was not looking for theophylline but since they are structural analogs the second peak in my chromatogram may have been that compound (smaller amount) - I did not have the standard at the time for both compounds. They are all alkaloids. In other words these are not special compounds in terms of rarity. Caffeine is a homologue of these - (has an extra methyl group on one of the nitrogens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note is that aminophylline is theophylline + 2 ethylenediamine and this formulation makes theophylline more water soluble - I suppose for medicinal purposes to increase solubility and therefore bio-availability (google it). Think about it like a salt or when you get a drug it says the drug name followed by a dot and then HCL. If you have questions about that let me know. I am not sure why that detail is relevant to this product and the purpose of its use. Explanation is welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review with +/- stars later after I use it longer -- and if there is interest I can find out how much theophylline is in natural chocolate. I don&#x27;t know the answer to this now, but what if you could get the same kind of results by melting chocolate on your body? That sounds like a lot more fun!r after I use it longer -- and if there is interest I can find out how much theophylline is in natural chocolate. I don&#x27;t know the answer to this now, but what if you could get the same kind of results by melting chocolate on your body? That sounds like a lot more fun!</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me. I was diligent about using it morning and evening. It was worth a try but I think diet and exercises work better for me. I just wanted an easy fix. Glad though that it works for some people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months. I have alot smoother thighs and have lost iches. .  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as to getting this but I decided to give it a try. I rubbed this on my stomach area, love handles, and back fat and may I say that within three weeks, I saw results!! It&#x27;s amazing! The bottles are small but they last about a month and I just ordered me a new set! Don&#x27;t expect for all the cellulite to be gone within a month because cellulite builds up over time so it&#x27;s going to take some patience! :) I am going to keep using this product for a LOOOOOOONG TIME!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you Finulite! I have spent years looking for a decent cellulite creme that was not full of chemicals &amp; left my skin soft, smooth &amp; nourished, not sticky!! Well, i finally found it in this product. Its great on all accounts!</li>
            <li> This is the best product EVER! Fortunately my cellulite isn&#x27;t bad, but it has made it almost completely disappear! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Firstly, this isn&#x27;t going to cause miracles. Nothing is. As cellulite is probably mostly genetic there&#x27;s not a quick fix. It amazes me how embarrassed we as women are about it, and anything which gives me a little more confidence whenever I have to go home to Australia and face the beach is a plus for me. The only thing which has ever made a dramatic difference for me is very intensive, strength-based exercise (ballet, pilates, etc. Strangely not running or diet changes.) And even that isn&#x27;t permanent, you have to keep it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However as far as smoothing and strengthening my skin goes, I have noticed results with this product and I will keep using it for the foreseeable future in the hope that combined with exercise I&#x27;ll finally feel better about bikinis. I don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight and I&#x27;m prepared to keep at it - and for such a great price you can&#x27;t really go wrong!</li>
            <li> I can not tell any difference since I purchased these product :(. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product ..... I sure wished I didn&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Finulite! Now, I won&#x27;t lie and say it completely gets rid of your cellulite, but this is honestly the only product I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve even noticed a difference in the firmness of my skin, and the reduction of cellulite on my butt and thighs. I spent money on numerous products ranging from $5.00 to $30 to paying in the $100s for the laser cellulite treatment (which I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference afterwards). I highly recommend Finulite to anyone with stubborn cellulite. Remember, you can&#x27;t completely get rid of your cellulite, though diet and exercise will also help with that, but Finulite will drastically reduce the appearance of your cellulite, as long as you use it every morning and night. I also highly recommend getting the massage mitt. It&#x27;s great and helps work the product into your skin!</li>
            <li> I am a mature guy and I have always used anti-fat/cellulite creams in order to reduce the fat I have at the sides of my belly. These creams work just perfect, there is one for the night and another for the morning. I normally use them after my working out and I can see the difference. My body is more firm and tight. The customer service is also great. I had a problem with my order and they just solved it in a day. Totally recommended! :-)</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchase these products. For last time, I did not consistently apply them on my body, so I did not observe significant change of my body shape. Since last Monday, I tried to apply them on my body everyday, two times a week. Also, I exercised two hours a day. After one week, my waist size reduced 1.5 centimeters. I&#x27;m not overweight, so 1.5 centimeters was a big progress for me. I&#x27;m soooo glad I chose these products, I strongly recommend it. If you consistently use them, keep exercise and eat healthy, you will see the change. Just try them! ^-^</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks only and I have seen no change but this bottle should last another month or two so we&#x27;ll see what happens in the meantime, I&#x27;m hoping but seeing as cellulite hasn&#x27;t been able to be effectively treated by any product, my hopes aren&#x27;t high, oh well!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for about 3 weeks now but I am starting to slowly see some results. I am not able to give the product 5 stars yet, Still too early to tell. But what i am most impressed with is the customer service from the company that distibutes the product.  I placed an order and received the wrong product by mistake. Hey mistakes happen, we are all human so it was not a big deal. When I contacted the company, Kandance responded very quickly and sent the correct product out promptly.  Good customer service is hard to come by these days  so I really appreciated their help with the mix up.</li>
            <li> ,after reading all the reviews I decided to try finulite, the first thing I do when I received it was take a before picture after they apply the cream and I did a 10 minute exercise, My thighs was the target, after 3 days I took another picture and noticed it was toning. So I know this will work, ill come back in a couple weeks with more info.  But you must excerise and use as directed, you will see results.</li>
            <li> this is great stuff and smells wonderful unlike other anti cellulite creams.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this stuff, because the reviews I read before I purchased it sounded promising. I didn&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite, but enough to make me want to do something about it before swimsuit and short shorts season this year. I did some research and based on what got the best reviews I bought this. This stuff smells great, that I will say. And I used it every morning after I showered And every night before bed until it was gone. It made my skin feel soft and smell nice, unlike other creams of this kind...but sadly it did not reduce even the minimal amount of cellulite I was hoping to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I have always had cellulite since I was 18 (i&#x27;m now 28) and I have tried almost everything. I saw this and read the reviews and was hopeful. I ordered it and used it like I was supposed to and it didn&#x27;t do anything miraculous..it worked the same as the lower price cellulite cream (i.e. Nivea&#x27;s Goodbye Cellulite or St. Ive&#x27;s Cellulite Shield). Plus the bottles are way too small for the price.</li>
            <li> Cellulite runs in my family, and while I have always been relatively fit, the last few years (I turn 47 next week) I&#x27;ve been less active, and have noticed a lot of cellulite building on my thighs.  Very noticeable, and has kept me from wearing shorts many times this past summer.  While nothing substitutes for losing fat and gaining muscle in order to control cellulite, I know even that doesn&#x27;t guarantee its total elimination, so in advance of starting a new diet/exercise routine on Jan 1, 2013, I purchased Finulite after doing COPIOUS amounts of research on cellulite solutions (from other creams to various types of laser surgery, which wasn&#x27;t an option for me at this time due to cost), and began using is just before the 1st of the year (this is important to note, because the results cannot be attributed to the new routine, as I hadn&#x27;t been doing it long enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, and I was doubtful that a topical solution could really achieve much results, but WOW, this stuff really is working!!  I&#x27;ve been pretty consistent with the am/pm routine, and I did buy and use an inexpensive cellulite massager which I use after the pm application, but I&#x27;ve missed a time or two.  Regardless, I have seen a big difference in the appearance of my legs.  Definitely less lumpy, and my skin is FAR smoother and tighter, and the appearance of the cellulite, which not entirely gone (especially on the back of my thighs), has noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product 5 Stars, and I might come back and do just that after I&#x27;ve finished up the bottles (I&#x27;m barely two weeks into using the stuff!), but I want to track the results over a longer period of time before I make any further judgements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone searching for a non-invasive cellulite reducer.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I have been using this product for 8 months now. This is the only product and I have used many, that has actually made a Huge difference. The dimples on my legs have diminshed. This is the best product in the market! \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other cellulite creams over the years, without much success.  I really like the results I am getting with this cream. It definitely tightens the skin and lessens the appearance of cellulite.  I have only been using it for about a month and a half.  I am going to continue using it and hopefully it will continue to improved.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I don&#x27;t review things but if it will help someone save then I will write a review. I am Adrican Anerican . It might just not work for my skin type , but I used it religiously. Still didn&#x27;t see a difference .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done endermologie treatments and have also used several creams to try and tackle my cellulite issues and this is by far the most affordable system that yields results. I&#x27;ll def. be using this product for at least the warm months of the year from here on out!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use twice daily and massage well into skin to improve circulation!</li>
            <li> I have used this about a week, and I can see tighter firmer skin already. I am happy so far</li>
            <li> I used this product for a week and I got an amazing result, I see that my cellulite reduced. I have suffered from cellulite for years, and now I am happy that I can end it by using this product. I would like to recommend it to who has the same my problem. it is soooo awesome</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t take any before or after pictures but I think I can see a difference. I didn&#x27;t have that much cellulite before but now I&#x27;ve barely nothing, but I&#x27;ve lost a little weight also so that&#x27;s also a contributor.&lt;br /&gt;I really LOVE the smell the lotions so even if it doesn&#x27;t work with the cellulite I would almost still buy it just for the smell :P</li>
            <li> I Have Had Cellulite For Many YEars Since I Was Young And Ive Tried MANY Products&lt;br /&gt;&amp; Honestly This Product Is AMAZING! I Have Given It 5 Stars Because IT REALLY DOES WORK!&lt;br /&gt;I Ordered This Product and It Lasted Me 3 Weeks Due To The Fact That I Have Very Big Thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I Have Already Ordered My New Set Which Arrived Today! Im So Excited To Keep On Using Because The Appearance Of&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite Has Extremely Diminished And Also the Skin On My thighs And Buttocks Feels A lot Firmer!&lt;br /&gt;I Really Recommend This  Product To Anyone Who Has Had Trouble With Cellulite&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Think about It Just Buy It! You Will Be amazed By The Results The Only Thing I Don&#x27;t Like Is The Size Of The Bottles&lt;br /&gt;Since I Have Very Big Thighs I Wish They Had Bigger Bottles Of This Stuff!!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent! Ever since I was in my early teens I have been plagued with cellulite even with being only 130 pounds throughout my teen years. Now that I am a 20 year old college student that has tried almost every over the counter cellulite treatment, I am so relieved that Finulite has actually given me a break on cellulite. After one months use and about a week in on my second bottles, I have noticed serious results as my thighs have smoothed out and seem firmer. I am more comfortable going out in shorts and not feel self-conscious among all the other cellulite free girls on my college campus. Finulite has given me the peace of mind I needed this summer. I also bought the smoothing mitt that I try to use once a day that seems to have aided my cellulite removal process. Overall, Finulite is a must buy for women with cellulite!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT EVER!!!~ I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT USING FINULITE~ CELLULITE CREAM.BUT&lt;br /&gt;IT REALLY WORKS. PLEASE GET YOURS TODAY!!!! FAST RESULTS (ALL SMILES).</li>
            <li> I started using this product around April 10 so it has been around a month. I started to see some improvement in the structure of my skin, it seems a little smoother. I am 32 years old, 117 pounds, 5&#x27;2, very active but all my life i had cellulite in my upper thighs. I am also working out about 5 days per week and incorporating weight training in my routine. I have read many reviews of other customers that have used it for several weeks/months and have noted a significant improvement. I will continue to use this cream for 2 more months to evaluate its results, I took pictures of before for comparing in the future. If this eliminates or significantly decreases my cellulite I will be a faithful customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> I have not faithfully applied this as instructed.. But I might say they both smell so good. I have not paid attention to see if my cellulite has diminished, but I do love the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last week. I have lost over 135lbs with diet and exercise in 12 months and am quite unhappy with how my skin has been left. I have leftover cellulite areas and stretch marks that make me feel very insecure. I bought this product with the massaging brush. I have sensitive skin so it did bruise me a little the first 2 days - but I followed the instructions per the bottle and massager and I see a noticeable difference in just days. The stretch marks have faded and my skin is improving and shrinking all over. And no I am not a paid advertiser or a BOT - I&#x27;m a regular country girl and mother from Oregon. If you can follow directions and commit 10 minutes a day to the treatment you will see results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and I&#x27;m seeing amazing results.  I was skeptical about buying any cellulite reduction cream but this one definitely changed my mind! With consistent application and patience, there will be results.  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many of my friends and I plan on continuing to use it. The quality, cheap price and results make it all worth while!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about a month (not as faithful with nightly application as I should be), but overall can definitely see firmness in the areas applied and less noticeable cellulite dimples.  Hoping for great results with continued use paired with my exercise routine.  Product has a pleasant smell and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  Would recommend this combo to a friend.</li>
            <li> I am now about halfway through my 2nd order.  I am definitely seeing an improved appearance.  The back of my legs appear smoother and I can no longer see any dimpling on my stomach.  I will keep using this to see if my legs get even better.  I do wish the frangrance was a softer scent.  I might even wear shorts this summer...it&#x27;s been years since I have.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing a cellulite cream at first, but after reading some positive reviews I decided to give Finulite a try. I have been using it for about a month and a half, and have seen a noticable reduction in the cellulite on the back of my legs! I am 28 years old, and I run 5 times a week. After having my son 2 years ago, the small amount of cellulite I had got dramatically worse, and eating healthy and exercising just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I recently ordered the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mit, and can&#x27;t wait to use it as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll make these products work even better. I highly recommend to anyone with this same problem.</li>
            <li> Ok about the product, it works very very good. I can definitely say that it helped me with my cellulite. BUT i am using 5 different things. 1. I reduced the carbohydrates in my meals almost at all 2. i work out, i run 2-3 miles (run/walk fast with my capris) and do yoga. 3. I took 3 pills per day of something to help to drain the water of your body and help with the cellulite 4. I use this cream in the morning and in the night, and i do some massage in my legs. and 5. i use a capri that i bought in amazon to make my sweat and help with cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think all this work better together that believe that you will get that you want sit on the couch doing nothing. Run for what you want!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes my skin super soft the moment it is put on and keeps it that way all day! It seems to do wonders for tone and am loving it and will buy again! It may be costly ladies but compared to the stuff in supermarkets or chemists in the UK it actually works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and I do see a 30% improvement in my cellulite. I don&#x27;t use it everyday and when I do use it I only use it once a day, sometimes twice. If I used it as recommend I think that I would defiantly see better results and I Also like the smell of these creams.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I am sticking to it because I see it working, you have to be consistant and use it daily. My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> I first stumbled upon finulite while on Amazon searching for creams for the cellulite. I found this particular one, reading the information on it it seemed like a good idea to try. Now the bottle said it takes up to five weeks to start noticing the changes so of course the results didn&#x27;t show right away but after about five weeks or so I spotted some changes. My skin became more tighter and healthy looking. The cottage cheese look on my thighs began to disappear slowly and surely enough it became a HUGE improvement over the months I&#x27;ve been using this product. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone wanting to get rid of their cellulite of doom. Mine sure did!</li>
            <li> Got product very fast been using about 10 days on stomach area no results so far maybe to early to review update been using on stomach about 5 wks a little improvement but not much i will purchase one more time to see if its going to work</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a guy but have some cellulite problems from working out and losing too much weight too fast. They&#x27;re mostly in my buttocks and upper thigh. I randomly stumbled across this product on amazon and bought it just to experiment because I figure the price was pretty reasonable. I&#x27;m currently on my second set and I can say that I think they make a difference in the appearance of the cellulite. Following the bi-daily application, they&#x27;re not as visible and leaves your skin feeling smooth. Also a plus is that they don&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy afterwards. A minor complaint I may have though is the scent; both AM and PM bottles have a very distinct flowery, sweet scent. I guess if you like the fragrant smell then they are good for you. It doesn&#x27;t bother me too much though. Anyway, I would recommend at least giving it a try before you move on to other products.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple good reviews, I decided to try for myself. The product does smell great (both Am and PM), very easy to apply, not greasy at all. It does do the job of making orange peel looking skin look smoother and firmer within a week of applications, but definitely need to use it all the time. You stop for a few days, and it seems the effect is gone.. For the price though, anybody can afford to use it, so overall - very positive experience.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using this product.  So far, I like it... not sure as to how much it is working yet.  Very fast shipping.  Product just as described.</li>
            <li> This is the best cellulite treatment I have ever used.  I have used various products over the years...Loreal, Nivea, really expensive ones.  They all tend to dry out my skin.  I love the texture of Finullite, it feels very hydrating and smooth as it absorbs into my skin.  I have been using it almost daily for the last 3 months and really see results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite creams and Finulite by far is the very best, I will continue to use it and recommend to everyone I know who is looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend last month and we can definitely see improvement since she has started using it. The only downside I can really see is that the bottles are a little small and you could easily run out quick if you are using lots of the lotion at once.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product after seeing all the hype from the other reviews. I have been using it for 3 weeks and been working out 4 times a week and dont see any difference in appearance or firmness. I am quite small already and only have a little cellulite (i would give it 2/10) and was shocked to see no difference seeing as i have used it every day correctly. Don&#x27;t have high expectations for this product.  Im going to buy another bottle and hope for best only because its cheap compared to other creams.</li>
            <li> I only used these creams for 2 days when I woke up itching one day, and had a red, splotchy rash, everywhere I rubbed this cream in. All over the back of my legs and sides. I had to go to my dermatologist and he had to give me a prescription for it! I spent over $60 to get rid of this itchy, irritating rash. He even said these creams were old and told me to stop using them immediately. Contacted the company to return these, and they send me a return label where I have to pay to ship them back! All these reviews are fake. Just like the product they are selling. Stay away from this stuff! Total loss here.</li>
            <li> Just got it this week and checking it out. So far so good. I will keep you posted if I see results soon. I use it with a massager which should help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cellulite lotions in the past and couldn&#x27;t stick to it because they didn&#x27;t absorb well and/or didn&#x27;t notice a difference after several months of use. This stuff smells great, absorbs really fast, and WORKS! I can throw it on and go! I have severe cellulite, so it&#x27;s not gone, but it has made a dramatic difference in just one month. My skin has smoothed out and the dimples are not as deep as they used to be. My skin feels softer and has regained elasticity. I have already started on my second set and plan to continue using it along with a sensible diet and regular exercise.</li>
            <li> I recently started to get a layer of cellulite on my legs and purchased this product based on some promising reviews. I used the lotion faithfully (as directed: morning and night, on an empty stomach) until both bottles were empty (approximately a month). I saw absolutely no change in my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to be patient - the process takes time. But after a full 8 oz of nothing I am not foolish enough to buy another round.</li>
            <li> I bought this product some time ago (like a year or so). I have used it a few times. I am going to put it to use since I am working out on a regular now. I will post another review soon. I hope all is well since most of the reviews are so positive!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It really worked for me... In a few weeks I and my boyfriend noticed that my cellulitis was almost completely gone. I bought it as gift for my mom and sister and they also loved it. The product smells great, has a nice texture and is quickly delivered. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Expensive, great cream, very little quantity.</li>
            <li> I have been using finulite  for about 2 months  now and can tell the difference. my legs feel smooth and tight  . I like the smell of this lotion ,  I think the price  is fair, for what It does , as for my cellulite  I still see some of it  there , I guess it takes time . will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;I am 45 years old, stand 5&#x27;2, and weigh 120 lbs. Despite working out (lifting weights &amp; cardio), I&#x27;ve struggled with cellulite for many years. In the last year or so, I ended a very stressful, ugly relationship. The reason I make mention of that is because in my despair, I started eating way too much fatty, sugared foods, which increased the amount of cellulite I have as well as the area it is located. No longer was the cellulite on my rear thighs, but had moved around to the sides of my legs (saddlebags). Some months ago, while putting lotion on my legs, I noticed I&#x27;ve got it just about everywhere now. I&#x27;ve tried many different serums, patches, or antidotes and as expected, nothing worked. I decided to purchase the Finulite because it had some good reviews. I was skeptical the reviews may have been generated by the company but wasn&#x27;t entirely sure and hoped they weren&#x27;t. I purchased two sets on my first order and I am nearly half way through the second set. I was looking in the mirror earlier this week and kept looking back at my legs and rear and turning the lights on and off for optimal lighting, wondering if my eyes were deceiving me or if some of my cellulite actually was reduced. Of course, I still have cellulite (I wish something worked that great!!) but I swear it has reduced. I keep looking everyday, as we all do, and am hoping it continues to diminish. I just purchased my second set of four bottles and will continue to use. Getting old stinks and watching my body turn to jello is such a terrible experience; I&#x27;m doing my best to fight back! Thanks Finulite. I&#x27;ll update my progress again in a few months.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend to anyone . Wish I could get a refund on purchase as product did not do as promised when used as directed</li>
            <li> The effects are of course temporary but these 2 lotions do smooth slight areas of cellulite. I havent figured out how to use this along with self tanner though to be fully summer ready!</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about purchasing cellulite lotions, because most are fraudulent and useless products. The only reason I gave this one a shot was because of all the positive reviews. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I am half way through my first set of lotion and I can already see a noticeable change in my problem areas. The severity of the cellulite has decreased, the skin is smoother and firmer. I showed my mom the results and I am now ordering her finulite too.</li>
            <li> As a consumer that has used many cellulite creams this has to be by far the worst. I was expecting a bit more considering their web site was so convincing. But honestly combining the nivea gel cream and serum works 20x better than this and is still less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i purchase this product, it really works. I only been using this product for two weeks and my skin get more firm and smooth. It is very easy to use and i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received my second bottles!&lt;br /&gt;Loving the results... my skin feels super smooth and the cellulite on my legs are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The creams smells lovely and I would buy this over and over again!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;worth the money!</li>
            <li> It helped hydrate my skin, which IS part of hiding cellulite since hydration plumps your skin. It also made my skin super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t work for cellulite. Can be used just as a lotion with nice essence. But too price to be a normal lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover I just got an email from some &#x27;Pete&#x27; blaming my comment as fake. So, Dear Pete, from the product company,I want to tell you that I have cellulite and I have used the product which didn&#x27;t work at all. Its very unprofessional and rude to blame your customer by emailing them that--\\&quot;your review is fake.\\&quot; Rather you could have just said that it may not work for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with your company.</li>
            <li> I never noticed any difference at all using these.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products to battle my cellulite and it seemed like all the ones I tried just were funky lotions and creams. Finally after searching on amazon for cellulite products I found Finulite, and all the reviews seemed promising so I tried it! I am glad that I trusted the reviews because it really does work, you have to be strict when using it, following the day and night regime but it becomes an easy routine.  I have seen great results, it has not all gone away but I am going to stick to it, this is my second time purchasing this product so that should speak for itself!  The only thing that is a tiny negative is that the bottles are so small but other then that I would defiantly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment I have ever had. I have tried different kinds of creams and lotions through the years and even the most expensive ones didn&#x27;t work at all. With finulite you feel your skin really nourished with the first application, the smell is great and it is a very convenient format</li>
            <li> I have used every product out there but this one is my favorite.  I think I like the fact that since there is an AM and PM it reminds me to put it on in the morning and at night.  I have added a leg and butt workout in the last year to my gym regiment along with using this product and I feel those two combined things has made a big difference.  I have used this product for over 2 yrs now...it is my go to item even as a moisturizer and never am out of stock!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream with the Finulite massager. So far so good! I do notice a difference in cellulite appearance already, not a huge difference, but it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks of usage. It can only get better from here  :-)</li>
            <li> Use as instructed and faithfully and you will be amazed .. so far it is working just as they say it should .. I will not be caught without this ! .. LOVE LOVE LOVE !</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I was hopeful this would help but I have used three quarters of these creams and am yet to see any results at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, both AM/PM and used it for 3 months.  It smells fantastic!  It makes your skin very soft; however, it does not appear to take away cellulite.  I am reordering it simply for the fragrance and the softening properties.  Maybe in 6 more months my cellulite will disappear?  This is probably wishful thinking. So far, no reduction in BUMPS. For the summer I use a tinted cream which visually makes a difference....but the bumps are still there.  good luck to all...........</li>
            <li> Hopefully this is a product that will work. Have not use it yet, plan to use with the Micro Needle Roller Skin Care Dermatology System.</li>
            <li> Finulite is the best treatment I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used different and expensive creams before with no results, but after using Finulite for for 2 weeks I started noticing changes and now after 2 months I would say about 75% is gone from my legs and tights.  The product is more than simple to use and in combination with the Finulite Massage Mitt it feels like is working even faster. This product is amazing, I HIGHLY recommend it..</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering Finulite and it really works. The first time I ordered the product I ordered two sets which lasted approximately six weeks and I saw results.  So I just order two more sets.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this is that the bottles are so small, that by the time it starts working, you&#x27;ve run out....But not a bad product and i&#x27;ll probably re order</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, never really saw as big of a difference as when I used the Nivea brand. Oh well. At least I tried it</li>
            <li> I really like the way both lotions smell- clean and citrus based. I have noticed smoother skin when I use both lotions every day (pink in the am, purple in the pm) but when I stopped using it for a couple days, i noticed my ripples going back to where they were. I like the texture and smell and do notice a smoothing effect.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these products and I&#x27;ve only used them 2x so I don&#x27;t know how good the results are yet but I am gonna continue to use them. I will say that this has been the best experience thru Amazon yet!!!!! I was promised my product on a certain day and it got to my home earlier than expected!!!!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the experience! I will def buy again from this company if I like the product!!!!!!!! Thank you and I would highly recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> i use this a.m and p.m .i been using it for quite sometime now and i will continue to use it as long as they sale it.</li>
            <li> I have been using finulite for about 3 months (not every day unfortunately, I was travelling) and I can tell the difference. My legs feel smooth and tight. I should use it properly to have a better result .... so maybe this month I will have more time.&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to use: purple bottle at night, pink in the morning.</li>
            <li> excellent product, thanks for your service!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works really well. It didn&#x27;t completely remove my cellulite but it does WAY better than anything else on the market and DEFINITELY reduces cellulite A LOT as well as improving overall skin tone.</li>
            <li> This sistema it didn&#x27;t work form me</li>
            <li> No improvement that I can see</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t do nothing at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice, and I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve seen results. I think maybe a little, but not as much as other people who have reviewed. I put it on regularly every morning and every night. For the first 4 weeks I used the cream in tandem with a massager because I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s helpful. In all, the results are minimal. Lotion smells nice and lasts a little over a month, so you may have to reorder for best results. I may order one more time just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review my purchases bc i rather not waste my time BUT I just had to come rave about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now &amp; have noticed a great improvement! Of course I still have some cellulite but the huge craters that had tormented me for so long had dissappeared! At this price it is worth a shot!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and different articles I decided to give Finulite a try.  I also purchased a Der ma-roller to aid in my effort to beat the cellulite.  I have been losing roughly 3 lbs a week and have lost a total of 67 lbs so far.  I started using Finulite approximately 3 weeks ago.  SO far it has made my skin tighter and so soft!  Much of my stretch marks are visibly gone.  My arms look amazing, and my stomach is greatly improving. I have about 73 lobs to go until my goal weight.  I plan to use Finulite to combat sagging skin.  I believe in this product in conjuncture with a VERY healthy diet, and regular exersize.  I go to the gym 3 days a week, and follow a strict diet as well as takeing vitamin&#x27;s and Vitamin B shots.  I feel healthy and much more fit, this cream has helped my eyes see what my body has done.  Losing this much weight is great but seeing results is keeping me going! I love this product. The smell is pretty good, and in conjuncture with results it is nice to find a product that I believe in.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item because of the main ingredients and positive product reviews--hoping I would see results. It has been only a week and I can already see changes with the smoothness of my legs! I was so pleased with the subtle changes already that I immediately purchased 2 more orders of the set so that I would have it available without running out. It has only been a week and I am confident the results will only continue to get better! I have used other products in the past, but I am very happy with the results of Finulite thus far and plan to continue using it! It is a part of my daily morning and evening routine! Looking forward to more Finulite.....and more results!</li>
            <li> What a great product!!&lt;br /&gt;I am now past my 40&#x27;s and I work out incessantly. I have tried many products to help me with the cellulite on my gluts but have had no luck. A friend of mine who swears by Finulite turned me on to the pm cream when I told her about that stubborn cellulite on my butt!! I saw results within the first week of using it! I have been using both your am and pm creams for a month now and I am addicted! Thanks for an amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Finulite AM/PM for about 2 months now. I have to admit that it has been the most effective anti-cellulite combat I have come across. I saw smoother and worth noting pump-free skin within the first two weeks of use. I have had no skin irritation or any other unpleasant experience with the product consistency and smell. I only use a small amount in the areas of interest while massaging and the product is absorbed very fast. Using the AM in the morning and the PM at night is much less of a cumbersome ritual than I first thought. It is just a matter of an everyday routine.</li>
            <li> I am usually a sceptic when it comes to all of these \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; creams but decided to give this one a try because all of the great reviews! I was really surprised on how quickly I began to notice results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it really felt as if my skin was tightening and smoothing itself out. I used this before I went to palm springs (hello bikini weather!!) and in conjunction with this and exercising (also watching what I ate) In one month I felt completely comfortable In my bikini which I never do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however...I did notice that once I ran out of this lotion that my legs (problem area) slowly started to look the way they did pre-lotion.</li>
            <li> Used both every day and see no difference whatsoever and I&#x27;m a guy that exercises everyday.  I have little on tops of thighs that should easily burn but doesn&#x27;t.  Snake oil, it is.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews others have posted on this product and was so happy and excited to finally see a cream that really seemed to work for people.  Sad to say it did absolutely nothing for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little less than 2 months now and nothing has changed. I look exactly the same as i did when i started using it. I have cellulite on the back of thighs and butt. Its such a let down to think if it worked for so many it must work for you and see absolutely 0% change.  Dont bother wasting your money.</li>
            <li> Finulite is truly a wonderful product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for some time now.  My cellulite has been pretty bad practically all my life, but now there is a great improvement.  It makes you legs thinner.  I don&#x27;t know how, but it does work.  I feel that with time my cellulite will completely disappear.  I use a small amount (approximately one tablespoon per leg) and massage it into my legs for about two minutes until the product disappears. It has a pleasant smell and feels silky good. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a cellulite problem. With proper exercise, diet and this product cellulite can be a thing of the past. Even without the diet and exercise the product works very well. Thank you Finulite!  Thanks for showing up in my lifetime!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. it really helped allot for my cellulite. its so good i ordered it twice! I can actually notice the changes. i recommend it 100%!</li>
            <li> I had read some fabulous reviews about this cream so I decided to give it a try! I half hearted thought I was wasting my money but Finulite has proved me wrong!! This cream is great!! It truly has reduced lines and cellulite. I use use it as directed and it didn&#x27;t take long before I saw an improvement!!  Not only does it work but the price is a huge bonus, under 30 bucks with shipping!! I have spent hundreds trying different creams and I can&#x27;t believe the least expensive is what worked the best! I highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Is it fair I rate this product with 1 star? Maybe, maybe not, because I don&#x27;t know which one is the real product, there gotta be a fake one out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought two sets of this. However, the second time I got a total different product then the first time. Yes, the bottles were the same, but that was it. The color was totally different, the smell was totally different and the texture was absolutely not the same. I still had some cream from the first set left, so I could make a good comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set 1: pink bottle had yellow/orange very fluid cream with a nice melon like fruity smell. Purple bottle had an orange very fluid cream, also with a sweet fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;Set 2: pink bottle had a pink very thick cream that smelled like citrus. Purple bottle had a very thick purple cream in it. Both creams are so thick you have to twist the cap off to get it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I tried to contact the company, asking if they renewed or changed their product, but several weeks later, still no answer from them, even though I used their contact form (only way to reach them) twice. What a lousy way to treat your customer. Conclusion: lousy product , horrible customer &#x27;service&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Goes on smooth and creamy. Smells great and leaves skin looking and feeling very soft and silky. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for about 4 months. I have been working out as well which I think has helped. The product does not smell bad like other reviews said.</li>
            <li> I had been trying everything before for to attack and improve my cellulite in my legs and button,and nothing worked at all lately.I take care of myself going to work out,being vegan and organic...and i felt in the way of depression when i wanted to wear a mini short or skirt that which i love those so much and I used to wear that when i was younger...Since the first moment I started to use finulite ,just couple days after I noticed the improvement results surround my knees.It was a miracle for me cause I was getting some info about some very expensive laser treatments that they couldn&#x27;t to guarantee me about the results that I was looking for.So when I,ve done with my first finulite set,I started with the second one right away for complete the professional recommendation.It,s been few months ago that I finish with the cellulite treatment and my legs looks amazing.I highly recommend this product for real.From women to women.</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite for about 3 months now. The first month, I did not see much difference, the second and third month have been of more significance. I also run and drink a lot of water, however, I&#x27;ve been running and drinking a lot of water for about 3 years, and it is now with Finulite that I have seen my cellulite disappearing. It is still there but it is harder to see it now and it is condensed more into one area. I will continue using Finulite and will continue working out to enhance the benefits from Finulite.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t seen great results yet. I&#x27;ve almost been using this a month. Smells good tho</li>
            <li> I have used about half bottle and I am very pleased,so I will definitely continue using it.I had seen the improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is the second time purchasing this product.  Besides helping with the cellulite it leaves my skin very soft and has a good smell.  I&#x27;ve used many other products and this one is the best.  I find along with exercise and eating well this works best.  I truly love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am really fit, but still have cellulite.  I have tried everything short of surgery - Bliss, Murad, Nivea, massagers, etc.  This product really works for me.  Once and awhile, something new or interesting will come on the market and I&#x27;ll stray, but I always come back.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have seen many 5 stars. Unfortunately, it did not work for me, maybe it will for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been about a week and there&#x27;s already less noticeable cellulite on my legs. I decided to give this product a try since the conventional diet and exercise just wasn&#x27;t giving me results in specific places that I wanted, but adding this into the equation is just amazing~ Please, before doing something unreasonable like surgery, spare a few dollars and get some real results.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I notice best results when I use in combination with regular body brushing and bellabaci cups.</li>
            <li> This definitely is a good addition to a cellulite care regimen-it smells good and has a number of good ingredients.  Along with balanced diet and regular exercise, the look of the back of my thighs has improved.  I don&#x27;t feel it would do a lot by itself, but I do feel that it is a helpful addition.</li>
            <li> My legs have always been the one part of my body that I actually loved about myself. When I turned 35 my upper outside thighs started getting dimples. A friend actually gave me the Finulite AM and PM to try and I will tell you with no hesitation, it&#x27;s a miracle in pretty little bottles. It was so easy to add to my beauty routine. It smells amazing and it feels like a body butter but not quite as heavy. I am a customer for life!! We&#x27;re not getting any younger, and when you find something that works, you want to share it with all of your girls! Get it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product works but it does!  I have always had some cellulite at the tops of my thighs but afte having children, it some how seemed to spread down to the top of my knees.  After loosing the baby weight, I thought it would tighten back up but it didn&#x27;t.  I worked out and lifted weights but nothing seemed to help.  I found this product on Amazon and read many positive reviews so I decided to try it.  The skin started to instantly feel smoother.  After a few weeks, I noticed some of the cellulite starting to disappear.  I have been using the product for about 3 months now and 80% of my cellulite is barely noticable.  I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to anyone who has stubborn cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks so far, they ship the product very fast and I received it with in days of shipping.  I have been using it religiously for the past 3 weeks and have only missed 1 time applying the PM treatment.  I definitely see a difference, the area I was most concerned with was my upper leg and since I have been using this product I feel that the area is a lot smoother and there has been an reduction in the dimpling.  I am an avid gym goer and my upper leg had muscle tone with dimpling around it, this product has allowed more of my muscle tone to come out.  The smell for each treatment is very pleasant, the AM has a citrus smell while the PM has a lavender one.  The one reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the size per amount of the product, with shipping it is about $28 and have lasted only 3 to 4 weeks.  I have to say over all I like the product and will continue to use it as long as I am financially able to.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this brand of cellulite cream because of all the high reviews that it had.  When I received the cream I followed some of the advice I read in other reviews.  I made sure to exfoliate very well in the shower before I would apply the cream, not wasting any of the cream on dead skin cells.  The main areas I focused on were my cellulite ridden butt and thighs. In fact I even took before and after pictures, which I&#x27;m not going to share because thats embarrassing, but they showed it really did work!  My husband even noticed the difference :) Now I also paired it with exercise and trying to eat healthy but I really feel this made a big difference because in the past with just exercising &amp; eating good I never got such results on problem areas!  Also as mentioned in other reviews, the smell is another plus it&#x27;s actually really good smelling lotion as opposed to the other chemically smelly cellulite treatments I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s trying to battle their cellulite.</li>
            <li> My wife has a little bit cellulite and she tray a lot off different products on the market. Noting works what she was trying. Some very expensive creams smell only nice and cost a lot money.........but don&#x27;t work !&lt;br /&gt;She tray this nice product and........what surprise...........IT WORKS !!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After the second order she was so happy about the results........no visible cellulite !!!!!!!!  Now  all her girlfriends want&#x27;s to know the product&amp;#34;s name.&lt;br /&gt;FINULITE IS THE NAME AND IT WORKS !!!!!!</li>
            <li> And so does she for whom I bought it for. Works quite nicely and goes a long way. Will repeat as long as she&#x27;s satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using Finulite for 3 months and see a big improvement in the appearance of cellulite. My legs and and thighs are much smoother and softer. I love how it does not feel greasey and abosorbs very quickly. I&#x27;ve purchased many products for reducing the appearance of cellulite and am happy to of found one that finally works!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product! Because I do have cellulite on my thighs, when I got this in the mail, I immediately wanted to try it and the first thing I noticed was how SMALL the bottles were. They both fit in one of my hands! I dont think alot of people know that. Well anyhow been using this product for about 2 weeks every morning and night and still no results. :( ugh, sucks.</li>
            <li> this is one of many tightening products that i have invested in.  i will admit, the packaging appeared a little juvenile and i was not sure how well it would really work.  i had a baby over 4 years ago and even though i am back to pre pregnancy weight, i eat well, and exercise, there is just this constant little layer of fat and loose skin on my upper arms, inner thighs and lower tummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. this smells really good. i am a \\&quot;stink a phobe\\&quot; and always afraid of overwhelmingly scented products, but this smells good.&lt;br /&gt;2. after one cycle, i could feel a noticeable difference in the smoothness of my skin&lt;br /&gt;3. i can feel the tightening effects but it doesn&#x27;t hurt or dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will continue to use finulite because it works. the price is more than nivea but it works a lot better than nivea... so if you have a lot of cellulite- honestly, only exercise and clean eating can rid the appearance of that- but if you are looking to tighten up your plushy layer- this is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope that helps!</li>
            <li> Well, the bottles are a TOTAL of 8oz. When I Saw the 8oz on there I assumed they meant a piece... Ok, whatever. I used this product for about three weeks before it ran out. I cold see a difference in the tone in my legs, but not necessarily a reduction in the cellulite. I know it may not have been enough time but I purchased NuElle at the same. So when I was finished with this product I began using NuElle. I could see results within  the first week. Now, Finulite may have been partly responsible, who knows... Finulite does smell great, but I ended up liking the other product better...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference and as soon as you apply it it dries off so you cannot even spread it on the skin to give the suggested massage.</li>
            <li> I give this product four stars, it does what it says it will although my idea of how well it works might be different from others. In about the span of 18 months, I went from a six 4 to a six 8 and then back to a size 4 due to illness and it did a number on my skin. The smaller more numerous cellulite lines disappeared in about two weeks, but the bigger thick lines on the sides of my belly prove to be trickier. The product description does allow 4-6 weeks, so I&#x27;ll just keep my fingers crossed and see if time and determination will make them go away. The purple PM has a fantastic, clean, and light smell and while the Pink AM isn&#x27;t my type of fragrance it is still pleasant.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, last summer, I was embarrassed to wear shorts because of cellulite on my legs. About a month ago, I stumbled across this on Pinterest and I was intrigued. After reading the reviews from multiple different websites, I figured I had nothing to lose and would give it a try. I was very skeptical at first. My first impression is that it actually smells nice! After 2 weeks, the skin on my legs are firmer, smoother, and believe it or not, the cellulite wasn&#x27;t as noticeable! I continued to use it for the remainder of the month and reordered more so I could keep up the treatment. It&#x27;s easy to use and only takes a couple minutes in the morning and at night. I also got the finulite scrub brush and use it in the shower. It did leave some bruises, but it&#x27;s winter, so I&#x27;m not worried...I am pushing hard, afterall and I figure I won&#x27;t need to push as hard as the cellulite continues to disappear. It&#x27;s now been 4 weeks and I&#x27;m beyond shocked and thrilled with the results! I can&#x27;t wait to see what the next 4 weeks will bring! I can&#x27;t wait to wear my shorts this year without the embarrassment!</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for the past couple weeks now and I have noticed a slight change.  I think that combining it with my weekly workout schedule is definitely the best way to go.  Thanks Finulite!</li>
            <li> Hi, I am 27 years old but have cellulite on my legs and my butt. I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of products but non of them didn&#x27;t help. I got this product before almost one month and I already see results. My cellulite reduced a lot the first 3 weeks so I ordered again. I didn&#x27;t believe that cellulite can ever goes away but finally found the right product for me. I recommend it  because it really works!</li>
            <li> Every time  I run out, it&#x27;s a must to replace ASAP. Love Finulite, it&#x27;s getting me ready for spring❤️</li>
            <li> Results were good, not great, although I used the product inconsistently. However, I think with regular use and exercise, I probably would have had better results.  I also actually loved the smell of both of these.  The price is also a huge plus, compared to other products of its kind.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical about this. I did not really know if I had what is considered to be cellulite but I had a baby 10 months ago and was left with kinda droppy loose skin on my stomach. I just started applying this lotion twice a day 5 days ago and I can already see a big difference. I didn&#x27;t even tell my husband I was using it and he noticed and said that my stomach was starting to go back to the way it used to be. In only five days, the skin of my stomach is now tighter and feels smoother to the touch. I still have the stretch marks but I will work on those after I use this product for at least 6 weeks or so. I will update on here again in 4 weeks or so. So far so good! Very happed with the results!</li>
            <li> I searched reviews on this cream on different websites and I found this page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream can give cancer. This is scary!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many items to compare this to, as I&#x27;ve only used two other creams before. I had debated purchasing this for a while because of the reviews as well as the price. I finally figured what the heck and went for it. I purchased this along with the derma roller because many reviewers suggested it.  When I first started using it I would use the derma roller and then apply the cream. I did this for about a week and a half and didn&#x27;t see any improvement. I stopped using the derma roller because it was small and took too long. I continued with the cream though and after about 2 more weeks I started seeing some improvement. Overall I have seen improvement but I don&#x27;t think it is worth $30. I have had better results with much cheaper creams that lasted a lot longer than these 2 small bottles. It seems to really work for some people though so I guess if you can afford it, go ahead. If not try something cheaper first.</li>
            <li> product  does not work at all , I would not recommend this product, it is not worth the money does not meet my espectations</li>
            <li> Bout this creme a month ago. Cellulite improving. Less dimple in the thighs, and butt. But still some work to do in the back of the thighs.  I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am an extremely skeptical person.  I have tried other cellulite products with no results.  But based on the Amazon reviews, I decided to give Finulite a try.  I am now a repeat buyer because IT WORKS!!  I had the orange peel kind of cellulite, not the lumpy kind.  After consistently using Finulite day and night, my skin is much smoother, and my cellulite is now barely noticeable.  Finally - a cellulite cream that actually does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> This product is just great! Not only works great for cellulite, but it mosturizes and it smells heavenly. Will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 month and I have not noticed any reduction in cellulite!  The lotion smells nice and makes your skin feel soft but that&#x27;s about all!  I would not recommend this product for cellulite reduction!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Finulite for almost a year now, and it works really well. I use a body brush to remove dead skin, then apply Finulite. Read the directions for application. You can&#x27;t just slap it on and expect it to work magic. You need to massage it deeply into your skin. Highly recommend! Works way better than any other cellulite treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> its working somewhatI its only been a couple weeks and i haven&#x27;t noticed much difference!!! I wouldn&#x27;t refer it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have never used any type of cellulite cream b/c I am plum skinny, but no matter how thin you are esp during swim suite season everyone has places they wish that just weren&#x27;t there! Well, I have used my first Finulite cream and have already received my second. I saw results within a week. My lower bum, upper legs thighs just look toner and firmer. I mean this stuff works!! I highly recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a cellulite cream, so I cannot compare Finulite to any other product.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my thighs are smoother after several months of use.  My cellulite wasn&#x27;t severe, just a light dimpling to my thighs and butt.  It was enough to annoy me since I work hard to look my best.  I am the correct weight for my height, but the underlying dimpling wouldn&#x27;t go away despite diet and exercise.  After using Finulite for several weeks, my thighs and butt are noticeably smooth and younger looking.  I would recommend this product to anyone with stubborn cellulite that resists diet and exercise.  It will take time, no instant results - but the results are worth it.  I am looking forward to swimsuit season.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through my 2nd month and I&#x27;m almost done with my second set and I haven&#x27;t seen the difference I thought I would. I have been working out like crazy and I started using the Jergens tanning lotion, which helps hide cellulite, so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s really working.  I do see a little bit of a difference which is why I gave the product 3 stars.  I&#x27;m supposed to be getting another set free by writing this review so if I see any more of a difference after using it another month I&#x27;ll write another review. Everything on pinterest pointed me toward this product and it has a lot of good reviews so I though I&#x27;d give it a try. It seems less expensive than a lot of the reputable cellulite creams out there.</li>
            <li> Looooove!! I use this product every morning and night and I am highly satisfied with the results. This is my second purchase of this product and this time around I am using it with the mitt. The results are even better! I recommend the mitt if you want best results. Please get this product. Lastly, I would recommend getting two sets becuase it does run out after a month or two of use; it could be sooner for some.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve had cellulite since I was 12. On front, back and sides of thighs, as well as on my butt. I&#x27;m not overweight, and I run, use an elliptical, lift weights and walk 5 to 6 days a week. No matter what I did with diet or exercise the cellulite was still there.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now 47, and read an article about a new plastic surgery technique called Cellulaze. Costs $5000 and I was going to have it done, even though I was disappointed in the before and after pictures the surgeons had. Not that much improvement, but hey, I was game for some improvement, anything to make me feel okay in a bathing suit or shorts.&lt;br /&gt;Well, because I would have had to wait a couple months due to my schedule to have it done, I decided to try a few cellulite home treatments in the meantime, just for fun, not really expecting them to work.&lt;br /&gt;I started talking glucosamine supplements, dry brushing my legs once a day with a Tampico skin brush, and got a 1.5mm micro needling roller and Finulite along with the Finulite mitt.&lt;br /&gt;It has been two weeks, and what had been a case of severe cellulite is now minor. The deep craters are no linger there. I am using the Finulite morning and night, but the micro needle roller I have used only 3 times. I truly believe it is a big part of my success but it hurts so I don&#x27;t like to do it. I will continue though, twice a week probably.&lt;br /&gt;The Finulite mitt I use in the shower once a day, and the other time a day I just use it with the cream. For about two minutes total.&lt;br /&gt;Truly the improvement in my legs is a miracle, at least as good as the plastic surgeon&#x27;s pictures and actually I think better. For such a small investment, it is amazing. I bought everything on amazon.</li>
