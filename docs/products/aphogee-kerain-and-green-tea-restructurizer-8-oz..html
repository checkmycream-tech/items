            <li> I been using Apohgee shampoo and conditioner for quite awhile . I seen a major change in my hair. I bleached my hair and and months then passed my hair began to fall completely out. I over processed my hair. Then I order the two-step treatment , the karatin restructurizer, the balancing oil, the whole product line. Anyway after that my hair is in great condition, I don&#x27;t use any oil to my hair cause it automatically has shine. Its growing healthy. I will continue to use Apohgee products from here on out. Thanks .</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair. Provide softness and shine.</li>
            <li> I did the big chop almost a year ago and have gone through so many products.  This keeps my hair so very soft.  I use it daily to revitalize my curl defining cream, which allows me to go a few extra days without cowashing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my dry hair</li>
            <li> i did not like this. it did not seem to do anything for me</li>
            <li> Love it! Hair is stronger than ever! And smells amazing! I would definitely recommend it to anyone! Amazing! Great leave in!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re transitioning, and have problems detangling, this product is for you!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Made my hair look and feel great. Great detangler and gave it a lot of body.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>

            <li> This is ok but its not as good as its counterparts for keratin like &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; I have been using it as a leave in conditioner and detangler</li>
            <li> This is a great product for damaged and protein starved hair  this is a strong leave in protein treatment please be  warned!  I would not recommend you  use this daily but maybe once a week depending on the extent of wear and tear on your hair.  Overall great product stops hair shed almost immediately!  Good luck its a must buy use at your own accord..</li>
            <li> This product is great for African-American hair ends. It helps to strengthen natural hair ends. It also helps soften the hair. My hair felt soft after sing this product.</li>
            <li> I being us this for past 3 week , ok so far no complain. I use it every time I wash my hair and blow dry which I try to do twice a month. Less shredding I notice</li>

            <li> I like the way this product immediately helps to detangle my hair. The product did arrive a little sooner than I expected which was a good surprise. I will continue to use it to see if it helps to condition my hair and prevent breakage. I have bi racial hair, African American and American Indian. My hair texture is thick and curly, and tangles easily. My hair length is past my shoulders and slightly down my back. I want more overall length, my hair has suffered some breakage due to a lack of special care that was needed after coloring my hair. Overall a great product I plan to continue to use for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> This treatment makes my hair so soft and normal after a relaxer. It has to be doing something corrective, or I don&#x27;t think there would be such an immediate improvement.</li>
            <li> It does nothing for natural hair</li>
            <li> This does wonders for my hair. Love love love it</li>
