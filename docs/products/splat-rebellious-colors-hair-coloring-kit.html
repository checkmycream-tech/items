    <ol>
            <li>If your hairdresser is not as awesome as mine, then try to employ a friend.  </li>
            <li>This colour worked soooooo wonderfully on my hair.</li>
            <li>Awesome color!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bleach it comes with isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>followed the instructions perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best product out there</li>
            <li>I also find that hand sanitizer gets dye off skin and counters best.</li>
            <li>Turned out wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair dye that is out there</li>
            <li>its the best hair dying kit EVER!</li>
            <li>seriously, incredible.</li>
            <li>I always loved SPLAT!</li>
            <li>Worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>The bleach in this kit works great, but the coloring did not have the intensity I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>And I am highly experienced with bleaching and dying hair.</li>
            <li>give it 4 stars because it works great</li>
            <li>Great color great dye.</li>
            <li>it does stain a lot but its great in your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving Splat five stars because it really is a great dye.</li>
            <li>but this is the best i love this stuff</li>
            <li>This is probably the best, most affordable non-natural hair color on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>My hubby was able to do it &amp; it came out great!</li>
            <li>My friend is VERY good at dying and bleaching hair and has done it many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m trying again and hoping for good results.</li>
            <li>I brought this product thinking it was a a really good hair dye</li>
            <li>Splat is a good brand.  </li>
            <li>this was going to be good stuff.  </li>
            <li>The dye lasts about a month before fading and it still looks good as it fades.</li>
            <li>It is a gorgeous shade and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>It is a gorgeous shade and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results I got from using this product.</li>
            <li>Splat is pretty good, but not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>We are buying more Splat!  </li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>All of his friends love it!</li>
            <li>Splat produces AMAZING color.  </li>
            <li>and the color is amazing,the results are just amazing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like that as much, but it did look awesome while I had it.  </li>
            <li>towel - unless you want to turn your nice towel purple.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m kind of klutzy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice that this kit comes with the bleach</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great product and it&#x27;s worth the purchase, just check out the seperate bleach and cream developer for better results!    </li>
            <li>I usually love splat, and this color in particular is absolutely perfect for me.</li>
            <li>and I have never bleached hair before and would have liked more info.</li>
            <li>and the price is great and worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>splat honestly works better on my hair than manic panic or ion</li>
            <li>and it does color your hair beautifully however, be aware that it will stain everything it touches</li>
            <li>and it got to me very quickly!  </li>
            <li>My sister got some of it on her hands, and it was washed off easily with hand soap!</li>
            <li>Definitally the best stuff I&#x27;ve tried to far, loads better than manic panic.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at dyeing my own hair if I do say so</li>
            <li>Do NOT throw away the dye until you are POSITIVE that you&#x27;re happy with the coverage.  </li>
            <li>Anything is better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Try it you may be able to do better</li>
            <li>I was actually able to wear my hair up in about a day or two.  </li>
            <li>but with the warning labels I&#x27;ve seen, I thought I&#x27;d better mention it.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a \\&quot;pigment\\&quot; than a \\&quot;dye\\&quot;, so it can stay on without damaging your hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it makes my hair look</li>
            <li>i feel safe using it</li>
            <li>, okay?  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re thicker and cover more of your arm.  </li>
            <li>I used an all-natural 100% vegetable soap and was able to get most of the stains out with a lot of scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>As a dye,this is phenomenal, but it will take a lot of work to do and maintain, so if you don&#x27;t want to devote a lot of effort to it, Splat is not for you.  </li>
            <li>The color is fantastic!</li>
            <li>But, it was okay.</li>
            <li>The color faded after 4 weeks after I&#x27;ve dyed my hair (even after leaving the product on my hair for more than 40 minutes, as recommended, before washing it out).</li>
            <li>but oh well get better ones and wear grubby clothes and your set.</li>
            <li>Splat gives the best results and the longest lasting color.</li>
            <li>If your hair touches your shoulders or longer you will want more than one bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially love the blue and purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>i love this hair dye</li>
            <li>i love the bleach too, it works wonders.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting a bit more cotton candy these days [...].     </li>
            <li>That a should remove most of the staining.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the color.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT FAST DELIVERY THANK  </li>
            <li>Do not shampoo your hair again as this makes it fade much more</li>
            <li>This color looks better than what I got done at the salon.</li>
            <li>Its more watery too, which makes it easier to fully saturate all of your hair.  </li>
            <li>We tried EVERYTHING to make sure this doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>Faded out sooner, but I still love this brand for hair dye.</li>
            <li>ok so I bought this kit at Walgreens not from Amazon...</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to wear petroleum jelly or else</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m super super super happy with the way my hair turned out!!</li>
            <li>The color came out great though and lasted for a decent amount of washes.</li>
            <li>umm all i can say is its a great product i love my new look and will probably purchase it again when my hair color fades.</li>
            <li>Have fun with it but follow the directions!!</li>
            <li>Takes about an hour or two to get done but comes out very nice and has so far lasted on my son for weeks with minimum fading!</li>
            <li>Of all rules, wearing gloves is the most important.</li>
            <li>I love the beautiful blue though  </li>
            <li>The most important thing is to WAIT.  </li>
            <li>The blue dye went on easy and was a brilliant color.  </li>
            <li>Do not take a full shower when rinsing it out!</li>
            <li>This brand is great with the colors and you need bleach blonde hair though to get the results and more then one box.</li>
            <li>i was doing the instructions and the product where easy to use.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of trying to add it to some cream conditioner to easy the application, and that was the bluest disaster my bathroom every encountered.</li>
            <li>and it came out fairly easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;Permanent, vibrant, gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>It took about 6 weeks for it to fade significantly, though parts of it were still very bright blue.</li>
            <li>and I intend on trying again and again til I achieve my beautiful blue.</li>
            <li>You may want to experiment with another kind of short-lived dye first.  </li>
            <li>I decided to not use bleach this time, just because I did not want the blonde after affects (I&#x27;m a brunette), but it still came out beautifully.</li>
            <li>beach worked fine</li>
            <li>I used it and the bleach worked fine</li>
            <li>I hear manic panic works better for darker hair if you&#x27;re trying to get a bold color</li>
            <li>The blue is very bold and looks great on her.</li>
            <li>Nice vibrant color!</li>
            <li>I want rich rich royal beautiful blue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely it again, though, as the results were great.     </li>
            <li>The color was really light.</li>
            <li>Buy them cheap at Walmart, $2 for three caps, can be rinsed and reused if you need to.)  </li>
            <li>And the 2nd time around, it all turned out great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>the bleach can hurt yes, but it&#x27;s bleach, and the result is so PERFECT at the end that you won&#x27;t care if it stung for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>but the amount is not nearly enough for a whole head of hair and the bleach isn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li>UNFORTUNANTLY, THIS KIT IS NOT STUPID PROOF.  </li>
            <li>I dyed my boyfriend hair and the color is soo pretty!!</li>
            <li>, it goes on super easily and stays strong and covers EXTREMELY well, and it fades beautifully.</li>
            <li>Incredible blue when first applied, but</li>
            <li>But again, very easy to get your hair fully saturated, and its very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>but it is fun!  </li>
            <li>but it is fun!  </li>
            <li>For my daughter&#x27;s first try though, it was an okay product.</li>
            <li>We originally dyed her hair in April, here it is July</li>
            <li>Instead of going with my gut feeling and keeping the dye in (significantly) longer, I followed the instructions.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>When I got this I was so excited.</li>
            <li>Kept getting comments on how nice my hair looked :) Be warned though, it may work differently for you...</li>
            <li>I got the Blue Envy dye from a CVS near me, neither me nor my friend (who helps me dye my hair, and is very awesome.)</li>
            <li>The color was beautiful at first, so if you have a system for making these colors last, I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li>I use to use Special FX color for my hair</li>
            <li>I had Vaseline on my hairline and I was wearing gloves so there wasn&#x27;t really any spillage, even though it was my first time dyeing my own hair.</li>
            <li>There are only two good things about this dye (the two stars instead of one): The smell and the fact that it lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li>We used a whole box on just her tips and could&#x27;ve used more.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t TOO MUCH change from before hand, but it was okay.    </li>
            <li>(on weekends if I wasn&#x27;t busy, I wouldn&#x27;t use any kind of shampoo at all).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something more on the temporary side, maybe not so much this product - try washables instead.</li>
            <li>He was so horrified by the outcome he ended up getting his tried and true Manic Panic to fix it, guess what, NO color or coverage problems and NO bleeding.</li>
            <li>then the rest of my hair comes out looking gray which is not bad at all</li>
            <li>This kit is not bad.      </li>
            <li>The color is amazing, it is easy to use if you prepare properly, and it doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li>At that point, most of my hair was a very light blonde.</li>
            <li>but i found just hot water and a rag to work just fine in the tub.</li>
            <li>It also washed out quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily there are youtube video tutorials that helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>so the color will be more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I love how vibrant the color turns out after I dye my hair with the product.</li>
            <li>I noticed in the packaging that it states this in bold ink.  </li>
            <li>It bleeds all over the and fades really quickly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to be a really quick thing.  </li>
            <li>With any drastic color, they fade quickly..</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was packaged well, but I followed the instuctions a nd</li>
            <li>Be sure to use conditioner so your hair relaxes and feels normal again.  </li>
            <li>Color stays strong, i wish the blue was a bit brighter under indoor lighting, but in outside it looks so vibrant and awesome.</li>
            <li>I used Manic Panic Purple Haze and Hot Hot Pink today and I loved it!</li>
            <li>so you better be prepared to live with it.</li>
            <li>Both the bleach and dye exceeded my expectations, and I think I&#x27;ve found my new go-to dye brand for the most part.</li>
            <li>It still looked pretty good while fading, though (someone described it as \\&quot;What it would look like if people had naturally blue hair\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair red first, loved it.  </li>
            <li>The shower cap over the dye is a wonderful thing to have, especially for long hair.  </li>
            <li>Very beautiful, long lasting color</li>
            <li>This is my first time however doing my own hair with such a bold and unique color</li>
            <li>My hair is a light ash brown, and although it picks up color very well, I used the bleach for a bold result.    </li>
            <li>Looked more purple than blue which was fine with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, the color is very pretty and bright.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the time.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dye and expect something nice, but it is totally opposite.</li>
            <li>(FYI, the best things I&#x27;ve found for taking the blue off your skin are Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent, rubbing alcohol, or nail polish remover.)  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want color that bold, you should not bleach your hair first.  </li>
            <li>It was hardly runny, it was not thick, it was the perfect consistency.  </li>
            <li>that comes out when it holds right.</li>
            <li>I knew right away</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest trying it, especially since it&#x27;s rather cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color but fades pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright blue, goes on much easier, and doesn&#x27;t stain as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the dye on for about an hour, give or take, and came out with friggin&#x27; brilliant blue hair, very even in tone.</li>
            <li>I have used lusty lavendar (which faded to a nice pink), and just used blue envy tonight and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>On top of that, somehow my roots were blue the rest was vaguely dark blue in the best of lights.</li>
            <li>Even if you follow the box and use all these tips, you may not do it right the first time.  </li>
            <li>The bleach did do VERY well, but color faded quick (aboout 2-3 wks).</li>
            <li>We did it outside &amp; used the hose over some river rocks &amp; no blue color mess anywhere :) looks great too even for a novice!</li>
            <li>Brought it to a very light blonde.</li>
            <li>Faded more naturally into my hair colour, as opposed to being a vibrant contrast.</li>
            <li>If you maintain the same color as I have, you might be able to just bleach the roots going forward.  </li>
            <li>Try to make sure that your ears are outside of the cap, but inside the saran wrap.  </li>
            <li>Much easier that way!  </li>
            <li>When I got to work it was very noticeable and I like it!     </li>
            <li>The only improvements this product needs to make is to include more bleach and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bleached my hair first before I started using this product, so maybe that effects the color.</li>
            <li>I love having  blue hair</li>
            <li>, it was literally hot coming out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an at-home product to dye my hair a non-natural color.  </li>
            <li>First, the color.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was a trial and error.</li>
            <li>the bleach was more than enough.  </li>
            <li>This kit is not difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>all and all was ok trying something else next time.</li>
            <li>This is not my first time using hair dye.</li>
            <li>but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>First, a confession.</li>
            <li>but I freakin&#x27; love this blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even as it fades, it&#x27;s still pretty.</li>
            <li>re-dye it every six or so weeks when I have a couple of hours free and so far, that&#x27;s been working out well.</li>
            <li>I love using the blue envy kit.</li>
            <li>This is the first brand that&#x27;s ever done that to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still has 99% of the vibrancy it had when I first colored it.</li>
            <li>pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks great when just done but it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li>First off, the fading.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to a T, tried dying my hair with this product twice, thinking I must have screwed something up the first time.</li>
            <li>The bleach is included in the box which is pretty convenient</li>
            <li>May look good and vibrant for a week and a half, but isn&#x27;t worth spending the time putting in.</li>
            <li>Any good semi permanent dye is going to be a bit messy.</li>
            <li>maybe a little more detailed instructions for people that have never done this before.</li>
            <li>TWO hours later, her hair was bright blue.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a real messy deal when getting blue heair, but it does work wonderfully!</li>
            <li>and I love Blue so much.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair a gorgeous shade of deep blue</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to be able to get just the blue and not the bleach because my bleach is stockpiling.)  </li>
            <li>and seeing the less than great reviews others gave it kind of confirmed my suspicions that this was just some wannabe lame attempt at hair dye.  </li>
            <li>As many have said you have to leave this on a long time.</li>
            <li>The color pretty much washed out when we rinsed her hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used pretty much all the brands out there, and done all the colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it at my local walmart, just an innocent 11 year old, right?</li>
            <li>but of course you&#x27;re going to have to buy things to protect your skin and clothes from the blue since it doesn&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
            <li>BE SMART ABOUT THIS.    </li>
            <li>We were hoping that the positive reviews were the accurate ones, but it turns out that the negative ones are much more on point.</li>
            <li>but since its now available in my local store I might try it out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I went over my whole head</li>
            <li>At that point, my hair was a light, stormy blue.  </li>
            <li>I keep using \\&quot;bold\\&quot; because that&#x27;s really what it is.  </li>
            <li>However, there are a number of extra things that you should have in order to make things go smoothly:  * Petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li>(Yes, I am that much of a nerd) myself to start dying my hair at 2pm, it is now like 8pm.  </li>
            <li>I bleached the front section (The whole front of my head) and</li>
            <li>I have never, ever dyed my hair alone before and my hair turned out better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Aqua Rush is absolutely hideous as it fades.</li>
            <li>four times (store bought bleach and professional) and while a big portion of my hair is bordering white, there is a good chunk that is still very purple/pink.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this brand if you&#x27;re looking for something long-lasting.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so intense.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you&#x27;re careful when you&#x27;re at the gym</li>
            <li>I did not expect much from this product.  </li>
            <li>The bleach worked FAST,</li>
            <li>I really like these hair dyes</li>
            <li>I would really recommend splat colors if your looking to dye your hair.</li>
            <li>If you want the same kind of blue you see on Katy Perry or your Stormer Jem doll, this is what you use.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure that all of your towels are ones that you don&#x27;t mind getting full of color, and wait until your hair is completely dry to dress or sleep or you will stain your clothes and sheets (unless you use the aforementioned shower cap).  </li>
            <li>Its very easy to make a mess with this stuff, and it does stain.  </li>
            <li>I dyed it a normal color to get rid of that, but I will use Splat again!</li>
            <li>When I bought this product, I was looking for something different, unique, and definately vibrant.</li>
            <li>I kept the pink in my hair for about a month, didn&#x27;t really enjoy the shade on myself too much because of my pale complexion and the bright pink natural blushing of my cheeks, it just kind of clashed for me personally.</li>
            <li>I naturally have brown hair, so I bleached streaks first.</li>
            <li>I have short, light-brown hair, and the amount of dye in the box was more than enough.</li>
            <li>Fast forward again, this dye gave me the most uneven dye job I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>We only did her bangs, so we were able to save the rest of the bottle for later applications to brighten them up.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more than enough product in the kit to dye a third of my six inch hair repeatedly before I have to buy another box.</li>
            <li>My hair was Aqua Rush at the beginning of this year and by March, my hair was still incredibly vibrant.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of it I bought the Special Effects Electric Blue and it works so much better.</li>
            <li>I used the dye eventually and the color came out a very rich, deep blue.</li>
            <li>I may have missed sections; I tend to take very hot, daily showers; some sections of my hair might not have been as bleached.</li>
            <li>First of all, the outside of the box was nearly perfect, yet the bag incasing the instructions was torn and somewhat dirty looking.</li>
            <li>color is VERY vivid though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this produces the most long lasting and intense results.</li>
            <li>even when you pay $100 in a salon so it was nice to have that extra color for a touch up application after the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>(I understand this isn&#x27;t high end dye</li>
            <li>We washed my hair out, dried it as best we could, and then applied about half a bottle of dye, stuck a bag on my head, and went back to card games.</li>
            <li>I thought they could have included a little more bleach.</li>
            <li>The color only seems to become more vivid and lasting with each dye</li>
            <li>When you get ready to apply the dye, definitely use the bleaching stuff first.  </li>
            <li>I did my normal routine</li>
            <li>Then, she washed it like normal.</li>
            <li>but the blue is pretty intense in the areas where I bleached.</li>
            <li>nice dark blue!</li>
            <li>Have done this many times with other dyes for only a large strand of hair.</li>
            <li>I had bought two boxes to be sure, though, which turned out well as I needed two sets of bleach (mostly due to messing up, not due to lack).</li>
            <li>Blowdried, then I got my black dye and colored the rest of my hair and over parts of the blue even, to tidy it all up.</li>
            <li>but it worked great though yes a little messy when you wash your hair after you dye it</li>
            <li>im new to dying my hair (i have grown it out since my profile pic)</li>
            <li>and i wanted to do something new but not too drastic</li>
            <li>Love the color for the first few days, but holy cow does it fade fast!</li>
            <li>so i uesed the bleach which made my hair light sorbet of colors like yellow and orange, but then i put the hair dye on and got the blue i been craving.</li>
            <li>However, I have found that a bit of stain remover on the blue areas before washing takes it out much better than expected.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because my hair was really really blonde, but it did look neat for a few weeks until it faded into a mucky kind of grey-blue.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is already a medium to light blonde, you will likely not need the bleach either.  </li>
            <li>The water never ran clear!</li>
            <li>(The first time it was over a week because my ears and neck were so blue).  </li>
            <li>After the first application I figured that I had simply brushed up against my scalp without realizing it.</li>
            <li>Since I obviously can&#x27;t bleach my son&#x27;s hair first now, we&#x27;ll have to see how this works out.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;ve bought other dyes without the bleach for the same price or more</li>
            <li>First time using a product such as this</li>
            <li>However other brands aren&#x27;t as accessible and I have always had to order them online which can be a pain, waiting for shipping and all that.  </li>
            <li>The first color was red.</li>
            <li>You should be fine as long as you don&#x27;t have two left feet for hands.</li>
            <li>It does originally make your hair blue, but it causes a huge mess and fades in a very short time unless you choose to never wash your hair.</li>
            <li>(Prior to trying this, I used Special Effects Blue Velvet which was amazing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We bleached the ends (for dip dye look) and after about an hour and a half, her hair was a light auburn.</li>
            <li>Unless you naturally have very blonde hair, you won&#x27;t get the desired results unless you bleach it first.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use a dark towel to minimize the appearance of stains...or just invest in a blue one!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price, maybe not worth the maintenance if you&#x27;re dying your whole head.</li>
            <li>Used almost the entire bottle to ensure coverage as well as increased time left in and rinsed with cool water.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my son has dirty blonde hair and isn&#x27;t picky but it would have been nice to have the bleach to get a true blue.</li>
            <li>More so when wet, but it does rub off a bit even when dry.  </li>
            <li>I rinse until the water runs mostly clear or at least very light in color.</li>
            <li>However, Blue Envy splat is so water that applying it is a huge mess and an absolute nightmare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a little while now and have tried several of the more well known brands.</li>
            <li>The color actually rinsed out of the hair and the color is so vibrant!</li>
            <li>I liked that it comes with bleach and not just the dye, so it costs half as much as other brands when you take that into consideration.  </li>
            <li>When rinsing, the water won&#x27;t ever run clear...</li>
            <li>run clear...</li>
            <li>Of course, the bleach job was fantastic and I was a partial platinum blonde when I went home, so maybe that helped</li>
            <li>Your whole scalp under your hair will be blue for a while....</li>
            <li>so I cover everything really well (obviously not over my face...</li>
            <li>If you have access to a rinsing sink and a friend to help with this step (or if you can set up another appointment to go back to your hairdresser,) I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>(Then again, my male friends never complain of this, so it might not happen to men as much).</li>
            <li>I was irritated that the box was completely destroyed and when I opened it, all of the bleaching liquid solution had spilled into the box and destroyed the instructions.</li>
            <li>I found a whole patch of hair in the back that I had missed after I washed the dye out and had to do touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the strongest of its type in hair colors.</li>
            <li>If you want to bleach your hair completely, buy professional bleach</li>
            <li>[I have medium-dark brown hair naturally.]</li>
            <li>Professional and over the counter.</li>
            <li>I went to a salon and had a professional bleach it for about $50.</li>
            <li>Lots of vigorous handwashing was necessary as this dye is very watery and gets in places.</li>
            <li>-old</li>
            <li>would like to note that while my color is bleeding constantly I haven&#x27;t noticed any real fading.</li>
            <li>It does miracles (thus far) for it, though it still is sticking to my roots</li>
            <li>The bleach is lacking, I&#x27;d suggest grabbing a box of frost n glow or something, especially if bleaching your whole head.</li>
            <li>To call it permanent is complete BS.</li>
            <li>BUT the hair dye was old.</li>
            <li>If you step near this product in a Sally&#x27;s, or Walmart, or wherever you go, walk away.</li>
            <li>Have fun with it and be careful during application and styling</li>
            <li>Have fun with it and be careful during application and styling</li>
            <li>Also, put something over your counters - there&#x27;s a few blue stains in my sink that I haven&#x27;t been able to get out yet.</li>
            <li>He used the bleach kit to lighten his medium brown, super short hair (buzzed almost all around and a 4\\&quot; wide 4\\&quot; high like mohawk)which worked well.</li>
            <li>fades quite quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to last so long.</li>
            <li>The water and dye will splatter everywhere and make a HUGE mess!</li>
            <li>However, I found that it was EXTREMELY messy, so be prepared to thoroughly clean your tub afterwards</li>
            <li>Also i put too much on my roots and had barely any left for the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>suggest L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach and a different brand of dye for anyone looking to dye their hair blue.</li>
            <li>My older son went swimming in a pool and the chlorine bleached all of the blue out.</li>
            <li>If you bleach your hair first, it will very likely end up the same color as the models on the box if you follow instructions and take your time.  </li>
            <li>The color is deep and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It either came out too light and grayish looking, or too dark to even tell it was blue.</li>
            <li>It takes about an hour to really wash out the extra dye, and even then it takes 2 or 3 shampoos to really get the extra blue out.</li>
            <li>The bleach worked fine, but the dye washed out completely after only a few days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more permanent and harder to wash/bleach out than permanent black hair dye.</li>
            <li>; I even blow dried my hair out because the box says the color sticks better to dry hair.</li>
            <li>:) my hair is pretty thick and already dyed black</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something new and different, you&#x27;ll definately wanna give this product a try.</li>
            <li>This purple will be messy for about 3 more shampoos, so be careful.</li>
            <li>Luckily after a few washes this evened out, but that did not help.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can barely see any blue and that is only under certain lighting.  </li>
            <li>50 minutes later, we take the pseudo-wrap off, and my hair is a light brown to a pale blond.</li>
            <li>My original hair color, except a shade darker, with little flicks of blue.    </li>
            <li>The blue is insanely vivid.</li>
            <li>We have blue stains on our pillows because the dye actually went through the pillowcase, and we were very careful to make sure her hair was dry every night before we went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say half of the dye washed right</li>
            <li>Just take the paper towel again and let it sit directly over the stain for a little while, probably as long as your clean up takes, and then wipe with water.</li>
            <li>Update: nixed the bleach since it was ruined but the blue looks great on my dirty blonde boys.</li>
            <li>The blue color don&#x27;t show at all except for on my roots which clearly isn&#x27;t what I was going for.</li>
            <li>at first it&#x27;s too dark but</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 9 year old son for his birthday and Walmart has been out of the blue for months.</li>
            <li>I had my hair professionally colored blue a number of times.  </li>
            <li>We barely scraped by with the amount of dye given to us, and had to use it all.</li>
            <li>Lumpy dye, completely unclear instructions, and I had a reaction to the dye that made my left eye swell shut.</li>
            <li>maybe it would look like that on natural blonde hair...</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m curious to see my blue hair after i bleach it since i perfer sky blue instead of deep dark blue honestly..</li>
            <li>They are either blonde, white or blue and I dont know how in the world they are not all blue since I wasted most of the dye on the front part.</li>
            <li>It actually fades to hot pink.</li>
            <li>The red lasted at least four months, very strong and slowly fading a nice dark pink.  </li>
            <li>This time, my hair was a vivid blue, similar to that on the box.     </li>
            <li>so by following the instructions i succesfully dyed parts of my hair, there is enough ingredients to dye really long hair with this product, though at first i was scetchy cause of the low price</li>
            <li>I have blue and black hair right now.</li>
            <li>Fast forward, rinse it, my hair is this dark almost black colour, and very very bleh.</li>
            <li>first time I did it, I felt that the color had not been dark enough.</li>
            <li>You need to saturate the hair you want colored completely, so one box is not enough for an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>it looks like someone has opened the box and closed it without much care several times.</li>
            <li>In no later then a week it was nearly all the way faded from my brothers hair, even on the bleached blonde.</li>
            <li>She has said it runs a little after she first put it in her hair</li>
            <li>My sink has one tiny, light dye spot due to being dumb and squeezing too much dye out.    </li>
            <li>The other cool thing is I used the color stay conditioner packet with the black dye.</li>
            <li>Most of my hair was this half blue-half brunette mix, and the color represented only had a few tiny streaks mixed in, with hints of blonde in some places.</li>
            <li>All in all, it took me about 2 and a half hours for the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>The first time we did this all, it was a mess!  </li>
            <li>It stayed in fine week one (duh!), but as soon as she started washing her hair the next week it started fading.</li>
            <li>The first couple of washes, it will run so use dark towels and dry your hair before wandering out into the world.</li>
            <li>She applied it very evenly, as there was so little bleach.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> If your hairdresser is not as awesome as mine, then try to employ a friend.  </li>

            <li> but this is the best i love this stuff</li>
            <li> This is probably the best, most affordable non-natural hair color on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> My hubby was able to do it &amp; it came out great!</li>
            <li> My friend is VERY good at dying and bleaching hair and has done it many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m trying again and hoping for good results.</li>
            <li> I brought this product thinking it was a a really good hair dye</li>
            <li> Splat is a good brand.  </li>
            <li> this was going to be good stuff.  </li>
            <li> The dye lasts about a month before fading and it still looks good as it fades.</li>
            <li> It is a gorgeous shade and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> It is a gorgeous shade and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results I got from using this product.</li>
            <li> Splat is pretty good, but not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> We are buying more Splat!  </li>
            <li> I love this color!</li>
            <li> All of his friends love it!</li>
            <li> Splat produces AMAZING color.  </li>
            <li> and the color is amazing,the results are just amazing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like that as much, but it did look awesome while I had it.  </li>
            <li> towel - unless you want to turn your nice towel purple.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m kind of klutzy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice that this kit comes with the bleach</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is a great product and it&#x27;s worth the purchase, just check out the seperate bleach and cream developer for better results!    </li>
            <li> I usually love splat, and this color in particular is absolutely perfect for me.</li>
            <li> and I have never bleached hair before and would have liked more info.</li>
            <li> and the price is great and worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> splat honestly works better on my hair than manic panic or ion</li>
            <li> and it does color your hair beautifully however, be aware that it will stain everything it touches</li>
            <li> and it got to me very quickly!  </li>
            <li> My sister got some of it on her hands, and it was washed off easily with hand soap!</li>
            <li> Definitally the best stuff I&#x27;ve tried to far, loads better than manic panic.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at dyeing my own hair if I do say so</li>
            <li> Do NOT throw away the dye until you are POSITIVE that you&#x27;re happy with the coverage.  </li>
            <li> Anything is better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Try it you may be able to do better</li>
            <li> I was actually able to wear my hair up in about a day or two.  </li>
            <li> but with the warning labels I&#x27;ve seen, I thought I&#x27;d better mention it.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a \\&quot;pigment\\&quot; than a \\&quot;dye\\&quot;, so it can stay on without damaging your hair.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and i love the way it makes my hair look</li>
            <li> i feel safe using it</li>
            <li> , okay?  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thicker and cover more of your arm.  </li>
            <li> I used an all-natural 100% vegetable soap and was able to get most of the stains out with a lot of scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> As a dye,this is phenomenal, but it will take a lot of work to do and maintain, so if you don&#x27;t want to devote a lot of effort to it, Splat is not for you.  </li>
            <li> The color is fantastic!</li>
            <li> But, it was okay.</li>
            <li> The color faded after 4 weeks after I&#x27;ve dyed my hair (even after leaving the product on my hair for more than 40 minutes, as recommended, before washing it out).</li>
            <li> but oh well get better ones and wear grubby clothes and your set.</li>
            <li> Splat gives the best results and the longest lasting color.</li>
            <li> If your hair touches your shoulders or longer you will want more than one bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially love the blue and purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> i love this hair dye</li>
            <li> i love the bleach too, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting a bit more cotton candy these days [...].     </li>
            <li> That a should remove most of the staining.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the color.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST DELIVERY THANK  </li>
            <li> Do not shampoo your hair again as this makes it fade much more</li>
            <li> This color looks better than what I got done at the salon.</li>
            <li> Its more watery too, which makes it easier to fully saturate all of your hair.  </li>
            <li> We tried EVERYTHING to make sure this doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Faded out sooner, but I still love this brand for hair dye.</li>
            <li> ok so I bought this kit at Walgreens not from Amazon...</li>
            <li> Also, make sure to wear petroleum jelly or else</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m super super super happy with the way my hair turned out!!</li>
            <li> The color came out great though and lasted for a decent amount of washes.</li>
            <li> umm all i can say is its a great product i love my new look and will probably purchase it again when my hair color fades.</li>
            <li> Have fun with it but follow the directions!!</li>
            <li> Takes about an hour or two to get done but comes out very nice and has so far lasted on my son for weeks with minimum fading!</li>
            <li> Of all rules, wearing gloves is the most important.</li>
            <li> I love the beautiful blue though  </li>
            <li> The most important thing is to WAIT.  </li>
            <li> The blue dye went on easy and was a brilliant color.  </li>
            <li> Do not take a full shower when rinsing it out!</li>
            <li> This brand is great with the colors and you need bleach blonde hair though to get the results and more then one box.</li>
            <li> i was doing the instructions and the product where easy to use.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trying to add it to some cream conditioner to easy the application, and that was the bluest disaster my bathroom every encountered.</li>
            <li> and it came out fairly easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;Permanent, vibrant, gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> It took about 6 weeks for it to fade significantly, though parts of it were still very bright blue.</li>
            <li> and I intend on trying again and again til I achieve my beautiful blue.</li>
            <li> You may want to experiment with another kind of short-lived dye first.  </li>
            <li> I decided to not use bleach this time, just because I did not want the blonde after affects (I&#x27;m a brunette), but it still came out beautifully.</li>
            <li> beach worked fine</li>
            <li> I used it and the bleach worked fine</li>
            <li> I hear manic panic works better for darker hair if you&#x27;re trying to get a bold color</li>
            <li> The blue is very bold and looks great on her.</li>
            <li> Nice vibrant color!</li>
            <li> I want rich rich royal beautiful blue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely it again, though, as the results were great.     </li>
            <li> The color was really light.</li>
            <li> Buy them cheap at Walmart, $2 for three caps, can be rinsed and reused if you need to.)  </li>
            <li> And the 2nd time around, it all turned out great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> the bleach can hurt yes, but it&#x27;s bleach, and the result is so PERFECT at the end that you won&#x27;t care if it stung for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but the amount is not nearly enough for a whole head of hair and the bleach isn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNANTLY, THIS KIT IS NOT STUPID PROOF.  </li>
            <li> I dyed my boyfriend hair and the color is soo pretty!!</li>
            <li> , it goes on super easily and stays strong and covers EXTREMELY well, and it fades beautifully.</li>
            <li> Incredible blue when first applied, but</li>
            <li> But again, very easy to get your hair fully saturated, and its very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> but it is fun!  </li>
            <li> but it is fun!  </li>
            <li> For my daughter&#x27;s first try though, it was an okay product.</li>
            <li> We originally dyed her hair in April, here it is July</li>
            <li> Instead of going with my gut feeling and keeping the dye in (significantly) longer, I followed the instructions.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> When I got this I was so excited.</li>
            <li> Kept getting comments on how nice my hair looked :) Be warned though, it may work differently for you...</li>
            <li> I got the Blue Envy dye from a CVS near me, neither me nor my friend (who helps me dye my hair, and is very awesome.)</li>
            <li> The color was beautiful at first, so if you have a system for making these colors last, I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> I use to use Special FX color for my hair</li>
            <li> I had Vaseline on my hairline and I was wearing gloves so there wasn&#x27;t really any spillage, even though it was my first time dyeing my own hair.</li>
            <li> There are only two good things about this dye (the two stars instead of one): The smell and the fact that it lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li> We used a whole box on just her tips and could&#x27;ve used more.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t TOO MUCH change from before hand, but it was okay.    </li>
            <li> (on weekends if I wasn&#x27;t busy, I wouldn&#x27;t use any kind of shampoo at all).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something more on the temporary side, maybe not so much this product - try washables instead.</li>
            <li> He was so horrified by the outcome he ended up getting his tried and true Manic Panic to fix it, guess what, NO color or coverage problems and NO bleeding.</li>
            <li> then the rest of my hair comes out looking gray which is not bad at all</li>
            <li> This kit is not bad.      </li>
            <li> The color is amazing, it is easy to use if you prepare properly, and it doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li> At that point, most of my hair was a very light blonde.</li>
            <li> but i found just hot water and a rag to work just fine in the tub.</li>
            <li> It also washed out quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily there are youtube video tutorials that helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> so the color will be more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I love how vibrant the color turns out after I dye my hair with the product.</li>
            <li> I noticed in the packaging that it states this in bold ink.  </li>
            <li> It bleeds all over the and fades really quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to be a really quick thing.  </li>
            <li> With any drastic color, they fade quickly..</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was packaged well, but I followed the instuctions a nd</li>
            <li> Be sure to use conditioner so your hair relaxes and feels normal again.  </li>
            <li> Color stays strong, i wish the blue was a bit brighter under indoor lighting, but in outside it looks so vibrant and awesome.</li>
            <li> I used Manic Panic Purple Haze and Hot Hot Pink today and I loved it!</li>
            <li> so you better be prepared to live with it.</li>
            <li> Both the bleach and dye exceeded my expectations, and I think I&#x27;ve found my new go-to dye brand for the most part.</li>
            <li> It still looked pretty good while fading, though (someone described it as \\&quot;What it would look like if people had naturally blue hair\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair red first, loved it.  </li>
            <li> The shower cap over the dye is a wonderful thing to have, especially for long hair.  </li>
            <li> Very beautiful, long lasting color</li>
            <li> This is my first time however doing my own hair with such a bold and unique color</li>
            <li> My hair is a light ash brown, and although it picks up color very well, I used the bleach for a bold result.    </li>
            <li> Looked more purple than blue which was fine with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, the color is very pretty and bright.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dye and expect something nice, but it is totally opposite.</li>
            <li> (FYI, the best things I&#x27;ve found for taking the blue off your skin are Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent, rubbing alcohol, or nail polish remover.)  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want color that bold, you should not bleach your hair first.  </li>
            <li> It was hardly runny, it was not thick, it was the perfect consistency.  </li>
            <li> that comes out when it holds right.</li>
            <li> I knew right away</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest trying it, especially since it&#x27;s rather cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color but fades pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bright blue, goes on much easier, and doesn&#x27;t stain as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the dye on for about an hour, give or take, and came out with friggin&#x27; brilliant blue hair, very even in tone.</li>
            <li> I have used lusty lavendar (which faded to a nice pink), and just used blue envy tonight and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> On top of that, somehow my roots were blue the rest was vaguely dark blue in the best of lights.</li>
            <li> Even if you follow the box and use all these tips, you may not do it right the first time.  </li>
            <li> The bleach did do VERY well, but color faded quick (aboout 2-3 wks).</li>
            <li> We did it outside &amp; used the hose over some river rocks &amp; no blue color mess anywhere :) looks great too even for a novice!</li>
            <li> Brought it to a very light blonde.</li>
            <li> Faded more naturally into my hair colour, as opposed to being a vibrant contrast.</li>
            <li> If you maintain the same color as I have, you might be able to just bleach the roots going forward.  </li>
            <li> Try to make sure that your ears are outside of the cap, but inside the saran wrap.  </li>
            <li> Much easier that way!  </li>
            <li> When I got to work it was very noticeable and I like it!     </li>
            <li> The only improvements this product needs to make is to include more bleach and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bleached my hair first before I started using this product, so maybe that effects the color.</li>
            <li> I love having  blue hair</li>
            <li> , it was literally hot coming out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an at-home product to dye my hair a non-natural color.  </li>
            <li> First, the color.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was a trial and error.</li>
            <li> the bleach was more than enough.  </li>
            <li> This kit is not difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> all and all was ok trying something else next time.</li>
            <li> This is not my first time using hair dye.</li>
            <li> but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> First, a confession.</li>
            <li> but I freakin&#x27; love this blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even as it fades, it&#x27;s still pretty.</li>
            <li> re-dye it every six or so weeks when I have a couple of hours free and so far, that&#x27;s been working out well.</li>
            <li> I love using the blue envy kit.</li>
            <li> This is the first brand that&#x27;s ever done that to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still has 99% of the vibrancy it had when I first colored it.</li>
            <li> pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks great when just done but it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> First off, the fading.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T, tried dying my hair with this product twice, thinking I must have screwed something up the first time.</li>
            <li> The bleach is included in the box which is pretty convenient</li>
            <li> May look good and vibrant for a week and a half, but isn&#x27;t worth spending the time putting in.</li>
            <li> Any good semi permanent dye is going to be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> maybe a little more detailed instructions for people that have never done this before.</li>
            <li> TWO hours later, her hair was bright blue.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a real messy deal when getting blue heair, but it does work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> and I love Blue so much.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair a gorgeous shade of deep blue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to be able to get just the blue and not the bleach because my bleach is stockpiling.)  </li>
            <li> and seeing the less than great reviews others gave it kind of confirmed my suspicions that this was just some wannabe lame attempt at hair dye.  </li>
            <li> As many have said you have to leave this on a long time.</li>
            <li> The color pretty much washed out when we rinsed her hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used pretty much all the brands out there, and done all the colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it at my local walmart, just an innocent 11 year old, right?</li>
            <li> but of course you&#x27;re going to have to buy things to protect your skin and clothes from the blue since it doesn&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
            <li> BE SMART ABOUT THIS.    </li>
            <li> We were hoping that the positive reviews were the accurate ones, but it turns out that the negative ones are much more on point.</li>
            <li> but since its now available in my local store I might try it out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I went over my whole head</li>
            <li> At that point, my hair was a light, stormy blue.  </li>
            <li> I keep using \\&quot;bold\\&quot; because that&#x27;s really what it is.  </li>
            <li> However, there are a number of extra things that you should have in order to make things go smoothly:  * Petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> (Yes, I am that much of a nerd) myself to start dying my hair at 2pm, it is now like 8pm.  </li>
            <li> I bleached the front section (The whole front of my head) and</li>
            <li> I have never, ever dyed my hair alone before and my hair turned out better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Aqua Rush is absolutely hideous as it fades.</li>
            <li> four times (store bought bleach and professional) and while a big portion of my hair is bordering white, there is a good chunk that is still very purple/pink.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this brand if you&#x27;re looking for something long-lasting.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so intense.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you&#x27;re careful when you&#x27;re at the gym</li>
            <li> I did not expect much from this product.  </li>
            <li> The bleach worked FAST,</li>
            <li> I really like these hair dyes</li>
            <li> I would really recommend splat colors if your looking to dye your hair.</li>
            <li> If you want the same kind of blue you see on Katy Perry or your Stormer Jem doll, this is what you use.  </li>
            <li> Also make sure that all of your towels are ones that you don&#x27;t mind getting full of color, and wait until your hair is completely dry to dress or sleep or you will stain your clothes and sheets (unless you use the aforementioned shower cap).  </li>
            <li> Its very easy to make a mess with this stuff, and it does stain.  </li>
            <li> I dyed it a normal color to get rid of that, but I will use Splat again!</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was looking for something different, unique, and definately vibrant.</li>
            <li> I kept the pink in my hair for about a month, didn&#x27;t really enjoy the shade on myself too much because of my pale complexion and the bright pink natural blushing of my cheeks, it just kind of clashed for me personally.</li>
            <li> I naturally have brown hair, so I bleached streaks first.</li>
            <li> I have short, light-brown hair, and the amount of dye in the box was more than enough.</li>
            <li> Fast forward again, this dye gave me the most uneven dye job I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> We only did her bangs, so we were able to save the rest of the bottle for later applications to brighten them up.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s more than enough product in the kit to dye a third of my six inch hair repeatedly before I have to buy another box.</li>
            <li> My hair was Aqua Rush at the beginning of this year and by March, my hair was still incredibly vibrant.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of it I bought the Special Effects Electric Blue and it works so much better.</li>
            <li> I used the dye eventually and the color came out a very rich, deep blue.</li>
            <li> I may have missed sections; I tend to take very hot, daily showers; some sections of my hair might not have been as bleached.</li>
            <li> First of all, the outside of the box was nearly perfect, yet the bag incasing the instructions was torn and somewhat dirty looking.</li>
            <li> color is VERY vivid though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this produces the most long lasting and intense results.</li>
            <li> even when you pay $100 in a salon so it was nice to have that extra color for a touch up application after the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> (I understand this isn&#x27;t high end dye</li>
            <li> We washed my hair out, dried it as best we could, and then applied about half a bottle of dye, stuck a bag on my head, and went back to card games.</li>
            <li> I thought they could have included a little more bleach.</li>
            <li> The color only seems to become more vivid and lasting with each dye</li>
            <li> When you get ready to apply the dye, definitely use the bleaching stuff first.  </li>
            <li> I did my normal routine</li>
            <li> Then, she washed it like normal.</li>
            <li> but the blue is pretty intense in the areas where I bleached.</li>
            <li> nice dark blue!</li>
            <li> Have done this many times with other dyes for only a large strand of hair.</li>
            <li> I had bought two boxes to be sure, though, which turned out well as I needed two sets of bleach (mostly due to messing up, not due to lack).</li>
            <li> Blowdried, then I got my black dye and colored the rest of my hair and over parts of the blue even, to tidy it all up.</li>
            <li> but it worked great though yes a little messy when you wash your hair after you dye it</li>
            <li> im new to dying my hair (i have grown it out since my profile pic)</li>
            <li> and i wanted to do something new but not too drastic</li>
            <li> Love the color for the first few days, but holy cow does it fade fast!</li>
            <li> so i uesed the bleach which made my hair light sorbet of colors like yellow and orange, but then i put the hair dye on and got the blue i been craving.</li>
            <li> However, I have found that a bit of stain remover on the blue areas before washing takes it out much better than expected.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because my hair was really really blonde, but it did look neat for a few weeks until it faded into a mucky kind of grey-blue.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is already a medium to light blonde, you will likely not need the bleach either.  </li>
            <li> The water never ran clear!</li>
            <li> (The first time it was over a week because my ears and neck were so blue).  </li>
            <li> After the first application I figured that I had simply brushed up against my scalp without realizing it.</li>
            <li> Since I obviously can&#x27;t bleach my son&#x27;s hair first now, we&#x27;ll have to see how this works out.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve bought other dyes without the bleach for the same price or more</li>
            <li> First time using a product such as this</li>
            <li> However other brands aren&#x27;t as accessible and I have always had to order them online which can be a pain, waiting for shipping and all that.  </li>
            <li> The first color was red.</li>
            <li> You should be fine as long as you don&#x27;t have two left feet for hands.</li>
            <li> It does originally make your hair blue, but it causes a huge mess and fades in a very short time unless you choose to never wash your hair.</li>
            <li> (Prior to trying this, I used Special Effects Blue Velvet which was amazing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We bleached the ends (for dip dye look) and after about an hour and a half, her hair was a light auburn.</li>
            <li> Unless you naturally have very blonde hair, you won&#x27;t get the desired results unless you bleach it first.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use a dark towel to minimize the appearance of stains...or just invest in a blue one!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price, maybe not worth the maintenance if you&#x27;re dying your whole head.</li>
            <li> Used almost the entire bottle to ensure coverage as well as increased time left in and rinsed with cool water.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my son has dirty blonde hair and isn&#x27;t picky but it would have been nice to have the bleach to get a true blue.</li>
            <li> More so when wet, but it does rub off a bit even when dry.  </li>
            <li> I rinse until the water runs mostly clear or at least very light in color.</li>
            <li> However, Blue Envy splat is so water that applying it is a huge mess and an absolute nightmare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a little while now and have tried several of the more well known brands.</li>
            <li> The color actually rinsed out of the hair and the color is so vibrant!</li>
            <li> I liked that it comes with bleach and not just the dye, so it costs half as much as other brands when you take that into consideration.  </li>
            <li> When rinsing, the water won&#x27;t ever run clear...</li>
            <li> run clear...</li>
            <li> Of course, the bleach job was fantastic and I was a partial platinum blonde when I went home, so maybe that helped</li>
            <li> Your whole scalp under your hair will be blue for a while....</li>
            <li> so I cover everything really well (obviously not over my face...</li>
            <li> If you have access to a rinsing sink and a friend to help with this step (or if you can set up another appointment to go back to your hairdresser,) I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> (Then again, my male friends never complain of this, so it might not happen to men as much).</li>
            <li> I was irritated that the box was completely destroyed and when I opened it, all of the bleaching liquid solution had spilled into the box and destroyed the instructions.</li>
            <li> I found a whole patch of hair in the back that I had missed after I washed the dye out and had to do touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the strongest of its type in hair colors.</li>
            <li> If you want to bleach your hair completely, buy professional bleach</li>
            <li> [I have medium-dark brown hair naturally.]</li>
            <li> Professional and over the counter.</li>
            <li> I went to a salon and had a professional bleach it for about $50.</li>
            <li> Lots of vigorous handwashing was necessary as this dye is very watery and gets in places.</li>
            <li> -old</li>
            <li> would like to note that while my color is bleeding constantly I haven&#x27;t noticed any real fading.</li>
            <li> It does miracles (thus far) for it, though it still is sticking to my roots</li>
            <li> The bleach is lacking, I&#x27;d suggest grabbing a box of frost n glow or something, especially if bleaching your whole head.</li>
            <li> To call it permanent is complete BS.</li>
            <li> BUT the hair dye was old.</li>
            <li> If you step near this product in a Sally&#x27;s, or Walmart, or wherever you go, walk away.</li>
            <li> Have fun with it and be careful during application and styling</li>
            <li> Have fun with it and be careful during application and styling</li>
            <li> Also, put something over your counters - there&#x27;s a few blue stains in my sink that I haven&#x27;t been able to get out yet.</li>
            <li> He used the bleach kit to lighten his medium brown, super short hair (buzzed almost all around and a 4\\&quot; wide 4\\&quot; high like mohawk)which worked well.</li>
            <li> fades quite quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to last so long.</li>
            <li> The water and dye will splatter everywhere and make a HUGE mess!</li>
            <li> However, I found that it was EXTREMELY messy, so be prepared to thoroughly clean your tub afterwards</li>
            <li> Also i put too much on my roots and had barely any left for the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> suggest L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach and a different brand of dye for anyone looking to dye their hair blue.</li>
            <li> My older son went swimming in a pool and the chlorine bleached all of the blue out.</li>
            <li> If you bleach your hair first, it will very likely end up the same color as the models on the box if you follow instructions and take your time.  </li>
            <li> The color is deep and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It either came out too light and grayish looking, or too dark to even tell it was blue.</li>
            <li> It takes about an hour to really wash out the extra dye, and even then it takes 2 or 3 shampoos to really get the extra blue out.</li>
            <li> The bleach worked fine, but the dye washed out completely after only a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more permanent and harder to wash/bleach out than permanent black hair dye.</li>
            <li> ; I even blow dried my hair out because the box says the color sticks better to dry hair.</li>
            <li> :) my hair is pretty thick and already dyed black</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something new and different, you&#x27;ll definately wanna give this product a try.</li>
            <li> This purple will be messy for about 3 more shampoos, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Luckily after a few washes this evened out, but that did not help.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can barely see any blue and that is only under certain lighting.  </li>
            <li> 50 minutes later, we take the pseudo-wrap off, and my hair is a light brown to a pale blond.</li>
            <li> My original hair color, except a shade darker, with little flicks of blue.    </li>
            <li> The blue is insanely vivid.</li>
            <li> We have blue stains on our pillows because the dye actually went through the pillowcase, and we were very careful to make sure her hair was dry every night before we went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say half of the dye washed right</li>
            <li> Just take the paper towel again and let it sit directly over the stain for a little while, probably as long as your clean up takes, and then wipe with water.</li>
            <li> Update: nixed the bleach since it was ruined but the blue looks great on my dirty blonde boys.</li>
            <li> The blue color don&#x27;t show at all except for on my roots which clearly isn&#x27;t what I was going for.</li>
            <li> at first it&#x27;s too dark but</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 9 year old son for his birthday and Walmart has been out of the blue for months.</li>
            <li> I had my hair professionally colored blue a number of times.  </li>
            <li> We barely scraped by with the amount of dye given to us, and had to use it all.</li>
            <li> Lumpy dye, completely unclear instructions, and I had a reaction to the dye that made my left eye swell shut.</li>
            <li> maybe it would look like that on natural blonde hair...</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m curious to see my blue hair after i bleach it since i perfer sky blue instead of deep dark blue honestly..</li>
            <li> They are either blonde, white or blue and I dont know how in the world they are not all blue since I wasted most of the dye on the front part.</li>
            <li> It actually fades to hot pink.</li>
            <li> The red lasted at least four months, very strong and slowly fading a nice dark pink.  </li>
            <li> This time, my hair was a vivid blue, similar to that on the box.     </li>
            <li> so by following the instructions i succesfully dyed parts of my hair, there is enough ingredients to dye really long hair with this product, though at first i was scetchy cause of the low price</li>
            <li> I have blue and black hair right now.</li>
            <li> Fast forward, rinse it, my hair is this dark almost black colour, and very very bleh.</li>
            <li> first time I did it, I felt that the color had not been dark enough.</li>
            <li> You need to saturate the hair you want colored completely, so one box is not enough for an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> it looks like someone has opened the box and closed it without much care several times.</li>
            <li> In no later then a week it was nearly all the way faded from my brothers hair, even on the bleached blonde.</li>
            <li> She has said it runs a little after she first put it in her hair</li>
            <li> My sink has one tiny, light dye spot due to being dumb and squeezing too much dye out.    </li>
            <li> The other cool thing is I used the color stay conditioner packet with the black dye.</li>
            <li> Most of my hair was this half blue-half brunette mix, and the color represented only had a few tiny streaks mixed in, with hints of blonde in some places.</li>
            <li> All in all, it took me about 2 and a half hours for the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> The first time we did this all, it was a mess!  </li>
            <li> It stayed in fine week one (duh!), but as soon as she started washing her hair the next week it started fading.</li>
            <li> The first couple of washes, it will run so use dark towels and dry your hair before wandering out into the world.</li>
            <li> She applied it very evenly, as there was so little bleach.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to stock up on some heavy duty tub cleaner in the mean time.</li>
            <li> It left very little color and only in certain places.</li>
            <li> When your hair is dry and not wet, then lay on your bed or whatevers.</li>
            <li> although more irritating than other brands of hair bleach Ive tried, it was tolerable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it would have lasted past 6 weeks; I had to go back to a more natural-looking brown for a family function.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble keeping unnatural-shaded dyes in my hair, but I put this in last summer and it stayed vibrant for over a month.</li>
            <li> For like a week straight after coloring... every time my boys got their hair wet, the blue would run down their face and on everything</li>
            <li> Especially since it didn&#x27;t take long to get blonde.  </li>
            <li> On the second application, the other part of my hair barely dyed at all.</li>
            <li> but after a few washes she still has incredibly vivid blue with no fading.</li>
            <li> the  blue lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I have to dye it black every six weeks just to be clear.</li>
            <li> Typically, I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal or Garnier products in natural shades.  </li>
            <li> almost black, naturally.</li>
            <li> She only used shampoo to wash her hair before, then we waited until it was extremely dry.</li>
            <li> He wanted to try this because he liked the color, but all he got was red with anger.</li>
            <li> After an hour, it still wasn&#x27;t bleached evenly or enough, so we used the second bottle and spent another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Even after a couple of long washes later, the color remained for as long as eight months.</li>
            <li> , the color was intense and gorgeous, I dyed over it once when my roots started showing real bad around the two month mark.</li>
            <li> The actual color depends not only on your natural hair color, but on your natural hair type (thick, thin, etc) - I have thin naturally dirty blonde hair and the pink fetish shade came out so vibrant it was more of a maroon color than a light pink.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised and came in earlier than I expected</li>
            <li> it just fades to a carnation pink (originally red).  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t know how long, but the instructions should tell you and also you can see it lighten).  </li>
            <li> how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I bleached again after a haircut and got a cool-looking blonde and pink combination.  </li>
            <li> I know this sounds strange, but it works...make a paste with cigarette ashes or fireplace ashes and a drop of water..rub onto dyed skin area..stinky but it does get the dye off.</li>
            <li> Every surface you touch, look at, every article of clothing, hands, neck, everything will be blue if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cruelty-free, and it lasts a long time depending on your hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> The next color I used was a shade of pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still bleeding every time it gets even remotely wet 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li> Leave the dye in as long as you can.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair buy two or three boxes.</li>
            <li> to be honest i&#x27;m a little afraid to try and use this as dye.</li>
            <li> so we were not aware it requires bleaching the hair prior to putting the hair color on.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t dye my hair just because I have black hair, and i don&#x27;t know how would it work for other natural color hair.</li>
            <li> Once you get it rinsed out, dry it well to minimize it rubbing off.  </li>
            <li> Once you get it rinsed out, dry it well to minimize it rubbing off.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to wait until your hair is bone dry to dress, you will want a shower cap.  </li>
            <li> The bleaching process will dry out your hair, and it might stiffen up a lot after you&#x27;ve shampooed it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who wants showstopping (seriously, just stand in the sun and watch people&#x27;s heads whip around for a doubletake)</li>
            <li> Apply dye, leave dye in until it is dry, wash out.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a deep blue, but it came out to be aqua, even green.</li>
            <li> I then carefully started to dye my hair blue CAREFULLY.  </li>
            <li> hope you like the color blue because you will be blue for a few days.</li>
            <li> My hair is green O_O.</li>
            <li> I plan on taking my hair loose in another week or so and maybe try for a purplish color</li>
            <li> 2 days after I dyed it and blue just started drizzling down my face.</li>
            <li> A word of advice: If you are going to wash hair in the sink/shower and it&#x27;s white, place some plastic down so not to tarnish the sink or shower.</li>
            <li> I was really frustrated then, but we fixed it up, did the entire process, and it looked even enough by the time we were ready for the dye.    </li>
            <li> and I wanted to have black and blue hair</li>
            <li> it almost resembled black and I am totally dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I left the dye in for about an hour and a half, then washed it out.</li>
            <li> and i have to keep re dying it if i don\\&quot;t want blonde strips in my black hair.</li>
            <li> I put some on unbleached sections too; the color did not turn out on my black (Asian) hair.</li>
            <li> I did blue streaks with black.</li>
            <li> (we did some blue some jet black).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not blue, it&#x27;s black.</li>
            <li> but then I put the blue dye in for the time it told me and it turned my hair black again</li>
            <li> very limited fading just before my next coloring of black.</li>
            <li> If it was red I&#x27;d be a little freaked out.</li>
            <li> gloves - the gloves provided were very strange and not exactly usable.  </li>
            <li> it was so bad it ddd not stay in for more then</li>
            <li> is the only problem I have with the product, I just wish it would last longer, or at least fade into an acceptable color as well.</li>
            <li> but the way its all looking on my hair looks messy and definitely looks</li>
            <li> I wet my hair this morning</li>
            <li> I usually carefully hold the front while she stretches it around the rest.  </li>
            <li> With gloves and careful planning you can avoid a lot of the \\&quot;get it off your skin\\&quot; part.  </li>
            <li> I use the gloves to style it if it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> I use the gloves to style it if it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> Washed it out CAREFULLY, with paper towels in the sink.    </li>
            <li> - BE CAREFUL.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> when this was shipped to me to box was soaking wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blonde sister decided to try some of it too but her hair turned green after a week or two (again, not bleached prior to application).</li>
            <li> So be careful,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not much closer to 30 than I would like to admit.</li>
            <li> It tends to bleach out to cotton candy pink.</li>
            <li> I suppose, so if you don&#x27;t like pink, avoid.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wear a cap and I wasn&#x27;t being overly careful</li>
            <li> Anytime his hair got wet the die would run off his hair and on his clothes</li>
            <li> and it ruined the clothes he did where when he got wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days since I applied it</li>
            <li> Well I spent my money from Christmas on it and on the box</li>
            <li> I let the dye sit for approximately 15-25 minites, i dont keep ti.e, i just wash it out after my latest episode of criminal minds is over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s April and the only reason it&#x27;s pale is because I bleached over it.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, though, it was fading (probably because my hair was wet for the initial dying), so I re-dyed it using the other bottle of dye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and liked other splat products, but hated the blue.</li>
            <li> On average, I wash my hair in the shower anywhere between two to three times per week, the days between I would just rinse my hair and use a dry shampoo on it so it wouldn&#x27;t be greasy</li>
            <li> I only used up half a bottle (or less) of the hair</li>
            <li> We carefully followed the directions from other reviewers when we put this in her hair.</li>
            <li> At least this comes with bleach included in the box, but it doesn&#x27;t last terribly long.</li>
            <li> (I had joked once after styling it wet without gloves that it looked like I had strangled about a dozen Smurfs!)</li>
            <li> (I had joked once after styling it wet without gloves that it looked like I had strangled about a dozen Smurfs!)</li>
            <li> I have never had this happen with any other hair bleach.</li>
            <li> i have used other dyes</li>
            <li> Splat is not like other kinds of hair dye.  </li>
            <li> She got an allergy reaction she had never had before using other hair coloring products.</li>
            <li> A couple other tools (besides what was provided)</li>
            <li> I dye small sections of my hair only.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even last two weeks and washed out little by little every time I took a shower.</li>
            <li> Splat Blue Envy was a waste of time, money, and towels!</li>
            <li> In the morning, I take the gloves that my hairdresser gave me and very carefully take off the saran wrap and then the cap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very careful both times not to get any color on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Every time your hair gets wet, the color will bleed a little.  </li>
            <li> Within a week or two is was hard to even notice she had blue in her hair at all</li>
            <li> I have dark brownish hair</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as dark as the box</li>
            <li> If you want the color to last, you will need to let it sit for at LEAST 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> If you plan on doing your entire head, buy at least two boxes depending on thickness and length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> ive aleays gone over my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> The dye on my dark hair lasts for about 4-5 weeks and then starts to fade to a lighter blue/green shade, which is when i re-dye it.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks it is faded purple, which I still like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest bleaching your hair twice (for dark hair).  </li>
            <li> my hair is naturally dark dark dark brown</li>
            <li> Anyway, my hair is just at dark as it was before I applied the bleach.</li>
            <li> it said it would last at least a month.</li>
            <li> You may not need it for the dyeing, since the color dye is extremely thick and will likely not drip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really thick blue water so even if you are just using water</li>
            <li> I put down a plastic table cover for any \\&quot;splats\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Please be careful and try under armpit  or any other small area and see if you get a reaction.</li>
            <li> I know this from experience because a little still ended up on the sink and my roommates would have had a cow if they saw it.</li>
            <li> The uneven fading might be due to a number of factors - I redyed it without any help, so</li>
            <li> Not a pretty shade of green either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I dyed my hair black.</li>
            <li> I put half the bottle in my hair, wrapped it up, and then went to bed.</li>
            <li> Less than 24 hours passed from dying it.  </li>
            <li> It came out black as night.</li>
            <li> it still faded very quickly to an odd grayish color.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown, was dyed a very dark black and the bleach still lightened it.</li>
            <li> and it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up with a mess.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how people are complaining about making a mess.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> It makes a mess.</li>
            <li> I always cut mine with a little bit of condition, put it on slightly damp hair, put a shower cap on, and let it set for about 5 hours.</li>
            <li> They could also make it a little less messy, but I guess dye will be dye.     </li>
            <li> As I sat in the sun today it has lightened a little.</li>
            <li> Then we realized, they had put so little bleach in, and it was so ineffective.</li>
            <li> A little EVERY time you shower.</li>
            <li> The bleach did burn a little but no more than any other bleach I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> There was no more staining than any other hair dye in the tub.</li>
            <li> Horribly messy to put on, then it bleeds out all over everything for a week, then you can&#x27;t get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use this product there are a few things to remember.  </li>
            <li> It did not deliver and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> dye though, so I&#x27;ll be going another round with Splat.</li>
            <li> And the really worse thing is that you will get all you bathtub blue because eveytime you wash you hair the dyes comes out</li>
            <li> Just semi saturate a paper towel and rub over the bottom of your tub and let sit for a few minutes, and then rinse with water.</li>
            <li> I experimented with crimson, the green shade, berry blast.</li>
            <li> it does start fading within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Just go slow and be careful.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be trying that in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was so made wasted my money for nothing</li>
            <li> In fact for the longest time I didn&#x27;t even consider using this brand, seeing as it was being offered at walmart, and the name is pretty cheesy, and the pictures of the people are admittedly a little dumb as well.</li>
            <li> but I will have to buy bleach and vol 30 or 40 cream developer to get the hair to a pale blond</li>
            <li> As I stated, it&#x27;s not easy...</li>
            <li> As I stated, it&#x27;s not easy...</li>
            <li> It does fade very slightly every time I wash it</li>
            <li> You tend to get a lot of weird looks and comments in public - I&#x27;ve had people follow me down the street to ask why my hair was dyed</li>
            <li> I started dying my hair crazy colors in Jr. High</li>
            <li> this this sucks for dark hair.</li>
            <li> The color was seriously too dark</li>
            <li> Then rinse with cold water until it runs clear.</li>
            <li> Not sure of this brand</li>
            <li> MESSY!</li>
            <li> MESSY!</li>
            <li> Then I just honestly carelessly put in the blue.</li>
            <li> Not sure if a bottle of bleach is needed in every box</li>
            <li> I usually buy these dyes from Walmart</li>
            <li> and it said on the package that it will not come off if the color get on skin, ball shit!</li>
            <li> Then to make it worse, if it gets wet at all it bleeds.</li>
            <li> Also, listen to the previous posts about NOT washing it out in the shower!!</li>
            <li> So while the bleeding is pretty annoying, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be affecting the color at all.</li>
            <li> hardly covered it all</li>
            <li> Purples are hard to turn out--this one did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that hard.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have common sense, get someone who does.  </li>
            <li> She only washed her hair with cold water to get the dye out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real messy thouh as the others say.</li>
            <li> I hate how fast it fades.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair you need 2 kits.</li>
            <li> AFter, your hair is like GREEN.... not a happy person.</li>
            <li> And i mean line a couple of highlights in my bangs and a couple on each side of my head.</li>
            <li> I mean I followed their directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I tried Manic Panic purple once, and it was a failure.  </li>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS STEP!!!!  </li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter, her hair is THICK THICK THICK and very dark brown with a weird texture (We are Sicilian)</li>
            <li> I was not stained too badly, besides being dumb and running my hand through my hair before it was completely washed out.  </li>
            <li> The bleach is nasty, but a shower cap (purchased separately) will help with the smell, mess, and generally ickiness.  </li>
            <li> - DON&#x27;T BE DUMB.  </li>
            <li> I have never successful bleached out this hair color</li>
            <li> On the edge of the sink, if youre stupid lime me and always forget to put something down, it takes a little longer soaking to remove those.</li>
            <li> keep in mind that it stains scalp and skin and also it&#x27;s a tough color to remove from your hair.</li>
            <li> I hate to give this anything less than 5 stars simply because I am pro crazy hair colors</li>
            <li> Horrible product the box came soaked and the bottle was opened the whole package was ruined..</li>
            <li> The absolute WORST color I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li> My front roots are all confused.</li>
            <li> (I have really thin hair).  </li>
            <li> This was the absolute worst!  </li>
            <li> but seriously!)</li>
            <li> We used the bleach according to direction and WOW talk about a shocking difference!</li>
            <li> Just terrible, it washed out within one wash and it went to this messy green.</li>
            <li> but it fades into either an ugly grey or an ugly blondish color.</li>
            <li> I was seriously wrong.</li>
            <li> But needless to say that your hair will be colored.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or cash on this worthless garbage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I did not allow her to bleach her hair, the dye did not show up as displayed and was difficult to discern in her brunette hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot attest to the bleach as my hair was pre-bleached.</li>
            <li> Go ahead, but it is definitely the worst hair dye I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> I used vasoline, gloves and wasn&#x27;t careless.</li>
            <li> I might recommend it to my worst enemy to trick them into getting blue stains all over their house.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely useless product.</li>
            <li> Came out horribly blotchy and lighter than a teal but darker than a baby blue.</li>
            <li> you did it wrong.</li>
            <li> False addvertizing!</li>
            <li> The gloves in the box are very thin.  </li>
            <li> I give four stars because the bleach included in the package is awful, it is not very powerful and will not pull the color out.</li>
            <li> But I knew this color stains like crazy, so I put it on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to do sections at a time, this is a process.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m desperately trying to get rid of it using Prell brand shampoo.</li>
            <li> But it is NOT for the faint of heart!  </li>
            <li> But it is NOT for the faint of heart!  </li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> The box on the side was misleading for starters, it had no haircap, so we were forced to use the plastic bag we had gotten this awful kit in.</li>
            <li> It will badly stain your hands if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It looked bad.    </li>
            <li> Which I guess isn&#x27;t a bad thing, for some people.    </li>
            <li> It was so ugly looking.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the bleach because I hate using any and all bleach on my hair.</li>
            <li> this is just crap</li>
            <li> /&gt;i hate it do not buy</li>
            <li> I hated that stuff</li>
            <li> The box was damaged very badly and the dye didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> We were very disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> Then the dye has awful coverage</li>
            <li> This hair dye is the worst you can buy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The bleach in this kit works great, but the coloring did not have the intensity I was looking for. It also washed out quickly.</li>
            <li> Horrible product the box came soaked and the bottle was opened the whole package was ruined.. don&#x27;t know if it was handling or the actual packaging it&#x27;s self</li>
            <li> the  blue lasts very long. at first it&#x27;s too dark but thats probably cause i left it in a while. The color came out great though and lasted for a decent amount of washes. keep in mind that it stains scalp and skin and also it&#x27;s a tough color to remove from your hair.</li>
            <li> Followed steps to the tee¡. Have done this many times with other dyes for only a large strand of hair. No go. My hair is green O_O.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised and came in earlier than I expected</li>
            <li> The absolute WORST color I&#x27;ve ever used!  Horribly messy to put on, then it bleeds out all over everything for a week, then you can&#x27;t get rid of it.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to bleach over it and even went to a salon. Nothing works - it just fades to a carnation pink (originally red).  Anything is better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a real messy deal when getting blue heair, but it does work wonderfully! I had red hair so i uesed the bleach which made my hair light sorbet of colors like yellow and orange, but then i put the hair dye on and got the blue i been craving. It&#x27;s real messy thouh as the others say. Of all rules, wearing gloves is the most important. Wear them from start to finish.. My hands turned blue when i was in the shower and rubbed my hands through my hair when rinsing, which never happened before to me. When your hair is dry and not wet, then lay on your bed or whatevers. It&#x27;s a good product and I really wanna try the green hair dye next but thats next month and i&#x27;m curious to see my blue hair after i bleach it since i perfer sky blue instead of deep dark blue honestly..</li>
            <li> I hate to give this anything less than 5 stars simply because I am pro crazy hair colors and I love Blue so much. This is my first time however doing my own hair with such a bold and unique color and I intend on trying again and again til I achieve my beautiful blue. This however did not hold on my hair. I spots and my roots are brighter then ever with Blue. then the rest of my hair comes out looking gray which is not bad at all but the way its all looking on my hair looks messy and definitely looks like I ha dno idea what I was doing. I wet my hair this morning 2 days after I dyed it and blue just started drizzling down my face. If it was red I&#x27;d be a little freaked out. I wash my hair thoroughly so that may be the problem why it didnt stick. Also i put too much on my roots and had barely any left for the rest of my hair. But I conditioned it through. My front roots are all confused. They are either blonde, white or blue and I dont know how in the world they are not all blue since I wasted most of the dye on the front part. This brand is great with the colors and you need bleach blonde hair though to get the results and more then one box. I don&#x27;t want pastel blue I want rich rich royal beautiful blue. So I will by 3 boxes in case. I will try again. Not sure of this brand but since its now available in my local store I might try it out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it you may be able to do better then I did. I love the beautiful blue though  that comes out when it holds right.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it every 6-8 weeks since May and it makes my hair a gorgeous shade of deep blue that I get compliments on daily!  If you&#x27;re going to use this product there are a few things to remember.  For one, blue hair is not \\&quot;easy\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not like just going to the store and getting the auburn dye from one of the big name companies.  It will turn things blue even when you&#x27;ve had it on for weeks.  More so when wet, but it does rub off a bit even when dry.  However, I have found that a bit of stain remover on the blue areas before washing takes it out much better than expected.  When you get ready to apply the dye, definitely use the bleaching stuff first.  Unless you naturally have very blonde hair, you won&#x27;t get the desired results unless you bleach it first.  If you maintain the same color as I have, you might be able to just bleach the roots going forward.  This will help to keep your hair from getting fried.  Also when you are prepping yourself to use the blue dye, smear Vaseline all along your hairline but not into your hairline.  You want to give a barrier between the dye and your skin, but you don&#x27;t want to make it so the dye doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to your hair.  Your whole scalp under your hair will be blue for a while....it&#x27;s just the way it is.  I happen to bring this kit to my regular hairdresser and she applies it all for me.  If your hairdresser is not as awesome as mine, then try to employ a friend.  I personally would not recommend doing this by yourself unless MAYBE if you have very short hair.  My hairdresser bleaches my roots (I don&#x27;t know how long, but the instructions should tell you and also you can see it lighten).  She then rinses out the bleach and covers all of my hair with the blue goo.  (My hair is very similar in length to the girl on the box.  I need 2 bottles of the blue, but only one of the bleach for just my roots...this is one reason I took away one star.  I&#x27;d really like to be able to get just the blue and not the bleach because my bleach is stockpiling.)  Then she covers my hair with a \\&quot;shower cap\\&quot; type cover.  BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS STEP!!!!  I usually carefully hold the front while she stretches it around the rest.  The first time we did this all, it was a mess!  We had her, myself, her daughter and her husband all helping...and we all got some blue on our hands!  (FYI, the best things I&#x27;ve found for taking the blue off your skin are Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent, rubbing alcohol, or nail polish remover.)  With gloves and careful planning you can avoid a lot of the \\&quot;get it off your skin\\&quot; part.  This last time we did it I was actually able to wear my hair up in about a day or two.  (The first time it was over a week because my ears and neck were so blue).  After she gets me set in the cap, I head home.  I then put saran wrap around my head so I cover everything really well (obviously not over my face...but with the warning labels I&#x27;ve seen, I thought I&#x27;d better mention it.)  Try to make sure that your ears are outside of the cap, but inside the saran wrap.  I then keep it on for HOURS.  I have actually started sleeping in it.  It&#x27;s more like a \\&quot;pigment\\&quot; than a \\&quot;dye\\&quot;, so it can stay on without damaging your hair.  In the morning, I take the gloves that my hairdresser gave me and very carefully take off the saran wrap and then the cap.  I then hop in the shower and try to keep my hair off my back as much as possible.  If you have access to a rinsing sink and a friend to help with this step (or if you can set up another appointment to go back to your hairdresser,) I highly recommend it!  Much easier that way!  Keep in mind that as you rinse the dye out, it will stain.  Your skin can get blue, your tub can get blue, and your towel will definitely get blue.  Make sure to use a dark towel to minimize the appearance of stains...or just invest in a blue one!  Rinse it out...don&#x27;t shampoo it at this point.  (You can use conditioner though.)  When rinsing, the water won&#x27;t ever run clear...it will still be blue.  Once you get it rinsed out, dry it well to minimize it rubbing off.  I use the gloves to style it if it&#x27;s wet.  (I had joked once after styling it wet without gloves that it looked like I had strangled about a dozen Smurfs!) Or I use one of the methods for getting the blue off my hands.  As I stated, it&#x27;s not easy...but it is fun!  It is a gorgeous shade and I absolutely love it!  But it is NOT for the faint of heart!  Have fun with it and be careful during application and styling and you too can have enviable blue hair!ver run clear...it will still be blue.

            <li> I thought they could have included a little more bleach. I did not bleach my hair. I bleached a track of weave. The bleach that was included was a small packet that got the hair from dark brown to dirty blond but did not get it as light as I would have liked. I used the dye eventually and the color came out a very rich, deep blue. I have dark brownish hair and I wanted to have black and blue hair so I dyed my hair black. No one could tell that the blue was there when I finished my hair last night. As I sat in the sun today it has lightened a little. When I got to work it was very noticeable and I like it!     The only improvements this product needs to make is to include more bleach and maybe a little more detailed instructions for people that have never done this before. I am african american and I have never bleached hair before and would have liked more info. Luckily there are youtube video tutorials that helped me tremendously. I plan on taking my hair loose in another week or so and maybe try for a purplish color but I will have to buy bleach and vol 30 or 40 cream developer to get the hair to a pale blond so the color will be more vibrant. They could also make it a little less messy, but I guess dye will be dye.     A word of advice: If you are going to wash hair in the sink/shower and it&#x27;s white, place some plastic down so not to tarnish the sink or shower. I placed grocery bags in the sink and this helped a lot because it will stain, so beware. If you do get some of it on the sink and cannot get it up, use some bleach all purpose cleaner. If you spray the spots of the dye and leave it there for about three minutes and then wash and scrub for about five minutes, it will come out. I know this from experience because a little still ended up on the sink and my roommates would have had a cow if they saw it. Otherwise, this is a great product and it&#x27;s worth the purchase, just check out the seperate bleach and cream developer for better results!    **Update** The dye got everywhere when I used it. The dye got on the walls, sink, floor, and my hands. It took me actually bleaching hair again to get the dye off my hands 2 1/2 weeks later. The color was seriously too dark it almost resembled black and I am totally dissatisfied. I used Manic Panic Purple Haze and Hot Hot Pink today and I loved it! It did not stain the sink, floor, walls, or my hands. The color actually rinsed out of the hair and the color is so vibrant! I say ditch Splat! and get on with Manic Panic!</li>
            <li> I understand that this works for a lot of people. This product did not work for me and I will never buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the bleach burnt my scalp. I have never had this happen with any other hair bleach. It didn&#x27;t just have a \\&quot;burning\\&quot; feeling, It actually burnt through my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did dye my hair twice with the color. There are only two good things about this dye (the two stars instead of one): The smell and the fact that it lasts FOREVER. I&#x27;m not kidding you when I say forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I did it, I felt that the color had not been dark enough. As many have said you have to leave this on a long time. I had done only part of my hair and didn&#x27;t like it. So I went over my whole head (this would lead to one part being darker and I knew that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful both times not to get any color on my scalp. After the first application I figured that I had simply brushed up against my scalp without realizing it. I was seriously wrong. This stuff bled all over my scalp. It was horrible. On the second application, the other part of my hair barely dyed at all. It left very little color and only in certain places. Luckily after a few washes this evened out, but that did not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this dye lasts forever (as I said before). I dyed my hair in November. It&#x27;s April and the only reason it&#x27;s pale is because I bleached over it. And it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> My wife has been a Splat user for about 3 years now. She only trusts the brand to bleach/color her hair. The blue is very bold and looks great on her. She has said it runs a little after she first put it in her hair but after a few washes she still has incredibly vivid blue with no fading.</li>
            <li> This colour worked soooooo wonderfully on my hair. I have always had trouble keeping unnatural-shaded dyes in my hair, but I put this in last summer and it stayed vibrant for over a month. Definitally the best stuff I&#x27;ve tried to far, loads better than manic panic. Kept getting comments on how nice my hair looked :) Be warned though, it may work differently for you...I strongly suggest trying it, especially since it&#x27;s rather cheap.</li>
            <li> Love it. Awesome color!</li>
            <li> I have short, light-brown hair, and the amount of dye in the box was more than enough. I had bought two boxes to be sure, though, which turned out well as I needed two sets of bleach (mostly due to messing up, not due to lack). If you have longer hair (mine was at the time above my ears), you might want to get another box to have extras. You&#x27;ll also want to get something to put over your head, like a shower cap.    I bleached my hair using the bleach included in the box. A friend helped me apply the bleach to my hair; it took about 15 minutes for her to do it evenly. Then, as there&#x27;s no sort of shower cap or anything, we stuck a plastic bag around my hair, taped it on, and played card games with friends for an hour, checking every 15 or so minutes. After an hour, it still wasn&#x27;t bleached evenly or enough, so we used the second bottle and spent another 30 minutes. At that point, most of my hair was a very light blonde. We washed my hair out, dried it as best we could, and then applied about half a bottle of dye, stuck a bag on my head, and went back to card games. I left the dye in for about an hour and a half, then washed it out. At that point, my hair was a light, stormy blue.  Within a few days, though, it was fading (probably because my hair was wet for the initial dying), so I re-dyed it using the other bottle of dye. I put half the bottle in my hair, wrapped it up, and then went to bed. The next morning, about eight hours later, I washed it out. This time, my hair was a vivid blue, similar to that on the box.     It took about 6 weeks for it to fade significantly, though parts of it were still very bright blue. The uneven fading might be due to a number of factors - I redyed it without any help, so I may have missed sections; I tend to take very hot, daily showers; some sections of my hair might not have been as bleached. It still looked pretty good while fading, though (someone described it as \\&quot;What it would look like if people had naturally blue hair\\&quot;). I&#x27;m not sure how long it would have lasted past 6 weeks; I had to go back to a more natural-looking brown for a family function. I&#x27;d definitely it again, though, as the results were great.     You tend to get a lot of weird looks and comments in public - I&#x27;ve had people follow me down the street to ask why my hair was dyed (Then again, my male friends never complain of this, so it might not happen to men as much). Also, put something over your counters - there&#x27;s a few blue stains in my sink that I haven&#x27;t been able to get out yet.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love how vibrant the color turns out after I dye my hair with the product. I always get compliments from friends, family and strangers on my hair when I go out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I hate how fast it fades. I&#x27;ve bleached my hair first before I started using this product, so maybe that effects the color. But, It fades in just a week. I have to re touch it up once a week! Not only that, but it fades into either an ugly grey or an ugly blondish color. Like I&#x27;ve stated, I&#x27;ve bleached my hair so I could dye it blue, so I dont know if that effects how the coloring fades and how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the only problem I have with the product, I just wish it would last longer, or at least fade into an acceptable color as well. Other than that, the color is very pretty and bright.</li>
            <li> I love having  blue hair i have used other dyes but this is the best i love this stuff and i love the way it makes my hair look ive been using this for two years and this in my number one hair dye i feel safe using it and it last for up 3 months and the price is great and worth it.</li>
            <li> The color was really light. I purchased a deep blue, but it came out to be aqua, even green. Even after a couple of long washes later, the color remained for as long as eight months. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t physically put it in my hair as yet but I&#x27;ve done some research and I think i&#x27;m liking the results of others.</li>
            <li> For starters, the bleach FRIED my hair.  I&#x27;ve been bleaching and dying my hair since 4th grade and NEVER had this happen before.  The bleach also separated in my hair, the peroxide started dripping out all over.  Then the dye has awful coverage, I have shoulder length hair and the bottle hardly covered it all, I probably still have bleached spots(I haven&#x27;t even rinsed it yet) but there was no dye left.  The bleach burns too, and I doubt it is even from an allergic reaction, it was literally hot coming out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach and a different brand of dye for anyone looking to dye their hair blue. (Prior to trying this, I used Special Effects Blue Velvet which was amazing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, for people saying to need to follow directions, I followed them step by step and it was a mess.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff to anyone.  And I am highly experienced with bleaching and dying hair.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was looking for something different, unique, and definately vibrant. I got all three when I picked up a box of Splat His &amp; Her Hair Color in Blue Envy. My hair is naturally dark brown, was dyed a very dark black and the bleach still lightened it. However, I found that it was EXTREMELY messy, so be prepared to thoroughly clean your tub afterwards and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing out the dye in the shower as it gets everywhere. That and the fact that the gloves are a tad big (I have pretty small hands), and there&#x27;s not quite enough bleach, are my only complaints. If you&#x27;re looking for something new and different, you&#x27;ll definately wanna give this product a try. Just be sure to stock up on some heavy duty tub cleaner in the mean time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 9 year old son for his birthday and Walmart has been out of the blue for months. I was irritated that the box was completely destroyed and when I opened it, all of the bleaching liquid solution had spilled into the box and destroyed the instructions. Since I obviously can&#x27;t bleach my son&#x27;s hair first now, we&#x27;ll have to see how this works out. Luckily, my son has dirty blonde hair and isn&#x27;t picky but it would have been nice to have the bleach to get a true blue. Update: nixed the bleach since it was ruined but the blue looks great on my dirty blonde boys. Warning, it stains everything! Use aquaphor liberally (or vasseline) and windex on a rag works to take it off skin. Second Update! For like a week straight after coloring... every time my boys got their hair wet, the blue would run down their face and on everything (I understand this isn&#x27;t high end dye but seriously!). My older son went swimming in a pool and the chlorine bleached all of the blue out.</li>
            <li> The one-star reviews for this product seem to consist of a lot of people who don&#x27;t realize that this product will stain EVERYTHING.  I noticed in the packaging that it states this in bold ink.  Hell, even my husband noticed that and he&#x27;s never dyed his hair, ever.  So read your directions, okay?  Not all hair dyes are created equal.  You don&#x27;t know if anything has changed, or if the product is consistently different since your last use.  I dyed my hair red first, loved it.  The bleach is nasty, but a shower cap (purchased separately) will help with the smell, mess, and generally ickiness.  The red lasted at least four months, very strong and slowly fading a nice dark pink.  The shower cap over the dye is a wonderful thing to have, especially for long hair.  Buy them cheap at Walmart, $2 for three caps, can be rinsed and reused if you need to.)  Then I bleached again after a haircut and got a cool-looking blonde and pink combination.  After a week I decided to try out the blue.  It wasn&#x27;t as dark as the box but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because my hair was really really blonde, but it did look neat for a few weeks until it faded into a mucky kind of grey-blue.  Didn&#x27;t like that as much, but it did look awesome while I had it.  I dyed it a normal color to get rid of that, but I will use Splat again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 and have been dyeing my hair since I was 17.  Typically, I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal or Garnier products in natural shades.  I tried Manic Panic purple once, and it was a failure.  I had my hair professionally colored blue a number of times.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an at-home product to dye my hair a non-natural color.  (This is based on using Splat&#x27;s Blue Envy color)  First, the color.  Splat produces AMAZING color.  If you bleach your hair first, it will very likely end up the same color as the models on the box if you follow instructions and take your time.  If you don&#x27;t want color that bold, you should not bleach your hair first.  If your hair is already a medium to light blonde, you will likely not need the bleach either.  My hair is a light ash brown, and although it picks up color very well, I used the bleach for a bold result.    I keep using \\&quot;bold\\&quot; because that&#x27;s really what it is.  If you want the same kind of blue you see on Katy Perry or your Stormer Jem doll, this is what you use.  Do NOT use this product if you do not want a color that will have no choice but to be seen.  The one star reviews here all seem to have the same problem: it sounds like users didn&#x27;t follow the instructions.  Splat is not like other kinds of hair dye.  You will need to work with precision and care.  If you do not have a lot of experience with dyeing your hair at home, I would recommend getting a friend to assist.  This is not a type of thing for first-time hair-dyers.  You may want to experiment with another kind of short-lived dye first.  Splat gives you bleach, color, and a pair of flimsy plastic gloves.  Theoretically, this is all you need to do it.  However, there are a number of extra things that you should have in order to make things go smoothly:  * Petroleum jelly.  You will want to line your hairline, ears, and the back of your neck with jelly.  However, even if you do this, you will likely get some of your hairline stained unless you are working with a partner.  * Shower cap.  This is essential.  You may not need it for the dyeing, since the color dye is extremely thick and will likely not drip.  However, it will help to keep the bleach/color if your hair from getting on your skin or clothing.  Even if you don&#x27;t use it for dyeing, you will want one for afterward.  Every time your hair gets wet, the color will bleed a little.  If you don&#x27;t want to wait until your hair is bone dry to dress, you will want a shower cap.  * Latex gloves.  The gloves in the box are very thin.  I would recommend using latex gloves that you would use for cleaning.  They&#x27;re thicker and cover more of your arm.  * A hand mirror.  If you are working alone, you will need the hand mirror to check the back.    The most important thing is to WAIT.  You can&#x27;t rush the dye.  If you want the color to last, you will need to let it sit for at LEAST 30 minutes.  Even if you follow the box and use all these tips, you may not do it right the first time.  Do NOT throw away the dye until you are POSITIVE that you&#x27;re happy with the coverage.  I found a whole patch of hair in the back that I had missed after I washed the dye out and had to do touch-ups.  That&#x27;s a reflection of my process, NOT of the product.  This will stain everything porous that it comes in contact with, as well.  If you get dye on your skin, you can still get it off with a lot of work.  I used an all-natural 100% vegetable soap and was able to get most of the stains out with a lot of scrubbing.  Also make sure that all of your towels are ones that you don&#x27;t mind getting full of color, and wait until your hair is completely dry to dress or sleep or you will stain your clothes and sheets (unless you use the aforementioned shower cap).  This is probably the best, most affordable non-natural hair color on the shelf.  The color is amazing, it is easy to use if you prepare properly, and it doesn&#x27;t smell.  The bleach smells like bleach, but the color has a hint of bubblegum-type scent to it.  As a dye,this is phenomenal, but it will take a lot of work to do and maintain, so if you don&#x27;t want to devote a lot of effort to it, Splat is not for you.  Otherwise, Splat away!</li>
            <li> This hair dye is the worst you can buy. It bleeds all over the and fades really quickly. I would not recommend it at all or rebuy it!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the strongest of its type in hair colors. It stains everything! Skin, counters, scalp, etc. But needless to say that your hair will be colored. The first time I used it, it was a trial and error. I got stained hands, counters, towels, etc. When I used it again, I knew what to do. Wear gloves any time you&#x27;re in contact with it! I put down a plastic table cover for any \\&quot;splats\\&quot;. And the 2nd time around, it all turned out great. The color is deep and vibrant. My daughter&#x27;s hair started out darkest brown-almost black, naturally. We bleached the ends (for dip dye look) and after about an hour and a half, her hair was a light auburn. NOT blonde. But I knew this color stains like crazy, so I put it on. TWO hours later, her hair was bright blue. DO NOT leave it in for 30 min. You need to saturate the hair you want colored completely, so one box is not enough for an entire head of hair. We used a whole box on just her tips and could&#x27;ve used more. If you plan on doing your entire head, buy at least two boxes depending on thickness and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleach it comes with isn&#x27;t the best. If you want to bleach your hair completely, buy professional bleach separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because it works great but the amount is not nearly enough for a whole head of hair and the bleach isn&#x27;t the greatest. However I&#x27;ve bought other dyes without the bleach for the same price or more and they don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I bought the Blue Envy lot, along with a brown hair dye.    I dyed my hair brown, the next day, I started the process, yes the process of dying my hair blue.    I scheduled (Yes, I am that much of a nerd) myself to start dying my hair at 2pm, it is now like 8pm.  I bleached the front section (The whole front of my head) and the bleach was more than enough.  It was hardly runny, it was not thick, it was the perfect consistency.  I let it sit for about 45 minutes (I have really thin hair).  I washed it out, conditioned with color protection conditioner.    I then carefully started to dye my hair blue CAREFULLY.  With latex gloves I bought.  With Vaseline along the hair line.  And then patiently waited ~an hour.  Washed it out CAREFULLY, with paper towels in the sink.    I was not stained too badly, besides being dumb and running my hand through my hair before it was completely washed out.  My sink has one tiny, light dye spot due to being dumb and squeezing too much dye out.    TIPS:  - DON&#x27;T BE DUMB.  If you don&#x27;t have common sense, get someone who does.  - BE PATIENT.  This is not just squeeze in, let it sit for 20 minutes and rinse it out.  It took me like 6 hours (With breaks of course).  All in all, it took me about 2 and a half hours for the whole thing.  Don&#x27;t expect this to be a really quick thing.  - ASK QUESTIONS.  Find someone who has done something such as this before and ask questions if you are unsure about something.  - BE CAREFUL.  Don&#x27;t just squeeze all over your head and smear it.  Grab a clump (or whatever) and meticiously rub the dye into each thing.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to do sections at a time, this is a process.    This kit is not difficult to use.  This kit is not bad.      UNFORTUNANTLY, THIS KIT IS NOT STUPID PROOF.  BE SMART ABOUT THIS.    I have never, ever dyed my hair alone before and my hair turned out better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased Blue Envy and dyed my hair according to the directions on the box, but I did not use the bleach that came in the kit. I went to a local salon and had them bleach my hair for me and dyed it blue later.     This is what I wish I had known before I did this:     1. This dye stains everything it touches, including your skin. Wear gloves, especially when rinsing it out(!) and use petroleum jelly all around your hairline.   2. The bleaching process will dry out your hair, and it might stiffen up a lot after you&#x27;ve shampooed it. Be sure to use conditioner so your hair relaxes and feels normal again.  3. Do not take a full shower when rinsing it out! The water and dye will splatter everywhere and make a HUGE mess! It cleans up well enough with all-purpose bleach cleaner, but why bother if you don&#x27;t have to?   4. Wear gloves when rinsing it out! It will badly stain your hands if you don&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t use gloves, it&#x27;s been two days, and my hands still have blue color on them, especially around the nails.     I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results I got from using this product. The color is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start at the start of my journey into this horrid work of hair.    I got the Blue Envy dye from a CVS near me, neither me nor my friend (who helps me dye my hair, and is very awesome.) had used Splat dye before.    BIG MISTAKE. We did it without researching the brand, and we screwed up big time.    The box on the side was misleading for starters, it had no haircap, so we were forced to use the plastic bag we had gotten this awful kit in. Of course, we only discovered that when we started to use the bleach. Then we realized, they had put so little bleach in, and it was so ineffective. My friend is VERY good at dying and bleaching hair and has done it many years. She applied it very evenly, as there was so little bleach. 50 minutes later, we take the pseudo-wrap off, and my hair is a light brown to a pale blond. [I have medium-dark brown hair naturally.] I was really frustrated then, but we fixed it up, did the entire process, and it looked even enough by the time we were ready for the dye.    We barely scraped by with the amount of dye given to us, and had to use it all. Fast forward, rinse it, my hair is this dark almost black colour, and very very bleh. We figure it&#x27;s cause it&#x27;s wet. Fast forward again, this dye gave me the most uneven dye job I&#x27;ve ever had. Most of my hair was this half blue-half brunette mix, and the color represented only had a few tiny streaks mixed in, with hints of blonde in some places. It looked bad.    But, it was okay. Live-able I guess. It wasn&#x27;t TOO MUCH change from before hand, but it was okay.    Less than 24 hours passed from dying it.  I look in the mirror, what do I see? My original hair color, except a shade darker, with little flicks of blue.    Before you say anything, I know how to use dye.    Screw Splat, go with Manic Panic, or SpecialFX. Don&#x27;t waste your time or cash on this worthless garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and liked other splat products, but hated the blue. It either came out too light and grayish looking, or too dark to even tell it was blue. After a few weeks of it I bought the Special Effects Electric Blue and it works so much better. It&#x27;s a bright blue, goes on much easier, and doesn&#x27;t stain as much. From what I&#x27;ve heard it lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> im new to dying my hair (i have grown it out since my profile pic) and i wanted to do something new but not too drastic but i didnt have alot of money so i got this, it comes with 4 plastic gloves, instructions, bleach, dye. all that you need. so by following the instructions i succesfully dyed parts of my hair, there is enough ingredients to dye really long hair with this product, though at first i was scetchy cause of the low price but it worked great though yes a little messy when you wash your hair after you dye it but i found just hot water and a rag to work just fine in the tub. umm all i can say is its a great product i love my new look and will probably purchase it again when my hair color fades.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair you need 2 kits. The bleach did do VERY well, but color faded quick (aboout 2-3 wks). A little EVERY time you shower. Also, listen to the previous posts about NOT washing it out in the shower!! MESSY! MESSY! For my daughter&#x27;s first try though, it was an okay product. Trying a different one next time.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to dye my hair blue so for my birthday a friend of mine gave this to me as a gift. as a guy and not knowing what the heck i was doing the instructions and the product where easy to use. the only problem i have is the color wont stay in my hair and i have to keep re dying it if i don\\&quot;t want blonde strips in my black hair. all and all was ok trying something else next time.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter, her hair is THICK THICK THICK and very dark brown with a weird texture (We are Sicilian) We used the bleach according to direction and WOW talk about a shocking difference! Her hair was BLONDE/white in every place we used the bleach.  The blue dye went on easy and was a brilliant color.  We only did her bangs, so we were able to save the rest of the bottle for later applications to brighten them up.  With any drastic color, they fade quickly..even when you pay $100 in a salon so it was nice to have that extra color for a touch up application after the first few weeks.  DO NOT get the dye on your skin..It will color your skin..But If you do, which we did..I know this sounds strange, but it works...make a paste with cigarette ashes or fireplace ashes and a drop of water..rub onto dyed skin area..stinky but it does get the dye off. We originally dyed her hair in April, here it is July and Yes it is faded, but her bangs are still blue! We are buying more Splat!  Totally recommend this product! Have fun with it but follow the directions!!</li>
            <li> Bought this product twice. The color faded after 4 weeks after I&#x27;ve dyed my hair (even after leaving the product on my hair for more than 40 minutes, as recommended, before washing it out).</li>
            <li> My daughter has dark brown hair.  We left the dye on for 30 minutes.  The color pretty much washed out when we rinsed her hair.  You can barely see any blue and that is only under certain lighting.  Very disappointed with this product.  It did not deliver and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> when this was shipped to me to box was soaking wet. the bleach kit was ruined. it looks like someone has opened the box and closed it without much care several times. to be honest i&#x27;m a little afraid to try and use this as dye.</li>
            <li> I usually love splat, and this color in particular is absolutely perfect for me. However, Blue Envy splat is so water that applying it is a huge mess and an absolute nightmare. I made the mistake of trying to add it to some cream conditioner to easy the application, and that was the bluest disaster my bathroom every encountered.</li>
            <li> First time using a product such as this so we were not aware it requires bleaching the hair prior to putting the hair color on. If we had known that, would have used hair chalk instead. It was supposed to be &amp;#34;temporary&amp;#34; hair dye so why would you bleach your hair prior to appying a temp dye? That defeats the purpose, especially with darker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I did not allow her to bleach her hair, the dye did not show up as displayed and was difficult to discern in her brunette hair. Looked more purple than blue which was fine with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blonde sister decided to try some of it too but her hair turned green after a week or two (again, not bleached prior to application). Not a pretty shade of green either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing results ... hope my daughters learned their lesson. They are looking for something else to play with.</li>
            <li> its blue and if that is the color that you want I would suggest the splat for one it does come out and for those parents who are like are you kidding  splat is the stuff to buy as it will fade out .</li>
            <li> My wife was in ER and was swollen like a balloon. She got an allergy reaction she had never had before using other hair coloring products. Please be careful and try under armpit  or any other small area and see if you get a reaction.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dye locally. First of all, the outside of the box was nearly perfect, yet the bag incasing the instructions was torn and somewhat dirty looking. So be careful, as the products inside may me damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions perfectly. This is not my first time using hair dye. This will be my 6th or 7th time. I knew something was a miss when the color timing chart said to wait 30 minutes before washing out the dye. Instead of going with my gut feeling and keeping the dye in (significantly) longer, I followed the instructions. I&#x27;d say half of the dye washed right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m writing this, I believe my instructions were mixed up with the instructions for the multi-color hair kit, which would explain why it came with a frosting cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying again and hoping for good results.</li>
            <li> I have blue and black hair right now. :) my hair is pretty thick and already dyed black so I have the stylist bleach so I could put on the blue myself. Threw trial and error I have come to find I need two hours of processing time for six weeks of color with very limited fading just before my next coloring of black. I have to dye it black every six weeks just to be clear. Great color great dye. Gloves included suck but oh well get better ones and wear grubby clothes and your set.</li>
            <li> I started dying my hair crazy colors in Jr. High and I&#x27;m not much closer to 30 than I would like to admit. I have used *EVERY* hair dye. Professional and over the counter. Splat gives the best results and the longest lasting color. It&#x27;s more permanent and harder to wash/bleach out than permanent black hair dye. I leave the color in overnight with a bag over my head and wash it out in the morning. If your hair touches your shoulders or longer you will want more than one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;Permanent, vibrant, gorgeous color. I especially love the blue and purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;I hope you like the color blue because you will be blue for a few days. Every surface you touch, look at, every article of clothing, hands, neck, everything will be blue if you aren&#x27;t careful. I have never successful bleached out this hair color so you better be prepared to live with it. It tends to bleach out to cotton candy pink.</li>
            <li> At least this comes with bleach included in the box, but it doesn&#x27;t last terribly long. It&#x27;s a pretty color but fades pretty quickly as well. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price, maybe not worth the maintenance if you&#x27;re dying your whole head. For streaks though, go for it! It&#x27;s not the best product out there but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> i love this hair dye and i swear by it. it does stain a lot but its great in your hair. i love the bleach too, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> First, a confession. I didn&#x27;t use the bleach that came in the kit. I went to a salon and had a professional bleach it for about $50. Of course, the bleach job was fantastic and I was a partial platinum blonde when I went home, so maybe that helped but I freakin&#x27; love this blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my initial bleaching - about a third of my hair, all in the front - I went home with some hair foils from my hairdresser and used them on myself with a dye brush. I had Vaseline on my hairline and I was wearing gloves so there wasn&#x27;t really any spillage, even though it was my first time dyeing my own hair. My scalp did get dyed as I worked my roots but it left after a couple of washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the dye on for about an hour, give or take, and came out with friggin&#x27; brilliant blue hair, very even in tone. Absolutely fabulous. It does fade very slightly every time I wash it but I&#x27;m pretty sure every dye does that so whatever. The first couple of washes, it will run so use dark towels and dry your hair before wandering out into the world. Even as it fades, it&#x27;s still pretty. (The Blue Envy anyway... Aqua Rush is absolutely hideous as it fades. I hated that stuff SO HARD.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I re-dye it every six or so weeks when I have a couple of hours free and so far, that&#x27;s been working out well. There&#x27;s more than enough product in the kit to dye a third of my six inch hair repeatedly before I have to buy another box. The color only seems to become more vivid and lasting with each dye and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at dyeing my own hair if I do say so myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants showstopping (seriously, just stand in the sun and watch people&#x27;s heads whip around for a doubletake) blue hair would do well to give Blue Envy a try.</li>
            <li> Purples are hard to turn out--this one did. I left the dye on for over an hour, blowdrying my hair several times throughout. Lots of vigorous handwashing was necessary as this dye is very watery and gets in places. I recommend using a facial scrub to get the dye off of your skin. A couple other tools (besides what was provided) I recommend:    -latex gloves - the gloves provided were very strange and not exactly usable.  -a blowdryer - it helps the color get in.  -petroleum jelly - to keep the dye from staining your face.  -aluminum foil - to wrap up dyed sections of your hair, so that it doesn&#x27;t stain things.  -old towel - unless you want to turn your nice towel purple.    This purple will be messy for about 3 more shampoos, so be careful. I dripped all over the bathroom floor. The purple though has a hint of pink--it&#x27;s somewhat fuchsia I suppose, so if you don&#x27;t like pink, avoid. It actually fades to hot pink. It&#x27;s getting a bit more cotton candy these days [...].     Unfortunately I cannot attest to the bleach as my hair was pre-bleached. I only used up half a bottle (or less) of the hair dye though, so I&#x27;ll be going another round with Splat. I put some on unbleached sections too; the color did not turn out on my black (Asian) hair. Here&#x27;s the look immediately after dyeing [...]</li>
            <li> I brought this product thinking it was a a really good hair dye but is not, the color start to dessapear after the sencond shampooing. And the really worse thing is that you will get all you bathtub blue because eveytime you wash you hair the dyes comes out I&#x27;m a really thick blue water so even if you are just using water the color will come off so don&#x27;t even bother paying for this I&#x27;ll recommend manic panic instead if you could put pic i would show you what manic panic can do</li>
            <li> I just wanted a stripe in the middle of my head. NEVER have I done anything like this with any drastic color requiring bleaching. My hubby was able to do it &amp; it came out great! We did it outside &amp; used the hose over some river rocks &amp; no blue color mess anywhere :) looks great too even for a novice!</li>
            <li> The box was damaged very badly and the dye didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I love using the blue envy kit. I dye small sections of my hair only. And i mean line a couple of highlights in my bangs and a couple on each side of my head. I&#x27;ve never used the bleaching kit, ive aleays gone over my dark brown hair. I let the dye sit for approximately 15-25 minites, i dont keep ti.e, i just wash it out after my latest episode of criminal minds is over. The dye on my dark hair lasts for about 4-5 weeks and then starts to fade to a lighter blue/green shade, which is when i re-dye it. It takes about an hour to really wash out the extra dye, and even then it takes 2 or 3 shampoos to really get the extra blue out. As for staining, have a jug of bleach on hand for them. Just semi saturate a paper towel and rub over the bottom of your tub and let sit for a few minutes, and then rinse with water. On the edge of the sink, if youre stupid lime me and always forget to put something down, it takes a little longer soaking to remove those. Just take the paper towel again and let it sit directly over the stain for a little while, probably as long as your clean up takes, and then wipe with water. That a should remove most of the staining. Its always worked for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Splat five stars because it really is a great dye. It&#x27;s cruelty-free, and it lasts a long time depending on your hygiene routine. I&#x27;ve experimented with all of the permanent colors over the last year or so. The dye itself is vegetable-based, so it doesn&#x27;t do any harm leaving it in your hair for an extended period of time. I typically left mine in for anywhere between three to five hours, and then when I got in the shower, I shampooed. I rinse until the water runs mostly clear or at least very light in color. On average, I wash my hair in the shower anywhere between two to three times per week, the days between I would just rinse my hair and use a dry shampoo on it so it wouldn&#x27;t be greasy (on weekends if I wasn&#x27;t busy, I wouldn&#x27;t use any kind of shampoo at all). This extended the life of the color a LOT. My hair was Aqua Rush at the beginning of this year and by March, my hair was still incredibly vibrant. A friend of mine who was experimenting with this color with me reported that her color faded dramatically after about a month of every day shampooing. The next color I used was a shade of pink. I used the bleach kit it came with to get the blue out of my hair and it came out fairly easily. I kept the pink in my hair for about a month, didn&#x27;t really enjoy the shade on myself too much because of my pale complexion and the bright pink natural blushing of my cheeks, it just kind of clashed for me personally. I experimented with crimson, the green shade, berry blast. I decided to go with lusty lavender last, and that&#x27;s where my biggest issue with Splat is. I did my normal routine, the color was intense and gorgeous, I dyed over it once when my roots started showing real bad around the two month mark. My experimentation period is over for the remainder of the year, however, I have bleached my hair four times (store bought bleach and professional) and while a big portion of my hair is bordering white, there is a good chunk that is still very purple/pink. I even upped shampooing my hair on a daily basis and cannot get the remainder of this shade out. I dropped $80 trying to get the rest of this color out and it just isn&#x27;t happening. Which I guess isn&#x27;t a bad thing, for some people.    I absolutely recommend this brand if you&#x27;re looking for something long-lasting. If you&#x27;re looking for something more on the temporary side, maybe not so much this product - try washables instead. Also, do keep in mind that the color on the box is relative. The actual color depends not only on your natural hair color, but on your natural hair type (thick, thin, etc) - I have thin naturally dirty blonde hair and the pink fetish shade came out so vibrant it was more of a maroon color than a light pink. Which I had no issue with, but if you&#x27;re going for a very specific shade try to keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a little while now and have tried several of the more well known brands. Splat is pretty good, but not the best I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s still bleeding every time it gets even remotely wet 3 weeks later. If I sweat at night I&#x27;ll have blue all over my neck and back when I wake up. This is the first brand that&#x27;s ever done that to me. Manic Panic and N~Rage did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is VERY vivid though. Almost neon it&#x27;s so intense. I LOVE the color. It&#x27;s beautiful and exactly what I was looking for. I always cut mine with a little bit of condition, put it on slightly damp hair, put a shower cap on, and let it set for about 5 hours. Then rinse with cold water until it runs clear. I&#x27;ve found this produces the most long lasting and intense results. It also conditions you hair after the bleaching you hopefully did before you colored it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to note that while my color is bleeding constantly I haven&#x27;t noticed any real fading. It&#x27;s still has 99% of the vibrancy it had when I first colored it. So while the bleeding is pretty annoying, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be affecting the color at all. Just make sure you&#x27;re careful when you&#x27;re at the gym or if it&#x27;s raining!</li>
            <li> Love the color for the first few days, but holy cow does it fade fast!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST DELIVERY THANK  YOU</li>
            <li> Splat is a good brand.  It is semi-permanent dye.  Incredible blue when first applied, but it does start fading within a few days.  After 3 weeks it is faded purple, which I still like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest bleaching your hair twice (for dark hair).  Apply dye, leave dye in until it is dry, wash out.  Do not shampoo your hair again as this makes it fade much more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a mohawk, so there is not a lot of hair to dye.  I apply what I need, then wrap the bottle tip in masking tape.  This prevents it from drying out and it will alst forever.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the bleach because I hate using any and all bleach on my hair. I have lighter brown hair. It came out black as night. On top of that, somehow my roots were blue the rest was vaguely dark blue in the best of lights. Oh that and it faded in 5 days. I&#x27;m desperately trying to get rid of it using Prell brand shampoo. It does miracles (thus far) for it, though it still is sticking to my roots pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO. NOT. BUY. THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you truly truly don&#x27;t care. Go ahead, but it is definitely the worst hair dye I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> I used vasoline, gloves and wasn&#x27;t careless. I didn&#x27;t end up with a mess. Just go slow and be careful. It&#x27;s not that hard. The bleach is lacking, I&#x27;d suggest grabbing a box of frost n glow or something, especially if bleaching your whole head. The bleach did burn a little but no more than any other bleach I&#x27;ve used. I got no chemical burns. Leave the dye in as long as you can. Disregard thirty minutes. If you have long hair buy two or three boxes. It advises to do so on the side of the box. I did blue streaks with black. I naturally have brown hair, so I bleached streaks first. Wash with shampoo only. No conditioner. Then I just honestly carelessly put in the blue. I left it for like 2-3 hours. Rinsed. There was no more staining than any other hair dye in the tub. Blowdried, then I got my black dye and colored the rest of my hair and over parts of the blue even, to tidy it all up. Worked beautifully. The blue is insanely vivid. The other cool thing is I used the color stay conditioner packet with the black dye. It did not strip the blue. I wouldn&#x27;t use regular conditioner or shampoo for a week so it can set. Just be nappy. This color looks better than what I got done at the salon. It&#x27;s worth the time. I also find that hand sanitizer gets dye off skin and counters best. I have no idea how people are complaining about making a mess. I didn&#x27;t wear a cap and I wasn&#x27;t being overly careful and I&#x27;m kind of klutzy and I didn&#x27;t make a mess. You should be fine as long as you don&#x27;t have two left feet for hands. Just follow the tips!</li>
            <li> I have used pretty much all the brands out there, and done all the colors. I did not expect much from this product.  In fact for the longest time I didn&#x27;t even consider using this brand, seeing as it was being offered at walmart, and the name is pretty cheesy, and the pictures of the people are admittedly a little dumb as well. and seeing the less than great reviews others gave it kind of confirmed my suspicions that this was just some wannabe lame attempt at hair dye.  However other brands aren&#x27;t as accessible and I have always had to order them online which can be a pain, waiting for shipping and all that.  So I finally caved and gave this one a try.  The bleach worked FAST, although more irritating than other brands of hair bleach Ive tried, it was tolerable. Especially since it didn&#x27;t take long to get blonde.  Its more watery too, which makes it easier to fully saturate all of your hair.  The blue dye I did the next day, and boy is that watery too.  Its very easy to make a mess with this stuff, and it does stain.  But again, very easy to get your hair fully saturated, and its very pigmented.  I knew right away this was going to be good stuff.  It makes a mess. it stains your skin and your bathtub,  but it works.  Any good semi permanent dye is going to be a bit messy. Thats just how it goes.  I liked that it comes with bleach and not just the dye, so it costs half as much as other brands when you take that into consideration.  Both the bleach and dye exceeded my expectations, and I think I&#x27;ve found my new go-to dye brand for the most part.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Splat. The first color was red. It lasted 3 weeks for us.  Not sure if a bottle of bleach is needed in every box</li>
            <li> When I got this I was so excited. The blue washed out of my hair in 2 days!!! It was so ugly looking. The water never ran clear! Do not get this product.</li>
            <li> I really like these hair dyes and it got to me very quickly!  I&#x27;ve tried the blue and red, I think I&#x27;ll go purple next!</li>
            <li> It looks great when just done but it does not last long at all. In no later then a week it was nearly all the way faded from my brothers hair, even on the bleached blonde. I had bought a purple to go with it  but i wouldnt use it after seeing how this worked in his hair. Anytime his hair got wet the die would run off his hair and on his clothes and it ruined the clothes he did where when he got wet. I wont ever by this product again.</li>
            <li> We were very disappointed by this product. We were hoping that the positive reviews were the accurate ones, but it turns out that the negative ones are much more on point. First off, the fading. We tried EVERYTHING to make sure this doesn&#x27;t fade. To call it permanent is complete BS. We carefully followed the directions from other reviewers when we put this in her hair. She only used shampoo to wash her hair before, then we waited until it was extremely dry. We used two boxes for medium length girls hair. We left the dye in for four hours. She only washed her hair with cold water to get the dye out. She then did not wash it for a week. Then, she washed it like normal. It stayed in fine week one (duh!), but as soon as she started washing her hair the next week it started fading. Within a week or two is was hard to even notice she had blue in her hair at all (we did some blue some jet black). Furthermore, everything that came in contact with her hair for that week ended up being stained. We have blue stains on our pillows because the dye actually went through the pillowcase, and we were very careful to make sure her hair was dry every night before we went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is the messiest, crapiest hair dye we have ever used. It does originally make your hair blue, but it causes a huge mess and fades in a very short time unless you choose to never wash your hair. We put every bit of effort possible into making this product work and got literally nothing out of it. I might recommend it to my worst enemy to trick them into getting blue stains all over their house. Maybe their marketing division ought to capitalize off of that...</li>
            <li> Turned out wonderfully. I decided to not use bleach this time, just because I did not want the blonde after affects (I&#x27;m a brunette), but it still came out beautifully. Faded more naturally into my hair colour, as opposed to being a vibrant contrast. Faded out sooner, but I still love this brand for hair dye. Works well with and without bleach.</li>
            <li> It washed out after about four or five times washing my hair... the water was blue as soon as I washed it. and it didn&#x27;t stay in for longer than a week.. AFter, your hair is like GREEN.... not a happy person.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dye that is out there and the color is amazing,the results are just amazing. I would really recommend splat colors if your looking to dye your hair.</li>
            <li> This was the absolute worst!  This hair dye must have been sitting on the Amazon shelves for the last 20 years! Lumpy dye, completely unclear instructions, and I had a reaction to the dye that made my left eye swell shut.</li>
            <li> ok so I bought this kit at Walgreens not from Amazon... HOWEVER! this this sucks for dark hair. my hair is naturally dark dark dark brown and so i used the bleach that they provided and went blonde before i put the blue dye on. I mean I followed their directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; I even blow dried my hair out because the box says the color sticks better to dry hair. Anyway, my hair is just at dark as it was before I applied the bleach. The blue color don&#x27;t show at all except for on my roots which clearly isn&#x27;t what I was going for. The color of the models&#x27; hair on the box is a fraud! maybe it would look like that on natural blonde hair... maybe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah I just wanted others to know before buying it. I hear manic panic works better for darker hair if you&#x27;re trying to get a bold color so I&#x27;ll be trying that in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this color! I use to use Special FX color for my hair but they are constantly out of stock so I tried Splat and I never went back. The dye lasts about a month before fading and it still looks good as it fades. I give four stars because the bleach included in the package is awful, it is not very powerful and will not pull the color out. Also, make sure to wear petroleum jelly or else your neck/face will be dyed also.</li>
            <li> I usually buy these dyes from Walmart but I bought it off of here to save a buck or two.&lt;br /&gt;The beach worked fine BUT the hair dye was old. Expired.&lt;br /&gt;It did not dye my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dye and expect something nice, but it is totally opposite. it wouldn&#x27;t dye my hair just because I have black hair, and i don&#x27;t know how would it work for other natural color hair. and it said on the package that it will not come off if the color get on skin, ball shit! My sister got some of it on her hands, and it was washed off easily with hand soap! Never buy their stuff ever again.</li>
            <li> The bleach worked fine, but the dye washed out completely after only a few days. I followed the directions to a T, tried dying my hair with this product twice, thinking I must have screwed something up the first time. Nope. This is an absolutely useless product.</li>
            <li> Just terrible, it washed out within one wash and it went to this messy green. It got everywhere ruin lots of towels. And it did not want to come out!!!! I will not buy this ever again!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was packaged well, but I followed the instuctions a nd it still faded very quickly to an odd grayish color. The color was beautiful at first, so if you have a system for making these colors last, I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> Nice vibrant color! Comes with everything you need! Takes about an hour or two to get done but comes out very nice and has so far lasted on my son for weeks with minimum fading! All of his friends love it! He took the picture below. I would recommend this to anyone thinking about dying their hair!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m super super super happy with the way my hair turned out!! splat honestly works better on my hair than manic panic or ion, it goes on super easily and stays strong and covers EXTREMELY well, and it fades beautifully. I have used lusty lavendar (which faded to a nice pink), and just used blue envy tonight and it looks amazing. the bleach can hurt yes, but it&#x27;s bleach, and the result is so PERFECT at the end that you won&#x27;t care if it stung for a few minutes. seriously, incredible.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, long lasting color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days since I applied it but the blue is pretty intense in the areas where I bleached. The bleach is included in the box which is pretty convenient but of course you&#x27;re going to have to buy things to protect your skin and clothes from the blue since it doesn&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice that this kit comes with the bleach and it does color your hair beautifully however, be aware that it will stain everything it touches</li>
            <li> If you would like permanent hair dye, NEVER buy this product! I&#x27;ve bought it at my local walmart, just an innocent 11 year old, right? Well I spent my money from Christmas on it and on the box it said it would last at least a month. It didn&#x27;t even last two weeks and washed out little by little every time I took a shower. My towels became blue along with the tips of my shirts. If you step near this product in a Sally&#x27;s, or Walmart, or wherever you go, walk away. False addvertizing! May look good and vibrant for a week and a half, but isn&#x27;t worth spending the time putting in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not blue, it&#x27;s black.</li>
            <li> I dyed my boyfriend hair and the color is soo pretty!! nice dark blue! and the bleach kit always work! leave it on for about 30mins and have Platinum BLONDE~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I always loved SPLAT! its the best hair dying kit EVER!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this please I used it and the bleach worked fine but then I put the blue dye in for the time it told me and it turned my hair black again I was so made wasted my money for nothing this is just crap</li>
            <li> Color stays strong, i wish the blue was a bit brighter under indoor lighting, but in outside it looks so vibrant and awesome.</li>
            <li> fades quite quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to last so long.</li>
            <li> Splat Blue Envy was a waste of time, money, and towels! Bought for my hubby, who has been coloring his hair for decades. He knows how to use a product correctly. He wanted to try this because he liked the color, but all he got was red with anger. He used the bleach kit to lighten his medium brown, super short hair (buzzed almost all around and a 4\\&quot; wide 4\\&quot; high like mohawk)which worked well. Brought it to a very light blonde. Used almost the entire bottle to ensure coverage as well as increased time left in and rinsed with cool water. Came out horribly blotchy and lighter than a teal but darker than a baby blue. Wrong! Then to make it worse, if it gets wet at all it bleeds. So contacted company, sent pictures as they asked, and they say try again you did it wrong. Oh and beware of bleeding. No way. He was so horrified by the outcome he ended up getting his tried and true Manic Panic to fix it, guess what, NO color or coverage problems and NO bleeding. So save you time, money and anything you don&#x27;t want to be the color of the Splat dye you are using, and just avoid it.</li>
            <li> it was so bad it ddd not stay in for more then a week&lt;br /&gt;i hate it do not buy</li>
