            <li>quickly (just use cord to hang dry)&lt;br /&gt;-To soften again just run under the tap for a minute or so</li>

            <li>Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Konjac Sponge - Activated Charcoal - Facial Sponge by Mayberry Health and Home is a sponge that needs to be in everyone&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li>i thought at first that its gonna be rough on my skin, however when i started using it and did a circular motion on my face, it felt really good..</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect from this sponge, but was interested in trying it after seeing a friends complexion completely change after using one like this.</li>
            <li>I also struggle a lot with keeping my pores clean and small, because most of the products I use (both makeup and skincare) tend to clog my pores and make them more visible.</li>
            <li>You will be amazed at how smooth, bright and exfoliated your skin is using these and after about a week of regular use your pores will become absolutely tiny.</li>
            <li>I just spend a minute or so, rubbing it a circular motion either with my cleanser, or sometimes, right after the first rinse.  </li>
            <li>Not only cleans your skin really nicely but also does a gentle exfoliation</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and would recommend this to other&#x27;s too.</li>

            <li>But the scent eventually went away after the first use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use cleanser as I was interested in seeing what the sponge could do alone.</li>

            <li>After two minutes, the sponge is super soft and ready to use.</li>
            <li>But, true to the instructions, an initial 5 min soak in warm water, and it&#x27;s softer than any other exfoliating sponge/scrub I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this sponge daily for a few days now and have seen great improvement in my complexion and texture.</li>
            <li>It might look like a rock but its as gentle as a feather when you use it on your face.</li>

            <li>It is soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>That right there should be reason enough for you to get yours!  </li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Awesome stocking suffers too!</li>
            <li>I have dry patches of skin and it cleaned those right up.</li>
            <li>That also means it is fine for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores, and much softer skin.  </li>
            <li>but when used on my face it felt like a soft wash cloth.</li>

            <li>product is a Konjac sponge with bamboo charcoal, it is a 100% all natural bath sponge for cleansing and exfoliating your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-All natural (Konjac Root)</li>
            <li>followed the directions and let it soak until it was soft - about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>They are made of natural, edible konjac corm fibers and charcoal made from bamboo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Took only a few days to get my order, and I love how my skin feels after I use this</li>
            <li>It also controls moisture levels by releasing water when the air is dry and absorbing it when the air is humid.</li>
            <li>I did and was surprised how soft and much larger this sponge became.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for something to use on my face as a mini-exfoliant, as I have very sensitive skin that tends to,stay red.</li>
            <li>There was even a tiny blackhead I had on the side of my nose that was completely gone!  </li>
            <li>I love the small loop which allows me to hang it over the faucet to dry.</li>
            <li>That hard little ball that arrived in plastic then transforms into a squishy and soft sponge ready to clean your face!</li>
            <li>Because I have sensitive skin I only use the sponge twice a week, but rest assure is not super abrasive at all, is just right.</li>
            <li>It is actually a vegetable fiber, like a natural loofa</li>
            <li>Easy to use ,you just need to wet it and use with your usual face cleaner avoiding the lips and Eyes area.</li>
            <li>one has an attached string so that it can hang in order to dry completely between uses, keeping it sanitary and extending it</li>
            <li>At first when i got, i was confused if it was really a sponge coz</li>
            <li>have NO EXCUSE now not to wash your face before bed because this is about as low maintenance as it gets.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect from this sponge, but was interested in trying it after seeing a friends complexion completely change after using one like this.</li>

            <li> I did and was surprised how soft and much larger this sponge became.</li>

            <li> one has an attached string so that it can hang in order to dry completely between uses, keeping it sanitary and extending it</li>
            <li> At first when i got, i was confused if it was really a sponge coz</li>

            <li> /&gt;The small sponge is shaped like a river stone and is very hard until soaked in warm water</li>
            <li> I added a tiny bit of my usual face cleanser and gently scrubbed my face in circular motion.</li>
            <li> Finally I rinsed and dried my face as normal.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, when I first received it, I couldn&#x27;t imagine using a little rock on my face.  </li>
            <li> and then it becomes luxuriously soft and slightly</li>

            <li> .. then i read the instructions on the side and soaked it in water for few minutes and was quite amazed that it turned out to be so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After bathing, use the rounded side to slowly massage the face to both gently exfoliate and hydrate the skin.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been a buzz lately about this type of facial cleansing sponge, does it live up to the hype?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised how soft this hard &#x27;briquette&#x27; got!  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I would like it to be a little bigger.  </li>

            <li> I have only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I soaked mine for a minute, it wasn&#x27;t long enough and the center was still hard.</li>
            <li> The sponge is small initially but when you soak it in the water for few minutes it becomes big.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not scratchy, my sensitive skin has not experienced any redness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a facial sponge, but when I received it, the item was incredibly hard and packed tight into plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes packaged in a simple little box and is rock hard.</li>
            <li> The sponge arrives at your door hard, and you have to soak it in water for a few minutes prior to using.  </li>
            <li> Between uses, it will harden slightly, although not like the beginning.</li>
            <li> I typically use my Clairsonic MIA or spa gloves so this was an odd addition to my face care lineup.</li>
            <li> No special sauce needed, just this sponge and some water.</li>
            <li> Hard and dry.</li>
            <li> I was a little suspicious when I opened the package, but...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just take it into the shower because it&#x27;ll take a little longer to soften.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It exfoliated the dead skin cells on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sponge for a few days now</li>
            <li> It exfoliates and remove all the dead skin.</li>
            <li> It removes dirt, excess oil, makeup residue, dead skin and reduce blemish-causing</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell to it that is a bit weird to me, but that goes away not long after you wash your face.</li>
            <li> Then when you use at night just apply a small amount of cleanser to the sponge to  remove the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It looked a hard black lump of charcoal!  </li>
            <li> it was kinda hard like a rock</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe the feeling when using the sponge.</li>
            <li> When you have acne,  you don&#x27;t want something hard that will spread bacteria to the rest of your face.  </li>
            <li> When I fist received this, it was really hard and scary looking.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too inconvenient.</li>
            <li> No preservatives, artificial fragrances or colors</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the Konjac sponge, it&#x27;s soft and leaves my face with a natural radiant glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge every day since I got it in the mail. I am beyond blown away by how amazing it is - cleansing and exfoliating with it is so easy and pleasant, and it does an incredible job of removing impurities from the surface of your skin. It also visibly improved the appearance of my pores - they are way smaller than just few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a mixed skin - some parts are dry, others are oily. I also struggle a lot with keeping my pores clean and small, because most of the products I use (both makeup and skincare) tend to clog my pores and make them more visible. As part of my skincare routine, I used to use the cleansing rotating brush twice a day, but as you can probably imagine, while it did a good job keeping my skin clean, it also wasn&#x27;t easy on it. Ever since I picked up the Konjac Sponge, I have switched to using it instead of the brush in the morning (I still use the brush in the evening, just to make sure my skin is completely clean and makeup free). And I absolutely love it. I honestly can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes packaged in a simple little box and is rock hard. You have to soak it in warm water for about 2 minutes before you use it. After two minutes, the sponge is super soft and ready to use. You can use it alone or with your regular facial cleanser. It&#x27;s surprisingly durable for a sponge, and I love the texture of it. It&#x27;s great for exfoliating, but really amazingly gentle on your skin at the same time. I&#x27;m definitely going to be using this sponge as part of my skincare routine from now on, and I am going to pick up a couple for my mom - she will love it, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will love the Konjac Sponge, definitely give this one a go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: A sample of the product was provided to me in exchange for my honest opinion</li>
            <li> Great product! Fewer breakouts after a week of using it, wish i would have found it sooner.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been a buzz lately about this type of facial cleansing sponge, does it live up to the hype?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, it looks like a lump of pumice. Hard and dry. It is actually a vegetable fiber, like a natural loofa is.&lt;br /&gt;This one is infused with charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;After soaking in warm water for about two minutes, it softens up and is ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more gentle than a lot of other forms of exfoliation,  making it a nice option for those of us with sensitive skin. That also means it is fine for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any exfoliating product, your skin is brightened and fresh looking,  but the plus to this one is that it does it so gently.&lt;br /&gt;This one has an attached string so that it can hang in order to dry completely between uses, keeping it sanitary and extending it&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided with the option to review.</li>
            <li> At first when i got, i was confused if it was really a sponge coz it was kinda hard like a rock.. then i read the instructions on the side and soaked it in water for few minutes and was quite amazed that it turned out to be so soft. I was hesitant to brush it on my face at first coz i thought at first that its gonna be rough on my skin, however when i started using it and did a circular motion on my face, it felt really good.. it was very gentle and soft. It didn&#x27;t hurt or scratch my face of any kind. It exfoliated the dead skin cells on my face. It made my face really smooth after using it. It might look like a rock but its as gentle as a feather when you use it on your face. It was created from konjac root fibers that&#x27;s why it is excellent for eliminating impurities and exfoliating the face. Plus it has this string attached to it so you can just hang it in the bathroom. I am pretty happy about it and tend to use it as one of my daily regimen in cleaning my face. I&#x27;m very satisfied and would recommend this to other&#x27;s too. This is a really great facial cleanser. I got this complimentary product for testing and review purposes. All thoughts and opinions are of my own and were not swayed by anyone.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something to use on my face as a mini-exfoliant, as I have very sensitive skin that tends to,stay red. I came across the Konnac sponge. I was a little suspicious when I opened the package, but...WOW!!  In the shower if was great. The sponge makes me look forward to washing my face.  This will be great for gifts as well.</li>
            <li> I was given this product as a gift, and I cannot say enough good things about it. These really hold up after repeated use, and I can feel the difference in my skin. My skin is clearer and softer because this sponge acts as a buffer. It dries very quickly so I doesn&#x27;t ever smell of mildew, and makes it easy for travel use. Awesome stocking suffers too!</li>
            <li> This is an incredible cleansing aid!  Incredible that something that works so well, is so inexpensive.  Like the other reviewers, when I first received it, I couldn&#x27;t imagine using a little rock on my face.  But, true to the instructions, an initial 5 min soak in warm water, and it&#x27;s softer than any other exfoliating sponge/scrub I&#x27;ve used.  Between uses, it will harden slightly, although not like the beginning. As soon as I put it under warm water, it&#x27;s good to go.  And go, it does!  I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores, and much softer skin.  I just don&#x27;t know how it can do the job without being scratchier.  I just spend a minute or so, rubbing it a circular motion either with my cleanser, or sometimes, right after the first rinse.  Because it&#x27;s not scratchy, my sensitive skin has not experienced any redness.  I&#x27;m really impressed, and when this one wears out, I&#x27;ll definitely order another!</li>
            <li> I really love this sponge! I have been using this sponge daily for a few days now and have seen great improvement in my complexion and texture. When I fist received this, it was really hard and scary looking. The instructions say to place it in a bowl with warm water and soak for about 2 mins. I did and was surprised how soft and much larger this sponge became. The sponge did have a light scent to it, charcoal? But the scent eventually went away after the first use. The sponge felt like...well, a sponge but when used on my face it felt like a soft wash cloth. I added a tiny bit of my usual face cleanser and gently scrubbed my face in circular motion. My skin felt so clean and smooth after! I used to use a facial brush but it&#x27;s just too inconvenient. I couldn&#x27;t take it in the shower and would have to remember to charge it. This sponge is so convenient, once I&#x27;m done, I rinse it and hang. I received this exfoliating sponge for free as a sample to test and offer my honest and unbiased opinion. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. This sponge feels so good, I wish there was a body size sponge!</li>
            <li> This little sponge does an excellent job of exfoliating, without being too rough on facial skin. I had been searching for a VIC washcloth, which was out of stock, but this is an answer. I love the small loop which allows me to hang it over the faucet to dry. Simple, handy, tidy, well-made.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect from this sponge, but was interested in trying it after seeing a friends complexion completely change after using one like this. So it arrives, and I immediately tested it out. What you do is soak it in warm water for a minute or so while pressing against the sponge. That hard little ball that arrived in plastic then transforms into a squishy and soft sponge ready to clean your face! So you then rub it in circular motions over your face, and you can do this with or without the aide of a facial cleanser. I didn&#x27;t use cleanser as I was interested in seeing what the sponge could do alone. I can&#x27;t get over how great it cleaned my face! With using nothing but this sponge and water my face was left completely clean, and incredibly soft! There is a slight smell to it that is a bit weird to me, but that goes away not long after you wash your face. And that&#x27;s it! Simply squeeze the excess water out and hang to dry with the string that&#x27;s attached! This has saved me tons of money on facial products. Truly worth giving a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for evaluation</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge.  The sponge arrives at your door hard, and you have to soak it in water for a few minutes prior to using.  I love that you can use this with or without cleanser.  Since I wash my face at night it would be great to use in the morning without cleanser.  Then when you use at night just apply a small amount of cleanser to the sponge to  remove the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The Bamboo charcoal is what offers the exfoliation.  It is hard to describe the feeling when using the sponge. It kind of feels like an oxygenating feeling. I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin after using for a month. I was provided a free sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and loved the way it cleaned my skin and left it so soft and smooth.  My son wanted mine the first time, so I wanted to get one for him since he is so prone to breakouts.  I have always known the benefits of charcoal.  I use it to whiten and clean my teeth and mouth and take charcoal tablets  when I have an upset stomach.  Charcoal is adept at pulling out toxins and ridding them from your body,  so it&#x27;s no surprise that the Konjac Sponge with Bamboo Charcoal would pull toxins from my skin when using it.  It has made a big difference in my son&#x27;s skin in the short time he has been using it (which is hard enough to get him to do .  lol )  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I would like it to be a little bigger.  My son has large hands and he says that he has a hard time holding on to it.  Other than that,  I recommend it to anyone....especially those with acne problems.  When you have acne,  you don&#x27;t want something hard that will spread bacteria to the rest of your face.  This is very soft,  although it still exfoliates very well.  Exfoliation is something that people with acne cannot do because of spreading it.  This allows you to clean your face AND exfoliate without damaging it and causing more problems with acne.&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for the purpose of testing and review.

            <li> The Konjac Sponge with Bamboo Charcoal is an interesting product. It&#x27;s a facial sponge, but when I received it, the item was incredibly hard and packed tight into plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak the sponge for 1-2 minutes. This is a must. I soaked mine for a minute, it wasn&#x27;t long enough and the center was still hard. I thought that was how it was supposed to be, added facial wash to the sponge and then well, washed my face. By the time I rinsed the sponge, it softened even further. So definitely let it soak. Don&#x27;t just take it into the shower because it&#x27;ll take a little longer to soften.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge did a fantastic job to remove dead flaky skin cells. I have dry patches of skin and it cleaned those right up. I had absolutely no irritation and I have very sensitive skin. The sponge was durable, yet soft. There was no abrasive nature to it. Would I use this again? Yes! Would I recommend this product? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a konjac sponge, you need to know that they are THE BOMB. It blows my mind that something that is basically a perfectly shaped piece of vegetable root could be the best face cleanser ever. You will be amazed at how smooth, bright and exfoliated your skin is using these and after about a week of regular use your pores will become absolutely tiny. No special sauce needed, just this sponge and some water. If you still want to use cleanser with it, you just need a drop as the sponge will make it foam up like nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have NO EXCUSE now not to wash your face before bed because this is about as low maintenance as it gets. Get it wet. Rub it on your face. Go to bed. Boom. Done. It even gets off makeup and it&#x27;s naturally ph balanced to keep your skin gorgeous without needing toner. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like so many cleanser can. The charcoal in it does extra pore cleansing and tightening and is ideal for blemish prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have gotten this for review purposes, but trust me, this is a REAL TWO THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> This is a great sponge ,this product arrived just as described . This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly , it arrived in excellent condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a Konjac sponge with bamboo charcoal, it is a 100% all natural bath sponge for cleansing and exfoliating your face.This all natural exfoliating sponge was created from konjac root fibers that are excellent for eliminating impurities and exfoliating the face. The plant is native to Asia and has been used in Chinese medicine for years due to its ability to detoxify and restore health. Bamboo Charcoal promotes replenishment of skin cells and encourages nutrient infusion. It is known for its porous quality and large surface area which allows it to absorb impurities. It also controls moisture levels by releasing water when the air is dry and absorbing it when the air is humid.The Konjac body sponge is soft when wet and can be used on all skin types including a baby&#x27;s and around delicate areas of the face. Its earth friendly design and natural components allow it to be composted after use. It is biodegradable and free of both toxins and pollutants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this sponge to work amazingly , it is nice and soft when wet and it cleans great .The feeling of my skin afterwards was just wonderful it felt so clean and refreshed , using your favorite cleanser is great to use with this sponge .The sponge has a really nice feel to it and I love the fact that it is all natural and biodegradable .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I love this! Took only a few days to get my order, and I love how my skin feels after I use this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about the benefits of using charcoal for your skin treatment, so when I was offered this Konjac Charcoal sponge free of charge  tested and share my honest opinion I was very excited.Easy to use ,you just need to wet it and use with your usual face cleaner avoiding the lips and Eyes area. Not only cleans your skin really nicely but also does a gentle exfoliation so your skin feels super soft. Because I have sensitive skin I only use the sponge twice a week, but rest assure is not super abrasive at all, is just right. I&#x27;m very pleased and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Okay, I really didn&#x27;t think this was going to be any good but I was wrong. Initially when I got this sponge I wasn&#x27;t sure how something that wasn&#x27;t rough/course was going to exfoliate. I typically use my Clairsonic MIA or spa gloves so this was an odd addition to my face care lineup. After a week of use in the mornings though, I am loving the smooth complexion and totally sold on the concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Small and easy grip.&lt;br /&gt;-Gets into all the fine corners and contours of a face&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t cause microscopic tears or cuts while exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;-Sloughs off/rubs off the top layer of dead skin without irritation (Definitely safe for daily use)&lt;br /&gt;-Dries quickly (just use cord to hang dry)&lt;br /&gt;-To soften again just run under the tap for a minute or so&lt;br /&gt;-Lathers very well which saves on product use&lt;br /&gt;-Can be used with or without cleanser&lt;br /&gt;-All natural (Konjac Root) No preservatives, artificial fragrances or colors&lt;br /&gt;-Added Bamboo Charcoal aids in replenishment of skin cells &amp; reduction of blemishes&lt;br /&gt;-Biodegradable (can be also be composted)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this item from the company in order to review</li>
            <li> When I received this sponge, I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to think.  It looked a hard black lump of charcoal!  I had never seen or heard of a Konjac plant.  I looked it up and read the black Konjac Sponge is good for acne prone skin and an excellent exfoliater.  I love facials and masks and anything that will keep my face blemish free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and let it soak until it was soft - about 2 minutes.  I was surprised how soft this hard &#x27;briquette&#x27; got!  First I just lightly rubbed the sponge over my face in circular motions.  I figured this way would be better for exfoliating.  I then added a dab of facial cleanser and again started circular motions all over my face and neck.  This sponge is super soft!  I can&#x27;t describe it any other way but to say it felt amazing!  I gently rinsed the sponge and then used it to wipe the cleanser off my face.  Finally I rinsed and dried my face as normal.  I am honestly impressed with the results!  My face was squeaky clean!  There was even a tiny blackhead I had on the side of my nose that was completely gone!  I have been using this sponge for a few days now and I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have recommended this Mayberry Health and Home Konjac Exfoliating Sponge to my family members and my sister has already purchased one!  That right there should be reason enough for you to get yours!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer - I received this item for my honest and unbiased review.  All opinions are my own based on personal experience.</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling smooth. String for hanging it up is great. I have only been using it for a few days but I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge it makes my face feel like its actually clean! So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Konjac Sponge - Activated Charcoal - Facial Sponge by Mayberry Health and Home is a sponge that needs to be in everyone&#x27;s bathroom. It is a great sponge. I have very sensitive skin and have to be very careful what I use on it but this is FANTASTIC!!! I love it!!! It made my face feel nice and clean.

The package comes with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  One round 100% natural bamboo charcoal konjac facial sponge with attached string&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 5 stars but wish I could give it more because it deserves more. I highly recommend this to everyone, especially for those who wish to have beautiful, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great konjac sponge. It exfoliates and remove all the dead skin. It comes in a cute box. The sponge is small initially but when you soak it in the water for few minutes it becomes big. It is soft and gentle on the skin. No irritation or side effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge with bamboo charcoal is perfect for your skin to deeply clean the skin. It removes dirt, excess oil, makeup residue, dead skin and reduce blemish-causing bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is great for cleansing and exfoliating. It is doing awesome job. I am using this sponge since I got it in the mail. I am amazed with the result. It has improved my skin. My skin looks more fresh and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;When I am done after using the sponge, I squeeze and remove the excess water and let it air dry. It will dry and shrink to its original size.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed how well the Konjac sponge works. I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate enough to get this awesome product as part of a promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Really like this, used it 3 times and can already see a difference.  Will continue to order them when needed!</li>
            <li> These beauty sponges are very popular in Japan and Korea.  They are made of natural, edible konjac corm fibers and charcoal made from bamboo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small sponge is shaped like a river stone and is very hard until soaked in warm water and then it becomes luxuriously soft and slightly gelatinous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After bathing, use the rounded side to slowly massage the face to both gently exfoliate and hydrate the skin.  It is not necessary to rinse the skin afterwards.  This treatment is a very relaxing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge itself should be carefully rinsed after use and then allowed to thoroughly dry.  It has a loop of string attached for hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mayberry Health and Home provided a sponge for evaluation and review.</li>
