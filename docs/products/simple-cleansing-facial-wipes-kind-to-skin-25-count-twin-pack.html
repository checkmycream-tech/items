            <li>These wipes also came in handy when I was too lazy/tired to get up to wash my face before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li>All comments and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Just that nice \\&quot;I&#x27;m cleaning\\&quot; tingle.</li>
            <li>I liked that the towelette was about the size of a kleenex.  </li>
            <li>It is my own creation called the \\&quot;One Direction Rating Scale\\&quot; and it goes from Zayn to Niall.</li>
            <li>Probably to take off the make up effectively, but...</li>
            <li>But beware, your face will have a shine afterwards, which is why I also keep neutrogena shine control power handy.</li>
            <li>These are really nice wipes.</li>
            <li>They have a nice smell and they do not make my skin burn.</li>
            <li>and it even says that it is kind to skin.</li>
            <li>These are kind of scratchy though, as another reviewer said.</li>
            <li>all, it&#x27;s a a really nice product, but it&#x27;s just not suited for me.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>The very best thing about this product is how quick and easy it gets off all my makeup</li>
            <li>These cool wipes feel great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Getting to try this new product was awesome!</li>
            <li>These wipes are very soft to the touch and felt wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about keeping some in the fridge so they will be even more refreshing to use!</li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to try out all of the products</li>
            <li>They are perfect for oily sensitive skin and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good price for a really good product.</li>

            <li>It had a pleasant, mild smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell, and my face feels smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>Perfect product for removing make-up,  fast, easy, just the right size non-irritating wipes without scrubbing,  pleasant scent, no oily residue or chemical odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I received these free because I tend to overlook things like this when shopping for skincare items.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>I first researched and learned more about the product, it contains two ingredients that are great for your skin, Zinc PCA and Glycerin.  </li>
            <li>These balancing wipes are a good refreshing wipe to use at the end of the day, or as I discovered on my most recent trip to the water park, they are great for wiping the sweat and grime off your face after standing in lines for hours at an amusement</li>
            <li>work well for cleansing the dirt away, and even provide a nice refreshing feel of smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>Just a warning though you&#x27;re face will need more and more.</li>
            <li>This is an okay face wipe</li>
            <li>Does an okay job at removing makeup</li>
            <li>The wipes are ok.</li>
            <li>Love these to remove my makeup at night.  </li>
            <li>Upon receiving it I love the design itself.</li>
            <li>but kinda made my skin have a healthy glow, which I love.</li>
            <li>I compared this product with my all-time favorite, Yes to Cucumber wipes and \\&quot;ultra-soft\\&quot;</li>
            <li>While I do love most of the Simple product line I would say I love these wipes the best.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and the price is reasonable which makes treating your face to a good cleaning a pleasure instead of a chore.</li>
            <li>I love pulling this pack out of my gym bag for my workouts.  </li>
            <li>During my workout the wipes were really refreshing for wicking sweat.  </li>
            <li>and i feel that my oil is more under control</li>
            <li>sometimes when it comes to taking off my makeup, so I am glad I got these for my BzzCampaign.</li>
            <li>I personally love the Oil Balancing cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>The Oil balancing wipes are great to use in the morning when my face is really oily.</li>
            <li>and I noticed my makeup stayed on better and longer and instead of blotting three times a day</li>
            <li>and I felt stood out more.</li>
            <li>I received these wipes for free and am sharing my HONEST opinion.</li>
            <li>I was able to try these wipes free of charge!</li>
            <li>my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>All my products were free!</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s famous for playing Marnie, on HBO&#x27;s Girls.</li>
            <li>I am actually really glad I got picked to do this campaign because the products are great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love these wipes.</li>
            <li>most cleaners I have used either dont treat the oily skin or burn when you use them and</li>
            <li>Did I mention I got to try them FREE by being a Bzz agent?!</li>
            <li>It helps to remove the oil that accumulates during the exercise, and makes sure that my face doesn&#x27;t keep getting oily for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>These are great for those nights or any night really.</li>
            <li>it definetley helps me keep a not oily face :)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product does not contain alcohol, perfumes or dyes.</li>
            <li>Whether I am taking off make-up or just needing to refresh my face, the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes are perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to pick some up when I run out.</li>
            <li>They are a perfect size for cleansing your entire face.  </li>
            <li>The wipes would be better if they were more moist.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would remove my eye makeup without causing my eyes to burn.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li>They take off make up well, although if you have a FULL face of make up it takes like 2 pads to do the job, which is fine because they are a good size.</li>
            <li>Thanks again BzzAgent!!!!</li>
            <li>I was sent this product on an online community, and I actually liked the unique concept and ingredients that truly did the job.</li>
            <li>If you use makeup quite a bit then these would help clean your pores really nicely without leaving a residue or overdrying of the face.  </li>
            <li>It even feels nice after you clean off your makeup.</li>
            <li>After receiving a free sample of these wipes from the Simple Skincare Campaign on the BzzAgent Website I was able to try and receive delightful results.</li>
            <li>It was amazing, so I gave some to my sister (who has super oily skin).</li>
            <li>and I love that the scent is very mild.</li>
            <li>i recieved these wipes free from bzz agent to try and I love them most of all...</li>
            <li>Clean!</li>
            <li>they are great they get make up off really well and leave your face feeling fresh!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They are great for an early morning face wake-up or for an afternoon refresher.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free through BzzAgent.com.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is arguably the most important category.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this free product from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably not the best person to review this product because I&#x27;m really not the target audience.</li>
            <li>These keep my face from that continual post-workout grossness :) I did get the item for free as part of a sampling pack from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this free product from BzzAgent and it is definately a product I would purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that they are good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It was love at first use!!</li>
            <li>These wipes are great because they use natural ingredients and don&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quickly brings your skin back into balance, and the best part of all is it has virtually no scent.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m super excited guys!</li>
            <li>I love the feeling after wiping my face clean with these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to finally find a product that can get rid of that shiny look and leave my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>Not to oily but also not to dry, My face is clean and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I like bringing face wipes with me when I travel because they&#x27;re easy to use and don&#x27;t require anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>were too drying/harsh on my skin, or had too strong of a smell.  </li>
            <li>They are not alcohol based so they do not burn after you use them and do not have that strong odor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were a huge help though and would recommend them if you are in a hurry/and or want an easy way to keep clean!</li>
            <li>They are pretty nice though.</li>
            <li>When I first used them I liked them.</li>
            <li>But after I used the first wipe, I was really impressed by the concept and results of the product and that led me to try several brands.</li>
            <li>Whether its for a quick freshen up during the day or part of your nightly ritual this product seems to decrease the appearance of oily skin!</li>
            <li>Fast, easy and effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, these left a really pleasant fresh feeling on my face, which I love and wish the Radiance Wipes had a bit more of.</li>
            <li>(honestly I probably would not pay this much for this product because I&#x27;m CHEAP.</li>
            <li>I think that these will really come in handy in the summer when my oil is out of control.</li>
            <li>I got this item for free because I am a BzzAgent, and was invited to participate in this campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>(I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.)</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, so when I started using these, free via bzzagent.com, I was praying they wouldn&#x27;t make my skin more oily, leading to more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I received these in my free sample kit from BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li>I followed up with the light moisturizer</li>
            <li>but these are fabulous for post-workout sweatiness.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product one week ago</li>
            <li>Overall these cleansing wipes are great for removing oil, dirt, and makeup but they can also be used as an &#x27;on the go&#x27; wipe to use on your hands and body etc.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it also smells lovely in a natural kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product as a BzzAgent.</li>

            <li>I have heard many great things about the brand itself but have never really tried it before.</li>
            <li>but these are far superior.</li>
            <li>They did have a very pleasant smell but that&#x27;s the only positive aspect I can find.</li>
            <li>but i found myseld using it more right before applying my make up.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I received these from bzzagent for free to review.</li>
            <li>The simple products are wonderful and I highly recommend you try them.</li>
            <li>They also leave your skin feeling light and clean.</li>
            <li>but after I was finished my skin felt smooth and clean</li>
            <li>Keeping a pack in your night side table makes it easy to remove makeup quickly to get you off to sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re portable and the cool soft cloth-like material is soothing and feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>First I would like to say this product was sent to me free to try, I really enjoyed trying this product.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for people with sensitive skin like me and they have a nice little scent to them.</li>
            <li>feels very refreshing and leaves face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I find that using the Radiance wipes first to take off my makeup, then these to control oil, is a winning</li>
            <li>These would be perfect if you&#x27;re in a rush, too lazy, or camping.  </li>
            <li>and I have significantly seen a difference.</li>
            <li>I got this product as a free full size sample</li>
            <li>and I always have a clean feeling after using them.</li>
            <li>I can see the dirt on the cloth, so I know my face is getting clean.</li>
            <li>use them during the day at work when I am sweaty or when I just feel like I need to clean my face.</li>
            <li>I loved receiving this Simple skincare product for free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was so lucky to have received this product for free using Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li>so I was happy they didn&#x27;t make me break out OR dry</li>
            <li>I clean my face with one of these wipes</li>
            <li>and I feel like it leaves my skin feeling extremely clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;They feel soothing and you feel clean</li>
            <li>and if everything is peachy and clean.</li>
            <li>You can even keep the wipes by the bed so that, just in case you forgot to wash your face before going to bed, you can still clean up without getting up.</li>
            <li>recommend this product for anyone who has combination skin like myself, and wants a good and fast way to remove all  of his or her makeup without having irritation or even oilier/drier skin.</li>
            <li>I have always had some what oily skin, and i have noticed a pretty significant change in my skin since using these wipes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just received my very first bzz campaign, very exciting stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used wipes a lot cheaper from the dollar store and they work even better than these ones and are very moist.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent.com, I received free (full-sized!)</li>
            <li>This was a good product overall.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried any of their products until I received my free campaign from BzzAgent and wanted to see if they were really worth the hype.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face was not tight or had any irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  Simple (.....) with nice colors and easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to try it, as I have very oily</li>
            <li>even water proof mascara comes off pretty easy with these wipes without them burningmy eyes out of my head.</li>
            <li>I recently got to try them for free, and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>so I definitely opt for the simple brand they&#x27;ve been the best for the money.</li>
            <li>When I was pregnant, I used the \\&quot;Yes to Blueberries\\&quot; face wipes and they worked well.  </li>
            <li>I feel this product would be best for a person who could benefit from it by using it on the entire face than for someone like me who only has an oily nose.</li>
            <li>While these only work okay with balancing oil, I love the way they smell.</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>Overall, I was impressed with the quality of these affordable Simple skincare</li>
            <li>I usually wear powdered foundation every day and this product did a very good job in removing all of it from my face and chin.</li>
            <li>They not only cleanse, but have added vitamins like vitamin E and pro vitamin b5 as well as skin loving ingredients like mango extract and glycerin, all amazing for touchably soft skin.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this product is pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed upon opening the package was the light scent.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave these a four star is because these wipes definitely cannot replace a good old shower... while they were great for camping I would not just use them in place of washing my face or taking a shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so fast and easy.</li>
            <li>These do a really good job at cleaning my face without leaving it feeling sticky or excessively dry.  </li>
            <li>If you are willing to buy it, I say: why not!</li>
            <li>I bet they&#x27;d be pretty useful for kids, too!</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and they are very moist.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzz agent I received this for free.</li>
            <li>But instead of dropping everything to run through a whole beauty regimen (you know, washing with a chemical filled cleanser to strip the oil off my face - hair getting caught in the crossfires - then slathering my face with lotion</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;ll probably work very well for people with genuinely oily skin</li>
            <li>I got to try out this product for free thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>This product is convenient, an extremely good value compared to similar products, is completely fragrance free and my face has never been softer.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that is mostly oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It felt cooling and refreshing on my skin and despite my initial opinion I found that the towelette was perfectly moist enough for my entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used cleansing wipes in nearly 8 years, but I LOVE these.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li>Thank you BZZAGENT for the free product, to be able to help pass the word of Simple Skincare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to the more natural \\&quot;Yes to Blueberries\\&quot; line.</li>
            <li>I guess my skin is just a bit more sensitive when it comes to this product.</li>
            <li>I received the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes for free via BzzAgent - and I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face felt fresh.</li>
            <li>They remove the oil and somehow leave my skin feeling healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>This is a product that I will definitely use every night before bed to ensure my face is clean, and I will most definitely be purchasing more after I run out of my sample!</li>
            <li>Even though it hasn&#x27;t significantly changed my skin, I love that it is gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use the Original Simple Cleansing Wipes every day and love them.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used my daily face wash when I tried these wipes and my felt felt fresh and clean all day after using it!!</li>
            <li>and you just want something to remove your makeup right away.</li>
            <li>think these could work for someone with the right skin.</li>
            <li>so I think it has just the right amount of roughness to gently exfoliate and clean your skin.  </li>
            <li>they are a really nice size, and have a slight smell, but it&#x27;s more of a clean natural smell.</li>
            <li>I had acne for 16 years, and just recently been able to manage it through diet and careful use of only the best lotions.</li>
            <li>They are great for sensitive skin, they don&#x27;t make my face for dry at all.</li>
            <li>They feel good on my face, don&#x27;t dry it up too much, but it keeps the oil under control.</li>
            <li>These are great for me when I am too lazy to fully wash face.  </li>
            <li>They were gentle, effective, fresh scented, and left no residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>I give my face a good wipe down with the Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes before moisturizing and applying my makeup and</li>
            <li>you are looking for an easy face cleansing product, with no mess or water required, this is your product!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes with my first use!</li>
            <li>While I like these wipes I have to admit that I like the radiance cleansing wipes a little more because it feels a bit more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This second day I used the product I made sure to use the Simple skin protecting light moisturizer which felt so much better afterwards, together these products are wonderful, I would not use this product by itself personally but would still recommend it to other people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed Simple&#x27;s eye makeup remover pads because they were not only gentle on my skin and eyes, but did an amazing job removing even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>They are very gentle.</li>
            <li>My first use of this product was due to a free sample from bzzagent, but I will most definitely be back for many more purchases from the Simple brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like these wipes make my skin feel tight or dry when I use them and it removes makeup perfectly off my face without any burning or stinging.</li>
            <li>and they make you&#x27;re face feel fresh in addition to absorbing oil.</li>
            <li>I love these facial wipes!</li>
            <li>Yikes, I can&#x27;t believe these cost this much!</li>
            <li>I definitely love this product and will continue to use the Simple skin care line on my face!  </li>
            <li>First of all, the product packaging for the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes is extremely cute.  </li>
            <li>These have got to be one of my favorite products from Simple.</li>
            <li>I noticed that some reviewers complained of the cloth being too rough, but it was perfect for me because it was smoother than a wash cloth, but not so smooth that it just felt like it was smearing my makeup around.</li>
            <li>but I do have pretty oily skin all around</li>
            <li>I Love the Simple oil balancing wipes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become the first step in my morning beauty routine...</li>
            <li>Felt nice on my skin but slightly rough.  </li>
            <li>And for this first review I&#x27;m torn.  </li>
            <li>THis is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>and I also used them once during the day to keep my skin oil free and so soft.</li>
            <li>The first time I used them I could see a difference.</li>
            <li>love the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes!</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the wipes were meant to get rid of oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li>However, these wipes are more cleansers and don&#x27;t remove oil without actually cleaning your face and also removing your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I instead grab one of these cleansing wipes and in a matter of seconds my skin feels so much happier!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin &amp; these wipes work wonders!</li>
            <li>I will first start by mentioning I do not have overly oily skin.  </li>
            <li>These wipe are scented (light scent) and remove makeup while not stripping your face of all the natural oils your face needs.</li>
            <li>They also have \\&quot;skin loving\\&quot; ingredients such as zinc, glycerin, mango extract and more.  </li>
            <li>I use the wipes first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Yes to product did a good job too, but I needed to wipe a few times with Neutrogena&#x27;s, despite its claim of a \\&quot;patented formula\\&quot; that \\&quot;dissolves all types of makeup, even waterproof mascara\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It smells and feels like it just has water, but it cleans much deeper and is still super gentle.</li>
            <li>It left my skin looking clean and healthy; as well as leaving my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of these because it is so light that it is barely even present!  </li>
            <li>They are made from natural ingredients to help keep oily skin clean.</li>
            <li>This particular cleansing wipe left my face feeling clean and smooth in the areas that are not prone to being oily but sticky across my nose and along my jaw line.</li>
            <li>Most of the times she gets really oily by mid morning</li>
            <li>I used this every morning for the past 7 days and each time my face feels  fresh, soft, clean, healthy and protected and you don&#x27;t have to rinse!</li>
            <li>I am becoming a big fan of this brand.</li>
            <li>The first couple of wipes in each package aren&#x27;t very moist, so you may need to use two if you wear your makeup heavier.</li>
            <li>Plus, unlike some other facial wipes these hold up great.</li>
            <li>I do prefer a similar wipe by LA Fresh as they are more natural but they are also twice the price.</li>
            <li>The next day I bought a pack for my own and have been using them for the past week, and so far so good, nothing has really changed on my face.</li>
            <li>First off, I got a free Simple Skincare pack to test from BzzAgent.com, so I had no idea</li>
            <li>My face felt super soft after each wipe.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t use these kinds of product because of my sensitive skin but this works great ...</li>
            <li>They made my face super soft and have a glow to it.</li>
            <li>To top it off, the inconvenience and discomfort of having to splash water all over your face and then wipe it dry is gone when you use these.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems with breaking out -- they were very mild and I appreciate that they only have two ingredients.</li>
            <li>Luckily they are helping my skin clear up though.</li>
            <li>These wipes cleared those areas easily and left my face feeling</li>
            <li>I have to bundle the wipe up just to make it strong enough to use.</li>
            <li>Great for facial wipe down at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant but it was a bit unexpected.</li>
            <li>Other than that I was VERY pleased with how fresh, clean, soft and smooth my face has gotten since starting the use of all Simple Skincare Products.</li>
            <li>They did not leave an oily residue or any other sticky product after I used them and my face and body felt very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Simple&#x27;s oil balancing wipes are very handy to have around for removing make-up or wiping down when you are feeling sweaty and oily but can&#x27;t shower.</li>
            <li>the winter I suspect they would be a little drying for me personally, but for now, these are a great wipe to toss in my bag for before work or after the gym.</li>
            <li>They work great for daily use if you travel or if you need a little touch up at your desk throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and breaks out within hours of using anything new, so I was nervous trying something new, but received a free sample</li>
            <li>It still gets oily, but not as much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help too much</li>
            <li>It also cleans up make up very well.</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use their face moisturizer, and highly recommend their products!</li>
            <li>and they are gentle as they say.</li>
            <li>how much these costed til now.</li>
            <li>Knowing how much they cost, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them if I saw them at the store unless they were cheaper.</li>
            <li>I did receive this for free, however I am definitely going to repurchase this soon!</li>
            <li>I got to try this product thanks to being a bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Simple Oil Balancing cleansing wipes via a Word of Mouth marketing campaign called Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really notice the oil balancing aspect of these</li>
            <li>Simple&#x27;s product wiped away the line immediately with a light touch.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an convenient option for after my gym time and had the opportunity to try the Simple line for free...</li>
            <li>so I have to be very cautious about the products that I use.</li>
            <li>I like it when you can really see on the wipes all of the gunk that it removed from your face.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I have been using these Simple Oil Balancing Wipes that I received free from Buzzagent for about a week now.</li>
            <li>These wipes are gentle, yet you can feel that they are cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li>M Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer Spf 15, 4.2 Ounce]], Eye Make-Up Remover Pads, [[ASIN:B00AO4EMKQ</li>
            <li>I received Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes for free about a week ago from BZZ Agent as part of their campaign and have been using them ever since.</li>
            <li>It did not burn, make my face feel drying after removing the makeup, if anything it left it smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>But, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I received the Simple oil balancing cleansing wipes for free through BuzzAgent, and after testing them out I must say that they are are a MUST for festival season.</li>
            <li>so they really are helping.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>It provided gentle cleansing and my skin was indeed refreshed.</li>
            <li>It was gentle to my skin, as it states.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>SO it worked for both of us really well.</li>
            <li>They are like gauze, and it feels like they will fall apart in my hands and will in fact do so if you stretch them too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this product as a free sample as a part of a BzzAgent.com Simple Skincare Campaign*</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was from the texture of the cloths or just the whole product.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I had success with Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes and will use them in the future.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin throughout the day, and found that these wipes didn&#x27;t really help much with decreasing my oily skin.</li>
            <li>and they work really well.</li>
            <li>They seem to gently exfoliate too.</li>
            <li>I use them very day.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of these from Bzzagent and was surprised out how useful I found them.</li>
            <li>My face is usually really oily at the end of the day</li>
            <li>I just recently received a free sample of these wipes as part of a BzzAgent Campaign.  </li>
            <li>I received my simple skin oil balancing wipes free through bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>I received a package of Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have very oily skin</li>
            <li>These do have a scent, but I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it.</li>
            <li>very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t have much of a scent which I really like in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I just tried the complete Simple skincare range -- which includes their Radiance cleansing wipes, Oil Balancing cleansing wipes, eye makeup remover pads &amp; their Protecting light moisturizer!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m constantly trying these wipes and so far they are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love these and would totally recommend them to anyone who has sensitive and oily skin....</li>
            <li>I would have liked the wipes to be smaller like the size of their make up remover pads for those of us who have combination skin and don&#x27;t need the wipe for the entire face.</li>
            <li>product did take care of my oily skin but isn&#x27;t my favorite product from Simple sensitive skin products.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say mine is more normal to dry.</li>
            <li>And I was not disappointed, the Oil balancing cleansing wipes definitely left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized without feeling all oily, I also noticed a definite reduction of the oiliness feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Right when I use it it wipes away all the oil and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The facial cleansing wipes were fantastic, and left my face feeling clean and</li>
            <li>Simple is VERY gentle on the most fragile skin there is.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got simple products to try in the mail courtesy of bzzagent.com!</li>
            <li>I felt that I had a lot more blemishes appear after using these than my other skincare products.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Simple brand face products.</li>
            <li>Another big issue: the second ingredient is propylene glycol - definitely not a &#x27;simple, skin loving&#x27; ingredient in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I have such oily and dry combination skin, I have tried so many things on it, but the oil busting astringents dry it out, and the moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past leave me greasy; this one is the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Overall I really did enjoy this product and it will be my new go-to.</li>
            <li>but also I would clean my body daily with these.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package I was surprised that the towelette wasn&#x27;t very moist.  </li>
            <li>These left my face feeling clean but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I felt like all my make up was off, but I never feel quite clean until I actually WASH my face.</li>
            <li>Although the Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes did not leave my skin looking as red and feeling as irritated as it does when I have used a harsher cleanser, I do not believe that my face is as clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>Usually I clean up my makeup with some fancy face soap and water, and occasionally realize after applying toner that the makeup did not come off all the way because I see it on the toner sheet.</li>
            <li>Which means that I clean my face day and night now as well as add moisturizer every morning before applying my makeup or going outside.  </li>
            <li>the other Simple products were pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>So many products claim to be for sensitive skin, but end up causing a breakout or cause your skin to dry out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, I am so lazy</li>
            <li>This would be great to take to the gym also, because the small, sturdy packaging won&#x27;t take up much room and the wipes will refresh your skin after a long workout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was a visible reduction of blemishes after about a week, but before then, the blemishes I had were much redder than normal</li>
            <li>The line is Simple skincare and it included 4 products, full size I might add, not some sample size</li>
            <li>This Simple product has the most subtle fragrance and because it performs well and is gentle on my skin, it has become my favorite wipe.</li>
            <li>So, I felt good about getting a little extra cleanse from these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to include these in my &#x27;new baby&#x27; kits for friends and keep a pack on hand for myself too!</li>
            <li>It seems like facial cleansing towelettes are the latest trend in beauty products and facial care.</li>
            <li>Now there are many similar products ranging from generic drugstore brands to high-end cosmetics makers&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li>I use the oil balancing wipes mainly after I work out</li>
            <li>Plus they really are soft gentle wipes I don&#x27;t feel them scratching my skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>They clean your skin without being harsh and leave it feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>At first I only tried the regular simple cleansing facial wipes which I loved and have gone through three packages.</li>
            <li>These wipes left my face feeling so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Every time I use them they have removed all of the oil from my face and left my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It also left a kind of tight feeling on my face, so it ended up taking a bit too much oil away from my skin.</li>
            <li>They are gentle and free of artificial fragrance and can easily be toted along with you for a quick refresh.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or dry it out, just left it clean and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I recommend these wipes to anyone with really oily skin or those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These have been really gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I normally remove makeup/dirt with jojoba oil which works wonders of course, but since I&#x27;m an actress sometimes it gets to be an inconvenience</li>
            <li>then I did my normal makeup routine</li>
            <li>These wipes do NOT contain any harsh ingredients and I was able to use them on my son&#x27;s face as well.</li>
            <li>I would consider my skin to be normal.  </li>
            <li>And again, I have normal skin.  </li>
            <li>To me a good wipe will remove makeup and cleanse without drying or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>But, this does make my face very soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out, which is unique for an oil-balancing product.</li>
            <li>I have quite cranky skin; sensitive to most wipes/cleansers, but I definitely do not have a problem using Simple, they truly know how to help those with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for an easy to use facial cleansing product.</li>
            <li>My super sensitive skin seems to like them well enough.</li>
            <li>I tried a few of the simple products as a free sample from bzzagent and this one is my favorite out of the simple skin line.</li>
            <li>The no-sting solution on the wipes makes it a comfortable alternative to other harsher skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I honestly was a little leery of trying a new facial product.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I break out when I start new products.</li>
            <li>Directions are clear as day and  ingredients are very visible for those who are sensitive, like I am.</li>
            <li>I could ready see the different and see my face less oily and the scent is okay.</li>
            <li>Subtle scent which was nice</li>
            <li>These help A LOT with the oil control though the wipes themselves are slightly rough, but I guess that could be a good thing if you like to scrub off some dead skin.</li>
            <li>Zinc PCA is proven to give a freshness to the skin and Glycerin is proven to improve smoothness and lubrication of the skin, the presence of these ingredients, minus all the harsh ingredients normally found in skin care products, made me super excited to try it!  </li>
            <li>The wipes were very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The cleaning face wipes left my skin moisturized, clean, and most importantly free of red patches and bumps, which has been the result of other face cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Let me first start by saying how excited I was to get to try this as well as other new products from the Simple Skincare line.  </li>
            <li>I like these wipes very much for my skins needs and skin type, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these wipes however for someone who has dry or very dry skin because the wipes do control oil &amp; shine so it wouldn&#x27;t be great at adding moisture to the skin if it is a very dry or dry skin type.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft even as I am typing this!</li>
            <li>No rash from my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I first tried Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes the morning after I received it.</li>
            <li>I have always had oily skin and these wipes completely take care of that!</li>
            <li>so I have tried many oil reducing products in the past.</li>
            <li>I am also surprised at the price of these!</li>
            <li>I have some really dry areas on my face and these wipes don&#x27;t dry those areas out more</li>
            <li>I tried two wipes so far of the new oil balancing wipe</li>
            <li>I have a 7 month old so, i&#x27;m not as much of a &#x27;new&#x27; mom</li>
            <li>My face is combo, where after I wash it, it gets really dry and flaky, but as the day goes on, it gets really oily in certain spots.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed when I opened the package of Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes was the mild perfume of a cleanser which I was unaccustomed to after using three of the brand&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these wipes, I was a little hesitant to try them as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I discontinued using this product, my skin returned to its natural glow; therefore, if you have sensitive skin - proceed with caution!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these in the morning, or whenever I need a quick wipe off - especially on our recent trip to Florida.  </li>
            <li>I am throughly please with Simple&#x27;s new skincare range and cannot wait to make it my new skincare regime for the summer!</li>
            <li>But honestly - that would make me more likely to give it a bad review if it did&#x27;t work - because what would I have to lose?</li>
            <li>They left my skin feeling very refreshed, and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it would take forever to clear up.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all thanks to Simple Skincare.  </li>
            <li>I love the way all the simple skin care cleansing wipes work, the only thing I would change is the rough, scratchy feeling.</li>
            <li>so I try to use products that are made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Naturally, this oil balancing cleansing wipe is produced for sensitive skin, and the fact that it was tested by dermatologists caught my eye.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, combination skin (I am predisposed to breaking out along my jaw</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and also oily skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about what you&#x27;re putting on your face.</li>
            <li>I even used it on my neck and chest which is sensitive as well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend theses for sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive oily skin and these wipes have worked wonders.</li>
            <li>This product uses natural skin-loving ingredients like zinc.</li>
            <li>I go through a whole lot of facial wipes because I wipe my face once when I wake up before I wash my face and again to take off some makeup before I wash my face and go to bed</li>
            <li>and I have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li>My son is 2 years old.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simple Sensitive Skin Wipes and Oil Control</li>
            <li>and I gotta say I was surprised by the oil control power of this wipes.</li>
            <li>These were soft though</li>
            <li>I even used it on my husband who has incredibly sensitive skin (he uses unscented soaps, detergents, lotions, etc)</li>
            <li>I am really liking the products that Simple is putting out.</li>
            <li>I suffer from oily sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They leave my face soft and oil-free</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive &amp; I usually break out from much products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off: I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the rest of my face pretty dry.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smell too strong, perfumey or chemically like others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I am an owner of super sensitive skin and many products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, even for sensitive skin, have left me with red, dry, bumpy skin.</li>
            <li>But... I was quickly let down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure who started this trend, either, but like my wife said, you didn&#x27;t really see these kind of products until a few years ago.</li>
            <li>When I first open it I was like wow these wipes are big.</li>
            <li>As a college student who is striving for a good gpa as a science major and balancing three jobs it was difficult to manage my stress levels and keep my forehead in check.</li>
            <li>the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes left my skin oil free after a long and strenuous workout, which I need because I break out from all the sweat!</li>
            <li>The wipes are sturdy and pretty good quality however they were not so moist, probably I got a bad one?</li>
            <li>would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Simple skin care product line!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these wipes for any skin type, but especially those with oily skin.</li>
            <li>The Simple Oil Balancing Wipes do a great job of cutting down on oil and removing excess dirt, allowing skin to clear up quickly.</li>
            <li>While it was not unpleasant, the scent lingered for nearly half an hour after washing my face.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was a bit rough on my skin</li>
            <li>I used one last night with my normal routine and then this morning before I washed my face</li>
            <li>I expected the wipes to be gentle, since it is specifically for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I found them very convenient when I threw my back out and was laid up recently.</li>
            <li>They are priced reasonably compared to similar products I have tried and I definitely recommend them.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant at first, because I have very sensitive and dry skin, and I didn&#x27;t want there to be any problems for my face than it already had been the past couple of months the fact that I was jut getting back under control, but I used one anyway, and knew immediately it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>B003II0R7M Badger Broad Spectrum SPF 35</li>
            <li>The Simple Wipes were soft on my skin and the mountain range on my forehead was gone in three days!</li>
            <li>I had no use for them until the radiating skin wipes caused me a major breakout.</li>
            <li>Having had sensitive skin for years now, it is important for me to use a product that isn&#x27;t to harsh on my face, because then I either end up with blemishes, or my skin becomes all dry and chapped.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry and oily skin, and these were like a gift from the gods haha.</li>
            <li>and i have recieved FREE dull sized samples of Oil balancing cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>The wipes left my skin feeling soft and my skin felt refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of scrubs with microbeads because my facial skin is sensitive and they hurt.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling soft and refreshed</li>
            <li>Over the years I have found that if you completely strip an oily face, your face lashes back with an over production of oil!!</li>
            <li>Left my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I had the same problem that I had with the radiance wipes though because these wipes are also pretty rough and scratchy.</li>
            <li>The light moisturizer isn&#x27;t thick or greasy and protects from UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 15.</li>
            <li>Smell is ok but not great.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend that you check out the new Simple Skincare products.  </li>
            <li>and the wipes kept very moist and wet and did not dry</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to not only women with sensitive skin, but to all women who wish to take care of their skin!</li>
            <li>They get off my sunscreen and leave my face feeling clean and dry without feeling tight or sticky.</li>
            <li>I love that the wipes also didn&#x27;t make my face feel tight and dried out.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin but due to my sennsitive skin its really hard to find a product that will clean my face and not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>They do not dry my skin out</li>
            <li>They take off heavy duty makeup, but are still very gentle as well.  </li>
            <li>My skin was a little red after using the product the first day.</li>
            <li>My weird skin was left feeling soft, very clean, and it was not oily at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple on my skin and does not dry or irritate my skin when I use it.</li>
            <li>They left my skin feeling rather tight and less than clean after use.</li>
            <li>A little disappointing to see that it says No Alcohol on the front, yet Alcohol is one of the ingredients, but my skin did not experience any irritation, so I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li>So so fresh, almost a citrusy-powdery scent that&#x27;s hard to place.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is my own creation called the \\&quot;One Direction Rating Scale\\&quot; and it goes from Zayn to Niall.</li>
            <li> Probably to take off the make up effectively, but...</li>
            <li> But beware, your face will have a shine afterwards, which is why I also keep neutrogena shine control power handy.</li>
            <li> These are really nice wipes.</li>
            <li> They have a nice smell and they do not make my skin burn.</li>
            <li> and it even says that it is kind to skin.</li>
            <li> These are kind of scratchy though, as another reviewer said.</li>
            <li> all, it&#x27;s a a really nice product, but it&#x27;s just not suited for me.</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The very best thing about this product is how quick and easy it gets off all my makeup</li>
            <li> These cool wipes feel great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very gentle, Gives you a very clean feeling,And Most of all my skin stayed BALANCED!!!</li>
            <li> Getting to try this new product was awesome!</li>
            <li> These wipes are very soft to the touch and felt wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about keeping some in the fridge so they will be even more refreshing to use!</li>
            <li> It was nice to be able to try out all of the products</li>
            <li> They are perfect for oily sensitive skin and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good price for a really good product.</li>
            <li> They have a pleasant, but not overpowering scent that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It had a pleasant, mild smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell, and my face feels smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> Perfect product for removing make-up,  fast, easy, just the right size non-irritating wipes without scrubbing,  pleasant scent, no oily residue or chemical odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I received these free because I tend to overlook things like this when shopping for skincare items.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> I first researched and learned more about the product, it contains two ingredients that are great for your skin, Zinc PCA and Glycerin.  </li>
            <li> These balancing wipes are a good refreshing wipe to use at the end of the day, or as I discovered on my most recent trip to the water park, they are great for wiping the sweat and grime off your face after standing in lines for hours at an amusement</li>
            <li> work well for cleansing the dirt away, and even provide a nice refreshing feel of smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> Just a warning though you&#x27;re face will need more and more.</li>
            <li> This is an okay face wipe</li>
            <li> Does an okay job at removing makeup</li>
            <li> The wipes are ok.</li>
            <li> Love these to remove my makeup at night.  </li>
            <li> Upon receiving it I love the design itself.</li>
            <li> but kinda made my skin have a healthy glow, which I love.</li>
            <li> I compared this product with my all-time favorite, Yes to Cucumber wipes and \\&quot;ultra-soft\\&quot;</li>
            <li> While I do love most of the Simple product line I would say I love these wipes the best.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and the price is reasonable which makes treating your face to a good cleaning a pleasure instead of a chore.</li>
            <li> I love pulling this pack out of my gym bag for my workouts.  </li>
            <li> During my workout the wipes were really refreshing for wicking sweat.  </li>
            <li> and i feel that my oil is more under control</li>
            <li> sometimes when it comes to taking off my makeup, so I am glad I got these for my BzzCampaign.</li>
            <li> I personally love the Oil Balancing cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> The Oil balancing wipes are great to use in the morning when my face is really oily.</li>
            <li> and I noticed my makeup stayed on better and longer and instead of blotting three times a day</li>
            <li> and I felt stood out more.</li>
            <li> I received these wipes for free and am sharing my HONEST opinion.</li>
            <li> I was able to try these wipes free of charge!</li>
            <li> my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> All my products were free!</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s famous for playing Marnie, on HBO&#x27;s Girls.</li>
            <li> I am actually really glad I got picked to do this campaign because the products are great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love these wipes.</li>
            <li> most cleaners I have used either dont treat the oily skin or burn when you use them and</li>
            <li> Did I mention I got to try them FREE by being a Bzz agent?!</li>
            <li> It helps to remove the oil that accumulates during the exercise, and makes sure that my face doesn&#x27;t keep getting oily for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> These are great for those nights or any night really.</li>
            <li> it definetley helps me keep a not oily face :)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product does not contain alcohol, perfumes or dyes.</li>
            <li> Whether I am taking off make-up or just needing to refresh my face, the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes are perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to pick some up when I run out.</li>
            <li> They are a perfect size for cleansing your entire face.  </li>
            <li> The wipes would be better if they were more moist.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would remove my eye makeup without causing my eyes to burn.  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> They take off make up well, although if you have a FULL face of make up it takes like 2 pads to do the job, which is fine because they are a good size.</li>
            <li> Thanks again BzzAgent!!!!</li>
            <li> I was sent this product on an online community, and I actually liked the unique concept and ingredients that truly did the job.</li>
            <li> If you use makeup quite a bit then these would help clean your pores really nicely without leaving a residue or overdrying of the face.  </li>
            <li> It even feels nice after you clean off your makeup.</li>
            <li> After receiving a free sample of these wipes from the Simple Skincare Campaign on the BzzAgent Website I was able to try and receive delightful results.</li>
            <li> It was amazing, so I gave some to my sister (who has super oily skin).</li>
            <li> and I love that the scent is very mild.</li>
            <li> i recieved these wipes free from bzz agent to try and I love them most of all...</li>
            <li> Clean!</li>
            <li> they are great they get make up off really well and leave your face feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They are great for an early morning face wake-up or for an afternoon refresher.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free through BzzAgent.com.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is arguably the most important category.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this free product from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably not the best person to review this product because I&#x27;m really not the target audience.</li>
            <li> These keep my face from that continual post-workout grossness :) I did get the item for free as part of a sampling pack from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this free product from BzzAgent and it is definately a product I would purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that they are good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It was love at first use!!</li>
            <li> These wipes are great because they use natural ingredients and don&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quickly brings your skin back into balance, and the best part of all is it has virtually no scent.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m super excited guys!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling after wiping my face clean with these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to finally find a product that can get rid of that shiny look and leave my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Not to oily but also not to dry, My face is clean and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I like bringing face wipes with me when I travel because they&#x27;re easy to use and don&#x27;t require anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> were too drying/harsh on my skin, or had too strong of a smell.  </li>
            <li> They are not alcohol based so they do not burn after you use them and do not have that strong odor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were a huge help though and would recommend them if you are in a hurry/and or want an easy way to keep clean!</li>
            <li> They are pretty nice though.</li>
            <li> When I first used them I liked them.</li>
            <li> But after I used the first wipe, I was really impressed by the concept and results of the product and that led me to try several brands.</li>
            <li> Whether its for a quick freshen up during the day or part of your nightly ritual this product seems to decrease the appearance of oily skin!</li>
            <li> Fast, easy and effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, these left a really pleasant fresh feeling on my face, which I love and wish the Radiance Wipes had a bit more of.</li>
            <li> (honestly I probably would not pay this much for this product because I&#x27;m CHEAP.</li>
            <li> I think that these will really come in handy in the summer when my oil is out of control.</li>
            <li> I got this item for free because I am a BzzAgent, and was invited to participate in this campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s my completely mathematically sound review system.</li>
            <li> After receiving these to try for free, I have found that I really enjoy using these in the morning.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free product from Bazzagent.</li>

            <li> I washed my face in the AM and swiped these, and they kept the area oil free all day.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free to try.</li>
            <li> I got to try these for free with bzzagent</li>
            <li> I received these for free from Bzzagent.com to try out.</li>
            <li> (I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.)</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so when I started using these, free via bzzagent.com, I was praying they wouldn&#x27;t make my skin more oily, leading to more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I received these in my free sample kit from BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li> I followed up with the light moisturizer</li>
            <li> but these are fabulous for post-workout sweatiness.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product one week ago</li>
            <li> Overall these cleansing wipes are great for removing oil, dirt, and makeup but they can also be used as an &#x27;on the go&#x27; wipe to use on your hands and body etc.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it also smells lovely in a natural kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I received these wipes for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In the campaign I received the Protecting Light Moisturizer, the Radiance Cleansing Wipes, Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes, and the Eye Make-up Remover Pads.  </li>
            <li> I have heard many great things about the brand itself but have never really tried it before.</li>
            <li> but these are far superior.</li>
            <li> They did have a very pleasant smell but that&#x27;s the only positive aspect I can find.</li>
            <li> but i found myseld using it more right before applying my make up.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I received these from bzzagent for free to review.</li>
            <li> The simple products are wonderful and I highly recommend you try them.</li>
            <li> They also leave your skin feeling light and clean.</li>
            <li> but after I was finished my skin felt smooth and clean</li>
            <li> Keeping a pack in your night side table makes it easy to remove makeup quickly to get you off to sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re portable and the cool soft cloth-like material is soothing and feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li> First I would like to say this product was sent to me free to try, I really enjoyed trying this product.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for people with sensitive skin like me and they have a nice little scent to them.</li>
            <li> feels very refreshing and leaves face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I find that using the Radiance wipes first to take off my makeup, then these to control oil, is a winning</li>
            <li> These would be perfect if you&#x27;re in a rush, too lazy, or camping.  </li>
            <li> and I have significantly seen a difference.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free full size sample</li>
            <li> and I always have a clean feeling after using them.</li>
            <li> I can see the dirt on the cloth, so I know my face is getting clean.</li>
            <li> use them during the day at work when I am sweaty or when I just feel like I need to clean my face.</li>
            <li> I loved receiving this Simple skincare product for free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was so lucky to have received this product for free using Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> so I was happy they didn&#x27;t make me break out OR dry</li>
            <li> I clean my face with one of these wipes</li>
            <li> and I feel like it leaves my skin feeling extremely clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;They feel soothing and you feel clean</li>
            <li> and if everything is peachy and clean.</li>
            <li> You can even keep the wipes by the bed so that, just in case you forgot to wash your face before going to bed, you can still clean up without getting up.</li>
            <li> recommend this product for anyone who has combination skin like myself, and wants a good and fast way to remove all  of his or her makeup without having irritation or even oilier/drier skin.</li>
            <li> I have always had some what oily skin, and i have noticed a pretty significant change in my skin since using these wipes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received my very first bzz campaign, very exciting stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used wipes a lot cheaper from the dollar store and they work even better than these ones and are very moist.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent.com, I received free (full-sized!)</li>
            <li> This was a good product overall.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried any of their products until I received my free campaign from BzzAgent and wanted to see if they were really worth the hype.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face was not tight or had any irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Simple (.....) with nice colors and easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was very excited to try it, as I have very oily</li>
            <li> even water proof mascara comes off pretty easy with these wipes without them burningmy eyes out of my head.</li>
            <li> I recently got to try them for free, and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> so I definitely opt for the simple brand they&#x27;ve been the best for the money.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant, I used the \\&quot;Yes to Blueberries\\&quot; face wipes and they worked well.  </li>
            <li> I feel this product would be best for a person who could benefit from it by using it on the entire face than for someone like me who only has an oily nose.</li>
            <li> While these only work okay with balancing oil, I love the way they smell.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin</li>
            <li> Overall, I was impressed with the quality of these affordable Simple skincare</li>
            <li> I usually wear powdered foundation every day and this product did a very good job in removing all of it from my face and chin.</li>
            <li> They not only cleanse, but have added vitamins like vitamin E and pro vitamin b5 as well as skin loving ingredients like mango extract and glycerin, all amazing for touchably soft skin.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed upon opening the package was the light scent.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave these a four star is because these wipes definitely cannot replace a good old shower... while they were great for camping I would not just use them in place of washing my face or taking a shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so fast and easy.</li>
            <li> These do a really good job at cleaning my face without leaving it feeling sticky or excessively dry.  </li>
            <li> If you are willing to buy it, I say: why not!</li>
            <li> I bet they&#x27;d be pretty useful for kids, too!</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and they are very moist.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzz agent I received this for free.</li>
            <li> But instead of dropping everything to run through a whole beauty regimen (you know, washing with a chemical filled cleanser to strip the oil off my face - hair getting caught in the crossfires - then slathering my face with lotion</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;ll probably work very well for people with genuinely oily skin</li>
            <li> I got to try out this product for free thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This product is convenient, an extremely good value compared to similar products, is completely fragrance free and my face has never been softer.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that is mostly oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It felt cooling and refreshing on my skin and despite my initial opinion I found that the towelette was perfectly moist enough for my entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used cleansing wipes in nearly 8 years, but I LOVE these.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> Thank you BZZAGENT for the free product, to be able to help pass the word of Simple Skincare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to the more natural \\&quot;Yes to Blueberries\\&quot; line.</li>
            <li> I guess my skin is just a bit more sensitive when it comes to this product.</li>
            <li> I received the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes for free via BzzAgent - and I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face felt fresh.</li>
            <li> They remove the oil and somehow leave my skin feeling healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I will definitely use every night before bed to ensure my face is clean, and I will most definitely be purchasing more after I run out of my sample!</li>
            <li> Even though it hasn&#x27;t significantly changed my skin, I love that it is gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use the Original Simple Cleansing Wipes every day and love them.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used my daily face wash when I tried these wipes and my felt felt fresh and clean all day after using it!!</li>
            <li> and you just want something to remove your makeup right away.</li>
            <li> think these could work for someone with the right skin.</li>
            <li> so I think it has just the right amount of roughness to gently exfoliate and clean your skin.  </li>
            <li> they are a really nice size, and have a slight smell, but it&#x27;s more of a clean natural smell.</li>
            <li> I had acne for 16 years, and just recently been able to manage it through diet and careful use of only the best lotions.</li>
            <li> They are great for sensitive skin, they don&#x27;t make my face for dry at all.</li>
            <li> They feel good on my face, don&#x27;t dry it up too much, but it keeps the oil under control.</li>
            <li> These are great for me when I am too lazy to fully wash face.  </li>
            <li> They were gentle, effective, fresh scented, and left no residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> I give my face a good wipe down with the Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes before moisturizing and applying my makeup and</li>
            <li> you are looking for an easy face cleansing product, with no mess or water required, this is your product!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes with my first use!</li>
            <li> While I like these wipes I have to admit that I like the radiance cleansing wipes a little more because it feels a bit more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This second day I used the product I made sure to use the Simple skin protecting light moisturizer which felt so much better afterwards, together these products are wonderful, I would not use this product by itself personally but would still recommend it to other people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed Simple&#x27;s eye makeup remover pads because they were not only gentle on my skin and eyes, but did an amazing job removing even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> They are very gentle.</li>
            <li> My first use of this product was due to a free sample from bzzagent, but I will most definitely be back for many more purchases from the Simple brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like these wipes make my skin feel tight or dry when I use them and it removes makeup perfectly off my face without any burning or stinging.</li>
            <li> and they make you&#x27;re face feel fresh in addition to absorbing oil.</li>
            <li> I love these facial wipes!</li>
            <li> Yikes, I can&#x27;t believe these cost this much!</li>
            <li> I definitely love this product and will continue to use the Simple skin care line on my face!  </li>
            <li> First of all, the product packaging for the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes is extremely cute.  </li>
            <li> These have got to be one of my favorite products from Simple.</li>
            <li> I noticed that some reviewers complained of the cloth being too rough, but it was perfect for me because it was smoother than a wash cloth, but not so smooth that it just felt like it was smearing my makeup around.</li>
            <li> but I do have pretty oily skin all around</li>
            <li> I Love the Simple oil balancing wipes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become the first step in my morning beauty routine...</li>
            <li> Felt nice on my skin but slightly rough.  </li>
            <li> And for this first review I&#x27;m torn.  </li>
            <li> THis is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> and I also used them once during the day to keep my skin oil free and so soft.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them I could see a difference.</li>
            <li> love the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes!</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the wipes were meant to get rid of oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li> However, these wipes are more cleansers and don&#x27;t remove oil without actually cleaning your face and also removing your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I instead grab one of these cleansing wipes and in a matter of seconds my skin feels so much happier!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin &amp; these wipes work wonders!</li>
            <li> I will first start by mentioning I do not have overly oily skin.  </li>
            <li> These wipe are scented (light scent) and remove makeup while not stripping your face of all the natural oils your face needs.</li>
            <li> They also have \\&quot;skin loving\\&quot; ingredients such as zinc, glycerin, mango extract and more.  </li>
            <li> I use the wipes first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Yes to product did a good job too, but I needed to wipe a few times with Neutrogena&#x27;s, despite its claim of a \\&quot;patented formula\\&quot; that \\&quot;dissolves all types of makeup, even waterproof mascara\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It smells and feels like it just has water, but it cleans much deeper and is still super gentle.</li>
            <li> It left my skin looking clean and healthy; as well as leaving my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of these because it is so light that it is barely even present!  </li>
            <li> They are made from natural ingredients to help keep oily skin clean.</li>
            <li> This particular cleansing wipe left my face feeling clean and smooth in the areas that are not prone to being oily but sticky across my nose and along my jaw line.</li>
            <li> Most of the times she gets really oily by mid morning</li>
            <li> I used this every morning for the past 7 days and each time my face feels  fresh, soft, clean, healthy and protected and you don&#x27;t have to rinse!</li>
            <li> I am becoming a big fan of this brand.</li>
            <li> The first couple of wipes in each package aren&#x27;t very moist, so you may need to use two if you wear your makeup heavier.</li>
            <li> Plus, unlike some other facial wipes these hold up great.</li>
            <li> I do prefer a similar wipe by LA Fresh as they are more natural but they are also twice the price.</li>
            <li> The next day I bought a pack for my own and have been using them for the past week, and so far so good, nothing has really changed on my face.</li>
            <li> First off, I got a free Simple Skincare pack to test from BzzAgent.com, so I had no idea</li>
            <li> My face felt super soft after each wipe.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use these kinds of product because of my sensitive skin but this works great ...</li>
            <li> They made my face super soft and have a glow to it.</li>
            <li> To top it off, the inconvenience and discomfort of having to splash water all over your face and then wipe it dry is gone when you use these.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with breaking out -- they were very mild and I appreciate that they only have two ingredients.</li>
            <li> Luckily they are helping my skin clear up though.</li>
            <li> These wipes cleared those areas easily and left my face feeling</li>
            <li> I have to bundle the wipe up just to make it strong enough to use.</li>
            <li> Great for facial wipe down at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant but it was a bit unexpected.</li>
            <li> Other than that I was VERY pleased with how fresh, clean, soft and smooth my face has gotten since starting the use of all Simple Skincare Products.</li>
            <li> They did not leave an oily residue or any other sticky product after I used them and my face and body felt very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Simple&#x27;s oil balancing wipes are very handy to have around for removing make-up or wiping down when you are feeling sweaty and oily but can&#x27;t shower.</li>
            <li> the winter I suspect they would be a little drying for me personally, but for now, these are a great wipe to toss in my bag for before work or after the gym.</li>
            <li> They work great for daily use if you travel or if you need a little touch up at your desk throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and breaks out within hours of using anything new, so I was nervous trying something new, but received a free sample</li>
            <li> It still gets oily, but not as much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help too much</li>
            <li> It also cleans up make up very well.</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use their face moisturizer, and highly recommend their products!</li>
            <li> and they are gentle as they say.</li>
            <li> how much these costed til now.</li>
            <li> Knowing how much they cost, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them if I saw them at the store unless they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I did receive this for free, however I am definitely going to repurchase this soon!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product thanks to being a bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Simple Oil Balancing cleansing wipes via a Word of Mouth marketing campaign called Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really notice the oil balancing aspect of these</li>
            <li> Simple&#x27;s product wiped away the line immediately with a light touch.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an convenient option for after my gym time and had the opportunity to try the Simple line for free...</li>
            <li> so I have to be very cautious about the products that I use.</li>
            <li> I like it when you can really see on the wipes all of the gunk that it removed from your face.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I have been using these Simple Oil Balancing Wipes that I received free from Buzzagent for about a week now.</li>
            <li> These wipes are gentle, yet you can feel that they are cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li> M Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer Spf 15, 4.2 Ounce]], Eye Make-Up Remover Pads, [[ASIN:B00AO4EMKQ</li>
            <li> I received Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes for free about a week ago from BZZ Agent as part of their campaign and have been using them ever since.</li>
            <li> It did not burn, make my face feel drying after removing the makeup, if anything it left it smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> But, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I received the Simple oil balancing cleansing wipes for free through BuzzAgent, and after testing them out I must say that they are are a MUST for festival season.</li>
            <li> so they really are helping.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li> It provided gentle cleansing and my skin was indeed refreshed.</li>
            <li> It was gentle to my skin, as it states.</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> SO it worked for both of us really well.</li>
            <li> They are like gauze, and it feels like they will fall apart in my hands and will in fact do so if you stretch them too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this product as a free sample as a part of a BzzAgent.com Simple Skincare Campaign*</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was from the texture of the cloths or just the whole product.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I had success with Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes and will use them in the future.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin throughout the day, and found that these wipes didn&#x27;t really help much with decreasing my oily skin.</li>
            <li> and they work really well.</li>
            <li> They seem to gently exfoliate too.</li>
            <li> I use them very day.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of these from Bzzagent and was surprised out how useful I found them.</li>
            <li> My face is usually really oily at the end of the day</li>
            <li> I just recently received a free sample of these wipes as part of a BzzAgent Campaign.  </li>
            <li> I received my simple skin oil balancing wipes free through bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> I received a package of Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have very oily skin</li>
            <li> These do have a scent, but I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it.</li>
            <li> very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t have much of a scent which I really like in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I just tried the complete Simple skincare range -- which includes their Radiance cleansing wipes, Oil Balancing cleansing wipes, eye makeup remover pads &amp; their Protecting light moisturizer!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m constantly trying these wipes and so far they are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love these and would totally recommend them to anyone who has sensitive and oily skin....</li>
            <li> I would have liked the wipes to be smaller like the size of their make up remover pads for those of us who have combination skin and don&#x27;t need the wipe for the entire face.</li>
            <li> product did take care of my oily skin but isn&#x27;t my favorite product from Simple sensitive skin products.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d say mine is more normal to dry.</li>
            <li> And I was not disappointed, the Oil balancing cleansing wipes definitely left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized without feeling all oily, I also noticed a definite reduction of the oiliness feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Right when I use it it wipes away all the oil and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The facial cleansing wipes were fantastic, and left my face feeling clean and</li>
            <li> Simple is VERY gentle on the most fragile skin there is.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got simple products to try in the mail courtesy of bzzagent.com!</li>
            <li> I felt that I had a lot more blemishes appear after using these than my other skincare products.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Simple brand face products.</li>
            <li> Another big issue: the second ingredient is propylene glycol - definitely not a &#x27;simple, skin loving&#x27; ingredient in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I have such oily and dry combination skin, I have tried so many things on it, but the oil busting astringents dry it out, and the moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past leave me greasy; this one is the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Overall I really did enjoy this product and it will be my new go-to.</li>
            <li> but also I would clean my body daily with these.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I was surprised that the towelette wasn&#x27;t very moist.  </li>
            <li> These left my face feeling clean but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I felt like all my make up was off, but I never feel quite clean until I actually WASH my face.</li>
            <li> Although the Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes did not leave my skin looking as red and feeling as irritated as it does when I have used a harsher cleanser, I do not believe that my face is as clean after using this product.</li>
            <li> Usually I clean up my makeup with some fancy face soap and water, and occasionally realize after applying toner that the makeup did not come off all the way because I see it on the toner sheet.</li>
            <li> Which means that I clean my face day and night now as well as add moisturizer every morning before applying my makeup or going outside.  </li>
            <li> the other Simple products were pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> So many products claim to be for sensitive skin, but end up causing a breakout or cause your skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, I am so lazy</li>
            <li> This would be great to take to the gym also, because the small, sturdy packaging won&#x27;t take up much room and the wipes will refresh your skin after a long workout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a visible reduction of blemishes after about a week, but before then, the blemishes I had were much redder than normal</li>
            <li> The line is Simple skincare and it included 4 products, full size I might add, not some sample size</li>
            <li> This Simple product has the most subtle fragrance and because it performs well and is gentle on my skin, it has become my favorite wipe.</li>
            <li> So, I felt good about getting a little extra cleanse from these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to include these in my &#x27;new baby&#x27; kits for friends and keep a pack on hand for myself too!</li>
            <li> It seems like facial cleansing towelettes are the latest trend in beauty products and facial care.</li>
            <li> Now there are many similar products ranging from generic drugstore brands to high-end cosmetics makers&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li> I use the oil balancing wipes mainly after I work out</li>
            <li> Plus they really are soft gentle wipes I don&#x27;t feel them scratching my skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> They clean your skin without being harsh and leave it feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> At first I only tried the regular simple cleansing facial wipes which I loved and have gone through three packages.</li>
            <li> These wipes left my face feeling so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Every time I use them they have removed all of the oil from my face and left my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It also left a kind of tight feeling on my face, so it ended up taking a bit too much oil away from my skin.</li>
            <li> They are gentle and free of artificial fragrance and can easily be toted along with you for a quick refresh.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or dry it out, just left it clean and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I recommend these wipes to anyone with really oily skin or those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These have been really gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I normally remove makeup/dirt with jojoba oil which works wonders of course, but since I&#x27;m an actress sometimes it gets to be an inconvenience</li>
            <li> then I did my normal makeup routine</li>
            <li> These wipes do NOT contain any harsh ingredients and I was able to use them on my son&#x27;s face as well.</li>
            <li> I would consider my skin to be normal.  </li>
            <li> And again, I have normal skin.  </li>
            <li> To me a good wipe will remove makeup and cleanse without drying or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> But, this does make my face very soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out, which is unique for an oil-balancing product.</li>
            <li> I have quite cranky skin; sensitive to most wipes/cleansers, but I definitely do not have a problem using Simple, they truly know how to help those with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for an easy to use facial cleansing product.</li>
            <li> My super sensitive skin seems to like them well enough.</li>
            <li> I tried a few of the simple products as a free sample from bzzagent and this one is my favorite out of the simple skin line.</li>
            <li> The no-sting solution on the wipes makes it a comfortable alternative to other harsher skin care products.  </li>
            <li> I honestly was a little leery of trying a new facial product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I break out when I start new products.</li>
            <li> Directions are clear as day and  ingredients are very visible for those who are sensitive, like I am.</li>
            <li> I could ready see the different and see my face less oily and the scent is okay.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent which was nice</li>
            <li> These help A LOT with the oil control though the wipes themselves are slightly rough, but I guess that could be a good thing if you like to scrub off some dead skin.</li>
            <li> Zinc PCA is proven to give a freshness to the skin and Glycerin is proven to improve smoothness and lubrication of the skin, the presence of these ingredients, minus all the harsh ingredients normally found in skin care products, made me super excited to try it!  </li>
            <li> The wipes were very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The cleaning face wipes left my skin moisturized, clean, and most importantly free of red patches and bumps, which has been the result of other face cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying how excited I was to get to try this as well as other new products from the Simple Skincare line.  </li>
            <li> I like these wipes very much for my skins needs and skin type, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these wipes however for someone who has dry or very dry skin because the wipes do control oil &amp; shine so it wouldn&#x27;t be great at adding moisture to the skin if it is a very dry or dry skin type.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft even as I am typing this!</li>
            <li> No rash from my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I first tried Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes the morning after I received it.</li>
            <li> I have always had oily skin and these wipes completely take care of that!</li>
            <li> so I have tried many oil reducing products in the past.</li>
            <li> I am also surprised at the price of these!</li>
            <li> I have some really dry areas on my face and these wipes don&#x27;t dry those areas out more</li>
            <li> I tried two wipes so far of the new oil balancing wipe</li>
            <li> I have a 7 month old so, i&#x27;m not as much of a &#x27;new&#x27; mom</li>
            <li> My face is combo, where after I wash it, it gets really dry and flaky, but as the day goes on, it gets really oily in certain spots.  </li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed when I opened the package of Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes was the mild perfume of a cleanser which I was unaccustomed to after using three of the brand&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these wipes, I was a little hesitant to try them as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I discontinued using this product, my skin returned to its natural glow; therefore, if you have sensitive skin - proceed with caution!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these in the morning, or whenever I need a quick wipe off - especially on our recent trip to Florida.  </li>
            <li> I am throughly please with Simple&#x27;s new skincare range and cannot wait to make it my new skincare regime for the summer!</li>
            <li> But honestly - that would make me more likely to give it a bad review if it did&#x27;t work - because what would I have to lose?</li>
            <li> They left my skin feeling very refreshed, and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it would take forever to clear up.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all thanks to Simple Skincare.  </li>
            <li> I love the way all the simple skin care cleansing wipes work, the only thing I would change is the rough, scratchy feeling.</li>
            <li> so I try to use products that are made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Naturally, this oil balancing cleansing wipe is produced for sensitive skin, and the fact that it was tested by dermatologists caught my eye.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, combination skin (I am predisposed to breaking out along my jaw</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and also oily skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about what you&#x27;re putting on your face.</li>
            <li> I even used it on my neck and chest which is sensitive as well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend theses for sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive oily skin and these wipes have worked wonders.</li>
            <li> This product uses natural skin-loving ingredients like zinc.</li>
            <li> I go through a whole lot of facial wipes because I wipe my face once when I wake up before I wash my face and again to take off some makeup before I wash my face and go to bed</li>
            <li> and I have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li> My son is 2 years old.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple Sensitive Skin Wipes and Oil Control</li>
            <li> and I gotta say I was surprised by the oil control power of this wipes.</li>
            <li> These were soft though</li>
            <li> I even used it on my husband who has incredibly sensitive skin (he uses unscented soaps, detergents, lotions, etc)</li>
            <li> I am really liking the products that Simple is putting out.</li>
            <li> I suffer from oily sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They leave my face soft and oil-free</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive &amp; I usually break out from much products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off: I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the rest of my face pretty dry.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell too strong, perfumey or chemically like others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am an owner of super sensitive skin and many products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, even for sensitive skin, have left me with red, dry, bumpy skin.</li>
            <li> But... I was quickly let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who started this trend, either, but like my wife said, you didn&#x27;t really see these kind of products until a few years ago.</li>
            <li> When I first open it I was like wow these wipes are big.</li>
            <li> As a college student who is striving for a good gpa as a science major and balancing three jobs it was difficult to manage my stress levels and keep my forehead in check.</li>
            <li> the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes left my skin oil free after a long and strenuous workout, which I need because I break out from all the sweat!</li>
            <li> The wipes are sturdy and pretty good quality however they were not so moist, probably I got a bad one?</li>
            <li> would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Simple skin care product line!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these wipes for any skin type, but especially those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> The Simple Oil Balancing Wipes do a great job of cutting down on oil and removing excess dirt, allowing skin to clear up quickly.</li>
            <li> While it was not unpleasant, the scent lingered for nearly half an hour after washing my face.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was a bit rough on my skin</li>
            <li> I used one last night with my normal routine and then this morning before I washed my face</li>
            <li> I expected the wipes to be gentle, since it is specifically for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I found them very convenient when I threw my back out and was laid up recently.</li>
            <li> They are priced reasonably compared to similar products I have tried and I definitely recommend them.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant at first, because I have very sensitive and dry skin, and I didn&#x27;t want there to be any problems for my face than it already had been the past couple of months the fact that I was jut getting back under control, but I used one anyway, and knew immediately it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> B003II0R7M Badger Broad Spectrum SPF 35</li>
            <li> The Simple Wipes were soft on my skin and the mountain range on my forehead was gone in three days!</li>
            <li> I had no use for them until the radiating skin wipes caused me a major breakout.</li>
            <li> Having had sensitive skin for years now, it is important for me to use a product that isn&#x27;t to harsh on my face, because then I either end up with blemishes, or my skin becomes all dry and chapped.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry and oily skin, and these were like a gift from the gods haha.</li>
            <li> and i have recieved FREE dull sized samples of Oil balancing cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> The wipes left my skin feeling soft and my skin felt refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of scrubs with microbeads because my facial skin is sensitive and they hurt.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling soft and refreshed</li>
            <li> Over the years I have found that if you completely strip an oily face, your face lashes back with an over production of oil!!</li>
            <li> Left my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem that I had with the radiance wipes though because these wipes are also pretty rough and scratchy.</li>
            <li> The light moisturizer isn&#x27;t thick or greasy and protects from UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 15.</li>
            <li> Smell is ok but not great.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend that you check out the new Simple Skincare products.  </li>
            <li> and the wipes kept very moist and wet and did not dry</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to not only women with sensitive skin, but to all women who wish to take care of their skin!</li>
            <li> They get off my sunscreen and leave my face feeling clean and dry without feeling tight or sticky.</li>
            <li> I love that the wipes also didn&#x27;t make my face feel tight and dried out.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin but due to my sennsitive skin its really hard to find a product that will clean my face and not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> They do not dry my skin out</li>
            <li> They take off heavy duty makeup, but are still very gentle as well.  </li>
            <li> My skin was a little red after using the product the first day.</li>
            <li> My weird skin was left feeling soft, very clean, and it was not oily at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple on my skin and does not dry or irritate my skin when I use it.</li>
            <li> They left my skin feeling rather tight and less than clean after use.</li>
            <li> A little disappointing to see that it says No Alcohol on the front, yet Alcohol is one of the ingredients, but my skin did not experience any irritation, so I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> So so fresh, almost a citrusy-powdery scent that&#x27;s hard to place.</li>
            <li> I felt that the wipes did an adequate job in reducing blemishes, but failed to prevent new ones from popping up.</li>
            <li> these the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the wipe itself is soft and cloth-like, and they&#x27;re not too damp like some other wipes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I do like sensitive skin products as they have less fragrance and other things you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> I do find that the Radiance Cleansing wipes from Simple work a bit better, because I wear a thick BB cream that can be hard to take off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it was too small to wipe my whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone to at least try and see the difference it really does make!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just damp enough to do the job, though it helps if you wad the wipe a little, especially after making a few first passes.</li>
            <li> I use these wipes specifically on my forehead and nose area, as those are the areas that tend to act a little crazy, oil wise.  </li>
            <li> Also, a while later, I had a couple of patches on my cheek that were dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think they are something you would flush in the toilet</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these products for anyone with sensitive skin, or anyone who prefers less harsh facial cleansers, they dont use alcohol or perfumes or dyes, it does what it is supposed to, takes away the oily shine!</li>
            <li> I use these only when I wear makeup, and then I cleanse my face with my African Black Soap and Jojoba oil afterwards.</li>
            <li> and it is a little more difficult to maintain.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I like these enough to make them the only way I remove makeup, but I will use them regularly, especially in the summertime.</li>
            <li> do I need to wait for my face to dry after use.</li>
            <li> These wipes balance out those parts of my skin without leaving it dry, irritated or flaky.  </li>
            <li> My face was neither sticky nor dry after usage.</li>
            <li> They helped balance the oily parts of my skin, but didn&#x27;t take away from the dry spots.  </li>
            <li> and so is my skin - oily here, dry there</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had some skin problems of late and my dermatologist told me to use only products made for sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li> I have used Simple products on and off for years, and have never been let down.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out the rest of my face when I used it all over!</li>
            <li> Being a BzzAgent has allowed me to try products I typically would not buy, like the Simple product line.</li>
            <li> and her face was much less oily than in regular days.</li>
            <li> I was previously using oil blotting sheets but after using these, I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> Most of them dry my skin out so bad it just gets irritated and starts to break out.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the store last week and use it once or twice everyday.</li>
            <li> but my skin is not really oily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to waste and use multiple wipes</li>
            <li> and then I hold it on my eye lashes for a second and wipe a few times and</li>
            <li> an have to e careful about what I use.</li>
            <li> the wipe NO its too rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other cleansing wipes before and they&#x27;ve all been under par because they left a film/residue,</li>
            <li> I have various categories which you will see listed below, but my rating system might be a little different from the usual.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to try them with the upcoming summer when oily skin runs crazy with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just oily and these were gentle on my skin and didn&#x27;t help me be less oily but didn&#x27;t make the problem worse either.</li>
            <li> but my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry.</li>
            <li> I found the Oil Balancing Wipes to work extremely well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for when you are too tired to do your normal cleansing routine, but I would not recommend switching to solely using these.</li>
            <li> These are a very moist wipe and very thick!</li>
            <li> So I gave her the average, which is basically Louis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of oil on my nose, and behind my ears once I cleaned my nose with the oil balancing cleansing wipes and it feels soft and looks shiny.</li>
            <li> I am normally not a huge fan of using wipes to cleanse my face because I normally feel that they leave some residue behind.</li>
            <li> and I used it because I have oily faces and after wipes down my face</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over the fact that I did not have dry or irritated skin after using this product, which unfortunately is usually the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no more oily skin and dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands of face wipes, but I have to say, for summer, I like</li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint is that where I can tell that it helps control oil, it&#x27;s not a significant change.</li>
            <li> Because of this I was skeptical in trying new products, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the week hiding in the house so no one would see my skin!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my face any less oily.</li>
            <li> I feel like my face has looked less shiny from all of the oils on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot less shiny and it feels so refreshed.</li>
            <li> Using these wipes made me realize that even after I was my face with my usual cleanser, I&#x27;m really not getting all of the makeup and dirt off.</li>
            <li> I drew a long thick line on my hand with my waterproof mascara and wiped the line with each of the wipes.</li>
            <li> My skin is the awkward combination type of dry, oily and very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It also makes your skin tingle a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for about three months everyday</li>
            <li> They did their job, they weren&#x27;t harsh on my skin, they didn&#x27;t have any overpowering scents and they weren&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> The shine on my T zone went away after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of facial wipes  because I like the convenience of them when I am too tired to wash my face.</li>
            <li> The Simple Oil Balancing Wipes do the job without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then after using them a few times my skin felt like it was burning.</li>
            <li> face even I wear heavy foundation and makeup.</li>
            <li> My face was not overly dried out after using these wipes.  </li>
            <li> even still it left some residue behind.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about a few things before trying these products.  </li>
            <li> Probably the only bad thing I could even mention about the product if I had to is the price, its comparable to basically every other brand unless you opt for store brand but $5.99-$7.99 does seem to be a bit pricey all across the board for facial wipes</li>
            <li> Since using the oil balancing wipes I have noticed my face has been a lot less oily during the day!</li>
            <li> but it seems like it&#x27;s one extreme or the other, never a happy medium.</li>
            <li> Definitely not pleasant or expected considering</li>
            <li> and I have seen a small change in how oily my skin gets throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure they remove all the make up.</li>
            <li> Fearing that I had been careless when washing my face, I repeated the process with the same result.</li>
            <li> I would use them in the morning before I put my makeup on, but I was still as oily as I usually am.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the [[ASIN:B00AO4EMKQ Simple Radiance Wipes, 25 Count]] wipes, but these weren&#x27;t TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a product that meets both of those needs and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling irritated.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and noticed there was hardly a scent to these.</li>
            <li> boy did it sting for at least five minutes.</li>
            <li> My face was not getting so oily by late afternoon.</li>
            <li> I did not have any negative experience</li>
            <li> but I later learned I can&#x27;t exfoliate my face with any type of product or it badly breaks me out regardless of brand.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely oil-prone and around the afternoon my skin is glistening (in a bad way) with oil.</li>
            <li> half sleep from working all day, and I told her that I just desperately needed to get the makeup off my face because it had been on for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and my oiliness has gradually decreased.</li>
            <li> It is much easier than washing my face with the awful soap and paper towels in the men&#x27;s room at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They stay on my bedside table, and no matter how tired I am, it is no problem to take out a wipe and take off my makeup.</li>
            <li> my poor baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li> There is a very slight smell that isn&#x27;t like anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled but its very faint</li>
            <li> but I still fall into bed exhausted at night and am guilty of skipping washing my face.</li>
            <li> , so I was a little doubtful</li>
            <li> However, I noticed that I am unable to use them on consecutive days without developing a bit of rosacea-like symptoms.</li>
            <li> They also leave out the artificial perfumes and dyes.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would make my skin  as well as cause a breakout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have artificial perfumes or dyes.  </li>
            <li> The smell was slightly unpleasant, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> and I can use them when my allergies are really bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my skin hated these and the radiance cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product, although they do work well with taking face makeup off.</li>
            <li> I always hated how when I would use a wipe post-workout - I&#x27;d still sweat and it wouldn&#x27;t matter that I&#x27;d used the wipes</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate it!</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s driving me insane!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They do not dry my skin out and I can use them when my allergies are really bad.</li>
            <li> These balancing wipes are a good refreshing wipe to use at the end of the day, or as I discovered on my most recent trip to the water park, they are great for wiping the sweat and grime off your face after standing in lines for hours at an amusement park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well for cleansing the dirt away, and even provide a nice refreshing feel of smooth skin. However, I noticed that I am unable to use them on consecutive days without developing a bit of rosacea-like symptoms. I had acne for 16 years, and just recently been able to manage it through diet and careful use of only the best lotions. I have never had rosacea. When I discontinued using this product, my skin returned to its natural glow; therefore, if you have sensitive skin - proceed with caution!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling after wiping my face clean with these.  It feels refreshing. I have been using them for about three months everyday and I have seen a small change in how oily my skin gets throughout the day.  It still gets oily, but not as much. Even though it hasn&#x27;t significantly changed my skin, I love that it is gentle on my sensitive skin and I always have a clean feeling after using them.</li>
            <li> These are great for clearing up oily or shiny skin. Just a warning though you&#x27;re face will need more and more. It doesn&#x27;t help too much there&#x27;s only 25 sheets in a pack. But I like that they are not overly damp and they make you&#x27;re face feel fresh in addition to absorbing oil.</li>
            <li> I love these facial wipes! They are incredibly soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin. Also a plus - they smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the store last week and use it once or twice everyday. I have really oily skin but due to my sennsitive skin its really hard to find a product that will clean my face and not cause breakouts. I thought I would give this a shot and it actually works. Right when I use it it wipes away all the oil and leaves my skin feeling soft. It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and my oiliness has gradually decreased. It also cleans up make up very well.</li>
            <li> I took these wipes camping with me for four days and they were very nice to have around! I cleaned not only my face but also I would clean my body daily with these. They did not leave an oily residue or any other sticky product after I used them and my face and body felt very fresh and clean. The wipes were also packaged very nicely so you could easily close and re-open the package and the wipes kept very moist and wet and did not dry out.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave these a four star is because these wipes definitely cannot replace a good old shower... while they were great for camping I would not just use them in place of washing my face or taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;They were a huge help though and would recommend them if you are in a hurry/and or want an easy way to keep clean!</li>
            <li> This is an okay face wipe but I would not repurchase this again. I have oily to combination skin and this kind of stung/irritated my skin, talk about removing my eye makeup with this. Does an okay job at removing makeup but I would not rely on this to remove all my makeup even if I used multiple wipes. The wipes are sturdy and pretty good quality however they were not so moist, probably I got a bad one? I have used wipes a lot cheaper from the dollar store and they work even better than these ones and are very moist.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for removing make-up,  fast, easy, just the right size non-irritating wipes without scrubbing,  pleasant scent, no oily residue or chemical odor. feels very refreshing and leaves face feeling soft. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> First off: I have dry, sensitive skin. I also bike commute, so when I get to work in the warmer months, I like to freshen up a bit beforehand. In the summer, I have to wash off my sunscreen ([[ASIN:B003II0R7M Badger Broad Spectrum SPF 35 All-Season Face Stick, 1 stick,65 oz (18.4 g)]] -- which is sweat-and-water-resistant so it&#x27;s also stubborn to wash off), as well as any sweat and dirt. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands of face wipes, but I have to say, for summer, I like these the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the wipe itself is soft and cloth-like, and they&#x27;re not too damp like some other wipes so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting anything nor do I need to wait for my face to dry after use. They&#x27;re just damp enough to do the job, though it helps if you wad the wipe a little, especially after making a few first passes. They get off my sunscreen and leave my face feeling clean and dry without feeling tight or sticky. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to moisturize after using one because the cleanser is so gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter I suspect they would be a little drying for me personally, but for now, these are a great wipe to toss in my bag for before work or after the gym. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my face any less oily. I didn&#x27;t even feel like this cleaned my face. I will be sticking to the exfoliating ones.</li>
            <li> These are great for me when I am too lazy to fully wash face.  Also great post workout.  They remove dirt and makeup very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to break out and I have had no issue with these.  If anything they improved skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the simple foaming face wash and it is incredible.  I am becoming a big fan of this brand.</li>
            <li> The wipes are ok. I am not sure they remove all the make up.</li>
            <li> Love these to remove my makeup at night.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; brand products!  I actually get theses wipes auto-shipped to me from amazon every month because i use them for my face before i go to bed, whether i have make-up on or not.  They take off heavy duty makeup, but are still very gentle as well.  I also use their face moisturizer, and highly recommend their products!</li>
            <li> Great for facial wipe down at the end of the day. Cheaper by $3 than Walmart</li>
            <li> This is literally awesome I have a lot of oil on my nose, and behind my ears once I cleaned my nose with the oil balancing cleansing wipes and it feels soft and looks shiny. I don&#x27;t have a oily face but some parts of my face are oily. I can&#x27;t even feel the oil on my nose and they are gentle as they say.</li>
            <li> I received these free from a BzzAgent campaign, and they&#x27;re great. They are made from natural ingredients to help keep oily skin clean. They are great especially in warm weather. I use one in the morning and one at night, and my skin feels great. I would definitely recommend these wipes.</li>
            <li> Yikes, I can&#x27;t believe these cost this much! First off, I got a free Simple Skincare pack to test from BzzAgent.com, so I had no idea how much these costed til now. Knowing how much they cost, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them if I saw them at the store unless they were cheaper. They did their job, they weren&#x27;t harsh on my skin, they didn&#x27;t have any overpowering scents and they weren&#x27;t oily. However, some of the moisture got in my eye and boy did it sting for at least five minutes. I much prefer the [[ASIN:B00AO4EMKQ Simple Radiance Wipes, 25 Count]] wipes, but these weren&#x27;t TERRIBLE. The packaging sealed nicely though!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the results of this product! The wipes left my skin feeling soft and my skin felt refreshed. The shine on my T zone went away after using it a few times. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or dry it out, just left it clean and feeling fresh. I tried a few of the simple products as a free sample from bzzagent and this one is my favorite out of the simple skin line. I definitely recommend these products for anyone with sensitive skin, or anyone who prefers less harsh facial cleansers, they dont use alcohol or perfumes or dyes, it does what it is supposed to, takes away the oily shine!</li>
            <li> I did receive this for free, however I am definitely going to repurchase this soon! I have heard many great things about the brand itself but have never really tried it before. Upon receiving it I love the design itself. Directions are clear as day and  ingredients are very visible for those who are sensitive, like I am. The oil cleansing wipes were great! No overbearing odor but kinda made my skin have a healthy glow, which I love. My skin feels soft even as I am typing this! Wonderful products! No rash from my sensitive skin! Definitely a fan!</li>
            <li> I use these wipes specifically on my forehead and nose area, as those are the areas that tend to act a little crazy, oil wise.  These wipes balance out those parts of my skin without leaving it dry, irritated or flaky.  All I feel is soothed, happy skin and it&#x27;s all thanks to Simple Skincare.  I have quite cranky skin; sensitive to most wipes/cleansers, but I definitely do not have a problem using Simple, they truly know how to help those with sensitive skin!  Thank you to BzzAgent, who allowed me to try these wonderful products free of charge.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and i have recieved FREE dull sized samples of Oil balancing cleansing wipes. Since using the oil balancing wipes I have noticed my face has been a lot less oily during the day! I had the same problem that I had with the radiance wipes though because these wipes are also pretty rough and scratchy. I love the way all the simple skin care cleansing wipes work, the only thing I would change is the rough, scratchy feeling. Other than that I was VERY pleased with how fresh, clean, soft and smooth my face has gotten since starting the use of all Simple Skincare Products.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product thanks to being a bzzagent. I am so glad I did! I have oily skin, so this product was great. I like the cloth-like facial wipes. I can see the dirt on the cloth, so I know my face is getting clean.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Simple Oil Balancing cleansing wipes via a Word of Mouth marketing campaign called Bzzagent.  Having had sensitive skin for years now, it is important for me to use a product that isn&#x27;t to harsh on my face, because then I either end up with blemishes, or my skin becomes all dry and chapped.  My skin has to have a balance of products to keep it from going in either direction.  Because of this I was skeptical in trying new products, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the week hiding in the house so no one would see my skin! I first researched and learned more about the product, it contains two ingredients that are great for your skin, Zinc PCA and Glycerin.  Zinc PCA is proven to give a freshness to the skin and Glycerin is proven to improve smoothness and lubrication of the skin, the presence of these ingredients, minus all the harsh ingredients normally found in skin care products, made me super excited to try it!  And I was not disappointed, the Oil balancing cleansing wipes definitely left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized without feeling all oily, I also noticed a definite reduction of the oiliness feeling throughout the day. By the end of the night, my skin still felt good and smooth!  I definitely love this product and will continue to use the Simple skin care line on my face!  I definitely recommend this product to not only women with sensitive skin, but to all women who wish to take care of their skin!</li>
            <li> I have allergies so I try to use products that are made for sensitive skin. These cool wipes feel great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them during the day at work when I am sweaty or when I just feel like I need to clean my face. It is much easier than washing my face with the awful soap and paper towels in the men&#x27;s room at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really notice the oil balancing aspect of these but my skin is not really oily.  My face does feel cleaner and look refreshed after using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product.</li>
            <li> It seems like facial cleansing towelettes are the latest trend in beauty products and facial care. I&#x27;m not sure who started this trend, either, but like my wife said, you didn&#x27;t really see these kind of products until a few years ago. Now there are many similar products ranging from generic drugstore brands to high-end cosmetics makers&#x27; brands. Anyway, I got these just for the missus. Here&#x27;s what she had to say about them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I tried soothing [[ASIN:B005FVSH0O Yes To Cucumber Hypoallergenic Facial Towelettes, 30 Count (Pack of 2)]], I was using a combination of liquid eye makeup remover, cleansing cream, and foaming facial soap, so I was a little doubtful a towelette could remove durable makeup such as waterproof mascara. But after I used the first wipe, I was really impressed by the concept and results of the product and that led me to try several brands. Naturally, this oil balancing cleansing wipe is produced for sensitive skin, and the fact that it was tested by dermatologists caught my eye. (I&#x27;ve had some skin problems of late and my dermatologist told me to use only products made for sensitive skin.) I compared this product with my all-time favorite, Yes to Cucumber wipes and \\&quot;ultra-soft\\&quot; [[ASIN:B0053T4HI4 Neutrogena Make Up Removing Wipes, 100 Cleansing Towelettes]]. I drew a long thick line on my hand with my waterproof mascara and wiped the line with each of the wipes. Simple&#x27;s product wiped away the line immediately with a light touch. Yes to product did a good job too, but I needed to wipe a few times with Neutrogena&#x27;s, despite its claim of a \\&quot;patented formula\\&quot; that \\&quot;dissolves all types of makeup, even waterproof mascara\\&quot;. This Simple product has the most subtle fragrance and because it performs well and is gentle on my skin, it has become my favorite wipe.</li>
            <li> While I do love most of the Simple product line I would say I love these wipes the best.  They clean your skin without being harsh and leave it feeling clean and soft.  If you use makeup quite a bit then these would help clean your pores really nicely without leaving a residue or overdrying of the face.  The fragrance is nice and the price is reasonable which makes treating your face to a good cleaning a pleasure instead of a chore.</li>
            <li> My skin is the awkward combination type of dry, oily and very sensitive. After receiving a free sample of these wipes from the Simple Skincare Campaign on the BzzAgent Website I was able to try and receive delightful results. My weird skin was left feeling soft, very clean, and it was not oily at all. I usually wear powdered foundation every day and this product did a very good job in removing all of it from my face and chin. I can&#x27;t get over the fact that I did not have dry or irritated skin after using this product, which unfortunately is usually the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone who has combination skin like myself, and wants a good and fast way to remove all  of his or her makeup without having irritation or even oilier/drier skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an convenient option for after my gym time and had the opportunity to try the Simple line for free...I have to say that this product is pretty fantastic. I have extremely sensitive, combination skin (I am predisposed to breaking out along my jaw line)...so I have to be very cautious about the products that I use. This product is convenient, an extremely good value compared to similar products, is completely fragrance free and my face has never been softer. I use the oil balancing wipes mainly after I work out and then sometimes in the mornings post shower pre moisturizer. My ONLY complaint is that where I can tell that it helps control oil, it&#x27;s not a significant change. I have been using this along with the radiance wipes, protecting moisturizer and eye make-up remover pads. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> First of all, the product packaging for the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes is extremely cute.  I love pulling this pack out of my gym bag for my workouts.  My skin is prone to breakouts so I used these wipes before, during, and after working out to prevent sweat and dirt buildup in my pores.  They worked really great getting off all of my foundation before my workout.  I like it when you can really see on the wipes all of the gunk that it removed from your face.  During my workout the wipes were really refreshing for wicking sweat.  These wipes also came in handy when I was too lazy/tired to get up to wash my face before going to sleep.  Keeping a pack in your night side table makes it easy to remove makeup quickly to get you off to sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product #gotitfree for testing purposes.  All comments and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received these wipes as part of a bzzagent campaign. I have very oily skin and I have found that using these wipes before applying moisturizer and makeup helps to control my oil. These smell good and i feel that my oil is more under control then it has been. I think that these will really come in handy in the summer when my oil is out of control.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Simple Oil Balancing Wipes that I received free from Buzzagent for about a week now. I use a lot of facial wipes  because I like the convenience of them when I am too tired to wash my face. To me a good wipe will remove makeup and cleanse without drying or irritating my skin. A great wipe will do that and provide another benefit like pore minimizing or acne reduction. These wipes do cleanse remove makeup and reduce shine. The texture is smooth and they are very moist. They have a pleasant, but not overpowering scent that dissipates quickly. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I do like sensitive skin products as they have less fragrance and other things you don&#x27;t need. I like everything I&#x27;ve tried from this skincare line.</li>
            <li> I got this item for free because I am a BzzAgent, and was invited to participate in this campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, I am so lazy sometimes when it comes to taking off my makeup, so I am glad I got these for my BzzCampaign. They stay on my bedside table, and no matter how tired I am, it is no problem to take out a wipe and take off my makeup. I do find that the Radiance Cleansing wipes from Simple work a bit better, because I wear a thick BB cream that can be hard to take off. But, this does make my face very soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out, which is unique for an oil-balancing product. I find that using the Radiance wipes first to take off my makeup, then these to control oil, is a winning combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of these is amazing! So so fresh, almost a citrusy-powdery scent that&#x27;s hard to place. It smells great as I&#x27;m using it on my face. I&#x27;m thinking about keeping some in the fridge so they will be even more refreshing to use! This would be great to take to the gym also, because the small, sturdy packaging won&#x27;t take up much room and the wipes will refresh your skin after a long workout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an easy face cleansing product, with no mess or water required, this is your product!</li>
            <li> These have got to be one of my favorite products from Simple. I recently got to try them for free, and I absolutely love them! I have sensitive skin and also oily skin. Its hard to find a product that meets both of those needs and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling irritated. Well I have finally found that product, these Oil balancing wipes! These wipes are gentle, yet you can feel that they are cleaning your skin. They leave you feeling refreshed and your face no longer has that oily and shiny look to it. I like to keep these with me, great for on the go or after the gym! I&#x27;m glad to finally find a product that can get rid of that shiny look and leave my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I loved receiving this Simple skincare product for free through BzzAgent. I found the Oil Balancing Wipes to work extremely well. They were gentle, effective, fresh scented, and left no residue on my skin. My face felt super soft after each wipe. The first couple of wipes in each package aren&#x27;t very moist, so you may need to use two if you wear your makeup heavier. They are great for an early morning face wake-up or for an afternoon refresher. I will definitely be throwing these in my gym bag for an after workout refresher.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m super excited guys! I just tried the complete Simple skincare range -- which includes their Radiance cleansing wipes, Oil Balancing cleansing wipes, eye makeup remover pads &amp; their Protecting light moisturizer! Wonderful bundle of vitamin enhanced skin care products! I am an owner of super sensitive skin and many products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, even for sensitive skin, have left me with red, dry, bumpy skin. Simple&#x27;s skincare is a welcoming difference. The cleaning face wipes left my skin moisturized, clean, and most importantly free of red patches and bumps, which has been the result of other face cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Simple is VERY gentle on the most fragile skin there is. I promise. They not only cleanse, but have added vitamins like vitamin E and pro vitamin b5 as well as skin loving ingredients like mango extract and glycerin, all amazing for touchably soft skin. I also enjoyed Simple&#x27;s eye makeup remover pads because they were not only gentle on my skin and eyes, but did an amazing job removing even waterproof mascara. The light moisturizer isn&#x27;t thick or greasy and protects from UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 15. Perfect for summer right around the corner. I am throughly please with Simple&#x27;s new skincare range and cannot wait to make it my new skincare regime for the summer! (I recieved free samples of this product)</li>
            <li> I received this free from bzz and I used it because I have oily faces and after wipes down my face I could ready see the different and see my face less oily and the scent is okay.</li>
            <li> I received these wipes for free from BzzAgent to do a product review. I am normally not a huge fan of using wipes to cleanse my face because I normally feel that they leave some residue behind. That was not the case with these wipes! They left my skin feeling very refreshed, and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for an easy to use facial cleansing product.</li>
            <li> The Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes are amazing! They also leave your skin feeling light and clean. It also makes your skin tingle a little bit. Just that nice \\&quot;I&#x27;m cleaning\\&quot; tingle. Sometimes I break out when I start new products. I haven&#x27;t had any yet! The ingredients are all natural, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about what you&#x27;re putting on your face. I received mine as well as the [[ASIN:B009RNUH7M Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer Spf 15, 4.2 Ounce]], Eye Make-Up Remover Pads, [[ASIN:B00AO4EMKQ Simple Radiance Wipes, 25 Count]] by doing a bzz campaign on bzzagent.com. It was nice to be able to try out all of the products so you know which one works best for you. I&#x27;ve found that using the Simple oil balancing wipes at night an the Radiance Cleansing Wipes works really great for me. The simple products are wonderful and I highly recommend you try them.</li>
            <li> As a college student who is striving for a good gpa as a science major and balancing three jobs it was difficult to manage my stress levels and keep my forehead in check. When I finally noticed how bumpy and oily my skin was I thought it would take forever to clear up. I&#x27;m not a fan of scrubs with microbeads because my facial skin is sensitive and they hurt. The Simple Wipes were soft on my skin and the mountain range on my forehead was gone in three days! Couldn&#x27;t be happier that I received a free trial of this product as a BzzAgent. I definitely can find a way to budget money for this.</li>
            <li> These wipes left my face feeling so clean and soft. These are a very moist wipe and very thick! They didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and didn&#x27;t burn my skin. Smell is ok but not great. I will be buying these in the future! I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I first tried Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes the morning after I received it. I re-read the packaging just to hype myself up again! I opened the package and noticed there was hardly a scent to these. They smelled like you would think \\&quot;simple\\&quot; would smell! I used this every morning for the past 7 days and each time my face feels  fresh, soft, clean, healthy and protected and you don&#x27;t have to rinse! I even used it on my neck and chest which is sensitive as well. There is no residue and it also removed any makeup on my face as well as my eyes. My face was not tight or had any irritation of any kind. I would recommend theses for sensitive skin types. I got this for free from BzzAgent!!</li>
            <li> For reference, I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that is mostly oily.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free through Bzzagent and I&#x27;ve gotta say I was impressed!  I&#x27;ve tried a few other cleansing wipes before and they&#x27;ve all been under par because they left a film/residue, were too drying/harsh on my skin, or had too strong of a smell.  The Simple Oil Balancing Wipes did not have any of these.  When I first opened the package I was surprised that the towelette wasn&#x27;t very moist.  It had a pleasant, mild smell.  Didn&#x27;t smell too strong, perfumey or chemically like others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It felt cooling and refreshing on my skin and despite my initial opinion I found that the towelette was perfectly moist enough for my entire face and neck.  I liked that the towelette was about the size of a kleenex.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it was too small to wipe my whole face and neck.  At first, I thought it was a bit rough on my skin but after I was finished my skin felt smooth and clean so I think it has just the right amount of roughness to gently exfoliate and clean your skin.  It did seem to help control oil because several hours later my skin didn&#x27;t seem as oily as it could&#x27;ve been.  These would be perfect if you&#x27;re in a rush, too lazy, or camping.  Overall, I would definitely repurchase and recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I received Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes for free about a week ago from BZZ Agent as part of their campaign and have been using them ever since. They work perfectly with my skin. I have really sensitive oily skin and these wipes have worked wonders. They are perfect for my skin type. This product uses natural skin-loving ingredients like zinc. They also leave out the artificial perfumes and dyes. They are also oil-free and alcohol free. The products have been Dermatologist Tested, Ophthalmologist tested, are Hypoallergenic and Non-comedogenic too! The best part as they leave your skin looking healthy. I personally love the Oil Balancing cleansing wipes. The Oil balancing wipes are great to use in the morning when my face is really oily. Every time I use them they have removed all of the oil from my face and left my face feeling soft and clean. These wipes are great because they use natural ingredients and don&#x27;t have a strong smell. I really enjoy using them. I feel like my face has looked less shiny from all of the oils on my face. This product works well. I plan on continuing to use this product. I recommend these wipes to anyone with really oily skin or those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used cleansing wipes in nearly 8 years, but I LOVE these. I normally remove makeup/dirt with jojoba oil which works wonders of course, but since I&#x27;m an actress sometimes it gets to be an inconvenience and you just want something to remove your makeup right away. A friend of mine introduced me to these while I was at her house half sleep from working all day, and I told her that I just desperately needed to get the makeup off my face because it had been on for 12 hours. I was very hesitant at first, because I have very sensitive and dry skin, and I didn&#x27;t want there to be any problems for my face than it already had been the past couple of months the fact that I was jut getting back under control, but I used one anyway, and knew immediately it was the real deal. It did not burn, make my face feel drying after removing the makeup, if anything it left it smooth. The next day I bought a pack for my own and have been using them for the past week, and so far so good, nothing has really changed on my face. I use these only when I wear makeup, and then I cleanse my face with my African Black Soap and Jojoba oil afterwards. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I had received this product for free as part of a campaign. I really like this product. It does help my oily skin to an extent. But, I do have combination skin and it is a little more difficult to maintain. But, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I received the Simple oil balancing cleansing wipes for free through BuzzAgent, and after testing them out I must say that they are are a MUST for festival season. With all of the dust and dirt, grit and sun from camping, these gentle wipes get rid of the grime without drying out your skin with harsh chemicals. It smells and feels like it just has water, but it cleans much deeper and is still super gentle. I noticed that some reviewers complained of the cloth being too rough, but it was perfect for me because it was smoother than a wash cloth, but not so smooth that it just felt like it was smearing my makeup around.A little disappointing to see that it says No Alcohol on the front, yet Alcohol is one of the ingredients, but my skin did not experience any irritation, so I am a happy customer. Best of all, none of these products irritate my skin or lead to break outs.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got simple products to try in the mail courtesy of bzzagent.com! I go through a whole lot of facial wipes because I wipe my face once when I wake up before I wash my face and again to take off some makeup before I wash my face and go to bed so I&#x27;m constantly trying these wipes and so far they are my favorite. I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin but I do have pretty oily skin all around I wouldn&#x27;t even consider myself combination I&#x27;m just oily and these were gentle on my skin and didn&#x27;t help me be less oily but didn&#x27;t make the problem worse either. At first I only tried the regular simple cleansing facial wipes which I loved and have gone through three packages. However I tried the exfoliating wipes and they did break me out but I later learned I can&#x27;t exfoliate my face with any type of product or it badly breaks me out regardless of brand. I tried two wipes so far of the new oil balancing wipe and so far I&#x27;m in love I used one last night with my normal routine and then this morning before I washed my face then I did my normal makeup routine and I noticed my makeup stayed on better and longer and instead of blotting three times a day I only blotted once so they really are helping. There is a very slight smell that isn&#x27;t like anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled but its very faint and I have a sensitive nose and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and it doesn&#x27;t linger, sometimes the scent of a product is a make or break for me because if I don&#x27;t like it I don&#x27;t want to smell it on my face all day. Plus they really are soft gentle wipes I don&#x27;t feel them scratching my skin and they don&#x27;t leave a film or mask on me afterwords. The very best thing about this product is how quick and easy it gets off all my makeup I don&#x27;t need to waste and use multiple wipes and I can get off my entire face of makeup, eye liner and then I hold it on my eye lashes for a second and wipe a few times and even water proof mascara comes off pretty easy with these wipes without them burningmy eyes out of my head. Probably the only bad thing I could even mention about the product if I had to is the price, its comparable to basically every other brand unless you opt for store brand but $5.99-$7.99 does seem to be a bit pricey all across the board for facial wipes so I definitely opt for the simple brand they&#x27;ve been the best for the money.</li>
            <li> The SimpleÂ® Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes clean the oil off my cheeks and nose with out drying them out leaving the perfect balance on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I Love the Simple oil balancing wipes. I have combination skin that leaves my T-Zone oily and the rest of my face pretty dry. When used in combination with the Radiance Clensing wipes this prouduct is unstopable. My skin is now balanced and Smooth. There is no more oily skin and dry skin it is the perfect combination. This product is definatly going to be part of my daily regimen. It is so fast and easy. Thank you BZZAGENT for the free product, to be able to help pass the word of Simple Skincare.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free sample through BzzAgent and I was very excited to try it, as I have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a visible reduction of blemishes after about a week, but before then, the blemishes I had were much redder than normal and I felt stood out more. I felt that the wipes did an adequate job in reducing blemishes, but failed to prevent new ones from popping up. I felt that I had a lot more blemishes appear after using these than my other skincare products. The smell was slightly unpleasant, but not too bad. My face was neither sticky nor dry after usage. The wipes were very soft. I would recommend these for when you are too tired to do your normal cleansing routine, but I would not recommend switching to solely using these.</li>
            <li> I use these wipes in my T-zone area, because some days my skin can get oily. I like these wipes a lot for controlling the shine and combating the oil. I received these wipes for free and am sharing my HONEST opinion. These wipes do NOT contain any harsh ingredients and I was able to use them on my son&#x27;s face as well. My son is 2 years old. I would purchase these wipes!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I was able to try these wipes free of charge! And I have to say they are amazing! Very gentle, Gives you a very clean feeling,And Most of all my skin stayed BALANCED!!! Not to oily but also not to dry, My face is clean and beautiful! I love these and would totally recommend them to anyone who has sensitive and oily skin.... Thanks again BzzAgent!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent.com, I received free (full-sized!) samples from the Simple Skin Care line. Being a BzzAgent has allowed me to try products I typically would not buy, like the Simple product line. I fell in love with the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes with my first use! I hadn&#x27;t used my daily face wash when I tried these wipes and my felt felt fresh and clean all day after using it!! This is a product that I will definitely use every night before bed to ensure my face is clean, and I will most definitely be purchasing more after I run out of my sample!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzz agent I received this for free. I usually don&#x27;t use these kinds of product because of my sensitive skin but this works great ...Im definitely going to continue use after the ones i got run out !!! Recommend to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free through BzzAgent.com.  My face is combo, where after I wash it, it gets really dry and flaky, but as the day goes on, it gets really oily in certain spots.  after using these wipes, I will be buying them again!  They helped balance the oily parts of my skin, but didn&#x27;t take away from the dry spots.  The wipes made my face feel so smooth and gave it an even feeling.</li>
            <li> I was so lucky to have received this product for free using Bzzagent.com&lt;br /&gt;I have tried multiple products and none can compare to the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes. These wipes are very soft to the touch and felt wonderful on my skin. It provided gentle cleansing and my skin was indeed refreshed. I have already told all of my friends and family about this amazing product!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and breaks out within hours of using anything new, so I was nervous trying something new, but received a free sample so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot!  I&#x27;m SO glad that I did!!!  It&#x27;s become the first step in my morning beauty routine...I give my face a good wipe down with the Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes before moisturizing and applying my makeup and my skin has never looked better.  It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell, and my face feels smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> This product was sent for me to review for free and I think they are a great product.The packaging is compact the wipe itself does a great job in controlling the oiliness. I found this wipe to be a great make-up remover but i found myseld using it more right before applying my make up. It left my face feeling soft and refreshed and i would definitely recommend to any skin type.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant, I used the \\&quot;Yes to Blueberries\\&quot; face wipes and they worked well.  I like bringing face wipes with me when I travel because they&#x27;re easy to use and don&#x27;t require anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these in the morning, or whenever I need a quick wipe off - especially on our recent trip to Florida.  These left my face feeling clean but not greasy.  My skin is really sensitive so I was happy they didn&#x27;t make me break out OR dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to the more natural \\&quot;Yes to Blueberries\\&quot; line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received my very first bzz campaign, very exciting stuff. All my products were free! The line is Simple skincare and it included 4 products, full size I might add, not some sample size bs. So that&#x27;s an A+ from the get-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However before I get into my actual review I want to set up my review process. I have various categories which you will see listed below, but my rating system might be a little different from the usual.  It is my own creation called the \\&quot;One Direction Rating Scale\\&quot; and it goes from Zayn to Niall. Zayn being a 1 and Niall being a 5, with Liam Louis and Harry as 2,3, and 4 respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great now that that&#x27;s sorted, let&#x27;s get to the review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Categories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Packaging -Harry&lt;br /&gt;  Simple (.....) with nice colors and easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple Sensitive Skin Wipes and Oil Control Wipes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Desired Effect- Harry&lt;br /&gt;  I felt like all my make up was off, but I never feel quite clean until I actually WASH my face. That&#x27;s just me though. It was gentle to my skin, as it states. Novel idea....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Smell - Niall&lt;br /&gt;  Subtle scent which was nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Texture - Harry&lt;br /&gt;  Felt nice on my skin but slightly rough.  Probably to take off the make up effectively, but...my poor baby&#x27;s bottom skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Size- Niall&lt;br /&gt;  They were huge!! Very awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spokesperson Category:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spokesperson; Allison Williams- Louis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is arguably the most important category. And for this first review I&#x27;m torn.  Allison Williams who I heard give one radio interview (I&#x27;m writing her biography now) sounded adorbz and so I give her a Harry. HOWEVER! she&#x27;s famous for playing Marnie, on HBO&#x27;s Girls. who is a total Zayn. Can&#x27;t stand her.  So I gave her the average, which is basically Louis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my completely mathematically sound review system. Overall I really did enjoy this product and it will be my new go-to. Also has you can see in the picture, Jack approves. Which is endorsement enough.</li>
            <li> After receiving these to try for free, I have found that I really enjoy using these in the morning. Before I start to put my makeup on I clean my face with one of these wipes and I feel like it leaves my skin feeling extremely clean but my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry. I have some really dry areas on my face and these wipes don&#x27;t dry those areas out more but I feel like they do help keep the oil in my t-zone balanced and therefore I don&#x27;t get oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free product from Bazzagent. At first I didn&#x27;t believe that this product would be any different than products I have tried in the past. I have combination skin but it seems like it&#x27;s one extreme or the other, never a happy medium. After just a couple days I started to see a difference. My face was not getting so oily by late afternoon. I was in shock that something was actually working. It&#x27;s simple on my skin and does not dry or irritate my skin when I use it. I would recommend this to anyone to at least try and see the difference it really does make!</li>
            <li> These oil balancing wipes are simple. Easy to use, quickly brings your skin back into balance, and the best part of all is it has virtually no scent. I would have liked the wipes to be smaller like the size of their make up remover pads for those of us who have combination skin and don&#x27;t need the wipe for the entire face. I feel this product would be best for a person who could benefit from it by using it on the entire face than for someone like me who only has an oily nose. All in all I enjoyed this free product from BzzAgent and it is definately a product I would purchase.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free to try them and I gotta say I was surprised by the oil control power of this wipes. I tend to get oily around my hair line, and these wipes controlled my oiliness perfectly. I washed my face in the AM and swiped these, and they kept the area oil free all day. It was amazing, so I gave some to my sister (who has super oily skin). Most of the times she gets really oily by mid morning and when I saw her oily face in school I gave her a couple of wipes... Several hours later that evening she called me and asked where to get them as it was 8 pm and her face was much less oily than in regular days. SO it worked for both of us really well.</li>
            <li> While these only work okay with balancing oil, I love the way they smell. I don&#x27;t know what the fragrance is; this product has lavender so that may be it. They work great for daily use if you travel or if you need a little touch up at your desk throughout the day.</li>
            <li> These worked out great.  We have since purchased them ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t leave you feeling like anything was left on your skin and they perform well removing the oils.&lt;br /&gt;They feel soothing and you feel clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think they are something you would flush in the toilet so I would stick to the garbage for these wipes.</li>
            <li> I actually found these at my gym, someone put a bunch of them out for samples and i grabbed a couple. I have oily skin, these things take off all your makeup and leave your skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> This was a good product overall. THis is my first time using this product. it does the job well. I did not have any negative experience</li>
            <li> Perfect for a quick face wash on the go or before bed. I keep a pack in my desk at work, in my messenger bag and at home. Some days I have oilier skin than others and feel gross and slimy- this is perfect for getting rid of the oil and leaving you refreshed. But beware, your face will have a shine afterwards, which is why I also keep neutrogena shine control power handy.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free to try. These are really nice wipes. I was using the Yesto wipes from Target but these are far superior. They have a nice smell and they do not make my skin burn. I am definitely going to buy these again!</li>
            <li> The Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes are a toss up. I have combination skin with an oily T-zone, and these do actually seem to help somewhat. They also leave my skin feeling refreshed after I use them. The biggest downside of these wipes is the material they are made out of. I absolutely hate it! They are like gauze, and it feels like they will fall apart in my hands and will in fact do so if you stretch them too much. I have to bundle the wipe up just to make it strong enough to use. So frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product as a free sample as a part of a BzzAgent.com Simple Skincare Campaign*</li>
            <li> I received these as part of the BZZAGENT campaign. I honestly was a little leery of trying a new facial product. So many products claim to be for sensitive skin, but end up causing a breakout or cause your skin to dry out. The Simple skin care products do not!! I am actually really glad I got picked to do this campaign because the products are great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these wipes. I used the Oil Balancing cleansing wipes after I woke up and I also used them once during the day to keep my skin oil free and so soft. They have definitely helped with my T-zone that gets oily throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Simple skin care product line!!</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of this product in the mail through the company BzzAgent. I absolutely loved these wipes. The first time I used them I could see a difference. I work in the food industry around a lot of oils and grime and they take a tole on my pores. The last couple nights I have been using these wipes before I go to bed and after I wake up in the morning and I have significantly seen a difference. My skin is a lot less shiny and it feels so refreshed. The pads smell great. They are not alcohol based so they do not burn after you use them and do not have that strong odor. I would buy these again and again.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I received these from bzzagent for free to review. But... I was quickly let down. I&#x27;ve used them four times now and each time it left a burning sensation on my skin. Definitely not pleasant or expected considering the other Simple products were pretty amazing. These were soft though and I see they work for some people. I guess my skin is just a bit more sensitive when it comes to this product.</li>
            <li> I received these Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes through BzzAgent to try for free which Are great for my combo/oily skin! These wipes very easy to use, are perfect to control shine, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and are perfect to remove makeup before washing/cleansing the skin. I like these wipes very much for my skins needs and skin type, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these wipes however for someone who has dry or very dry skin because the wipes do control oil &amp; shine so it wouldn&#x27;t be great at adding moisture to the skin if it is a very dry or dry skin type. I don&#x27;t feel like these wipes make my skin feel tight or dry when I use them and it removes makeup perfectly off my face without any burning or stinging. If you have combination to oily skin these wipes would be just perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I received the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes for free via BzzAgent - and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes! the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes left my skin oil free after a long and strenuous workout, which I need because I break out from all the sweat! The Simple Oil Balancing Wipes do the job without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend Simple Oil Balancing Wipes to other sensitive skinned folks! Thank you Simple and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I got to try these for free with bzzagent (honestly I probably would not pay this much for this product because I&#x27;m CHEAP. haha) They are pretty nice though. They take off make up well, although if you have a FULL face of make up it takes like 2 pads to do the job, which is fine because they are a good size. They feel good on my face, don&#x27;t dry it up too much, but it keeps the oil under control. They are very gentle. If you are willing to buy it, I say: why not!</li>
            <li> I received these for free from Bzzagent.com to try out. I have very sensitive skin an have to e careful about what I use. I was excited to try the Simple brand face products. Unfortunately my skin hated these and the radiance cleansing cloths. When I first used them I liked them. My face felt fresh. Then after using them a few times my skin felt like it was burning. I don&#x27;t know if it was from the texture of the cloths or just the whole product. I will definitely not be using these again.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed when I opened the package of Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes was the mild perfume of a cleanser which I was unaccustomed to after using three of the brand&#x27;s other products. While it was not unpleasant, the scent lingered for nearly half an hour after washing my face. This particular cleansing wipe left my face feeling clean and smooth in the areas that are not prone to being oily but sticky across my nose and along my jaw line. Fearing that I had been careless when washing my face, I repeated the process with the same result. Although the Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes did not leave my skin looking as red and feeling as irritated as it does when I have used a harsher cleanser, I do not believe that my face is as clean after using this product. I am glad that I had success with Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes and will use them in the future. Thank you, Simple! (I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.)</li>
            <li> I have oily skin throughout the day, and found that these wipes didn&#x27;t really help much with decreasing my oily skin. I would use them in the morning before I put my makeup on, but I was still as oily as I usually am. I was disappointed in the product, although they do work well with taking face makeup off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably not the best person to review this product because I&#x27;m really not the target audience. At first, I thought the wipes were meant to get rid of oil throughout the day. I have somewhat oily skin and sometimes I just want to freshen up in the middle of the day. However, these wipes are more cleansers and don&#x27;t remove oil without actually cleaning your face and also removing your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I started using them after washing my face at night and showering in the morning. Using these wipes made me realize that even after I was my face with my usual cleanser, I&#x27;m really not getting all of the makeup and dirt off. So, I felt good about getting a little extra cleanse from these. However, a couple days after I started using these, I started breaking out, which is obviously counterproductive to why I started using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these could work for someone with the right skin. But if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts, I would probably stay away!</li>
            <li> The Simple Oil Balancing Wipes are a convenient package of wipes to have around, especially after a work out.  They&#x27;re portable and the cool soft cloth-like material is soothing and feels good on the skin.  The no-sting solution on the wipes makes it a comfortable alternative to other harsher skin care products.  The Simple Oil Balancing Wipes do a great job of cutting down on oil and removing excess dirt, allowing skin to clear up quickly.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes and have a subscription for them! They are perfect for oily sensitive skin and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Se siente renovada la piel y no deja residuos ni sensaciones pegajosas como algunas otras marcas... la piel se siente fresca como cuando sales del baÃ±arte</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so when I started using these, free via bzzagent.com, I was praying they wouldn&#x27;t make my skin more oily, leading to more breakouts. Thankfully they didn&#x27;t! My skin feels great!!!</li>
            <li> i recieved these wipes free from bzz agent to try and I love them most of all... I have always had oily skin and these wipes completely take care of that! most cleaners I have used either dont treat the oily skin or burn when you use them and this cleaner takes care of the oil and doesnt burn my face when I use them! i would recommend these to every one!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these oil balancing cleansing wipes! I have such oily and dry combination skin, I have tried so many things on it, but the oil busting astringents dry it out, and the moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past leave me greasy; this one is the best I have ever used! Use it all over, or just where you struggle with oil, either way it&#x27;s fine! It didn&#x27;t dry out the rest of my face when I used it all over! These will have a permanent home on my bathroom shelf from now on!  Did I mention I got to try them FREE by being a Bzz agent?! (bzzagent.com)</li>
            <li> I received these in my free sample kit from BzzAgent.com and they work really well. They made my face super soft and have a glow to it. They are perfect for people with sensitive skin like me and they have a nice little scent to them. I am excited to try them with the upcoming summer when oily skin runs crazy with me. I followed up with the light moisturizer and I must say I am very happy. I love that the wipes also didn&#x27;t make my face feel tight and dried out.</li>
            <li> I use the Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes after working out and I think they worked great! It helps to remove the oil that accumulates during the exercise, and makes sure that my face doesn&#x27;t keep getting oily for the rest of the day. I use a different wipe in the morning (their Radiance wipes) and in the evening (I use Ponds) - but these are fabulous for post-workout sweatiness. I always hated how when I would use a wipe post-workout - I&#x27;d still sweat and it wouldn&#x27;t matter that I&#x27;d used the wipes - my face would get all gross again. These keep my face from that continual post-workout grossness :) I did get the item for free as part of a sampling pack from BzzAgent. But honestly - that would make me more likely to give it a bad review if it did&#x27;t work - because what would I have to lose? lol.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product one week ago and I have enjoyed using it!  Overall these cleansing wipes are great for removing oil, dirt, and makeup but they can also be used as an &#x27;on the go&#x27; wipe to use on your hands and body etc.  I love the scent of these because it is so light that it is barely even present!  These have been really gentle on my sensitive skin.  While I like these wipes I have to admit that I like the radiance cleansing wipes a little more because it feels a bit more moisturizing.  I suggest trying them both to figure out which works best for you!</li>
            <li> I was sent this product on an online community, and I actually liked the unique concept and ingredients that truly did the job. However, the reason that I did not give this products 5 stars is for the lack of product on the wipes and they were rough for my sensitive skin. I expected the wipes to be gentle, since it is specifically for sensitive skin and it even says that it is kind to skin. The ingredients yes they are, but the wipe NO its too rough.</li>
            <li> When I first open it I was like wow these wipes are big. All you need is just one to remove all your makeup on you face even I wear heavy foundation and makeup. Everything comes off effortlessly. It even feels nice after you clean off your makeup. I like this product and I would definitely buy this again. I do have oily skin and this wiped said its recommend for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this! It&#x27;s the middle of exam week, I&#x27;m stressing out and so is my skin - oily here, dry there - it&#x27;s driving me insane! But instead of dropping everything to run through a whole beauty regimen (you know, washing with a chemical filled cleanser to strip the oil off my face - hair getting caught in the crossfires - then slathering my face with lotion so it doesn&#x27;t start cracking immediately!), I instead grab one of these cleansing wipes and in a matter of seconds my skin feels so much happier! Refreshed! Radiant! Clean! Such a time saver! Plus, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it also smells lovely in a natural kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I have a 7 month old so, i&#x27;m not as much of a &#x27;new&#x27; mom but I still fall into bed exhausted at night and am guilty of skipping washing my face. These are great for those nights or any night really. I received a sample to try through BzzAgent and have been using them for a couple days now. My super sensitive skin seems to like them well enough. No burning sensation, no over drying effects and I love that the scent is very mild. They seem to gently exfoliate too. I&#x27;m going to include these in my &#x27;new baby&#x27; kits for friends and keep a pack on hand for myself too!</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free full size sample &amp; i love it!! .. I have very oily skin &amp; these wipes work wonders! I use them very day. They are great for sensitive skin, they don&#x27;t make my face for dry at all. I would commend everyone to try them!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of these from Bzzagent and was surprised out how useful I found them. Usually I clean up my makeup with some fancy face soap and water, and occasionally realize after applying toner that the makeup did not come off all the way because I see it on the toner sheet. That doesn&#x27;t happen with these, however, since you can see what is coming off on the wipe and if everything is peachy and clean. To top it off, the inconvenience and discomfort of having to splash water all over your face and then wipe it dry is gone when you use these. You can even keep the wipes by the bed so that, just in case you forgot to wash your face before going to bed, you can still clean up without getting up. I bet they&#x27;d be pretty useful for kids, too!</li>
            <li> I recived this product as one of my free \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; product kit.. works great. My face is usually really oily at the end of the day but i carry these around with me in my purse and it definetley helps me keep a not oily face :)</li>
            <li> Simple&#x27;s oil balancing wipes are very handy to have around for removing make-up or wiping down when you are feeling sweaty and oily but can&#x27;t shower. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with breaking out -- they were very mild and I appreciate that they only have two ingredients. I am not sure that I like these enough to make them the only way I remove makeup, but I will use them regularly, especially in the summertime.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these wipes, I was a little hesitant to try them as I have very sensitive skin. They controlled unwanted shine and left my skin glowing the way I wanted. I love the fact that this product does not contain alcohol, perfumes or dyes. I definitely would recommend these wipes to a friend.  I enjoyed this free product from BzzAgent and it is definately a product I would purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used Simple products on and off for years, and have never been let down. Whether I am taking off make-up or just needing to refresh my face, the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes are perfect. They have a great smell, too. Plus, unlike some other facial wipes these hold up great.</li>
            <li> I am a member of BzzAgent, and got this in the campaign for Simple,and this product, just GREAT. I have very dry and oily skin, and these were like a gift from the gods haha. they are a really nice size, and have a slight smell, but it&#x27;s more of a clean natural smell. They did not irritate my skin or give me a rash. After using these for a while, I noticed the oiliness of my skin lessened dramatically. If you too have oily skin, i would recommend this to you with flying colors! It&#x27;s a pretty good price for a really good product. I&#x27;ll be sure to pick some up when I run out.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say this product was sent to me free to try, I really enjoyed trying this product. My skin is super sensitive &amp; I usually break out from much products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did take care of my oily skin but isn&#x27;t my favorite product from Simple sensitive skin products. My skin was a little red after using the product the first day. This second day I used the product I made sure to use the Simple skin protecting light moisturizer which felt so much better afterwards, together these products are wonderful, I would not use this product by itself personally but would still recommend it to other people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just recently received a free sample of these wipes as part of a BzzAgent Campaign.  I will first start by mentioning I do not have overly oily skin.  I would consider my skin to be normal.  I still was impressed by this product.  They are a perfect size for cleansing your entire face.  My face was not overly dried out after using these wipes.  And again, I have normal skin.  I would say this is a perfect balance of a good clean without over drying.  I would highly recommend these wipes for any skin type, but especially those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I received my simple skin oil balancing wipes free through bzzagent.com. I have always had some what oily skin, and i have noticed a pretty significant change in my skin since using these wipes! Whether its for a quick freshen up during the day or part of your nightly ritual this product seems to decrease the appearance of oily skin!</li>
            <li> These were sent to me through a Bzz campaign. I had no use for them until the radiating skin wipes caused me a major breakout. They left my skin feeling rather tight and less than clean after use. Luckily they are helping my skin clear up though.</li>
            <li> It was love at first use!! I was previously using oil blotting sheets but after using these, I&#x27;ll never go back! Fast, easy and effective.  My first use of this product was due to a free sample from bzzagent, but I will most definitely be back for many more purchases from the Simple brand.</li>
            <li> I received a package of Simple Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes for free from BzzAgent. I use the Original Simple Cleansing Wipes every day and love them. Getting to try this new product was awesome! I have super oily skin so I have tried many oil reducing products in the past. Most of them dry my skin out so bad it just gets irritated and starts to break out. These wipes rock! They remove the oil and somehow leave my skin feeling healthy and soft. No drying, no irritation. I definitely recommend these wipes to anyone trying to control their oily skin.</li>
            <li> I received these wipes for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign. They did have a very pleasant smell but that&#x27;s the only positive aspect I can find. The wipes would be better if they were more moist. I felt like I had to use quite a bit of friction to remove the sunscreen I had been wearing and even still it left some residue behind. Also, a while later, I had a couple of patches on my cheek that were dry and flaky. I would not recommend these. Another big issue: the second ingredient is propylene glycol - definitely not a &#x27;simple, skin loving&#x27; ingredient in my opinion! They also have parabens which I prefer to try and stay away from. I am also surprised at the price of these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these to balance out some oiliness cause by a moisturizer I used in my t-zone (which I shouldn&#x27;t have) they are great they get make up off really well and leave your face feeling fresh! I even used it on my husband who has incredibly sensitive skin (he uses unscented soaps, detergents, lotions, etc) and it cleaned his face well and it didn&#x27;t break him out.</li>
            <li> These are really refreshing and convenient and great for my son who I just can&#x27;t seem to get to wash his face in the morning. They are gentle and free of artificial fragrance and can easily be toted along with you for a quick refresh. I found them very convenient when I threw my back out and was laid up recently. They are priced reasonably compared to similar products I have tried and I definitely recommend them.  I do prefer a similar wipe by LA Fresh as they are more natural but they are also twice the price.</li>
            <li> I am really liking the products that Simple is putting out. These are some really good face cleaning products. They do a great job of removing oil and dirt. Plus they don&#x27;t have alcohol so they don&#x27;t dry your face out. I will definetly use these again. I have also used their lotion which is great as well.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and arrived in time with no issues.</li>
            <li> Note: I received this product for free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, I&#x27;d say mine is more normal to dry. However the sides of my nose DO get oily after working out so I figured I might as well give these a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these left a really pleasant fresh feeling on my face, which I love and wish the Radiance Wipes had a bit more of. These are kind of scratchy though, as another reviewer said. It also left a kind of tight feeling on my face, so it ended up taking a bit too much oil away from my skin. That said, it&#x27;ll probably work very well for people with genuinely oily skin so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a plus! These do have a scent, but I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it. It&#x27;s not overpowering though, so I didn&#x27;t mind it terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it&#x27;s a a really nice product, but it&#x27;s just not suited for me.</li>
            <li> I received these for review. I really enjoyed using this product!! I suffer from oily sensitive skin so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products that are meant to manage oil.  These wipe are scented (light scent) and remove makeup while not stripping your face of all the natural oils your face needs. As a \\&quot;makeup remover\\&quot; this worked great. Over the years I have found that if you completely strip an oily face, your face lashes back with an over production of oil!! These seem to be the solution! Left my skin soft. Will def be buying these!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample from BzzAgent to review.. I&#x27;m very glad I received these free because I tend to overlook things like this when shopping for skincare items. My skin is definitely oil-prone and around the afternoon my skin is glistening (in a bad way) with oil. These help A LOT with the oil control though the wipes themselves are slightly rough, but I guess that could be a good thing if you like to scrub off some dead skin. They leave my face soft and oil-free so I will continue buying these~</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed upon opening the package was the light scent. It&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant but it was a bit unexpected. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as refreshed as the Radiance Wipes but it definitely got the job done. It left my skin looking clean and healthy; as well as leaving my skin feeling soft. I got to try out this product for free thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was impressed with the quality of these affordable Simple skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial cleansing wipes were fantastic, and left my face feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my face is not oily, but I do have a couple problem areas. These wipes cleared those areas easily and left my face feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided this product to review. My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying how excited I was to get to try this as well as other new products from the Simple Skincare line.  I hadn&#x27;t tried any of their products until I received my free campaign from BzzAgent and wanted to see if they were really worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;  In the campaign I received the Protecting Light Moisturizer, the Radiance Cleansing Wipes, Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes, and the Eye Make-up Remover Pads.  I was concerned about a few things before trying these products.  I have oily/combination skin so I didn&#x27;t know if the Oil Balancing Wipes would actually help with controlling the oil my skin produces.  I didn&#x27;t know how well the cleansing wipes would actually remove my makeup and cleanse my skin.  Also I had never used Eye Make-up Remover Pads so I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would remove my eye makeup without causing my eyes to burn.  Finally I was especially concerned about the moisturizer.  I was afraid it would make my skin  as well as cause a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;  I was really impressed with all of these products.  I really like the fact that they are good for my skin.  They don&#x27;t have artificial perfumes or dyes.  They also have \\&quot;skin loving\\&quot; ingredients such as zinc, glycerin, mango extract and more.  They don&#x27;t contain alcohol or oil which is another plus.  The eye make-up remover pads and moisturizer also contain vitamins which are really good for your skin.  I also appreciate the fact that Simple Skincare products contain no animal derived ingredients.  Here is my review of the Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes.&lt;br /&gt;  Oil Balancing Cleansing Wipes-  I use the wipes first thing in the morning.  They help remove any oil my skin has accumulated over the night.  These do a really good job at cleaning my face without leaving it feeling sticky or excessively dry.  They also don&#x27;t have much of a scent which I really like in the morning.  Which can happen even though I have oily/combination skin.  I have noticed that my makeup lasts a lot longer during the day and that my face doesn&#x27;t look as oily.&lt;br /&gt;  I would definitely recommend that you check out the new Simple Skincare products.  They have not only improved the condition of my skin but also my skincare routine.  Prior to trying them my routine was minimalistic.  I washed my face while in the shower or before bed and occasionally added a moisturizer to my skin at night and/or in the morning.  These products are so simple to use that you don&#x27;t need anything else.  No water, washcloth, towel.. nothing.  Which means that I clean my face day and night now as well as add moisturizer every morning before applying my makeup or going outside.  I use the makeup remover pads in the evening if I wear makeup so I&#x27;m not tugging on pulling on my eyes.  Again I recommend that you check these products out.  They work great and are good for your skin.  What more could you ask for.</li>
