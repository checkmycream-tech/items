            <li>This merchandise did not smell anything like sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month now and my skin feels fresh, clean and nourished.</li>
            <li>quickly</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>did, it is just that you will need to get a squirt bottle of some kind for actual use.  </li>
            <li>I make my own pain oil and the base is this wonderful almond oil.</li>
            <li>this was not expensive.  </li>
            <li>but this oil makes my scalp feel super soft and luscious .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mixed it with my face moisturizer and it blends easily.</li>

            <li>Recommend highly for 45 and older .</li>

            <li>My skin is always left soft and supple .</li>
            <li>An old trick is to use a regular can of coke mixed in with your detergent to get the oil and smell out.</li>

            <li> An old trick is to use a regular can of coke mixed in with your detergent to get the oil and smell out.</li>
            <li> It does not leave me with that damp skin feeling that lotion gives me and my skin stays moisturized for a long time unlike with lotion that I need to constantly re-apply.  </li>
            <li> so my skin gets dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I do a lot of camping, snowshoeing and other outdoor stuff in the winter</li>
            <li> Also, compared to a lot of the other oils I saw here on Amazon</li>
            <li> I will not buy from this company again unless they make restitution for the oil I lost, the lid was loose and about an inch of the oil had leaked out of the 32 oz bottle, even out of the plastic sack it was in, the box was oily but it didn&#x27;t mess up the rest of my order.  </li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in has a big opening and if you try to dump a little in your hand you will spill and waste a lot.  </li>
            <li> Leave on for a  few minutes then dry off.</li>
            <li> The only negative about this product is the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It had been opened previously</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived sealed, but there were black particles floating in the bottom.</li>
            <li> Had no smell, which is a little odd since you&#x27;d expect almond oil to smell like.it.</li>
            <li> I got a Ketchup / Mustard type bottle with a little end cap from WalMart in the kitchen department for about $1.50 for this</li>
            <li> I was tired of using lotion and was looking for something that was a little longer lasting.  </li>
            <li> It was packaged well, however I&#x27;m not really sure what I received.</li>
            <li> wrong product delivey!!</li>
            <li> I hate paying for something and not getting all that I paid for.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This almond oil is NOT Organic. The bottle is no way even close to what is shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wil share image soon.</li>
            <li> This merchandise did not smell anything like sweet almond oil. It had no smell whatsoever. It was packaged well, however I&#x27;m not really sure what I received. For all I know this could be vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help manage my eczema. It absorbs really well and is an EXCELLENT moisturizer. I will continue to purchase this oil, which I use along with Organic Shea Butter to keep my skin in shape!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Sweet Almond Oil, it feels amazing when rubbing it on your skin, and it smells wonderful. My skin feels clean and smooth when I apply it. It also lasts throughout the day. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase, will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil for use as a carrier oil, massage oil, or hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic !! I oil my scalp once a day but this oil makes my scalp feel super soft and luscious .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. I have been using it for about a month now and my skin feels fresh, clean and nourished. I was suffering with quite dry skin after the winter months and now I feel summer ready as my skin is literally glowing. It smells fragrant and it isn&#x27;t at all sticky. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I will not buy from this company again unless they make restitution for the oil I lost, the lid was loose and about an inch of the oil had leaked out of the 32 oz bottle, even out of the plastic sack it was in, the box was oily but it didn&#x27;t mess up the rest of my order.  I hate paying for something and not getting all that I paid for.  Maybe more attention to bottle caps when shipping would be nice.  In addition to it leaking, the sealed lid under the screw cap was not even sealed to the bottle.  It had been opened previously I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived sealed, but there were black particles floating in the bottom. Had no smell, which is a little odd since you&#x27;d expect almond oil to smell like.it. NOT organic</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and I use this for massage and I love it!</li>
            <li> I am using this product along with coconut oil, &amp; shea butter to make body polish &amp; butter.  It smells &amp; feels great!</li>
            <li> Great product to use in homemade body lotions and butters, sugar scrubs, etc. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I read mixed reviews, but decided to try it anyway. I think it&#x27;s great. Exactly what I had expected. The oil is virtually odorless. It came packaged well, no leaks. I use it all over, particularly after I shower and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on my skin or clothes. I&#x27;ve mixed it with my face moisturizer and it blends easily. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great on my skin!!!  Great size  I will always have it in my shower  So pure your could drink it</li>
            <li> I apply this over my entire body while skin is still damp. Leave on for a  few minutes then dry off. My skin stays soft and doesn&#x27;t cause ME breakouts. Recommend highly for 45 and older . Great Product. Used for years to keep my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> Very greasy, if you are using this in your massage studio make sure you run the sheets on long cycles with hot water, and extra detergent. An old trick is to use a regular can of coke mixed in with your detergent to get the oil and smell out. If you don&#x27;t clean them well, it will become rancid *quickly*.</li>
            <li> I love this Sweet Almond Oil!  It is fabulous alone when I apply it after my shower and it is simply heavenly in my homemade body butters. My skin is always left soft and supple . I have natural hair and it moisturizes my hair without feeling greasy. Absolutely wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I SO love your sweet almond oil. I make my own pain oil and the base is this wonderful almond oil. I love the way I the skin absorbs this oil and makes your skin feel silky and refreshing. I really love the size also. Thank you and GOD bless. I add it to all my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Good oil at a nice price.</li>
            <li> wrong product delivey!!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery , it&#x27;s smooth oil for massage ..</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to try to help keep my skin from drying out.  I was tired of using lotion and was looking for something that was a little longer lasting.  I do a lot of camping, snowshoeing and other outdoor stuff in the winter so my skin gets dry and itchy.  This Almond Oil works very well and I am quite happy with it.

This stuff makes my skin feel so smooth and eliminates the itchiness.  Also, compared to a lot of the other oils I saw here on Amazon this was not expensive.  The only negative about this product is the bottle.  I didn’t have any leakage issues like the one reviewer did, it is just that you will need to get a squirt bottle of some kind for actual use.  The bottle it comes in has a big opening and if you try to dump a little in your hand you will spill and waste a lot.  I got a Ketchup / Mustard type bottle with a little end cap from WalMart in the kitchen department for about $1.50 for this and it works quite well.
