            <li>It does&#x27;t make them bright white</li>
            <li>I love the toothpaste but find the accelerator is only ok for whitening.</li>

            <li>Supersmile along with regular dental care is amazing.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it in larger tubes, but they are not as easy to handle, and the larger tubes disintegrate before I can use all the Accelerator.</li>
            <li>and maybe it is because my teeth are old and I have years of coffee stains and nicotine buildup.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Super white teeth are the results. Must be used with pre-rinse and their tooth paste in order to work properly.</li>
            <li> I love the toothpaste but find the accelerator is only ok for whitening. I love the clean feel the toothpaste gives my teeth. I use it with the sonicare toothbrush and it does a good job but the whitener could be better</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever use regular toothpaste again!</li>
            <li> gently whitens teeths without any sensitivity</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference so went back to the tray tooth whitening system</li>
            <li> It really works and easy to use unlike those whiting strips that don&#x27;t stay on and it works out cheaper!!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for travelling.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well and should use with the supersmile toothpaste too.  It is a little costly though and wish they&lt;br /&gt;would give some breaks on it.</li>
            <li> Using this system has removed the stains off of my teeth.  I am amazed at how it works.  Definitely would recommend the other products this works with.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AND ALL WAYS WILL BE A PERFECT, UPKEEP FROM;  YEARLY CLEANING AND POLISHINGS.  EASY TO USE EVERYMORNING....OR WHATEVER TIME..</li>
            <li> I have only ordered this once, it gave a boost to the toothpaste but I after using it once I find the toothpaste is working fine.</li>
            <li> You mix this with the toothpaste before brushing. The combination cleans my teeth better than any I have used. I just wished that it whitened better than it does.</li>
            <li> Supersmile along with regular dental care is amazing.  I brush twice a day and  I have noticed quite a difference in the  whitening in my teeth.  There is no sensitivity, which is a plus!  I will always buy Supersmile for now on.</li>
            <li> am needing more soon.  works well</li>
            <li> best whiter I have tried... been looking so long to find something easy, tastes great, and actually works.... even my husband will use it lol : ) highly recommend</li>
            <li> It did what it said it supposed to do</li>
            <li> The easiest way to improve and keep the whiteness of teeth is to use Supersmile Whitening Accelerator with Supersmile Toothpaste. I&#x27;ve bought it in larger tubes, but they are not as easy to handle, and the larger tubes disintegrate before I can use all the Accelerator. This size is great, even if it is a bit more expensive per oz. this way.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TRYING THIS WITH THE TOOTHPASTE AND PRE-RINSE I NOTICE MY TEETH ARE WHITER</li>
            <li> This product has brought a birghtness to my teeth.  It does&#x27;t make them bright white but it brightens my teeth so it looks like I;m maintaining a dental process.</li>
            <li> I have used the Super smile toothpaste and the accelerator for years. I love the flavor and the way it whitens my teeth. Would not use anything else. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I first ordered this in a kit so the tube was small.  I used it until it ran out, which took about a month.  Now, after only using the toothpaste for several months I see that my teeth aren&#x27;t quite so white so I purchased this tube which should last several months.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work  for me and maybe it is because my teeth are old and I have years of coffee stains and nicotine buildup.</li>
