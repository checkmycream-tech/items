            <li>I picked out this &amp;#34;Joy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Renew&amp;#34; to try first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Joy&amp;#34; reminds me of a cheery kitchen, with bright morning sunshine coming through clean windows hung with cotton eyelet curtains.  </li>

            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Joy&amp;#34; is a great name for this combination scent - it is very fitting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oils seem to be top notch, not my favorite scent, but still is about what you would expect based on the description.  </li>
            <li>Love the cinnamon and sage that helps to make this oil smell unique.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is ylang ylang that gives a tanginess, and pachouli, which adds a touch of mystery and exotic.  </li>
            <li>look forward to adding it to more products as I make them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
            <li>Put into a cute container or mason jar.</li>
            <li>These are the best essential oils.  </li>
            <li>There are so many ways to utilize it.  </li>
            <li>It is uplifting, calming and just enjoyable in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>Fairly pleasant scent here but takes a lot to really smell this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankincense essential oil has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits to the skin, making it ideal for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>but when I put a few drops in my diffuser my house fills will a pleasant aroma that calms me and makes me happy.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Joy essential oil from Scential Health.</li>
            <li>Having had such a good experience with their singles, and since I like combing oils to make my own blends, I was inquisitive to try their blended oils.  </li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, it smells like black licorice and spice.  </li>
            <li>First I love the smell, but also I love the calming effect that it brings into the room.</li>
            <li>Scential Health that isn&#x27;t an issue, their oils are 100% pure and they are amazing quality.  </li>
            <li>Great pure quality oils for a reasonable  price .</li>
            <li>I have a difusser in every room and am using Joy in every room currently, because I am not going to lie</li>
            <li>It smells like a light mix of lemon/lime and flowers.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this oil to anyone who wants a nice smell in the home.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: I received this book free from HealthBizDirect,</li>
            <li>This is what I found in the Joy Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>I bought the Joy scent, and so far have added it to almond oil that I splash on my legs and arms right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The scent is so fun and uplifting!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an uplifting scent that is too strong right out of the bottle, but lightly diffused</li>
            <li>First, I love free and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This is the second scent I bought from Scential Health and all though both were pleasant</li>
            <li>Scential seems to know exactly what we need to calm ourselves and enjoy our lives more.  </li>
            <li>The label is nice and clearly</li>
            <li>received this item for testing purposes, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I think the clary sage and the sandalwood keep the blend from being too sweet, too floral.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasing, but not overpowering - just don&#x27;t use too much because it is indeed potent.</li>
            <li>The almond oil absorbs quickly but the scent lingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad but liked other brand oils better then</li>
            <li>They are rich and potent and smell natural.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try out the new essential oils by Scential Health, but especially pumped about Joy!</li>
            <li>This package arrived securely and fast.</li>
            <li>that I am not getting from my own simple blends.  </li>
            <li>Always use with some kind of carrier:  A &amp;#34;carrier oil&amp;#34;, water, lotion, or some such combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must say the oils are pure, clean and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I was actually very surprised at how quickly the scent filled the room.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of essential oils and believe they offer a ton of benefits to us, I have been able to treat many issues with essential oils and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty glass spray bottle for my purse.</li>
            <li>So much healthier than a perfume loaded with chemicals and alcohol!  </li>
            <li>I had to buy more and wish they had a larger quantity.</li>
            <li>I feel that is what this Oil Blend does, calms you down and helps you to enjoy life once more.</li>
            <li>I can picture it being a nice scent for meditation and for other uses too, like cleaning.  </li>
            <li>With the blend of several single essential oils, it created a wonderfully, uplifting feeling.  </li>
            <li>Inc. I was not required to write a positive review.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t measure the actuality of how pure this oil is</li>
            <li>This is definitely going to be a new favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>and I have felt very relaxed and at peace when diffusing it throughout my home.</li>
            <li>I ordered  &amp;#34;Healthy Joy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Bergamot&amp;#34; Essential oils and decided to use them in a Vapor &amp; Oil Diffuser, which I can put in any room I wish and enjoy the relaxing  scent of the oil of my choice .</li>
            <li>Now this is a real hit here.</li>
            <li>This bottle is therefore a great deal - it&#x27;ll last a few months at this rate!</li>
            <li>and I think it is very peace promoting and highly recommend it to EO lovers as well as those who are new to EO.</li>
            <li>I also detect Clary Sage which I am new to, but can recognize it.</li>
            <li>It is cytophylactic, which means that it helps protect existing cells and encourage new cell growth.</li>
            <li>Through the window I see a bright blue sky and white puffy clouds and new green leaves.  </li>
            <li>Pure essential oils, which all the Scential oils are, should never go on your skin or in your mouth undiluted.  </li>
            <li>since I&#x27;m very safety-minded--that some reviewers are suggesting that you use these Scential essential oils undiluted.  </li>
            <li>It is also a natural toner, decreasing the appearance of pores and evening skin-tone.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, packaged well as to not get damaged during transit and the cap was sealed ( I have received oils from other companies that arrived opened and leaking! )</li>
            <li>The issue with essential oils is finding high quality ones that are not cut with fillers and chemicals, you do not want to use those junk oils on your skin</li>
            <li>This essential oil is 100% Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils and contains No Fillers, Additives, Bases Or Additive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried several Scential Health single essential oils and have appreciated them all.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very excited to try out the new essential oils by Scential Health, but especially pumped about Joy! I have heard good things and from checking out the EO&#x27;s in this blend, I knew I had to try it out !  It arrived quickly, packaged well as to not get damaged during transit and the cap was sealed ( I have received oils from other companies that arrived opened and leaking! ) The label is nice and clearly labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this oil in my diffuser, and I have to say that I am really en&#x27;joy&#x27;ing it! The scent is absolutely amazing and I have felt very relaxed and at peace when diffusing it throughout my home. I have a difusser in every room and am using Joy in every room currently, because I am not going to lie it is my very favorite...even out of the others I received from Scential Health! I love it and I think it is very peace promoting and highly recommend it to EO lovers as well as those who are new to EO. I received this EO blend to try out in our home and have provided my honest opinion in return.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle of Joy, I was impressed by the immediate reaction to my senses. I can&#x27;t measure the actuality of how pure this oil is but I do know that by smelling this wonderful scent, it lifted my spirits almost every time.  With the blend of several single essential oils, it created a wonderfully, uplifting feeling.  This past month has been a difficult one with some challenges but this blended oil has helped me cope with all the stress and challenges I face at times. I love this oil.  It has been so helpful to me and my family.</li>
            <li> This scent is so yummy! It smells like candy! I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not a huge fan of combo scents, but this one is different.  It smells like a light mix of lemon/lime and flowers.  It&#x27;s not overpowering when properly diluted in an aromatherapy diffuser, which is the only place this beginner is using essential oils for the time being.  :)  I can picture it being a nice scent for meditation and for other uses too, like cleaning.  &amp;#34;Joy&amp;#34; is a great name for this combination scent - it is very fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was received for an honest evaluation.</li>
            <li> The oils seem to be top notch, not my favorite scent, but still is about what you would expect based on the description.  These are good oils for the value.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of essential oils and believe they offer a ton of benefits to us, I have been able to treat many issues with essential oils and I highly recommend them. The issue with essential oils is finding high quality ones that are not cut with fillers and chemicals, you do not want to use those junk oils on your skin and you definitely don&#x27;t want to be ingesting them! There are a lot of unpure oils being sold and unfortunately I have been fooled into purchasing some myself.&lt;br /&gt;With Scential Health that isn&#x27;t an issue, their oils are 100% pure and they are amazing quality.  I ordered Joy Scential to diffuse in my home since I tend to suffer from depression.  The smell is wonderful, it smells like black licorice and spice.  I also use a couple drops with a carrier oil and use it on my pressure points, it makes me smell great and gives me a boost of happiness.  Its wonderful and it is feel good in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for testing purposes, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Joy Scential is a nice sweet light smell, I found myself just standing in front of it smiling.  Love the cinnamon and sage that helps to make this oil smell unique.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several Scential Health Oils and I must say the oils are pure, clean and relaxing. I recommend this oil to anyone who wants a nice smell in the home.&lt;br /&gt;I received this oil in return for an honest review.  Keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Scential Health single essential oils and have appreciated them all.  They are rich and potent and smell natural.  Having had such a good experience with their singles, and since I like combing oils to make my own blends, I was inquisitive to try their blended oils.  I was looking for a little complexity, that I am not getting from my own simple blends.  I picked out this &amp;#34;Joy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Renew&amp;#34; to try first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Joy&amp;#34; reminds me of a cheery kitchen, with bright morning sunshine coming through clean windows hung with cotton eyelet curtains.  Through the window I see a bright blue sky and white puffy clouds and new green leaves.  When I turn back towards the kitchen I see yellow, red, white accents and tablecloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smell lemon--sweet, rather than tart.  There is ylang ylang that gives a tanginess, and pachouli, which adds a touch of mystery and exotic.  I think the clary sage and the sandalwood keep the blend from being too sweet, too floral.  Don&#x27;t think that the addition of anise and cinnamon leaf makes this a spicy mix--it is not that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an aromatherapy vessel, it is a noticeable scent, but stays nicely behaved in the background.  It is not overpowering, not overwhelming, and plays well with normal &amp;#34;house smells&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  It concerns me--since I&#x27;m very safety-minded--that some reviewers are suggesting that you use these Scential essential oils undiluted.  Don&#x27;t!  There is even a warning on the bottle.  Pure essential oils, which all the Scential oils are, should never go on your skin or in your mouth undiluted.  Always use with some kind of carrier:  A &amp;#34;carrier oil&amp;#34;, water, lotion, or some such combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Scential Health.</li>
            <li> I ordered  &amp;#34;Healthy Joy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Bergamot&amp;#34; Essential oils and decided to use them in a Vapor &amp; Oil Diffuser, which I can put in any room I wish and enjoy the relaxing  scent of the oil of my choice . Great pure quality oils for a reasonable  price .</li>
            <li> First, I love free and quick shipping. This package arrived securely and fast. I bought the Joy scent, and so far have added it to almond oil that I splash on my legs and arms right out of the shower. The almond oil absorbs quickly but the scent lingers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an uplifting scent that is too strong right out of the bottle, but lightly diffused it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to adding it to more products as I make them.</li>
            <li> Scential Health kindly provided me with a sample of this product for review and I&#x27;m glad they did. I used 6 drops of this in our Greenair Spa Vaporizer mixed with some water. The smell is very pleasant and the oil is very concentrated - in fact, I&#x27;d probably use a little less next time. This bottle is therefore a great deal - it&#x27;ll last a few months at this rate! I was actually very surprised at how quickly the scent filled the room. It smells a little like 7-Up, but less lemony. It&#x27;s pleasing, but not overpowering - just don&#x27;t use too much because it is indeed potent. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this oil to others.</li>
            <li> I dropped 6 drops in the palm of my hand and rubbed my palms together and then breathed in deeply. I repeated this process a few times. I felt revived! Inhaling deeply is good for our healthy anyways and so why not inhale Joy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Premium Synergistic Blend Of Anise, Cinnamon Leaf, Clary Sage, Lemon, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Ylang Ylang and Jasmine essential oils is heaven in a bottle! Lemon is on the forefront of this essential oil. I also detect Clary Sage which I am new to, but can recognize it. I am loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a great gift idea - for  pennies: Birthday Bath Salts - Mix 1 cup each of Epsom Salt and baking soda and 20-30 drops of Scential Health Joy. Use 1/4 cup per bath. Put into a cute container or mason jar. Wrap with a ribbon or raffia bow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scential Joy can be worn as a perfume. I have a pretty glass spray bottle for my purse. So much healthier than a perfume loaded with chemicals and alcohol!  This essential oil is 100% Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils and contains No Fillers, Additives, Bases Or Additive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HealthBizDirect, Inc. continues to offer an amazing product for a competitive price.

            <li> These are the best essential oils.  There are so many ways to utilize it.  I had no idea that spiders did not like the smell of peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense essential oil has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits to the skin, making it ideal for acne-prone skin. It is also a natural toner, decreasing the appearance of pores and evening skin-tone. It is cytophylactic, which means that it helps protect existing cells and encourage new cell growth. For this reason, it helps reduce wrinkles, tighten skin, and reduce the appearance of scars. It also helps soothe chapped, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love the scent of this oil! The blend is just perfect and smells wonderful. This is definitely going to be a new favorite of mine. The scent is so fun and uplifting! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Delightful and reasonable</li>
            <li> Now this is a real hit here. It is uplifting, calming and just enjoyable in the diffuser. I had to buy more and wish they had a larger quantity. Try this and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought several of their oils and do not like their formulated products.  They smell like bug spray.  I was not the only person who said this.  I&#x27;m selling my house and was asked not to run &amp;#34;that chemical smelling stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Fairly pleasant scent here but takes a lot to really smell this. This is the second scent I bought from Scential Health and all though both were pleasant they were not strong enough for me. So instead of using 4 drops I would have to use 6 to get enough scent in the room with my diffuser so not really a value because you get a bigger bottle for the same price. Not bad but liked other brand oils better then the ones I bought from Scential Health.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Joy essential oil from Scential Health. It is a blend of multiple scents that, as a beginning, I am not totally certain if I can identify all of them. To me, I can definitely smell lavender and citrus, like lemon. That may seem like a strange combination but when I put a few drops in my diffuser my house fills will a pleasant aroma that calms me and makes me happy. At night before bed I have even dabbed a little under my nostrils, allowing me to have a restful sleep as I breathe it in through the night. It is a wonderful scent and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a discount for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Scential seems to know exactly what we need to calm ourselves and enjoy our lives more.  This is what I found in the Joy Essential Oil. First I love the smell, but also I love the calming effect that it brings into the room. Life can be so hectic, and any small help we can get to bring us peace, we should take it. I feel that is what this Oil Blend does, calms you down and helps you to enjoy life once more. I&#x27;m very happy to receive this product for a honest review because it truly did help me to relax.</li>
