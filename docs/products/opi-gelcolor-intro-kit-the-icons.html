            <li>Grateful the seller was able to accommodate a return.</li>
            <li>I bought my own set &amp; UV  light.</li>

            <li>Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I brush on cuticle oil to my nail beds at this point, just to keep them healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to file the gel polish off acrylic nails, or have the salon do it for you (you&#x27;d need to wear a mask, since you don&#x27;t want to breathe in acrylic powder.)</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I sprang for the OPI and not a cheaper version.</li>
            <li>The kit contained so many goodies that I needed to create my nails.</li>
            <li>I Love it all.</li>

            <li>And unlike most Gel Nail starter kits, this also included the tools needed to remove the gel manicure, as well as - you guessed it - instructions how!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you already know that you are getting top quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;OPI&#x27;s products are top quality, that&#x27;s why I chose this kit.</li>
            <li>Awesome starting kit, I love all the colors.</li>

            <li>It is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and if you have to fix a nail because it chipped or lifted, it&#x27;s quick and easy to redo.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Trust me, this kit is worth EVERY penny!</li>

            <li>They are some of the most popular and this is an entire kit that provided her with everything she needs for at home shellac!</li>
            <li>then he started to chat me and said we will full refund you</li>

            <li>want to add that when I wanted to stop to look for these products in accordance with adequate criteria for me, helped me to this seller at amazon.com employee during the chat.</li>
            <li>BondAid removes the natural oil from your nail for better adhesion.</li>
            <li>Nice for starting out.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of times to get this right.  </li>
            <li>This kit includes a fabulous classic collection of colors.</li>
            <li>My husband told me the people we purchased our product from claimed the box had been opened, so they would be including a \\&quot;few\\&quot; extras--and I received six OPI files, which are just amazing, an extra bottle of Top Coat, and extra box of ExpertTouch removal wraps.</li>
            <li>However Opi colors are so rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Other than that I received it very quickly and am satisfied.</li>
            <li>The first time I did it.only lasted 5 days.</li>
            <li>I did not contact them first.</li>
            <li>I know I will come back to them for more.</li>
            <li>I actually use two coats for better wear.</li>
            <li>This dries instantly, and while this product is pretty smelly, it works better than any on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just got myself my first manicure</li>
            <li>Great colors, quality polish, long lasting!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!Dark - super deep plum, opaque, nearly black (this works great for reverse French tips)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gelish hardens better and doesn&#x27;t shrink back from the tip as much.</li>
            <li>Really took a lot of time, over an hour.</li>
            <li>but I really wish NAS99 was included.</li>
            <li>You may want to buff lightly, but it really isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the colors.  </li>
            <li>I just liked the pink which was awesome, the red was mediocre, will just use it on my friends.</li>
            <li>I am more of fan of the pink family.</li>
            <li>You really need a buffer to get the no-chip to stick as well as alcohol pads.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all of you, both the seller and amazon.com employees.</li>
            <li>This Gel polish is amazing-lasts 2-3 weeks depending on how fast your nails grow.</li>
            <li>Overall she loves it, she was especially fond of the top coat / bottom coat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Compared to other products on the market, here&#x27;s my detailed review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After Dark - super deep plum, opaque, nearly black (this works great for reverse French tips)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other brands before this one, so I already own a light, and was anxious to try OPI.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow directions exactly, including applying thin coats of the gel color.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that as the final step in curing your nails you take a cottonball with the acetone polish remover and wipe down your nails.  </li>
            <li>One vital item not in this kit is the after manicure wipe that gets rid of the tackiness.</li>
            <li>Use the included cuticle stick to gentle push back the cuticles from your nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>PRODUCT HAVE BEEN SENT MUCH EARLIER(even a week or two earlier)</li>
            <li>They chip or peel after a few days while my CND shellac nails last two weeks using the same light and technique.</li>
            <li>we did the first time and the polish peeled off after a few days.  </li>

            <li> This Gel polish is amazing-lasts 2-3 weeks depending on how fast your nails grow.</li>
            <li> Overall she loves it, she was especially fond of the top coat / bottom coat.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This kit provides almost everything you need to start doing your own gel nails.  You still need to get a UV or LED lamp to dry your nails with.  The five nail colors they provide you with are an Ok selection.  The kit comes with a CD I presume to show you how to do your nails but I did not view it. The little booklet with instructions is all I used.  Make sure that as the final step in curing your nails you take a cottonball with the acetone polish remover and wipe down your nails.  This is the final curing step, otherwise you will think your nails have not cured.</li>
            <li> Got this because I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying alot of money for gel manicures. One vital item not in this kit is the after manicure wipe that gets rid of the tackiness. From reading other reviews I found rubbing alcohol does the trick. Have to really be careful to apply thin coats.It also runs easily and need to use cuticle stick to clean edges. The first time I did it.only lasted 5 days. The second went a week. Same result I got from the salon. The big problem is removing it. Really took a lot of time, over an hour.I had to do alot of filing, buffing and still not a smooth surface. Same result at the salon but I took my time. I got this Opi version since it was supposed to be easier to remove, it&#x27;s not. From other searches I did I might try the Gelish products.</li>
            <li> Its nice to have everything to get started with but I did not care for these colors. Also, my opi nails never last as long as other brands. It could be the light. So I am not exactly sure. They chip or peel after a few days while my CND shellac nails last two weeks using the same light and technique.</li>
            <li> I love OPI and now I&#x27;ve fallen in love with their Gel Polish as well.  Look forward to wearing many more colors.</li>
            <li> I gave them a bad review because one item was broken and part of the order was missing. I did not contact them first. Not only did they replace the broken product they doubled it. I received everything within 2 days.Ignore the bad review and shop with this company. I know I will come back to them for more. They are the Best!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked this product because the majority of colors were ones that appealed to me. I love OPI products, glad they have a good selection of gel colors.</li>
            <li> A bottle was broken when it arrived to my house. Nail Polish was everywhere. Other than that I received it very quickly and am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Researched shellac/gel nail polishes for weeks and was excited to find this intro kit. Sadly the polishes didn&#x27;t last longer than 2 days vs 2 weeks with my previous shellac/gel nail systems. Grateful the seller was able to accommodate a return.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife for Christmas. Overall she loves it, she was especially fond of the top coat / bottom coat.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and nice colours.&lt;br /&gt;Got everything I needed to do my nails but I really wish NAS99 was included.</li>
            <li> On my nails &amp; the color lasted for 2 weeks!  I&#x27;m hooked! I bought my own set &amp; UV  light. Very excited about this product!!</li>
            <li> I received this kit for Christmas from my kids, and I could not be happier. This kit includes everything you need to get started with at-home gel manicures (except the LED light, which you will need to purchase separately). I&#x27;ve used several other brands before this one, so I already own a light, and was anxious to try OPI. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using thin coats is best--and whatever you do, don&#x27;t apply the apply the polish in direct sunlight, since the UV rays from the sun can and will set the polish, and ruin the brush and all the polish in your bottle. Compared to other products on the market, here&#x27;s my detailed review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Remove all other polish, and file your nails. You may want to buff lightly, but it really isn&#x27;t necessary. My husband told me the people we purchased our product from claimed the box had been opened, so they would be including a \\&quot;few\\&quot; extras--and I received six OPI files, which are just amazing, an extra bottle of Top Coat, and extra box of ExpertTouch removal wraps. I can&#x27;t tell if anything has been used, either. Use the included cuticle stick to gentle push back the cuticles from your nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) BondAid removes the natural oil from your nail for better adhesion. I actually use two coats for better wear. This dries instantly, and while this product is pretty smelly, it works better than any on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Base Coat. This product is pretty thin, and using two thin coats can give you better adhesion, if you aren&#x27;t getting the wear you want from your gels, I find, or if your nails are \\&quot;ridgy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Color. This kit includes a fabulous classic collection of colors. I&#x27;ll describe them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny Bunny - a sheer white&lt;br /&gt;Passion - neutral, skin tone (use it with Funny Bunny for a great, easy French manicure)&lt;br /&gt;Strawberry Margarita - perfect opaque Barbie pink&lt;br /&gt;Cajun Shrimp - summery coral&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Not Really a Waitress - the one shimmery deep red shade&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Park After Dark - super deep plum, opaque, nearly black (this works great for reverse French tips)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best idea is to apply 2-3 very thin coats, using a cuticle stick to clean up the edges before curing. Some of the darker shades tend to shrink a little while being set. Cure each hand after being done, so you don&#x27;t run the risk of running or bubbling. Also, capping the nail (at the tip) will help shrinkage. It still takes me a little practice. I find lighter colors to be more forgiving than darker ones, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Top Coat. Apply a thin coat to all fingers and cure a final time. Don&#x27;t skip this step, since this will add that final touch of super-high gloss and extra wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Removing tacky layer. Using rubbing alcohol (or even included polish remover!), I use a cotton pad to quickly wipe over the top of each nail to remove the sticky layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah. I forgot two things that I do, which unfortunately aren&#x27;t included in the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Cuticle treatment. I brush on cuticle oil to my nail beds at this point, just to keep them healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Hand lotion. I finish my own gel manicures with hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal requires wrapping the little removal foils, which have been soaked in polish remover, around each nail, and letting them sit for 5-10 minutes. The gel will turn to jelly, and remove easily. Keep in mind: If you are wearing gel polish over acrylic nails, that acetone will also turn your acrylics into jelly. It&#x27;s better to file the gel polish off acrylic nails, or have the salon do it for you (you&#x27;d need to wear a mask, since you don&#x27;t want to breathe in acrylic powder.) However--I have to say, I never thought I&#x27;d use those acrylic removal foils, but they are awfully convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since ordered several other sets of polish.

            <li> Thank you for this great kit. It has everything to start to do my nails. Use this for several month every two weeks and very happy. Price is really good in comperison with others. Thank you guys!</li>
            <li> The kit is nice and gives you a nice assortment for colors. I ordered this from VIPolish and it took 4 weeks to receive it. So it was late for Christmas. Otherwise I liked it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift.  She absolutely loves the colors.  They are some of the most popular and this is an entire kit that provided her with everything she needs for at home shellac!</li>
            <li> I invited this item to israel, and he sent it into australia i tried to chat him about where the item is, no communicate, when i found out it was sent to australia then he started to chat me and said we will full refund you, i asked if i can atleast get compensation for that , he ignored me and didnt answered again, i recommend not to buy from him.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for this kit and I&#x27;m so glad that I sprang for the OPI and not a cheaper version. The polish colors are really nice and the gel manicure comes out and lasts just like what you get at the salon.  One warning, don&#x27;t put on too thick a coat - we did the first time and the polish peeled off after a few days.  This was our fault and since using thinner coats, we haven&#x27;t had an issue.</li>
            <li> Good variety of colors or polish.  The kit contained so many goodies that I needed to create my nails. I Love it all.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Just got myself my first manicure and I love it! I like the colors very much; unfortunately,  one of the bottles was broken when I received the package,  but instead of returning it I cleaned and kept it.</li>
            <li> I bought as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it! The kit was in sale for Christmas so couldn&#x27;t pass up the offer</li>
            <li> A excellent product to use. This set is very easy to use now I just need to purchase more color options</li>
            <li> I just liked the pink which was awesome, the red was mediocre, will just use it on my friends. I am more of fan of the pink family. However Opi colors are so rich and vibrant. They already made me a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Nice for starting out.  Only con is the colors are too similar. Would like to have had a better selection</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and saves me from going in to get a manicure every 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had great customer service experience, one of the colors broke in transit, emailed them and they sent a new one immediately.</li>
            <li> This is a great beginner kit; all you need are lint-free wipes, rubbing alcohol and the light. Unfortunately, after having used this kit for a year and a half now, I know I prefer Gelish to OPI for overall results. Gelish hardens better and doesn&#x27;t shrink back from the tip as much. Still, this is a good kit and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love this nail kit!  It&#x27;s all you need for professional nails minus a buffer.  You really need a buffer to get the no-chip to stick as well as alcohol pads.  But the products that came in the kit were great!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very happy and very, very thankful to this is a seller. Because I&#x27;m a great need for these products, and such price our country, which I could not pay(I could not pay the amount to our country). It was the only sellers who had such price and sending to my country. FOR ME IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. PRODUCT HAVE BEEN SENT MUCH EARLIER(even a week or two earlier) and it was in excellent condition!&lt;br /&gt;I want to add that when I wanted to stop to look for these products in accordance with adequate criteria for me, helped me to this seller at amazon.com employee during the chat. Sorry, I do not remember the name. Thanks to all of you, both the seller and amazon.com employees. Be blessed!)</li>
            <li> This kit has all that you need to do your own gel nails at home!  It is quick and easy to use.  Be sure to follow directions exactly, including applying thin coats of the gel color.  Too much gel color makes the tips really think and can lead to the color peeling/lifting unnecessarily.  It took me a couple of times to get this right.  The best part is how quick the polish cures and if you have to fix a nail because it chipped or lifted, it&#x27;s quick and easy to redo.</li>
            <li> Great colors, quality polish, long lasting! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Everything was in the box and just as described. The products are great and exactly what I was looking for to use with my Royal Nails Professional UV Light. One of the bottles of fingernail polish broke inside the box and I took pictures and sent it to them and they replaced the bottle free of charge to me. Thanks for the great service!</li>
            <li> Hey Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Dee in NY and I am gleefully giving this product 5 stars! First of all, the product arrived very quickly! I ordered it on a Wednesday and it was delivered the following Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to admit that I was skeptical as I had read on some previous reviews that occassionally bottles were broken during shipping, but the seller seems to have read the comments and addressed the issue because everything arrived in PERFECT pristine condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the instructions - I have never seen such detailed instructions, it&#x27;s amazing! But also, for the quick tutorial and to just get started, they included a one page, laminated instruction card! And unlike most Gel Nail starter kits, this also included the tools needed to remove the gel manicure, as well as - you guessed it - instructions how!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, this kit is worth EVERY penny! And it&#x27;s OPI so you already know that you are getting top quality polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this along with the 54W Royal UV Nail Lamp - which is an entire book of glory in and of itself! It comes with a fan and five different settings and is literally 1) Plug  2) Press and 3) Set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this kit, and get the lamp ladies (and fabulous gents)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> All items were received in good shape! I gave away the colors that were not to my taste... Arrived as promised</li>
            <li> This kit is great!  It has everything you need to do your own gel manicure at home.&lt;br /&gt;OPI&#x27;s products are top quality, that&#x27;s why I chose this kit. I would highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;to anyone who enjoys doing their own nails like I do.</li>
            <li> Awesome starting kit, I love all the colors. Can&#x27;t beat the price I would def recommend this kit. Well worth it</li>
            <li> This Gel polish is amazing-lasts 2-3 weeks depending on how fast your nails grow. No chips no nothing. Awesome product!</li>
