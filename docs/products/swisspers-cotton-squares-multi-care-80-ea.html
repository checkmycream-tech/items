            <li>/&gt;Shipping was great they got here really fast!!</li>
            <li>I use them with rose petal moisturizer for a lovely feel.</li>
            <li>These are nice for many things.</li>
            <li>Excellent price and so soft while still strong.  </li>
            <li>I thought 80 squares were more than 80 squares.  </li>
            <li>Bought two packages of these and love them.  </li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I got those cotton squares as part of a gift for a friend and love them.</li>
            <li>My mother uses them for makeup removal as well :)</li>
            <li>What is there to say :-)</li>
            <li>i use this most days.</li>
            <li>I like cotton balls better, but they work fine.  </li>
            <li>only thing I liked about this purchase was that Prime free shipping was available, because that&#x27;s uncommon for products under $5</li>
            <li>Easy to use and carry along.  </li>
            <li>They fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>And they don&#x27;t fall apart as easy as some cotton rounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i used this before, just bought it online because it was easy</li>
            <li>These cotton squares are strong and absorbent.</li>
            <li>It would probably be fine if you cut it instead of trying to tear it.</li>
            <li>They work fine for removing nail polish, which is what I bought them for, but I&#x27;d rather have cotton balls.</li>
            <li>I thought this was the huge pack</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re strong and up to any mild use.  </li>
            <li>My nails so clean you can see yourself in them.  </li>
            <li>I also use themn to clean keyboards and cameras.</li>
            <li>My husband uses them to clean gun parts.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s overpriced and nothing special.</li>
            <li>I used twice as many of these that what I&#x27;m used to - the material soaks up my liquids so much so that the pad basically falls apart before it is used ...</li>
            <li>it is surprising they are not more popular.</li>
            <li>The cotton can wear away quickly when rubbing the square on one&#x27;s body (it wears away faster than cotton balls).</li>
            <li>first aid clean up.</li>
            <li>I cannot see what application this would be good for, avoid getting them wet because you will have cotton bits all over your fingers.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I got some gel eye make up remover that doesn&#x27;t soak into the squares right for application.</li>
            <li>There your basic cotton squares but more durable and don&#x27;t tear.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Fine product but not enough in the package to make this purchase worth it.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly what it says it is, they are quality cotton squares they hold up really well.</li>
            <li>I mainly use these pads with witch hazel to cleanse my face and have never had a problem giving a good scrub with the round pads...</li>
            <li>Expected more for this price.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that it would be much</li>
            <li>And I really wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really doubt they&#x27;ll hold together through much.</li>
            <li>Which means I&#x27;m not using as much remover as well.</li>
            <li>These seem to fluff and fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>very soft.  </li>
            <li>There are ok but small.  </li>
            <li>I love these because unlike a lot of cotton pads, they don&#x27;t shed all over your skin wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Like many other cotton squares, these were full of hard pieces of ?</li>
            <li>(Wow I&#x27;m a rocket scientist huh?)</li>
            <li>These really don&#x27;t beat traditional cotton balls.</li>
            <li>I had never tried this brand before, but ordered it off Amazon, and was really pleasantly surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li>It ripped apart so easily that at first I thought I was using them wrong</li>
            <li>i mean, they&#x27;re bits of cotton, and a bit pricy for that, but they work fine.</li>
            <li>no regrets, i guess, i&#x27;d do it again, but i won&#x27;t have to for quite a while.</li>
            <li>They also leave little pieces of cotton all over your face, which is obviously very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> These things are quite good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;However, it leaves behind little bits of cotton on my face whenever I&#x27;m not PERFECTLY clean shaven.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They might be okay for little things, like nail polish or eye makeup removing, but they&#x27;re so weak</li>
            <li> i think the squares are 2&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34; or so, and the package is smaller than i expected, but will last me a while, so i probably didn&#x27;t need a bigger package.</li>
            <li> These have been around a long time.  </li>
            <li> But as long as the pads are 100% cotton they are recommended.</li>
            <li> I will not order these again for use as polish remover or toner application - they should be reserved for applying make-up in limited need</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that it frays if you try and tear it into a smaller piece.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to remove makeup but found they were really rough for under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Too rough.  </li>
            <li> Yes, even for such a small dollar amount.</li>
            <li> Besides, for the number of squares in the pack, it is not worth it given the quality.</li>
            <li> But it works to take the make-up off, but not super for cleansing the face.</li>
            <li> I normally use the cotton rounds but ordered these when I was unable to get out to the store.</li>
            <li> A little thinner than I would like.</li>
            <li> I thought they were cotten balls, but they&#x27;re little padded squares.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> They do what they are meant to do, but I have found that little pieces of cotton fall off after a couple seconds, causing me to search for the pieces after applying toner to my face!</li>
            <li> These cotton squares are a waste of your hard earned dollars.</li>
            <li> Well this bag is small.</li>
            <li> In fact, so small, that had I seen it in person, I would have not purchased it for the three dollars it cost.</li>
            <li> I guess, if you are too lazy to walk out of your house and prefer things to be ship-ped to your door, this may be a solution.</li>
            <li> i can get polish off of all of my fingernails with 1 square, maybe 2 if i get sick of finding new surfaces and folding, and i&#x27;d say these are a little easier in that sense than cotton balls.</li>
            <li> so, I opened them to review their quality at least, for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think they are a little too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Paper thin and falls apart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> I hate the ones you have to rip apart.</li>
            <li> Annoying!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these to remove makeup but found they were really rough for under the eyes.  I threw them out, would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> These have been around a long time.  I like the product but I think they are a little too expensive.  That&#x27;s why I gave four stars instead of five.  I thought 80 squares were more than 80 squares.  (Wow I&#x27;m a rocket scientist huh?)</li>
            <li> I thought this was the huge pack but it&#x27;s only the size of a piece of bread. My bad. Expected more for this price. Off to Walmart.</li>
            <li> My nails so clean you can see yourself in them.  Not even a scrap of nail polish left. XD !</li>
            <li> Easier to use than cotton balls, these cotton squares seem to work well removing nail polish and make-up. I also use themn to clean keyboards and cameras.</li>
            <li> Bought two packages of these and love them.  They&#x27;re strong and up to any mild use.  I would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Happy Customer</li>
            <li> Love these.  Excellent price and so soft while still strong.  Perfect for make up removal and first aid clean up.</li>
            <li> Well this bag is small. In fact, so small, that had I seen it in person, I would have not purchased it for the three dollars it cost. Yes, even for such a small dollar amount. I will use these to remove nail polish, but I needed these for a nifty halloween trick I was plotting this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I opened them to review their quality at least, for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People: go to CVS, go to Walgreens, make the trip. These seem to fluff and fall apart easily. Sigh.</li>
            <li> They do what they are meant to do, but I have found that little pieces of cotton fall off after a couple seconds, causing me to search for the pieces after applying toner to my face!</li>
            <li> I got those cotton squares as part of a gift for a friend and love them. Very good value given it is an add-on item.</li>
            <li> I normally use the cotton rounds but ordered these when I was unable to get out to the store. I mainly use these pads with witch hazel to cleanse my face and have never had a problem giving a good scrub with the round pads...these however fall apart almost instantly. I cannot see what application this would be good for, avoid getting them wet because you will have cotton bits all over your fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would be much bigger.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s my fault that I didn&#x27;t read the count correctly.&lt;br /&gt;It is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> A little thinner than I would like.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for the price.  Easy to use and carry along.  The only negative thing is that it frays if you try and tear it into a smaller piece.  It would probably be fine if you cut it instead of trying to tear it.</li>
            <li> Like many other cotton squares, these were full of hard pieces of ? I don&#x27;t know what.  Cotton seeds?  Stems?  Too rough.  Had to throw away.</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t beat traditional cotton balls. All of the material will end up all over whatever it is you&#x27;re trying to use it for.</li>
            <li> I like cotton balls better, but they work fine.  I got some gel eye make up remover that doesn&#x27;t soak into the squares right for application.</li>
            <li> These just the regular cotton balls that you can buy in any store for a dollar. For ONE DOLLAR. I guess, if you are too lazy to walk out of your house and prefer things to be ship-ped to your door, this may be a solution. Otherwise, it&#x27;s overpriced and nothing special.</li>
            <li> These cotton squares are a waste of your hard earned dollars. They fall apart easily. I would never buy them again and can not recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> i mean, they&#x27;re bits of cotton, and a bit pricy for that, but they work fine. i can get polish off of all of my fingernails with 1 square, maybe 2 if i get sick of finding new surfaces and folding, and i&#x27;d say these are a little easier in that sense than cotton balls. i think the squares are 2&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34; or so, and the package is smaller than i expected, but will last me a while, so i probably didn&#x27;t need a bigger package. no regrets, i guess, i&#x27;d do it again, but i won&#x27;t have to for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I used twice as many of these that what I&#x27;m used to - the material soaks up my liquids so much so that the pad basically falls apart before it is used ... I will not order these again for use as polish remover or toner application - they should be reserved for applying make-up in limited need</li>
            <li> These are good quality.  I also like the fact that they are separated.  I hate the ones you have to rip apart.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Paper thin and falls apart. Besides, for the number of squares in the pack, it is not worth it given the quality.</li>
            <li> These things are quite good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;However, it leaves behind little bits of cotton on my face whenever I&#x27;m not PERFECTLY clean shaven. Which is all the time. Annoying!</li>
            <li> I use toner on my face nightly and I ordered this specifically for that purpose... And I really wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 swipes across my face, the square started totally falling apart. It ripped apart so easily that at first I thought I was using them wrong and they&#x27;re SUPPOSED to come apart (they&#x27;re not). They also leave little pieces of cotton all over your face, which is obviously very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They might be okay for little things, like nail polish or eye makeup removing, but they&#x27;re so weak I really doubt they&#x27;ll hold together through much. I would definitely not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked about this purchase was that Prime free shipping was available, because that&#x27;s uncommon for products under $5</li>
            <li> These cotton squares are strong and absorbent. I use them with rose petal moisturizer for a lovely feel. My mother uses them for makeup removal as well :)</li>
            <li> Fine product but not enough in the package to make this purchase worth it.  Will not buy this quantity again</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used cotton balls, the toner or whatever just gets lost in the ball somewhere.  These pads hold a lot of liquid, and it stays where you put it, and goes on the skin like it should.</li>
            <li> There your basic cotton squares but more durable and don&#x27;t tear. They can be used to take eye make-up off as well as cleansing but it doesn&#x27;t do the job for cleansing only.  But it works to take the make-up off, but not super for cleansing the face.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what it says it is, they are quality cotton squares they hold up really well. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Come big enough to use for toner and it is sturdy enough to do the job. Simple &amp; basic part of beauty regimen</li>
            <li> What is there to say :-) These are nice for many things. I use them for applying my face astringent. My daughter uses them for nail polish remover. My husband uses them to clean gun parts. Many uses and a good price.</li>
            <li> I love these because unlike a lot of cotton pads, they don&#x27;t shed all over your skin wet or dry. Definitely would order them again!</li>
            <li> I love these! I got a free sample with my bag of cotton balls and now I&#x27;m never going to use cotton balls again!!! It only takes 1 square to remove polish from all 10 nails! (except with glitter then I use like 2 maybe 3) Which means I&#x27;m not using as much remover as well. Definite money saver! And they don&#x27;t fall apart as easy as some cotton rounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great they got here really fast!!</li>
            <li> i use this most days. and i used this before, just bought it online because it was easy and i have prime. thanks!</li>
            <li> There are ok but small.  I prefer the larger quilted cotton rounds.  But as long as the pads are 100% cotton they are recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girlfriend, could not be happier with the value of this buy. These are so much better then cotton balls!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I would purchase this again.  You cannot rave about cotton squares.  You either like them or you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought these by mistake.  I thought they were cotten balls, but they&#x27;re little padded squares.  They work fine for removing nail polish, which is what I bought them for, but I&#x27;d rather have cotton balls.</li>
            <li> These are great for toner and for washing children&#x27;s faces.  Simple, and it is surprising they are not more popular.</li>
            <li> The cotton can wear away quickly when rubbing the square on one&#x27;s body (it wears away faster than cotton balls). Other than that it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this brand before, but ordered it off Amazon, and was really pleasantly surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li> very soft.  Great price.like the re-sealable bag, great for traveling. would purchase again and recommend to everyone I know.  Keep carrying</li>
