            <li>but besides that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best quality hair</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>The hair is really good</li>
            <li>I Love these extensions!</li>
            <li>I liked it for MY type of hair.</li>
            <li>It also falls out very easily.</li>
            <li>The hair was soft and the colour was perfect (no. 2).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought $100+ exstensions &amp; these are a good fit.</li>
            <li>Easy to style and hold the curl all day!</li>
            <li>I know most people wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with this hair</li>
            <li>but most people have better hair than I do, soooo</li>
            <li>I think they are priced appropriately .</li>
            <li>They took the color pretty good.</li>
            <li>ALL extensions have some that are more fine than others.</li>
            <li>I have biracial hair &amp; they work fine for my hair</li>
            <li>but if I have some of it pulled back it looks great.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I was expecting more hair but ather than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>well I just probably won&#x27;t be able to add much heat to them.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;d and clips broke quickly</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what helps give a more natural look.</li>
            <li>you just have to style them right.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine because I love these now and am not buying any other brand after these.</li>
            <li>But it was definitely virgin hair because was able to dye them.</li>
            <li>My real hair is soft but not silky and fine.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t happy about was the fact that I ordered a #2 dark brown and for anyone that knows hair color..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not that straight hair</li>
            <li>I really like the hair.</li>
            <li>and these extensions are really good quality for the price, my hair is thin</li>
            <li>I used professional color.</li>
            <li>so I could get as much pieces as possible..</li>
            <li>and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft too</li>
            <li>wish it had more hair since i have thick hair</li>
            <li>I really like the hair and it flat irons just fine.&lt;br /&gt;People</li>
            <li>So I would only suggest this product to people who have thin hair that isn&#x27;t exactly super fine.</li>
            <li>They are a little bit reddish but you can&#x27;t really notice unless you look at it close enough.</li>

            <li> I have long hair but purchased these for a different look!</li>
            <li> However I have found a few gray and blue hairs in them.</li>
            <li> Quality as expected.</li>
            <li> so it gives them the thickness it needs unlike other extensions you find on amazon.</li>
            <li> Clips were thin, need two bigger clips.</li>
            <li> But my hair is so thin I only need six of the clips.</li>
            <li> They look bad when I wear my hair straight down</li>
            <li> They do shed a little, and its hard for the clips not to show through thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick &amp; I had no problems.</li>
            <li> not happy with the hair too thin, just not happy with the hair will not buy again</li>
            <li> and these are by far the worst I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The hair is thin , which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because I have VERY thin hair</li>
            <li> So disappointed :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these based on price and reviews. I really like the hair and it flat irons just fine.&lt;br /&gt;People...this is not a wig. ALL extensions have some that are more fine than others. That&#x27;s what helps give a more natural look. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t happy about was the fact that I ordered a #2 dark brown and for anyone that knows hair color..its was about a #4. I had to color them to match. They took the color pretty good. I used professional color. So it kept it healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I like them a lot</li>
            <li> The hair was soft and the colour was perfect (no. 2).  I bought two packs so I could get as much pieces as possible..</li>
            <li> They do shed a little, and its hard for the clips not to show through thin hair. They look bad when I wear my hair straight down but if I have some of it pulled back it looks great. Doesn&#x27;t quite match my hair colour, but besides that they&#x27;re great! I get compliments every time I wear them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought $100+ exstensions &amp; these are a good fit. I have biracial hair &amp; they work fine for my hair you just have to style them right. My hair is thick &amp; I had no problems. They are a little bit reddish but you can&#x27;t really notice unless you look at it close enough. It took my straightener well I just probably won&#x27;t be able to add much heat to them.</li>
            <li> I Love these extensions! Easy to style and hold the curl all day! However I have found a few gray and blue hairs in them. But over all would buy again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that straight hair but it&#x27;s good. wish it had more hair since i have thick hair</li>
            <li> Clips were thin, need two bigger clips. But it was definitely virgin hair because was able to dye them. The color worked.</li>
            <li> The hair is really good and it looks natural. I also die it and didn&#x27;t have any problems. The only thing is that I was expecting more hair but ather than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d and clips broke quickly</li>
            <li> I have long hair but purchased these for a different look! They are so simple to clip, style and wear!</li>
            <li> I really like the hair. It&#x27;s not the best quality hair but you get what you pay for. The hair is thin , which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because I have VERY thin hair and I didn&#x27;t want extensions that would make my hair look unnatural. So if you have thicker hair I would suggest getting two sets. But my hair is so thin I only need six of the clips. The texture of the hair is not fine at all but neither is my real hair. My real hair is soft but not silky and fine. So I would only suggest this product to people who have thin hair that isn&#x27;t exactly super fine. I know most people wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with this hair but most people have better hair than I do, soooo yeah. I liked it for MY type of hair.</li>
            <li> Clips do not stay in my hair.. the color was way lighter than a #2. Ans the ends were garbage....</li>
            <li> not happy with the hair too thin, just not happy with the hair will not buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this brand before so I decided to ive been wearing extensions for 6 years almost and these extensions are really good quality for the price, my hair is thin so it gives them the thickness it needs unlike other extensions you find on amazon. They&#x27;re soft too they have a bit of a different texture but that&#x27;s fine because I love these now and am not buying any other brand after these.</li>
            <li> So disappointed :( the hair turned almost plastic when straightened. It also falls out very easily. I&#x27;ve with extensions for three years and these are by far the worst I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Quality as expected. Used it as a fuller between my hair and my longer extensions</li>
            <li> I think they are priced appropriately .</li>
