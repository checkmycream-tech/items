            <li>Great creamy but non-oily consistency.</li>
            <li>It has no scent, which is great, and it also doesn&#x27;t have those exfoliating microbeads, which I also like.</li>

            <li>I like this face wash; they did a good job on improving my skin.</li>
            <li>does good job</li>
            <li>and this one does the job nicely without drying my skin out.  </li>
            <li>THIS OLAY SENSITIVE FACE WASH  IS EXCELLENT  </li>
            <li>I works great &amp; makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I also have rosacea so the product I use is very important.  </li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m glad I went with this.</li>
            <li>I love this foaming face wash.  </li>
            <li>I have many issues with my face.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 26 Y.O.) and nothing seemed to work for more than a couple of weeks controlling breakouts.</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>wash most mornings and every night before bed.  </li>
            <li>I apply Neutrogena Acne Stress Control Gel Moisturizer - - LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>I LOVE this face wash.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see this cleanser for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years, ever since it was suggested to me by a dermatologist MD.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding that I need to take better care of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 4 years.</li>
            <li>The smell is nature as it doesn&#x27;t have strong perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for use in the morning though.</li>
            <li>It does everything that it says it will do, and makes my skin feel smooth without burning.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial wash.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and it is an amazing deal here if you lock into the subscribe and save price.  </li>
            <li>Oil free is very important for skin that is oily and that truly needs a gentle touch.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this product from St. Ives Apricot Scrub because I wanted something more gentle.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li>It cleanses my face fully, removing all oil and dirt leaving it clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and most facial cleansers for oily skin leave the skin feeling ultra clean, dry and tight, the problem is that that effect makes things worse.&lt;br /&gt;So after doing some research I found Olay Sensitive foaming face wash, and it&#x27;s incredible, excellent product.</li>
            <li>Olay foaming face wash for sensitive skin is 100 % soap free and oil free as well as allergy and dermatologist tested.  </li>
            <li>Anyhoo, 5 months later and while I am not 100% clear, my skin is 90% clearer and I am happy with that after the battle I&#x27;ve had with pimples.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>Now, it doesn&#x27;t clean very well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry out my face and is fragrance free, but I think this product is better for those with senstitive skin, but are not acne prone.</li>
            <li>Many products say they are oil and soap free and then have a minimal amount of the ingredients when you read the label</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I imagine that this would be good for those who do because of the aforementioned lack of scent and drying effect.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable if you wait for the discount.</li>
            <li>I like that this face wash is very effective (takes off mascara and other makeup without a problem) and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gone are the deep hormonal bumps that plagued my chin and jawline - most bumps</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I used to love this facial wash.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY GENTLE,  DOES NOT OVER SUDS , RINSES CLEAN , LEAVES SKIN SOFT AND MOISTURIZED.  </li>
            <li>Foams up well, face feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>love it so much that I wish I had tried it earlier</li>
            <li>i also had dry skin in patches on my face and it made my skin smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li>as well - I feel that most foaming washes have the tendency to dry me out, whereas I can use this one twice a day without compromising moisture.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or need a clean and pure product I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I started using this cleanser about 5 months ago because of a suggestion from a mod on acne.org.</li>
            <li>i work at a fast food restarunt so my face gets really oily and breaks out</li>
            <li>It takes off my makeup and foams up very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really foam much.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this cleanser to everybody!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile, and really like it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much at all for it to do its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and unable to use soap, so I found this works wonderful on my type of skin.</li>
            <li>Initially, I used it either with my hands or a soft washcloth, but recently I&#x27;ve been using it with a Philips skin cleaner with good results.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through many different facial cleansers all promising what I wanted</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay Sensitive Foaming Face Wash for several years and don&#x27;t use anything else to wash my face as my skin is sensitive to most soaps and cleansers.  </li>
            <li>As I get older</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product in the pump bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>My wife has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This foaming face wash is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have mature skin that is sensitive to many otc lotions and creams; this product removes my makeup without making my face feel dried out afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin, I have to use special soap, detergent, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m older, so need something that is gentle enough but still cleans well.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this worked so much better than all the more expensive wash&#x27;s out there!</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED COUNTLESS BODY WASHES SOME VERY HIGH END,  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than my local drugstore even when on sale.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with adult acne for around 6-7 years</li>
            <li>I have been using this face wash for a couple of years now after trying product after product for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>it is not only gentle on the face, but also removes make up.</li>

            <li>are small and easily treated with a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin which is at the same time very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Shiseido&#x27;s daily face wash for oily skin and my sensitive skin takes it well</li>
            <li>Takes a little more water to wash off, but helped clear up my skin in a few days!</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin and minor skin problems, I&#x27;ve tried various products over the years, I was pleasantly surprised with this product especially because it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what was to blame: hormones, the face wash or the moisturizer, so I waited for my skin to clear up and tried the products one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since used the moisturizer with no more problems, but for the past two days I&#x27;ve used this face wash and now have a a red, burning rash all across my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive (very dry) skin</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really foaming, but it lathers up well with a little water.</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t really foaming, but it lathers up well with a little water.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin feeling really fresh without little tricks like menthol or other additives.</li>
            <li> It is also sensitive enough for me to wash twice a day which I need to do due the oiliness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> The lady on the message board (acne.org) gave the advice that if you want to clear your skin, the cleanser is NOT the step to use benzyl peroxide or salicylic acid because it&#x27;s literally washed away and down the sink.</li>
            <li> A moisturizer is definitely needed as well, but that may be due to the winter season and the harsh water where I live.  </li>
            <li> I usually do a lot of research before I buy a product especially with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> ; moderately-priced cleansers I&#x27;ve found, cleans well without drying, and lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out either, also</li>
            <li> I pat my face lightly to dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> A little harder to rinse off than a regular bar of soap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually really more painful than visible.</li>
            <li> this cleanser left the least amount on the skin that could potentially cause a breakout.    </li>
            <li> lasts a long time as it only needs a drop/one small pump.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not medicated so you can use whatever other medicated products you want together with it.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m a man that doesn&#x27;t use any type of makeup or product on my face other than aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I must be allergic, although I&#x27;ve never been allergic to any other cleanser or cosmetic product.</li>

            <li> I got pack of 2 for less than 4$.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a cleanser that isn&#x27;t too oily or too harsh.  </li>
            <li> but this cleanser doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in my eyes and for people usually in a rush</li>
            <li> I tried other brands with bad results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is difficult.  </li>

            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin, I have to use special soap, detergent, etc. I don&#x27;t have bad acne but breakout a lot with stress. This product is awesome! I usually do a lot of research before I buy a product especially with my sensitive skin, i&#x27;m glad I went with this. It isn&#x27;t really foaming, but it lathers up well with a little water. Takes a little more water to wash off, but helped clear up my skin in a few days! Doesn&#x27;t dry out either, also good price too with subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> I love this foaming face wash.  It does everything that it says it will do, and makes my skin feel smooth without burning.</li>
            <li> I have many issues with my face.  I have oily skin which is at the same time very sensitive.  I also have rosacea so the product I use is very important.  I have gone through many different facial cleansers all promising what I wanted/need but not following through.  Till this one. Olay foaming face wash for sensitive skin is 100 % soap free and oil free as well as allergy and dermatologist tested.  Oil free is very important for skin that is oily and that truly needs a gentle touch.  Many products say they are oil and soap free and then have a minimal amount of the ingredients when you read the label closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been a Godsend for me.  It cleanses my face fully, removing all oil and dirt leaving it clean and fresh.  It is also sensitive enough for me to wash twice a day which I need to do due the oiliness of my skin.  Now my rosacea is totally under control.  I highly recommend this product and it is an amazing deal here if you lock into the subscribe and save price.  Much cheaper than my local drugstore even when on sale.  If you have sensitive skin or need a clean and pure product I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is thee best cleanser for acne prone or oily skin types.     I started using this cleanser about 5 months ago because of a suggestion from a mod on acne.org. I&#x27;ve been dealing with adult acne for around 6-7 years (I&#x27;m 26 Y.O.) and nothing seemed to work for more than a couple of weeks controlling breakouts. I&#x27;ve tried everything from proactiv to clearasil to biore and nothing seemed to do the trick on my hormonal and painful acne until I tried the Olay foaming face wash.    The lady on the message board (acne.org) gave the advice that if you want to clear your skin, the cleanser is NOT the step to use benzyl peroxide or salicylic acid because it&#x27;s literally washed away and down the sink. (Your acne fighters should be used in the lotion.) She recommended the foaming face wash from Olay stating that of all the products she&#x27;s research (and believe you me she had research A LOT) this cleanser left the least amount on the skin that could potentially cause a breakout.    Anyhoo, 5 months later and while I am not 100% clear, my skin is 90% clearer and I am happy with that after the battle I&#x27;ve had with pimples. Gone are the deep hormonal bumps that plagued my chin and jawline - most bumps I get now are small and easily treated with a spot treatment. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product in the pump bottle. :)    My routine:  *I wash with this face wash most mornings and every night before bed.  *I pat my face lightly to dry my skin.  *I apply Neutrogena Acne Stress Control Gel Moisturizer - - LOVE THIS STUFF [...]  *I spot treat with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s spot treatment using a q-tip - -[...]    I hope this helps you!</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Sensitive Foaming Face Wash for several years and don&#x27;t use anything else to wash my face as my skin is sensitive to most soaps and cleansers.  It leaves my face feeling so clean and fresh and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> My wife has very sensitive skin so she can&#x27;t use bar soap in the shower.  This foaming face wash is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for a couple of years now after trying product after product for my sensitive skin. I was surprised that this worked so much better than all the more expensive wash&#x27;s out there! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin. No foam.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive (very dry) skin and it&#x27;s hard to find a cleanser that isn&#x27;t too oily or too harsh.  Maybe it&#x27;s psychological, but I like for my cleanser to suds up and this one does the job nicely without drying my skin out.  It works well and has no smell.  I use Oil of Olay body bar to bathe with and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for what it is I will order again and again and tell my best friends</li>
            <li> Like this product. Use it every day for face. Foams up well, face feels clean and soft.Recommend instead of soap.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great creamy but non-oily consistency. I have normal skin but this cleanser doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in my eyes and for people usually in a rush that&#x27;s worth its weight in gold. A little harder to rinse off than a regular bar of soap but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. Leaves the skin feeling really fresh without little tricks like menthol or other additives.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED COUNTLESS BODY WASHES SOME VERY HIGH END,  THIS OLAY SENSITIVE FACE WASH  IS EXCELLENT  FOR A ALTERNATIVE TO THE ACTUAL BODY WASHES.  IT IS VERY GENTLE,  DOES NOT OVER SUDS , RINSES CLEAN , LEAVES SKIN SOFT AND MOISTURIZED.  IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.</li>
            <li> this face wash is perfect! i work at a fast food restarunt so my face gets really oily and breaks out and this product cleared that up in days. i also had dry skin in patches on my face and it made my skin smooth and refreshed! for such a low price this product deffinetly works</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash. It has no scent, which is great, and it also doesn&#x27;t have those exfoliating microbeads, which I also like. I don&#x27;t know if I would agree that it is &amp;#34;foaming,&amp;#34; but I like that about it as well - I feel that most foaming washes have the tendency to dry me out, whereas I can use this one twice a day without compromising moisture. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I imagine that this would be good for those who do because of the aforementioned lack of scent and drying effect. Also, it&#x27;s not medicated so you can use whatever other medicated products you want together with it.</li>
            <li> love it so much that I wish I had tried it earlier</li>
            <li> I was happy to see this cleanser for a reasonable price.  I works great &amp; makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin my whole life and trying to find products that I can use that don&#x27;t make me break out or get a rash is difficult.  I like that this face wash is very effective (takes off mascara and other makeup without a problem) and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is just a basic face wash but that&#x27;s all anyone needs. It takes off my makeup and foams up very well. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  Best part is the price!</li>
            <li> I like this face wash; they did a good job on improving my skin. I noticed my skin become softer and less oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years, ever since it was suggested to me by a dermatologist MD. I have mature skin that is sensitive to many otc lotions and creams; this product removes my makeup without making my face feel dried out afterwards.  I always follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really foam much. It felt like I was washing my face with liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t it actually foam?&lt;br /&gt;Should it be drying? Should it feel slimy?&lt;br /&gt;Wow.</li>
            <li> Great face wash.  I have used this product and Neutrogena face wash and find that this product seems to produce a thicker foam and I feel fresher after using this soap.  That being said, I&#x27;m a man that doesn&#x27;t use any type of makeup or product on my face other than aftershave.  As I get older I&#x27;m finding that I need to take better care of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin and minor skin problems, I&#x27;ve tried various products over the years, I was pleasantly surprised with this product especially because it was inexpensive. A moisturizer is definitely needed as well, but that may be due to the winter season and the harsh water where I live.  I highly recommend this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I used to love this facial wash. Now, it doesn&#x27;t clean very well. Even when I use toner after cleansing my face with this, I break out. It&#x27;s fine for use in the morning though. It didn&#x27;t dry out my face and is fragrance free, but I think this product is better for those with senstitive skin, but are not acne prone. I switched to Shiseido&#x27;s daily face wash for oily skin and my sensitive skin takes it well and my acne is almost gone.</li>
            <li> been using for 20 years. does good job</li>
            <li> A cleanser is a cleanser, they are all the same...that&#x27;s what I used to think. I have oily skin, and most facial cleansers for oily skin leave the skin feeling ultra clean, dry and tight, the problem is that that effect makes things worse.&lt;br /&gt;So after doing some research I found Olay Sensitive foaming face wash, and it&#x27;s incredible, excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 4 years. A couple of times (because I couldn&#x27;t find it) I tried other brands with bad results.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cleanser to everybody!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and unable to use soap, so I found this works wonderful on my type of skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial wash. The smell is nature as it doesn&#x27;t have strong perfume. I hate perfume so this is the perfect product for me. Highly recommended. The price is very reasonable if you wait for the discount. I got pack of 2 for less than 4$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for several years, one of several Olay products I use on a regular basis.  It cleanses well and the pump is so convenient.  Highly recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile, and really like it. It&#x27;s the best of the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; moderately-priced cleansers I&#x27;ve found, cleans well without drying, and lasts quite a long time.  Initially, I used it either with my hands or a soft washcloth, but recently I&#x27;ve been using it with a Philips skin cleaner with good results.  You don&#x27;t need to use much at all for it to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m older, so need something that is gentle enough but still cleans well. This is it. I&#x27;ve had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product from St. Ives Apricot Scrub because I wanted something more gentle. I had  used it once before along with a new moisturizer but stopped after two days because my face broke out. I wasn&#x27;t sure what was to blame: hormones, the face wash or the moisturizer, so I waited for my skin to clear up and tried the products one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since used the moisturizer with no more problems, but for the past two days I&#x27;ve used this face wash and now have a a red, burning rash all across my cheeks. It&#x27;s actually really more painful than visible. So use with caution! Do a skin-test before using it on your face. I must be allergic, although I&#x27;ve never been allergic to any other cleanser or cosmetic product.</li>
            <li> it is not only gentle on the face, but also removes make up. lasts a long time as it only needs a drop/one small pump.</li>
