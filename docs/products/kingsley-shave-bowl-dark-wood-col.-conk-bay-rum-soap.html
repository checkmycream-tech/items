            <li>Wonderful soap--smells great!</li>
            <li>This works wonderfully!!!</li>
            <li>It was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift!</li>
            <li>Great price and quality product!</li>
            <li>We gave it as a gift, and he loved it!  </li>
            <li>Great soap, great bowl.</li>
            <li>Great smell and great lather.</li>
            <li>For what you get this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>The bowl is very nice quality, aesthetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li>This was a very nice purchase.  </li>
            <li>The shave soap provides a good lather and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a fair quality wood shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li>It does smell good if you like the scent of bay rum.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless,  everything is all good now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also made in China so that should give you a good idea about the quality you are purchasing.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I give it a good whisking to get it nice and</li>
            <li>Enjoy da shave!!</li>
            <li>I love using them!</li>
            <li>The kind we (our parents) used when traveling.  </li>
            <li>The wood shave bowl is nice</li>
            <li>When I switch, I&#x27;ll be keeping the bowl handy in case the mug doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>If I may suggest a great &amp; useful alternative...    </li>
            <li>The large soap sits nicely in the bowl and the soap lathers up very nicely.</li>
            <li>I also noticed, since I&#x27;m trying to return the item(s), that the shipping was more ($$) than the item.  </li>
            <li>The best thing to do is melt the soap into the bowl by putting it in the microwave for 10 to 5 second increments till it melts in but doesnt boil.</li>
            <li>That way you dont change its properties or cook off the fragrance, its better than smashing the puck in there or grating it like cheese or any of that.</li>
            <li>Taylor is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>Bowls is ok, the bay rum is a really nice rich scent and lather.</li>
            <li>Happy New Year to all!</li>
            <li>might be able to fit razor (disassembled?)</li>
            <li>The soap is OK, nothing special.</li>
            <li>My first shave was perhaps the most enjoyable shaving experience I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it with my belt-sander (&amp; a touch of stain) to make it fit</li>
            <li>It can also travel securely with you...</li>
            <li>For those of you who are wondering how to make the soap fit in the bowl, just stick it in and microwave until it melts and molds to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Enjoy...</li>
            <li>Initial impression:  nice looking, good size for a soap bowl, wife likes it, thinks it&#x27;s to pretty to use as a shave bowl.  </li>
            <li>The soap (which is great!) is too small in diameter</li>
            <li>It lathers up good and smells nice a little pricy.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am being too picky, but I like things in my shaving den to look and feel good as well as being functional, especially since you pick up your shaving bowl and hold it in your hand when loading a shaving brush.    </li>
            <li>Then let it cool and thats it</li>
            <li>So I open the microwave door and grab the wooden bowl and the perfectly shape soap</li>
            <li>First off, I really enjoy using the Col. Conk Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>Col. Conk does make a bigger 3\\&quot; bar that would fit better...    </li>
            <li>I was told by a couple individuals that the Double bladed safety razor gives a closer and more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Right now its a spare change bowl on the bedroom dresser.</li>
            <li>and when I unpacked it was craked right though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked being able to control how thick the lather is,</li>
            <li>The wooden bowl looks nice but isn&#x27;t really practical.  </li>
            <li>(pretty).  </li>
            <li>My first shaving soap, needs a shaving brush of course.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You need to melt soap first or lid</li>
            <li>The product was delivered ahead of schedule, and it is exactly like the discription.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li>You might think that because the shaving bowl &amp; soap are sold together that the soap would actually fit (properly) inside the bowl, right?  </li>
            <li>Too short for most pucks and not big enough to really work a good lather up in the bowl with a new puck.</li>
            <li>The wooden bowl that comes with it is a nice one, though, obviously not made for this particular size soap bar.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap, easy to find (locally), and come in a wide variety of colors/styles.  </li>
            <li>The bowl and soap are both classy looking and smelling, really what I was going for with the whole safety razor interest.</li>
            <li>It melts real quick so be careful!!!</li>
            <li>Got it to try something new.</li>
            <li>The bowl is just barely too big (1/4\\&quot;) to fit behind the mirror, which would be a nice option.  </li>
            <li>I got this kit.comes with exactly what you see in the picture: wood bowl, big soap,</li>
            <li>Seeing many reviews about people microwaving the soap, I copied them and did it in small increments.&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing, I did 5secs, no change.</li>
            <li>It has a deep, dark color, however, I wish it had been finish sanded better.</li>
            <li>i would reccomend this soap for anyone who is starting off with wet shaving, it does take a little bit longer and a bit of effort to build up a quality lather, but it is definately worth the wait, also the bowl is really nice, I put the soap in a different bowl and melted it in the microwave and then poured it into the kingsley shave bowl for storage.</li>

            <li> Buyer beware...(sic)  You might think that because the shaving bowl &amp; soap are sold together that the soap would actually fit (properly) inside the bowl, right?  Oh...I&#x27;m the only one?  The soap (which is great!) is too small in diameter so there&#x27;s a 1/2\\&quot; gap all the way around AND too thick, so the lid rests/sticks to the bar! Bummer.  Col. Conk does make a bigger 3\\&quot; bar that would fit better...    Once I became unhappy with the purchase (thus requiring my attention/focus), I became more critical...  The bowl is just barely too big (1/4\\&quot;) to fit behind the mirror, which would be a nice option.  I&#x27;m considering \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; it with my belt-sander (&amp; a touch of stain) to make it fit (pretty).  FYI-I also noticed, since I&#x27;m trying to return the item(s), that the shipping was more ($$) than the item.  That&#x27;s why the bowl may get a \\&quot;modification\\&quot;...and a bigger bar of soap.    If I may suggest a great &amp; useful alternative...    A plastic (Box Shell) bar soap travel case.  The kind we (our parents) used when traveling.  They&#x27;re cheap, easy to find (locally), and come in a wide variety of colors/styles.  Epoxy a big brass upholstery tack to the inside of the Bottom-half, so that any size bar stays put.  It fits behind the mirror or can sit (covered/closed) on the counter.   It can be used in the shower, with no worries.  The Top-half can be used for a \\&quot;mug\\&quot;, if desired/needed.    It can also travel securely with you...might be able to fit razor (disassembled?) and small brush into case, if small soap bar is attached off-center/near top of Bottom-half.  Just don&#x27;t make any sudden moves if some airport x-ray screener suddenly looks panicky/excited.    That&#x27;s the (engineering) result of my \\&quot;unhappy\\&quot; experience...    Hope this feedback/review helps in your research &amp; decision making.  Enjoy da shave!!</li>
            <li> This is a fair quality wood shaving bowl.  It has a deep, dark color, however, I wish it had been finish sanded better. I hate to buy a hand-made product and then have to refinish it to my liking.  Maybe I am being too picky, but I like things in my shaving den to look and feel good as well as being functional, especially since you pick up your shaving bowl and hold it in your hand when loading a shaving brush.    I have not yet used my Colonel Conk Bay Rum soap.  I&#x27;m still using up my bowl of Proraso green tub.  It does smell good if you like the scent of bay rum.    Happy New Year to all!</li>
            <li> Initial impression:  nice looking, good size for a soap bowl, wife likes it, thinks it&#x27;s to pretty to use as a shave bowl.  Has a few rough spots on the inside, nothing major.  Right now its a spare change bowl on the bedroom dresser.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap--smells great! The wood shave bowl is nice but I may switch to a deep dish mug or something when it&#x27;s time to replace the soap.  The bowl is a bit shallow.  I can&#x27;t knock the product though for something that may just be my preference. When I switch, I&#x27;ll be keeping the bowl handy in case the mug doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> A while back I decided I would change from a disposable 5-blade razor that left me needing another shave with 10 hours. I was told by a couple individuals that the Double bladed safety razor gives a closer and more comfortable shave. I purchased a Parker 22R razor, this Kingsley Shave Bowl + Col. Conk Bay Rum Soap Combo along with a Tweezerman Brush. I am very pleased with my purchase. My first shave was perhaps the most enjoyable shaving experience I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a close shave with little to no irritation!</li>
            <li> Great soap, great bowl. I love using them! The bowl and soap are both classy looking and smelling, really what I was going for with the whole safety razor interest. For those of you who are wondering how to make the soap fit in the bowl, just stick it in and microwave until it melts and molds to the bowl. This works wonderfully!!! Just keep an eye on it as it should take no more than 20-30 seconds. Enjoy...</li>
            <li> First off, I really enjoy using the Col. Conk Bay Rum. Great smell and great lather. The wooden bowl that comes with it is a nice one, though, obviously not made for this particular size soap bar. After several uses the lid does close securely enough.  For what you get this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I got this kit.comes with exactly what you see in the picture: wood bowl, big soap, small soap.&lt;br /&gt;I grabbed the big soap and put it in to the bowl. Seeing many reviews about people microwaving the soap, I copied them and did it in small increments.&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing, I did 5secs, no change. Another 5secs, no change. 10secs, no change. 15secs, no change. And I&#x27;m thinking WTF!? Ithought I was only supposed to do this for 5-10secs!? So I open the microwave door and grab the wooden bowl and the perfectly shape soap just plunges into liquid!!&lt;br /&gt;So... Lesson of this story is, try in 5sec increments and open the microwave and shake it a little or something of that nature... Or else it may look like nothing is happening...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless,  everything is all good now.&lt;br /&gt;I whip it up with my Badger whisker thingee and I am shaving away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is good. I give it a good whisking to get it nice and whipped.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is pretty shallow so the foam spills over quite a bit. I shave in the shower so that&#x27;s not an issue for me, but if I were to be shaving elsewhere, it might get a bit messy.</li>
            <li> My first shaving soap, needs a shaving brush of course.&lt;br /&gt;I liked being able to control how thick the lather is,</li>
            <li> The soap is OK, nothing special. It lathers up good and smells nice a little pricy. The wooden bowl looks nice but isn&#x27;t really practical.  Too short for most pucks and not big enough to really work a good lather up in the bowl with a new puck. I wouldn&#x27;t get it again. Got it to try something new.</li>
            <li> Bowls is ok, the bay rum is a really nice rich scent and lather. The best thing to do is melt the soap into the bowl by putting it in the microwave for 10 to 5 second increments till it melts in but doesnt boil. That way you dont change its properties or cook off the fragrance, its better than smashing the puck in there or grating it like cheese or any of that. It melts real quick so be careful!!! Then let it cool and thats it</li>
            <li> i would reccomend this soap for anyone who is starting off with wet shaving, it does take a little bit longer and a bit of effort to build up a quality lather, but it is definately worth the wait, also the bowl is really nice, I put the soap in a different bowl and melted it in the microwave and then poured it into the kingsley shave bowl for storage.</li>
            <li> I packed it in my bag for a trip to Italy and when I unpacked it was craked right though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money. Next time I will used a plastic container.</li>
            <li> Soap is slightly too big for container.  You need to melt soap first or lid won&#x27;t close.  It&#x27;s also made in China so that should give you a good idea about the quality you are purchasing.  If I knew that would never have ordered it.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered ahead of schedule, and it is exactly like the discription.</li>
            <li> The shave soap provides a good lather and has a pleasant scent.  The bowl is very nice quality, aesthetically pleasing.  My only complaint is that the soap is slightly too tall for the bowl.  If you put the lid on while the soap is wet, the lid sticks to the soap.  Not a major problem, just a minor annoyance.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get the TOBS.  This soap is difficult to lather, and does not provide the lubrication or protection of other soaps.  Taylor is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! It was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift! I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li> The large soap sits nicely in the bowl and the soap lathers up very nicely. The smell lingers for a little bit but doesn&#x27;t clash with my old spice aftershave.</li>
            <li> This was a very nice purchase.  We gave it as a gift, and he loved it!  Great price and quality product!</li>
