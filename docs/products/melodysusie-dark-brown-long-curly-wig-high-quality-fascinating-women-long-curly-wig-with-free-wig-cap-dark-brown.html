            <li>:P Still love it, though!</li>
            <li>It was cheap, looks beautiful, and gave me a great sense of confidence while wearing it.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the hair itself is very good looking but gets tangled easily.</li>

            <li>&amp; honestly I was a tad bit scared to even buy it.</li>
            <li>so wigs come in handy when going out.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered another one thinking it was an honest mistake</li>
            <li>It nice</li>
            <li>Even a co worker went online and bought her own.</li>
            <li>was thrilled to get this wig, and as soon as i got it out, i put it on a wig stand.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>those who like this kind of style, go ahead.</li>
            <li>and it comes with one of those nice wig caps that has the openings on both sides.</li>
            <li>The curls are nice.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, however it tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>This was nice but it sided a lot and got tangle very easy.</li>

            <li>Very real looking and simply gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Very easy to manage</li>
            <li>It tangles very easily though.</li>
            <li>but it gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this wig for a cosplay because it is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>This wig is sooo soft, life like and just perfect.</li>
            <li>TO MAKE IT SUITABLE TO UR FACE.</li>
            <li>it is so soft the color is awesome</li>
            <li>Great fit and doesn&#x27;t slide around, comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>The letter from the seller was especially nice, it showed how much the consumer is important to the seller.</li>
            <li>After trying the wig on it fit perfectly and looked JUST like real hair.</li>
            <li>However this one tangles so easily and honestly</li>
            <li>arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>This wig is better for halloween or a costume party.</li>
            <li>Would work for Halloween not for more though unless you want to put in a lot of work</li>
            <li>absolutely love it</li>
            <li>shipped out really fast and the wig was in great condition when I recieved it.</li>
            <li>Love the wig but the part in the hairline always messes up...</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>a cosmetologist who wear wigs on a daily basis and its perfect</li>
            <li>As soon as I brought this hair out of the package I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Gets many complements.</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent wig, I changed the part in it to the middle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely an outstanding wig for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a really stunning wig for the price.</li>
            <li>I feel confident knowing that this wig would will not come off accidentally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but I love</li>
            <li>I love love love this wig.</li>
            <li>But I love the burgandy color.</li>
            <li>As a person who wears wigs for religious reasons I was very happy with the way the wig looked and felt.</li>
            <li>So I would return it and I am not a fan of the way the top looks</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig.</li>
            <li>They all have clips attached to the wig and they all start to hurt my scalp after wearing them more than four hours from the clips.</li>
            <li>LOOKS GREAT VERY DURABLE WIG</li>
            <li>I will buying more of these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that i bought this wig</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it</li>
            <li>wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself was okay and just about that.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this again though - much better quality than anything else this price.</li>
            <li>This wig is so cute and comfortable!</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>Had to cut it shoulder link to look better after 2 months.</li>
            <li>This wig is better than a lot of beauty store wig I have bought.</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality!</li>
            <li>I love mine, so</li>
            <li>and it looks ok.</li>
            <li>but overall it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>lol, I thought it wouldnt fit right.</li>
            <li>I put up pictures on facebook with it on and people thought it was my real hair (just much more voluptuous and stunning)!!</li>
            <li>It looked beautiful out of the package and felt very soft.</li>
            <li>(it is an extremely full wig, but a bonus in my opinion, as there is more room to personalize it!)</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this wig after seeing a great review for it on youtube.</li>
            <li>As a nice bonus, it came with a wig cap and a wig comb (the packaging on the comb was a bit grungy, but the comb is cute and quite useful</li>
            <li>Super amazing I say.</li>
            <li>This wig changed that, and I was my normal, cheerful and happy self again.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, I loved how the wig came with a brush and a mesh wig cap.</li>
            <li>They blend in perfectly with the rest of the hair, it&#x27;s so long and has very beautiful waves/curls down towards the bottom.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be wearing this wig every day but it was great to live a day in the life of someone with fabulous</li>
            <li>It should fit fine for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first wig and I love it!</li>
            <li>Will order again due to the nice price!!!!</li>
            <li>I love the look of it fresh out of the box!</li>
            <li>but I am more than excited to.</li>
            <li>Best $20 I ever spent!</li>
            <li>gets tangled easy wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend to any one.</li>
            <li>tangles/gets tousled quite easily at the bottom</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
            <li>Tangles really easily.</li>
            <li>Hair started to fall out and the wig tangled so easily</li>
            <li>Beautiful Long wavy believable wig.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a pretty amazing wig for under twenty dollars.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a more full</li>
            <li>I have sewn in some synthetic extensions I wasn&#x27;t using and now it is absolutely full and believable.</li>
            <li>All in all, it was fine</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing for as cheap as it is.</li>
            <li>Good quality and looking naturally!</li>
            <li>It even makes your head look huge.</li>
            <li>It fits so snugly and feels so secure.</li>
            <li>It fits great, its heat resistent (on low setting 350) &amp; its not so shiny.</li>
            <li>Its just a great wig overall.</li>
            <li>So, this wig I bought mostly for fun.</li>
            <li>cheaply made.</li>
            <li>and I got a light brown/red.  </li>
            <li>I will enjoy wearing it</li>
            <li>I guess we could have gotten a cheap 5-dollar wig for that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, so why not risk it and do it yourself?</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>It came light brown.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>This was a GREAT buy, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I purchased this wig because I had some left of cash on my gift card and it turned out to be a great idea.</li>
            <li>And I got a free bookmark.</li>
            <li>but then again it was light brown.</li>
            <li>This is a great wig if you wear it only once, after one time use the front of the wig lining started showing.</li>
            <li>I would feel comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as full at the bottom as I&#x27;d hoped, but the top is full and fits well.  </li>
            <li>So soft and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly i like it even way better than a $150 wig i bought from another seller that was an actual lace wig.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>This wig is far superior to what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Beautiful long hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered it in curly dark brown, but it&#x27;s more of a red/light brown, the color looks really beautiful on me though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and long, alot longer than I thought when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The top of the wig has WAY too many layers so its very &#x27;poofy&#x27; .</li>
            <li>A synthetic wig, under $20, that actually looked nice &amp; stayed nice?</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t hold up to close scrutiny the way a truly high end wig would, but for what you&#x27;re paying, this is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;d expected but still a beautiful color.  </li>
            <li>its really pretty i love it</li>
            <li>No fake shine, like most synthetics.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li>Def worth $20!</li>
            <li>I have many wigs and wear them regularly, and I have to say, this one is extremely nice quality.  </li>
            <li>The bangs were far more prominent than they look in all the photo&#x27;s of this wig.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is good enough to wear in the light of day.  </li>
            <li>The wig is of delightful quality, nicer than some wigs I&#x27;ve spent thrice as much on.</li>
            <li>the special comb couldn&#x27;t save it.</li>
            <li>The skin part is not very visible, but still looks great.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to LOVE this wig.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>They really need to give a better explanation of what each item number means.</li>
            <li>this is the 10 which is supposed to be most real like.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good for daily wear.</li>
            <li>I was able to fix this with hair pins but ideally i wouldn&#x27;t want to deal with styling my wig with so much fuss everyday.</li>
            <li>This is good if you&#x27;re only going to use it for halloween</li>
            <li>This wig is surprisingly good for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;Being synthetic hair, it does have a bit more shine than real hair and it tangles a bit easier.</li>
            <li>According to reviews, it was true, so I had to try.</li>
            <li>so it got to me pretty early which is good.</li>
            <li>The other user pictures looked great, so I gave it a Try.  </li>
            <li>It likes to keep getting tangled, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great wig.</li>
            <li>The only criticism I have is that it tends to get tangled easily but for the price, it&#x27;s a fantastic wig, much better</li>
            <li>Once I took it off, they told me that it was super noticeable that it was a wig.</li>
            <li>I cut some off the bottom to make it more realistic.  </li>
            <li>It tangled quickly, and started to frizz as soon as i took it out of the package.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super so speedy too</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tangles super easily&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li>I also got it extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very full wig and very feminine.  </li>
            <li>i opened the package and my expectations were not only met and far more displayed in every good way.</li>
            <li>So it is perfect for me but someone with a small head may find this too large.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible wig for cosplay, you get a decent wig for a days/weeks worth of fun.</li>
            <li>The texture is lovely, very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This was my first wig purchase ever!  </li>
            <li>It looked so real that all of my friends thought I dyed my hair!!</li>
            <li>I was stunned when I opened the very carefully packaged wig and saw how nice it was!</li>
            <li>You can style this into a low pony tail, arrange the bangs how you want, hell you can go ahead and cut it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Its very comfortable not heavy has just the right amount of thickness.</li>
            <li>Maybe light brown red is really the color or someone at the factory made an honest mistake.  </li>
            <li>Great for everyday use</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy yours as much as I have mine.</li>
            <li>Overall, good quality for the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying such a cheap wig.</li>
            <li>I bought this one and it is ENTIRELY worth every dime.</li>
            <li>I just bought this for a fun change, it&#x27;s inexpensive as wigs go</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have fun with this wig regardless.  </li>
            <li>Good quality but too thick on top.</li>
            <li>It is a full head of hair, shiny, exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Tangles really easily, like most long wigs.</li>
            <li>I suggest you invest in it if you want a good, strong wig that doesn&#x27;t shed for everyday (or cosplay) use!</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with wigs and I am a licensed professional.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a bit of adjusting once the wig cap and wig are on your head but eventually looks right.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice wig especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The texture and material that makes up the synthetic hair is remarkably realistic and beautiful however the wig itself has an odd shape and doesn&#x27;t sit well on the head</li>
            <li>Very think and full</li>
            <li>Great for the average cosplayer or someone just looking to try a new style!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s s0 good length and is much fuller than expected.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, very bouncy and doesn&#x27;t tangle very much.</li>
            <li>Not a lace front but the way the wefts are placed it looks very much like a lace front</li>
            <li>included a wig net to hold the wig, a cap that might fit a doll or child but not an adult human, and a great comb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up trimming the ends a bit and working some dry shampoo into the scalp to cut down on shine and give it a more realistic look, but this wig is honestly great right out of the box.</li>
            <li>It had a lot of body when I first got it.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend love the different look she can accomplish with using wig.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a pretty wig.  </li>
            <li>There is quite a bit of a red undertone (more maroon I guess) to this wig.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about a cheapo wig from China but they impressed me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first wig-</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent first wig to buy.</li>
            <li>It is my first and it came with the cap and brush.</li>
            <li>I must say, this was my first wig purchase.</li>
            <li>I really love this wig short, because i know how to cut hair</li>
            <li>When I first put it on of course some adjustments were needed.  </li>
            <li>Would love for it to be sold in a variety of colors with highlight options (such as (1B/4, 2/4, 1/4, etc...)</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>the wig actually looks better in the picture  </li>
            <li>The wig is soft and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an avid wig wearer or anything</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying another one. :)</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a Halloween costume - wasn&#x27;t expecting much since it was so cheap, but was surprised by the quality!</li>
            <li>I would have like combs on the inside of the wig for a more tight fit.</li>
            <li>but instead I got one that was more flat to the head.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it is exactly like pictured, but I don&#x27;t quite love how long it is.</li>
            <li>I use a large tooth comb to keep the hair from getting tangled and it works fine, no other special products are needed so far.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast and the packaging was very neat.</li>
            <li>Very Light Light shedding, only when brushed.</li>
            <li>It looks incredibly natural, but it didn&#x27;t fit my head very well and got reallllllly tangled easily during only 1 use.</li>
            <li>The hair is silky and looks pretty real.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because the first time i wore it; it looked like real hair not a wig.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can buy higher quality wigs, but probably for three times as much money.</li>
            <li>This wig was professionally assembled with full coverage</li>
            <li>Colour was a nice dark brown.</li>
            <li>, this one does not have that problem, even in full sunlight it still looks like my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>If I wore a beanie, it looked super natural.</li>
            <li>If you wear a large size I would not recommend this one for you.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was delighted and tore it open to find neatly packed inside, a mesh hair cap (I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it as it didnt work well), a wig comb (as many other reviewers have stated it was dirty and scratched up), and the</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture, voluminous, realistic.</li>
            <li>so much she will be buying one for herself as well.  </li>
            <li>The wig is very nice!Almost look like a real hair.</li>
            <li>feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>very much!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Look pritty real bit</li>
            <li>The hair is very silky feeling and very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I didnt want to pay too much.</li>
            <li>I know I didn&#x27;t pay a whole lot, but I have bought a wig from another seller</li>
            <li>The hair itself looks real.</li>
            <li>I am very satisifyed with this product.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really move the hair in any direction...</li>
            <li>Also the bangs are really messed up.</li>
            <li>I am going to go ahead and order the straight one, too.</li>
            <li>This wig looks just like real hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to wear a wig once in awhile to change things up</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t wear a hat, you can absolutely tell that I have a wig on.</li>
            <li>I really like the wig, it almost looks real.</li>
            <li>I really wanted something that looked real and would hold up</li>
            <li>If I wore this out, not one would guess that it wasn&#x27;t my real hair expect of course my friends and family.</li>
            <li>Looked completely real.</li>
            <li>It looks SO real.  </li>
            <li>thought it to be my real hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this wig minus the way it looks at the top.</li>
            <li>But straight out of the package, it looked...</li>
            <li>real.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I had with it was that it didn&#x27;t look natural on the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively sturdy (if you understand that the wig is made from synthetics and is simply prone to frizz/tangling) and the styling is nice.</li>
            <li>When you receive the pretty little pink box, professionally packaged, you will be able to tell the difference at once! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and looks very real.</li>
            <li>just make sure the heat is not super hot.</li>
            <li>very soft at first, mine was damaged after 2 weeks, but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for a model in my upcoming runway show to better match the other models&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>More than other wigs with cheaper quality and cheaper cost.</li>
            <li>Other then that it was okay.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure there are other reviews of people who have.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more colors other than browns and blacks because I would buy them all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and soft and sexy.  </li>
            <li>It did not tangle easily and looks really natural with side part, or even a middle part.</li>
            <li>as an FYI, the wig is really more of a dark chestnut color?</li>
            <li>It was lightweight and I love the color ( I ordered dark brown ) .</li>
            <li>People with normal/thick hair maybe don&#x27;t realize how difficult it is to feel feminine and truly beautiful without it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty soft.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change about it (and I have found this to be true for every wig ever)</li>
            <li>looks SO REALISTIC.</li>
            <li>I am really sure the different colors are differently cut/ styled wigs.</li>
            <li>If I get another wig, I will get a lace front wig with a realistic part.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, it&#x27;s much better quality than I expected</li>
            <li>Felt realistic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- realistic coloring and texture</li>
            <li>Now, it looks very natural like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bangs and the top of the back was easy to take care of, but the bottom wavy part was hard to keep from tangling ..</li>
            <li>This is a high quality wig.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>After reading tons of reviews i decided to buy the wig and keep my hopes high.</li>
            <li>All in all, if you&#x27;re someone who needs a wig for health reasons, I would highly suggest purchasing one of these.</li>
            <li>I love the color of the wig and the little curls which have a &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; to them.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting too much but happily surprised.  </li>
            <li>This lasted about a month with care but made my face more round which i wasn&#x27;t a fan</li>
            <li>I must say that I love this wig and have been wearing it everyday.</li>
            <li>very realistic and soft, comes with comb and wig cap, it feels and looks very natural</li>
            <li>The volume of the hair has definitely gone down since I first got it, but it is still better than a lot of wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont think I completely understand the lower star ratings from other users, because the wig itself out of the box looks okay, but I trimmed and fixed it to match my face and people</li>
            <li>wish I could buy ten of these in the right color.</li>
            <li>My only problem with this one is that the crown doesn&#x27;t sit right...</li>
            <li>The way it hangs right in front of one of my eyes is enough to keep me from wearing it</li>
            <li>Also, I do not use the wig cap, I just apply the wig right over my hair, which is the same color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a few more styles of this wig!</li>
            <li>The wigs was super long</li>
            <li>I wanted to go for a long and natural look like how it was before I cut it short and dyed it so many times.</li>
            <li>it very much looks real lastrd a long time without , any washes partied wjth this wig</li>
            <li>I posted some photos joking that it was my new look</li>
            <li>, I had new promo shots done, with my &amp;#34;new hair!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Of course, the wig is a bit shiny, but it doesn&#x27;t look completely unreal, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to get the shine out of it such as using dry conditioner or something</li>
            <li>It looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the quality of this wig considering the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- looks very natural</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very soft and keeps its texture, and I can confirm that it is heat resistant.</li>
            <li>This wig is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Low shine so the hair looks very real.</li>
            <li>It looks super fake and it wouldn&#x27;t fit my head right</li>
            <li>Very little shedding of hair, I love this wig</li>
            <li>Only issue is that long hair wigs tend to tangle easily, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to shave my head, because my hair was pretty damaged.  </li>
            <li>Such a pretty wig.  </li>
            <li>Im mixed and was trying to grow out my hair while looking pretty so bought this</li>
            <li>The dark brown was actually light brown t which sucked.</li>
            <li>I bought it early to wear to a con I&#x27;m going to with a friend in May!  </li>
            <li>I asked for dark brown and they sent me light brown.</li>
            <li>I got Dark brown and Light brown.  </li>
            <li>this is the reason, this is the third one I have purchased, and most definitely not the last.</li>
            <li>And I can be blonde and then brunette every other day :)</li>
            <li>It doesnt exactly look like the photo except its the same color.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- not very easy to secure to the head</li>
            <li>The wig was pretty much exactly like the pictures, dark brown was a ltitle lighter in color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always a bit unsure when buying a wig under 20 dollars, since I&#x27;ve had bad experiences in the past with cheap wigs; but I am happy to say that this wig is nothing like those!</li>
            <li>I like the dark rich brown color in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Because I am platinum blonde and it took a long time to get my hair blonde and healthy</li>
            <li>Looks pretty good, Its a little awkward looking in the front part with the bang parting but other than that it is lovely!</li>
            <li>Will need to be cut and/or trimmed a little to fit your face/personality</li>
            <li>This wig is not full enough to be believable unless you naturally have this hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY full and has very little shine.</li>
            <li>so I was able to adjust for my tiny little head.</li>
            <li>I recently cut my hair short and wanted something to keep my neck warm, and to give a little variety to my looks.</li>
            <li>It was light brown not dark almost black like the picture.  </li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>It looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>I received several comments about how real the hair looked--it is a natural-looking shine, not a fake-hair shine.</li>
            <li>It appeared so much darker in the photo shown above.  </li>
            <li>The hair is beautifully soft with luxurious bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>Everyone that saw me with a beanie with the hair thought it was natural.</li>
            <li>so that wasn&#x27;t entirely unexpected.</li>
            <li>The wig looks natural and I adore the style and soft curls.</li>
            <li>Next time I am going to order the straight one.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll figure it out later haha).</li>
            <li>No shedding so far.</li>
            <li>It could definitely pass for real hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far the NICEST wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Not good for very long but loved the wig.</li>
            <li>I mean, unless you&#x27;re okay with that look?</li>
            <li>After a few days of wearing this wig in curly dark brown, I have received more compliments on my hair than I have in years!</li>
            <li>Did not meet expectations, constant shedding, dry synthetic texture, super unimpressed.</li>
            <li>You can wear it daily, if you know how to create a realistic look to the bang near the root of the wig.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less expensive than wigs at most Halloween/costume shops, and so much better quality.</li>
            <li>My hair has been steadily thinning since my mid teens</li>
            <li>It feels like real hair, full and thick.</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s a little too full at the crown of the head for my taste --</li>
            <li>and I actually paid a little less for that but got such an amazing one from them!</li>
            <li>It is heat friendly, so you can smooth the ends down every few weeks with your flat iron, and it will not damage it.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see the cap underneath at all, it&#x27;s very full and thick.</li>
            <li>an again I got a brown wig.. not dark brown.</li>
            <li>so this color was a little too bold for me.</li>
            <li>My only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34;is that top of the wig is a little flat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a couple of other more expensive wigs and this one ranked up there on quality and fit.  </li>
            <li>it is soft and looks like natural human hair.</li>
            <li>do have to note that if this fake hair pokes you in the eye it hurts more than real hair</li>
            <li>If anything, this is really my only complaint, because the hair was so thick at the top and sides that it looked comically voluminous on my head, especially compared to the wispier curls at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Looks overall very natural.</li>
            <li>If I put the wig up in a half pony tail (top half of hair in a rubberband or scruchi)</li>
            <li>I actually took the time to reduce the straps inside the wig to reduce the size (it&#x27;s huge on my averagely small head.)</li>
            <li>wore it in general.</li>
            <li>usually wear an average size and this wig does fit very snug.</li>
            <li>There are absolutely no tangles when I run my fingers through it like real hair</li>
            <li>But for those who want normal long haired wig, try something else.</li>
            <li>it kind of pops up in a weird way.</li>
            <li>but I suppose that&#x27;s better than it being too thin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t base my happiness on my hair, but it does make me very self conscious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price, however way too long to the point of looking fake.  </li>
            <li>I had previously purchased a fake synthetic wig at a costume store but wasn&#x27;t happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig is very soft , long and curly.</li>
            <li>looks like a short hair wig all around, with about 5 strands of long curly hair attached only on the very back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe if cut a few inches it would look a little better.</li>
            <li>My only beef with it is it&#x27;s not dark brown</li>
            <li>It hardly shed at all when styling for the first time, it&#x27;s very soft and not too shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and the wig is very long and nearly touches the bum.</li>
            <li>Since It&#x27;s so very long, use a wig spray detangler each night when you take it off and put it away, and it will keep the ends soft.</li>
            <li>and I like to switch my style often without too much dying for less damage.</li>
            <li>and it was starting to get super hard to brush at the ends.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of natural hair which is hidden completely by this wig AND no tracts to be seen.</li>
            <li>I could pull the entire wig over one ear while the other side sits right above the other ear;  </li>
            <li>i really like it except it is a little bit shiny.</li>
            <li>and it works a little but its too late for this wig, its now busted at the top of it</li>

            <li> To be completely honest, the hair was beautiful.</li>
            <li> it was a bright copper color</li>
            <li> Wig is darker and fuller than it appears in picture but still a good wig.</li>
            <li> The curls it comes with are gorgeous and both the wig cap(fishnet) and the wig comb that come with</li>
            <li> LOVED playing with the hair.</li>

            <li> It is perfect for my Cyclops cosplay and looks fantastic on me.</li>
            <li> :P Still love it, though!</li>
            <li> It was cheap, looks beautiful, and gave me a great sense of confidence while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Regardless, the hair itself is very good looking but gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Much better quality, look and great prices.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice how it comes with the wig cap and comb as well.</li>
            <li> &amp; honestly I was a tad bit scared to even buy it.</li>
            <li> so wigs come in handy when going out.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered another one thinking it was an honest mistake</li>
            <li> It nice</li>
            <li> Even a co worker went online and bought her own.</li>
            <li> was thrilled to get this wig, and as soon as i got it out, i put it on a wig stand.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> those who like this kind of style, go ahead.</li>
            <li> and it comes with one of those nice wig caps that has the openings on both sides.</li>
            <li> The curls are nice.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, however it tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> This was nice but it sided a lot and got tangle very easy.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig which is wearable right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> Very real looking and simply gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Very easy to manage</li>
            <li> It tangles very easily though.</li>
            <li> but it gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this wig for a cosplay because it is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig is sooo soft, life like and just perfect.</li>
            <li> TO MAKE IT SUITABLE TO UR FACE.</li>
            <li> it is so soft the color is awesome</li>
            <li> Great fit and doesn&#x27;t slide around, comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> The letter from the seller was especially nice, it showed how much the consumer is important to the seller.</li>
            <li> After trying the wig on it fit perfectly and looked JUST like real hair.</li>
            <li> However this one tangles so easily and honestly</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> This wig is better for halloween or a costume party.</li>
            <li> Would work for Halloween not for more though unless you want to put in a lot of work</li>
            <li> absolutely love it</li>
            <li> shipped out really fast and the wig was in great condition when I recieved it.</li>
            <li> Love the wig but the part in the hairline always messes up...</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I love this wig.</li>
            <li> a cosmetologist who wear wigs on a daily basis and its perfect</li>
            <li> As soon as I brought this hair out of the package I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Gets many complements.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent wig, I changed the part in it to the middle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely an outstanding wig for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a really stunning wig for the price.</li>
            <li> I feel confident knowing that this wig would will not come off accidentally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> but I love</li>
            <li> I love love love this wig.</li>
            <li> But I love the burgandy color.</li>
            <li> As a person who wears wigs for religious reasons I was very happy with the way the wig looked and felt.</li>
            <li> So I would return it and I am not a fan of the way the top looks</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig.</li>
            <li> They all have clips attached to the wig and they all start to hurt my scalp after wearing them more than four hours from the clips.</li>
            <li> LOOKS GREAT VERY DURABLE WIG</li>
            <li> I will buying more of these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that i bought this wig</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it</li>
            <li> wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself was okay and just about that.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this wig.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy this again though - much better quality than anything else this price.</li>
            <li> This wig is so cute and comfortable!</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> Had to cut it shoulder link to look better after 2 months.</li>
            <li> This wig is better than a lot of beauty store wig I have bought.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality!</li>
            <li> I love mine, so</li>
            <li> and it looks ok.</li>
            <li> but overall it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> lol, I thought it wouldnt fit right.</li>
            <li> I put up pictures on facebook with it on and people thought it was my real hair (just much more voluptuous and stunning)!!</li>
            <li> It looked beautiful out of the package and felt very soft.</li>
            <li> (it is an extremely full wig, but a bonus in my opinion, as there is more room to personalize it!)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this wig after seeing a great review for it on youtube.</li>
            <li> As a nice bonus, it came with a wig cap and a wig comb (the packaging on the comb was a bit grungy, but the comb is cute and quite useful</li>
            <li> Super amazing I say.</li>
            <li> This wig changed that, and I was my normal, cheerful and happy self again.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, I loved how the wig came with a brush and a mesh wig cap.</li>
            <li> They blend in perfectly with the rest of the hair, it&#x27;s so long and has very beautiful waves/curls down towards the bottom.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be wearing this wig every day but it was great to live a day in the life of someone with fabulous</li>
            <li> It should fit fine for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first wig and I love it!</li>
            <li> Will order again due to the nice price!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the look of it fresh out of the box!</li>
            <li> but I am more than excited to.</li>
            <li> Best $20 I ever spent!</li>
            <li> gets tangled easy wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> tangles/gets tousled quite easily at the bottom</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
            <li> Tangles really easily.</li>
            <li> Hair started to fall out and the wig tangled so easily</li>
            <li> Beautiful Long wavy believable wig.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a pretty amazing wig for under twenty dollars.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a more full</li>
            <li> I have sewn in some synthetic extensions I wasn&#x27;t using and now it is absolutely full and believable.</li>
            <li> All in all, it was fine</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing for as cheap as it is.</li>
            <li> Good quality and looking naturally!</li>
            <li> It even makes your head look huge.</li>
            <li> It fits so snugly and feels so secure.</li>
            <li> It fits great, its heat resistent (on low setting 350) &amp; its not so shiny.</li>
            <li> Its just a great wig overall.</li>
            <li> So, this wig I bought mostly for fun.</li>
            <li> cheaply made.</li>
            <li> and I got a light brown/red.  </li>
            <li> I will enjoy wearing it</li>
            <li> I guess we could have gotten a cheap 5-dollar wig for that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, so why not risk it and do it yourself?</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> It came light brown.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT buy, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig because I had some left of cash on my gift card and it turned out to be a great idea.</li>
            <li> And I got a free bookmark.</li>
            <li> but then again it was light brown.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig if you wear it only once, after one time use the front of the wig lining started showing.</li>
            <li> I would feel comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as full at the bottom as I&#x27;d hoped, but the top is full and fits well.  </li>
            <li> So soft and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly i like it even way better than a $150 wig i bought from another seller that was an actual lace wig.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> This wig is far superior to what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Beautiful long hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered it in curly dark brown, but it&#x27;s more of a red/light brown, the color looks really beautiful on me though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and long, alot longer than I thought when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The top of the wig has WAY too many layers so its very &#x27;poofy&#x27; .</li>
            <li> A synthetic wig, under $20, that actually looked nice &amp; stayed nice?</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t hold up to close scrutiny the way a truly high end wig would, but for what you&#x27;re paying, this is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;d expected but still a beautiful color.  </li>
            <li> its really pretty i love it</li>
            <li> No fake shine, like most synthetics.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li> Def worth $20!</li>
            <li> I have many wigs and wear them regularly, and I have to say, this one is extremely nice quality.  </li>
            <li> The bangs were far more prominent than they look in all the photo&#x27;s of this wig.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is good enough to wear in the light of day.  </li>
            <li> The wig is of delightful quality, nicer than some wigs I&#x27;ve spent thrice as much on.</li>
            <li> the special comb couldn&#x27;t save it.</li>
            <li> The skin part is not very visible, but still looks great.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to LOVE this wig.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> They really need to give a better explanation of what each item number means.</li>
            <li> this is the 10 which is supposed to be most real like.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good for daily wear.</li>
            <li> I was able to fix this with hair pins but ideally i wouldn&#x27;t want to deal with styling my wig with so much fuss everyday.</li>
            <li> This is good if you&#x27;re only going to use it for halloween</li>
            <li> This wig is surprisingly good for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;Being synthetic hair, it does have a bit more shine than real hair and it tangles a bit easier.</li>
            <li> According to reviews, it was true, so I had to try.</li>
            <li> so it got to me pretty early which is good.</li>
            <li> The other user pictures looked great, so I gave it a Try.  </li>
            <li> It likes to keep getting tangled, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great wig.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that it tends to get tangled easily but for the price, it&#x27;s a fantastic wig, much better</li>
            <li> Once I took it off, they told me that it was super noticeable that it was a wig.</li>
            <li> I cut some off the bottom to make it more realistic.  </li>
            <li> It tangled quickly, and started to frizz as soon as i took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super so speedy too</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tangles super easily&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li> I also got it extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very full wig and very feminine.  </li>
            <li> i opened the package and my expectations were not only met and far more displayed in every good way.</li>
            <li> So it is perfect for me but someone with a small head may find this too large.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible wig for cosplay, you get a decent wig for a days/weeks worth of fun.</li>
            <li> The texture is lovely, very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This was my first wig purchase ever!  </li>
            <li> It looked so real that all of my friends thought I dyed my hair!!</li>
            <li> I was stunned when I opened the very carefully packaged wig and saw how nice it was!</li>
            <li> You can style this into a low pony tail, arrange the bangs how you want, hell you can go ahead and cut it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Its very comfortable not heavy has just the right amount of thickness.</li>
            <li> Maybe light brown red is really the color or someone at the factory made an honest mistake.  </li>
            <li> Great for everyday use</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy yours as much as I have mine.</li>
            <li> Overall, good quality for the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying such a cheap wig.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and it is ENTIRELY worth every dime.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for a fun change, it&#x27;s inexpensive as wigs go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have fun with this wig regardless.  </li>
            <li> Good quality but too thick on top.</li>
            <li> It is a full head of hair, shiny, exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> Tangles really easily, like most long wigs.</li>
            <li> I suggest you invest in it if you want a good, strong wig that doesn&#x27;t shed for everyday (or cosplay) use!</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with wigs and I am a licensed professional.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a bit of adjusting once the wig cap and wig are on your head but eventually looks right.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice wig especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The texture and material that makes up the synthetic hair is remarkably realistic and beautiful however the wig itself has an odd shape and doesn&#x27;t sit well on the head</li>
            <li> Very think and full</li>
            <li> Great for the average cosplayer or someone just looking to try a new style!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s s0 good length and is much fuller than expected.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, very bouncy and doesn&#x27;t tangle very much.</li>
            <li> Not a lace front but the way the wefts are placed it looks very much like a lace front</li>
            <li> included a wig net to hold the wig, a cap that might fit a doll or child but not an adult human, and a great comb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up trimming the ends a bit and working some dry shampoo into the scalp to cut down on shine and give it a more realistic look, but this wig is honestly great right out of the box.</li>
            <li> It had a lot of body when I first got it.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love the different look she can accomplish with using wig.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a pretty wig.  </li>
            <li> There is quite a bit of a red undertone (more maroon I guess) to this wig.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a cheapo wig from China but they impressed me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first wig-</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent first wig to buy.</li>
            <li> It is my first and it came with the cap and brush.</li>
            <li> I must say, this was my first wig purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love this wig short, because i know how to cut hair</li>
            <li> When I first put it on of course some adjustments were needed.  </li>
            <li> Would love for it to be sold in a variety of colors with highlight options (such as (1B/4, 2/4, 1/4, etc...)</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> the wig actually looks better in the picture  </li>
            <li> The wig is soft and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an avid wig wearer or anything</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying another one. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Halloween costume - wasn&#x27;t expecting much since it was so cheap, but was surprised by the quality!</li>
            <li> I would have like combs on the inside of the wig for a more tight fit.</li>
            <li> but instead I got one that was more flat to the head.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it is exactly like pictured, but I don&#x27;t quite love how long it is.</li>
            <li> I use a large tooth comb to keep the hair from getting tangled and it works fine, no other special products are needed so far.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast and the packaging was very neat.</li>
            <li> Very Light Light shedding, only when brushed.</li>
            <li> It looks incredibly natural, but it didn&#x27;t fit my head very well and got reallllllly tangled easily during only 1 use.</li>
            <li> The hair is silky and looks pretty real.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because the first time i wore it; it looked like real hair not a wig.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can buy higher quality wigs, but probably for three times as much money.</li>
            <li> This wig was professionally assembled with full coverage</li>
            <li> Colour was a nice dark brown.</li>
            <li> , this one does not have that problem, even in full sunlight it still looks like my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> If I wore a beanie, it looked super natural.</li>
            <li> If you wear a large size I would not recommend this one for you.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was delighted and tore it open to find neatly packed inside, a mesh hair cap (I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it as it didnt work well), a wig comb (as many other reviewers have stated it was dirty and scratched up), and the</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture, voluminous, realistic.</li>
            <li> so much she will be buying one for herself as well.  </li>
            <li> The wig is very nice!Almost look like a real hair.</li>
            <li> feels like real hair.</li>
            <li> very much!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Look pritty real bit</li>
            <li> The hair is very silky feeling and very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I didnt want to pay too much.</li>
            <li> I know I didn&#x27;t pay a whole lot, but I have bought a wig from another seller</li>
            <li> The hair itself looks real.</li>
            <li> I am very satisifyed with this product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really move the hair in any direction...</li>
            <li> Also the bangs are really messed up.</li>
            <li> I am going to go ahead and order the straight one, too.</li>
            <li> This wig looks just like real hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to wear a wig once in awhile to change things up</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wear a hat, you can absolutely tell that I have a wig on.</li>
            <li> I really like the wig, it almost looks real.</li>
            <li> I really wanted something that looked real and would hold up</li>
            <li> If I wore this out, not one would guess that it wasn&#x27;t my real hair expect of course my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Looked completely real.</li>
            <li> It looks SO real.  </li>
            <li> thought it to be my real hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this wig minus the way it looks at the top.</li>
            <li> But straight out of the package, it looked...</li>
            <li> real.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I had with it was that it didn&#x27;t look natural on the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively sturdy (if you understand that the wig is made from synthetics and is simply prone to frizz/tangling) and the styling is nice.</li>
            <li> When you receive the pretty little pink box, professionally packaged, you will be able to tell the difference at once! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and looks very real.</li>
            <li> just make sure the heat is not super hot.</li>
            <li> very soft at first, mine was damaged after 2 weeks, but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a model in my upcoming runway show to better match the other models&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> More than other wigs with cheaper quality and cheaper cost.</li>
            <li> Other then that it was okay.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure there are other reviews of people who have.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more colors other than browns and blacks because I would buy them all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and soft and sexy.  </li>
            <li> It did not tangle easily and looks really natural with side part, or even a middle part.</li>
            <li> as an FYI, the wig is really more of a dark chestnut color?</li>
            <li> It was lightweight and I love the color ( I ordered dark brown ) .</li>
            <li> People with normal/thick hair maybe don&#x27;t realize how difficult it is to feel feminine and truly beautiful without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty soft.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change about it (and I have found this to be true for every wig ever)</li>
            <li> looks SO REALISTIC.</li>
            <li> I am really sure the different colors are differently cut/ styled wigs.</li>
            <li> If I get another wig, I will get a lace front wig with a realistic part.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, it&#x27;s much better quality than I expected</li>
            <li> Felt realistic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- realistic coloring and texture</li>
            <li> Now, it looks very natural like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bangs and the top of the back was easy to take care of, but the bottom wavy part was hard to keep from tangling ..</li>
            <li> This is a high quality wig.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After reading tons of reviews i decided to buy the wig and keep my hopes high.</li>
            <li> All in all, if you&#x27;re someone who needs a wig for health reasons, I would highly suggest purchasing one of these.</li>
            <li> I love the color of the wig and the little curls which have a &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; to them.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting too much but happily surprised.  </li>
            <li> This lasted about a month with care but made my face more round which i wasn&#x27;t a fan</li>
            <li> I must say that I love this wig and have been wearing it everyday.</li>
            <li> very realistic and soft, comes with comb and wig cap, it feels and looks very natural</li>
            <li> The volume of the hair has definitely gone down since I first got it, but it is still better than a lot of wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont think I completely understand the lower star ratings from other users, because the wig itself out of the box looks okay, but I trimmed and fixed it to match my face and people</li>
            <li> wish I could buy ten of these in the right color.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this one is that the crown doesn&#x27;t sit right...</li>
            <li> The way it hangs right in front of one of my eyes is enough to keep me from wearing it</li>
            <li> Also, I do not use the wig cap, I just apply the wig right over my hair, which is the same color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a few more styles of this wig!</li>
            <li> The wigs was super long</li>
            <li> I wanted to go for a long and natural look like how it was before I cut it short and dyed it so many times.</li>
            <li> it very much looks real lastrd a long time without , any washes partied wjth this wig</li>
            <li> I posted some photos joking that it was my new look</li>
            <li> , I had new promo shots done, with my &amp;#34;new hair!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Of course, the wig is a bit shiny, but it doesn&#x27;t look completely unreal, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to get the shine out of it such as using dry conditioner or something</li>
            <li> It looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the quality of this wig considering the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- looks very natural</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very soft and keeps its texture, and I can confirm that it is heat resistant.</li>
            <li> This wig is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Low shine so the hair looks very real.</li>
            <li> It looks super fake and it wouldn&#x27;t fit my head right</li>
            <li> Very little shedding of hair, I love this wig</li>
            <li> Only issue is that long hair wigs tend to tangle easily, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to shave my head, because my hair was pretty damaged.  </li>
            <li> Such a pretty wig.  </li>
            <li> Im mixed and was trying to grow out my hair while looking pretty so bought this</li>
            <li> The dark brown was actually light brown t which sucked.</li>
            <li> I bought it early to wear to a con I&#x27;m going to with a friend in May!  </li>
            <li> I asked for dark brown and they sent me light brown.</li>
            <li> I got Dark brown and Light brown.  </li>
            <li> this is the reason, this is the third one I have purchased, and most definitely not the last.</li>
            <li> And I can be blonde and then brunette every other day :)</li>
            <li> It doesnt exactly look like the photo except its the same color.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- not very easy to secure to the head</li>
            <li> The wig was pretty much exactly like the pictures, dark brown was a ltitle lighter in color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a bit unsure when buying a wig under 20 dollars, since I&#x27;ve had bad experiences in the past with cheap wigs; but I am happy to say that this wig is nothing like those!</li>
            <li> I like the dark rich brown color in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Because I am platinum blonde and it took a long time to get my hair blonde and healthy</li>
            <li> Looks pretty good, Its a little awkward looking in the front part with the bang parting but other than that it is lovely!</li>
            <li> Will need to be cut and/or trimmed a little to fit your face/personality</li>
            <li> This wig is not full enough to be believable unless you naturally have this hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY full and has very little shine.</li>
            <li> so I was able to adjust for my tiny little head.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair short and wanted something to keep my neck warm, and to give a little variety to my looks.</li>
            <li> It was light brown not dark almost black like the picture.  </li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> It looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> I received several comments about how real the hair looked--it is a natural-looking shine, not a fake-hair shine.</li>
            <li> It appeared so much darker in the photo shown above.  </li>
            <li> The hair is beautifully soft with luxurious bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> Everyone that saw me with a beanie with the hair thought it was natural.</li>
            <li> so that wasn&#x27;t entirely unexpected.</li>
            <li> The wig looks natural and I adore the style and soft curls.</li>
            <li> Next time I am going to order the straight one.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll figure it out later haha).</li>
            <li> No shedding so far.</li>
            <li> It could definitely pass for real hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far the NICEST wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Not good for very long but loved the wig.</li>
            <li> I mean, unless you&#x27;re okay with that look?</li>
            <li> After a few days of wearing this wig in curly dark brown, I have received more compliments on my hair than I have in years!</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations, constant shedding, dry synthetic texture, super unimpressed.</li>
            <li> You can wear it daily, if you know how to create a realistic look to the bang near the root of the wig.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive than wigs at most Halloween/costume shops, and so much better quality.</li>
            <li> My hair has been steadily thinning since my mid teens</li>
            <li> It feels like real hair, full and thick.</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s a little too full at the crown of the head for my taste --</li>
            <li> and I actually paid a little less for that but got such an amazing one from them!</li>
            <li> It is heat friendly, so you can smooth the ends down every few weeks with your flat iron, and it will not damage it.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see the cap underneath at all, it&#x27;s very full and thick.</li>
            <li> an again I got a brown wig.. not dark brown.</li>
            <li> so this color was a little too bold for me.</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34;is that top of the wig is a little flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a couple of other more expensive wigs and this one ranked up there on quality and fit.  </li>
            <li> it is soft and looks like natural human hair.</li>
            <li> do have to note that if this fake hair pokes you in the eye it hurts more than real hair</li>
            <li> If anything, this is really my only complaint, because the hair was so thick at the top and sides that it looked comically voluminous on my head, especially compared to the wispier curls at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Looks overall very natural.</li>
            <li> If I put the wig up in a half pony tail (top half of hair in a rubberband or scruchi)</li>
            <li> I actually took the time to reduce the straps inside the wig to reduce the size (it&#x27;s huge on my averagely small head.)</li>
            <li> wore it in general.</li>
            <li> usually wear an average size and this wig does fit very snug.</li>
            <li> There are absolutely no tangles when I run my fingers through it like real hair</li>
            <li> But for those who want normal long haired wig, try something else.</li>
            <li> it kind of pops up in a weird way.</li>
            <li> but I suppose that&#x27;s better than it being too thin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t base my happiness on my hair, but it does make me very self conscious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, however way too long to the point of looking fake.  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a fake synthetic wig at a costume store but wasn&#x27;t happy with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wig is very soft , long and curly.</li>
            <li> looks like a short hair wig all around, with about 5 strands of long curly hair attached only on the very back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe if cut a few inches it would look a little better.</li>
            <li> My only beef with it is it&#x27;s not dark brown</li>
            <li> It hardly shed at all when styling for the first time, it&#x27;s very soft and not too shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and the wig is very long and nearly touches the bum.</li>
            <li> Since It&#x27;s so very long, use a wig spray detangler each night when you take it off and put it away, and it will keep the ends soft.</li>
            <li> and I like to switch my style often without too much dying for less damage.</li>
            <li> and it was starting to get super hard to brush at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of natural hair which is hidden completely by this wig AND no tracts to be seen.</li>
            <li> I could pull the entire wig over one ear while the other side sits right above the other ear;  </li>
            <li> i really like it except it is a little bit shiny.</li>
            <li> and it works a little but its too late for this wig, its now busted at the top of it</li>
            <li> It was super long and hard to manage, but I took about 4&amp;#34; off the bottom</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get this one to look even slightly like normal hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft, 100% kanekalon, and a dark brown color.</li>
            <li> I am going to trim it as it is very long and the very ends tangle slightly.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t comment on long term wear because I bought this wig purely to wear a few minutes a day.</li>
            <li> My only issues are that it constantly tangles and that it slips off my head easily, but perhaps that is because I have a weird head shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&amp;#34;4 and the long wig comes to about mid back.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m becoming addicted!</li>
            <li> Also, I straightened out some kinks from shipping with a flat iron on the lowest setting and didn&#x27;t melt, friz or fray one hair.</li>
            <li> My long distance family all thought it was my actual hair!</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of short hair sticking out in the bangs and made it look like I was wearing a wig, however once I clipped them it took on a natural look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid cosplayer and usually spend at least twice this much on wigs (and generally more than that), but I needed something close to my natural color (after a TERRIBLE haircut) that would arrive quickly, so I took a chance on this and was pleasantly surprised by how thick and natural-looking it turned out to</li>
            <li> What I like about this wig for one is the price, especially after looking else where not only on other websites but also on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It looks real in pictures but for me having long hair already it was hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Wrong wig the color was too light brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve carefully packed it away until next Halloween...</li>
            <li> and I like how long it is.</li>
            <li> Also beware, this wig is LONG.</li>
            <li> Length is probably too long for me, but can have it cut.</li>
            <li> I wanted a long hair wig</li>
            <li> The wig i got was the long brown curly one.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it sits pretty oddly with how the bangs are parted.</li>
            <li> Also, it may look better with anyone with a larger face, but if you have a small little head this wig looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li> However I wore less than 7 times and barely touched/</li>
            <li> Apparently I have a big head; I had a hard time getting it to stay on properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried moving the bangs from one direction to the other and they did move...</li>
            <li> One problem is that it has a tendency to tangle, but a bit of detangler or dry shampoo and patience with a comb</li>
            <li> Also it is really thin at the bottom and thick at the top</li>
            <li> I sat down next to my wig and thought for a long time what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a single spot where the cap weave showed through.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, but then when I received it today, I was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I chose the dark brown with a deep part.</li>
            <li> In the past wigs I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon were thinning and they shed, you could see the cap completely under the hair.</li>
            <li> The wig I got definitely wasn&#x27;t dark brown</li>
            <li> Extra care with maintenance of it, such as slow combing and daily detangler.</li>
            <li> I think it is a bit excessive and makes it look more unrealistic.</li>
            <li> Very well made, very thick</li>
            <li> Obviously this isn&#x27;t really a negative just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the long, dark brown curly wave.</li>
            <li> Arrived on expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Definitely not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> then I had expected.  </li>
            <li> and it just shed so much and was poorly put together.</li>
            <li> I ordered the long dark brown fp710</li>
            <li> I spent about 30 minutes combing it through.</li>
            <li> It got a kink in it only a few minutes of wearing..</li>
            <li> Longer then i expected.</li>
            <li> you could see the tracks and even when it was straight down you could see where the tracks were poorly assembled.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27; and currently the hair reaches just past my breasts.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted , but the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other brand of wig of course that is within this price range.</li>
            <li> Not too shiny like other wigs I have ordered too.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical at first because I have never worn a wig before.</li>
            <li> Compares to units I&#x27;ve spent 75.00 -300.00 for!  </li>
            <li> have worn it a few times, and because it is so long it does start to tangle, but I have yet to wash it.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I wore this the other day</li>
            <li> it was extremely  poofy and everyone could tell it was a wig.</li>
            <li> Very long, so i trimmed it a little.</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis,  and it&#x27;s worse in the cold months, this year worst yet, having gone from a shiny, healthy, full head of naturally almost black hair, falling to mid back this summer, to dry, brittle, and with over half my hair fallen out by Christmas.</li>
            <li> I can admit, I was very skeptical when buying it because I bought one before (from a different vendor and brand, of course), but it was my first time buying a wig</li>
            <li> but i have to say, the style of the wig made it hard for me to keep the back part</li>
            <li> I had people all night asking me if I was wearing extensions in my shoulder-length dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> (I got the dark brown curly one)&lt;br /&gt;- packaged properly&lt;</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and it wasa lot lighter than what I thought it would&#x27;ve been.</li>
            <li> I was expecting dark brown.</li>
            <li> So much that the bangs make it look fake.</li>
            <li> I love it on me but the bangs are retarded</li>
            <li> I am 4&#x27;9 and the wig comes down to my belly button.</li>
            <li> It came down almost to my butt</li>
            <li> The wig is dark brown, almost a black color.</li>
            <li> I sprayed dry shampoo on it to try to loose the extra shine fake hair has.</li>
            <li> it lasted me a month and a half</li>
            <li> Did have to cut the bangs as well seen as how the covered half my face.</li>
            <li> Mine had that black cap already in it</li>
            <li> Wiga has dull amount of hair, dark brown is a lil dark looking bit what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I can put it up in a half pony tail and the base has enough coverage to where it just looks real.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with hair loss due to disease for the past few years.</li>
            <li> The version I got goes all the way down to my waist!</li>
            <li> off one star because it&#x27;s fairly large on my head (though snug with the adjustable band at the base of the back), and can make my head look rounder than it is.</li>
            <li> It will work well for stage work, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> Heavy.</li>
            <li> I do not know how it would hold up to everyday wear, but it would probably need a lot of maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Wore it everyday for about 2 months</li>
            <li> The bangs are really short compared to the pic, and there is a layer in the front half way down the wig which makes it look weird.</li>
            <li> I got engaged this past year, started work in a very public and appearance focused field, and my hair had gotten so bad, and I was so self conscious and depressed, I had turned into almost a recluse.</li>
            <li> This wig really isn&#x27;t all that bad for the price.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m putting it on correctly.</li>
            <li> not sure of the longevity</li>
            <li> ALMOST EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> the very next day it had tons of kinks and it got very tough to comb.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this wig is the fact that I look ridiculous wearing it because the bangs are seriously messed up!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that as a negative because there was plenty of hair to customize it to your needs.  </li>
            <li> I finally got tired of being insecure and ordered myself a wig for my birthday.</li>
            <li> Edit: dropping the rating by one star because after light wear for about an hour this wig tangled horribly.</li>
            <li> Thats a common complaint</li>
            <li> the bang/fringe is intensely thick.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna be surprised if you are disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bangs are ridiculous, the hair tangles, and the curls fall out.</li>
            <li> The bangs can be really bad since it is parted down the middle weird.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> The volume may not make this an everyday wear for me, because it just doesn&#x27;t look all that casual, but for a night out the va-va-voom of this wig would make it a stunner.</li>
            <li> i just spent over 300 on my last one and it was HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thick.  </li>
            <li> Very thick and soft&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very thick hair</li>
            <li> This was just false advertising with the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of the wig.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a blonde wig from another company which was too thick and tangles like crazy and the bangs were horrific to try and figure out (I have to use hairspray to make it stay where I want)</li>
            <li> it looked weird.</li>
            <li> looks fake.</li>
            <li> It just looks fake.</li>
            <li> I think they sent me the wrong wig</li>
            <li> parting the hair is a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on it and it failed.</li>
            <li> I was dissapointrd though I got the wrong color and cut.</li>
            <li> Some wigs look too shiny and are obviously fake</li>
            <li> So I come each day in a wig and fake glasses as his &#x27;nurse&#x27; and he takes his pills.</li>
            <li> It almost looks like a weird mullet or one of those scene kids haircuts.</li>
            <li> and i ended up cutting it because it looked so fake and unnatural.</li>
            <li> I am planning on cutting it about 4/5 inches.</li>
            <li> This is another reason I will be cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it would look noticeably fake but it doesn&#x27;t at all!</li>
            <li> I clipped my hair with pins randomly on my head and could wear the wig without needing to worry about buying a wig cap!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> Ends are almost fried looking too but not as bad as you might think.</li>
            <li> And it ripped and now there is holes in the wig :(</li>
            <li> I can fix those problems, but I am still disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and i absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> color me disappointed!</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible!</li>
            <li> Worst wig I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I thought I will be disappointed because of the the price...but not at all!!</li>
            <li> I hate y&#x27;all and this!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very impressed with the quality of this wig for the price.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting too much but happily surprised.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and the wig is very long and nearly touches the bum. Looks overall very natural. I&#x27;ve bought a couple of other more expensive wigs and this one ranked up there on quality and fit.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It looks super fake and it wouldn&#x27;t fit my head right it looked weird.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Halloween costume - wasn&#x27;t expecting much since it was so cheap, but was surprised by the quality! I posted some photos joking that it was my new look and my friends actually thought I had dyed my hair &amp; purchased extensions! It&#x27;s nice how it comes with the wig cap and comb as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear in a community theater production.  It will work well for stage work, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for everyday wear.  It&#x27;s not quite as full at the bottom as I&#x27;d hoped, but the top is full and fits well.  Came with a comb and wig cap.  Overall, good quality for the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I had to throw this wig out! Absolutely terrible! Bangs are ridiculous, the hair tangles, and the curls fall out. It even makes your head look huge. Worst wig I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig. Looks exactly like the picture, voluminous, realistic. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. A couple things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The...part you put on your head? The inside cap thing not the actual hair obviously....anyway it is quite big. I have a big head and it is almost too big...but not quite! So it is perfect for me but someone with a small head may find this too large. Of course there are adjusters inside of it but that doesn&#x27;t change where it hits on your hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Like I said, it is exactly like pictured, but I don&#x27;t quite love how long it is. I think it is a bit excessive and makes it look more unrealistic. I am planning on cutting it about 4/5 inches. I am 6&#x27; and currently the hair reaches just past my breasts. Obviously this isn&#x27;t really a negative just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It had a lot of body when I first got it. I have collectively worn it maybe 3 hours/brushed it out once. The volume of the hair has definitely gone down since I first got it, but it is still better than a lot of wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Tangles really easily, like most long wigs. This is another reason I will be cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways so don&#x27;t worry go ahead and buy it I&#x27;m gonna be surprised if you are disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig for a Halloween costume and I was so impressed. It&#x27;s less expensive than wigs at most Halloween/costume shops, and so much better quality. I purchased the long, dark brown curly wave. I had people all night asking me if I was wearing extensions in my shoulder-length dark brown hair. The wig comes with a wig comb and cap, and has adjustable tension from within the wig so I was able to adjust for my tiny little head. At the end of the night, I didn&#x27;t want to take it off--I can see why people purchase this wig for daily wear. I&#x27;ve carefully packed it away until next Halloween...</li>
            <li> Oh I am so impressed. It fits so snugly and feels so secure. It&#x27;s VERY full and has very little shine. Soft. Arrived on expected delivery date. It&#x27;s s0 good length and is much fuller than expected. It parts well. It looks very natural on me. I am Caucasian and it matches my complexion well.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this wig after seeing a great review for it on youtube. However this one tangles so easily and honestly looks fake. As others have said, the cap is noticeable. Some of the tracks started loosening from the cap. This wig is better for halloween or a costume party. Definitely not for everyday use. It&#x27;s too bad but you do get what you pay for with this one!</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing, I just received it today looks SO REALISTIC. I just ordered a blonde wig from another company which was too thick and tangles like crazy and the bangs were horrific to try and figure out (I have to use hairspray to make it stay where I want) this wig has the bangs cut PERFECTLY. They blend in perfectly with the rest of the hair, it&#x27;s so long and has very beautiful waves/curls down towards the bottom. I am 4&#x27;9 and the wig comes down to my belly button. It&#x27;s not too thick and not too thin. It looks completely natural. About to order another wig from this company!!</li>
            <li> Wig is darker and fuller than it appears in picture but still a good wig.</li>
            <li> Would work for Halloween not for more though unless you want to put in a lot of work</li>
            <li> This is my first wig. &amp; honestly I was a tad bit scared to even buy it. Since I have a big head lol, I thought it wouldnt fit right. But once it camein the mail, I absolutely loved it! It fits great, its heat resistent (on low setting 350) &amp; its not so shiny. Its just a great wig overall.</li>
            <li> It worked well but you need to keep it on a wig stand. The bangs can be really bad since it is parted down the middle weird. All in all, it was fine</li>
            <li> product complies with the specifications</li>
            <li> I like it !! Good quality and looking naturally!</li>
            <li> very realistic and soft, comes with comb and wig cap, it feels and looks very natural</li>
            <li> Wow.  This is AMAZING.  So soft and gorgeous.  It looks great!  Very real looking and simply gorgeous!</li>
            <li> beautiful wig. absolutely love it</li>
            <li> The quality, texture and shine where pefect. It fits very nicely and I didn&#x27;t have to trim to wig.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped out really fast and the wig was in great condition when I recieved it. Great seller. Great Wigs.</li>
            <li> Love the wig but the part in the hairline always messes up... And it ripped and now there is holes in the wig :(</li>
            <li> Looks pretty good, Its a little awkward looking in the front part with the bang parting but other than that it is lovely!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a model in my upcoming runway show to better match the other models&#x27; hair.  I have many wigs and wear them regularly, and I have to say, this one is extremely nice quality.  It hardly shed at all when styling for the first time, it&#x27;s very soft and not too shiny.  It&#x27;s also very thick.  I&#x27;ll be keeping it for myself after the show, and my model likes it so much she will be buying one for herself as well.  As a nice bonus, it came with a wig cap and a wig comb (the packaging on the comb was a bit grungy, but the comb is cute and quite useful, I like it a lot).</li>
            <li> Great wig for the price. Heavy. Soft. Will need to be cut and/or trimmed a little to fit your face/personality but that&#x27;s with all wigs.</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations, constant shedding, dry synthetic texture, super unimpressed. won&#x27;t be making that mistake again. color me disappointed!</li>
            <li> The wig is very nice!Almost look like a real hair.My only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34;is that top of the wig is a little flat.I thought I will be disappointed because of the the price...but not at all!! I didn&#x27;t regret that I bought.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to shave my head, because my hair was pretty damaged.  I was looking for a wig to wear in public and found this one.  The other user pictures looked great, so I gave it a Try.  It came in a very nice packing with a wig comb and head cover and bookmark.  The wig was pretty much exactly like the pictures, dark brown was a ltitle lighter in color then I&#x27;d expected but still a beautiful color.  I&#x27;m 5&amp;#34;4 and the long wig comes to about mid back.  It&#x27;s a very full wig and very feminine.  The only criticism I have is that it tends to get tangled easily but for the price, it&#x27;s a fantastic wig, much better then I had expected.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a few more styles of this wig!</li>
            <li> Nevermind abt da refused i had received my package..  thank u i love it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying such a cheap wig. i just spent over 300 on my last one and it was HORRIBLE but this wig is AMAZING!!!!! You see is what you get. Its very comfortable not heavy has just the right amount of thickness. No one could even tell i was wearing a wig and all of my friends LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> So, this wig I bought mostly for fun. Try a wig, you know the drill. Regardless, the hair itself is very good looking but gets tangled easily. I am really sure the different colors are differently cut/ styled wigs. I chose the dark brown with a deep part. It just looks fake. No matter what. I actually took the time to reduce the straps inside the wig to reduce the size (it&#x27;s huge on my averagely small head.) then I trimmed it up and cut the bangs. I added some color for skin at the part. I just can&#x27;t get this one to look even slightly like normal hair. I could pull the entire wig over one ear while the other side sits right above the other ear;  that&#x27;s how big it is when it arrives. Regardless. It&#x27;s not a terrible wig for cosplay, you get a decent wig for a days/weeks worth of fun. If I get another wig, I will get a lace front wig with a realistic part. Best of luck, friends!</li>
            <li> Very thick and soft&lt;br /&gt;I straighten it&lt;br /&gt;crimp it&lt;br /&gt;curl it&lt;br /&gt;whatever i want and it holds up amazingly. The curls it comes with are gorgeous and both the wig cap(fishnet) and the wig comb that come with it work great. Not a lace front but the way the wefts are placed it looks very much like a lace front and nobody can tell its a wig! I love this wig. Surprisingly i like it even way better than a $150 wig i bought from another seller that was an actual lace wig.&lt;br /&gt;Im a cosmetologist who wear wigs on a daily basis and its perfect</li>
            <li> This lasted about a month with care but made my face more round which i wasn&#x27;t a fan</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with wigs and I am a licensed professional. I was stunned when I opened the very carefully packaged wig and saw how nice it was! I will definitely reorder from this company with no hesitation. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> As soon as I brought this hair out of the package I fell in love with it. The texture is lovely, very soft and silky. I&#x27;d buy this I&#x27;m another color.</li>
            <li> The wig is beautiful and I love it! It looks exactly as pictured. If I ever purchase another wig, it will be from this company. The product description advertises that it comes with a wig cap but it also comes with a wig comb which isn&#x27;t mentioned.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love the different look she can accomplish with using wig. her hair is short so wigs come in handy when going out. Gets many complements.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth hair. The skin part is not very visible, but still looks great. Very long, so i trimmed it a little. will be definitely buying another!!! Very fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I got the color I ordered. The wig fits perfectly on my head. It came with washing instructions and what the hair was made out of. It&#x27;s not real human hair but.. it looks n feels like real hair. And most of all loved the PRICE!!!!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent wig, I changed the part in it to the middle (it took a bit of work.</li>
            <li> My first wig and I love it! I still can&#x27;t believe how great the price was!</li>
            <li> This wig is just omg amazing. I am a performing artist and I like to switch my style often without too much dying for less damage. I wanted to go for a long and natural look like how it was before I cut it short and dyed it so many times. I can admit, I was very skeptical when buying it because I bought one before (from a different vendor and brand, of course), but it was my first time buying a wig and it just shed so much and was poorly put together. If I put the wig up in a half pony tail (top half of hair in a rubberband or scruchi) you could see the tracks and even when it was straight down you could see where the tracks were poorly assembled. I bought this one and it is ENTIRELY worth every dime. I am completely impressed. This wig was professionally assembled with full coverage and I can put it up in a half pony tail and the base has enough coverage to where it just looks real. It is amazing. I&#x27;ll be buying another in a different style soon.</li>
            <li> This wig is far superior to what I was expecting. I&#x27;m an avid cosplayer and usually spend at least twice this much on wigs (and generally more than that), but I needed something close to my natural color (after a TERRIBLE haircut) that would arrive quickly, so I took a chance on this and was pleasantly surprised by how thick and natural-looking it turned out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up trimming the ends a bit and working some dry shampoo into the scalp to cut down on shine and give it a more realistic look, but this wig is honestly great right out of the box. Plus it comes beautifully packaged and includes a wig cap and nice wig comb. It wouldn&#x27;t hold up to close scrutiny the way a truly high end wig would, but for what you&#x27;re paying, this is an amazing deal. Great for the average cosplayer or someone just looking to try a new style!</li>
            <li> cheaply made. actually had a hole in the back. gets tangled easy wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> A great wig for the price. Only issue is that long hair wigs tend to tangle easily, and this one is no exception. I received several comments about how real the hair looked--it is a natural-looking shine, not a fake-hair shine.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to LOVE this wig.  I like the dark rich brown color in the picture.  However when I received the wig It was light brown not dark almost black like the picture.  So, I ordered another one thinking it was an honest mistake an again I got a brown wig.. not dark brown. I returned both wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is very soft , long and curly. Exactly what I wanted , but the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for a fun change, it&#x27;s inexpensive as wigs go so I thought why not.  I was pleasantly surprised, it&#x27;s much better quality than I expected and I was very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This wig was close, but not quite what I thought I was getting from the picture. The bangs were far more prominent than they look in all the photo&#x27;s of this wig. I did not want bangs.</li>
            <li> It likes to keep getting tangled, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great wig. Just have to up keep it a lot</li>
            <li> Bought this to use when I model my hat&#x27;s. It nice and I like how long it is.</li>
            <li> I ordered the long dark brown fp710 and I got a light brown/red.  It appeared so much darker in the photo shown above.  Also, I specifically got the wig for the side swoop bang on the left side of the face as shown in the picture and it was  reversed.  I can fix those problems, but I am still disappointed.  I think they sent me the wrong wig but I am not going through the hassle of returning it.  So beware that you may have to deal with that.  Maybe light brown red is really the color or someone at the factory made an honest mistake.  I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a pretty wig.  OMG! The hair is beautifully soft with luxurious bouncy curls.  I&#x27;ll have fun with this wig regardless.  Great for photo shoots and cosplays.  You can wear it daily, if you know how to create a realistic look to the bang near the root of the wig.  It&#x27;s definitely an outstanding wig for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could buy ten of these in the right color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig for a great price. I will enjoy wearing it very much!&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with larger heads, I would think twice about buying this wig.</li>
            <li> The hair is BEAUTIFUL. Probably one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon. Very pretty, very bouncy and doesn&#x27;t tangle very much. My only problem with this one is that the crown doesn&#x27;t sit right... it kind of pops up in a weird way. I like wearing it with hats. Haha.</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, the hair was beautiful. It was NOT shiny at all. Beautiful long hair. I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and it came 2 inches below my breasts. Colour was a nice dark brown. Felt realistic. LOVED playing with the hair. Didn&#x27;t tangle for me at all. No shedding for me. Very thick hair but it was breathable. It didn&#x27;t feel like I had a wig on. The only problem that I had with it was that it didn&#x27;t look natural on the top. If I wore a beanie, it looked super natural. Everyone that saw me with a beanie with the hair thought it was natural. Once I took it off, they told me that it was super noticeable that it was a wig.Wish the top construction could have been better!!! I placed an order for a lace front wig. Hopefully, Ill have better luck. Good luck! Cheers! x</li>
            <li> He needed it for a video where he had to do different characters and it got the job done.  I guess we could have gotten a cheap 5-dollar wig for that.  This is a high quality wig.</li>
            <li> its really pretty i love it</li>
            <li> This is a really stunning wig for the price. I couldn&#x27;t find a single spot where the cap weave showed through. If anything, this is really my only complaint, because the hair was so thick at the top and sides that it looked comically voluminous on my head, especially compared to the wispier curls at the bottom. Also beware, this wig is LONG. It came down almost to my butt and I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 8&amp;#34;. The cap was also a bit snug for me on the loosest clasp, but I have a giant egg head so that wasn&#x27;t entirely unexpected. It should fit fine for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an FYI, the wig is really more of a dark chestnut color? There is quite a bit of a red undertone (more maroon I guess) to this wig. Also, be sure to play around with it! It&#x27;s cheap, so why not risk it and do it yourself? I ended up chopping lots of length off of this and adjusting the bangs and it looks great. Also, I straightened out some kinks from shipping with a flat iron on the lowest setting and didn&#x27;t melt, friz or fray one hair. The synthetic hair on this one can stand up to quite a bit. One problem is that it has a tendency to tangle, but a bit of detangler or dry shampoo and patience with a comb and you can undo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a pretty amazing wig for under twenty dollars. Heck, for under a HUNDRED dollars! The volume may not make this an everyday wear for me, because it just doesn&#x27;t look all that casual, but for a night out the va-va-voom of this wig would make it a stunner. I was skeptical about a cheapo wig from China but they impressed me!</li>
            <li> Such a pretty wig.  Good quality and looks very nice on.  Will order again due to the nice price!!!!</li>
            <li> Wiga has dull amount of hair, dark brown is a lil dark looking bit what I expected. Look pritty real bit I am going to trim it as it is very long and the very ends tangle slightly. But over all I am very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Ripped me off!! Didn&#x27;t even delivery it to me! I hate y&#x27;all and this!!! Wasted my money!!</li>
            <li> It looks real enough if you wear a hat with it, and only if you wear a hat with it. It&#x27;s my first wig- and it&#x27;s good enough. When I&#x27;m done with it I&#x27;m going to give it to my daughter to play dress up with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, however way too long to the point of looking fake.  Maybe if cut a few inches it would look a little better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is good enough to wear in the light of day.  It doesn&#x27;t quite look real enough for that.... BUT for the price it still gets 5 stars because indoors it look wonderful.  It&#x27;s long and soft and sexy.  Great fit and doesn&#x27;t slide around, comfortable to wear.  I cut some off the bottom to make it more realistic.  I didn&#x27;t see that as a negative because there was plenty of hair to customize it to your needs.  The bangs are perfect, the color was nice, the layers are great.  I sprayed dry shampoo on it to try to loose the extra shine fake hair has.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice wig especially for the price. The hair is silky and looks pretty real. A great wig for cosplay!</li>
            <li> I ordered it in curly dark brown, but it&#x27;s more of a red/light brown, the color looks really beautiful on me though. The wig looks natural and I adore the style and soft curls. Will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the quality of this wig considering the price. I&#x27;ve bought wigs that were more expensive and were lesser quality. The construction of the cap is excellent and the comfort band on the front is an added extra.&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear an average size and this wig does fit very snug. I feel confident knowing that this wig would will not come off accidentally. If you wear a large size I would not recommend this one for you. The hair is very silky feeling and very long.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this item 4 stars instead of five is because of the confusion on the item numbers. They really need to give a better explanation of what each item number means. I thought I was getting a more full but instead I got one that was more flat to the head. (I mistakenly assumed that the numbers were different lengths of hair).&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived quickly and in good condition. I would buy another MelodySusie wig in a different style.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for a play I was in for the weekend : Fiddler on the roof. So I didnt want to pay too much. I was very happy with this wig. It was lightweight and I love the color ( I ordered dark brown ) . The bangs and the top of the back was easy to take care of, but the bottom wavy part was hard to keep from tangling .. Next time I am going to order the straight one. If we do this play again. So I gave this wig a 4 star!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Trish</li>
            <li> Im mixed and was trying to grow out my hair while looking pretty so bought this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it very much looks real lastrd a long time without , any washes partied wjth this wig and it still looked great</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, but then when I received it today, I was super disappointed. The bangs are really short compared to the pic, and there is a layer in the front half way down the wig which makes it look weird. Also it is really thin at the bottom and thick at the top so it makes you look like a mushroom head! I know I didn&#x27;t pay a whole lot, but I have bought a wig from another seller and I actually paid a little less for that but got such an amazing one from them! Will definitely be returning this one and buying something from L-email instead. Much better quality, look and great prices. This was just false advertising with the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of the wig.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig.  Length is probably too long for me, but can have it cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It is a wig and looks like one around the hairline. Would be great for a costume or cosplay. The hair itself looks real. Apparently I have a big head; I had a hard time getting it to stay on properly.</li>
            <li> sheds but I love it lasted me a month and a half</li>
            <li> I just got this wig today so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity,  but my god is it beautiful!!! I put up pictures on facebook with it on and people thought it was my real hair (just much more voluptuous and stunning)!! My hair has been steadily thinning since my mid teens and it&#x27;s been a constant source of stress for me. People with normal/thick hair maybe don&#x27;t realize how difficult it is to feel feminine and truly beautiful without it. I don&#x27;t base my happiness on my hair, but it does make me very self conscious. I won&#x27;t be wearing this wig every day but it was great to live a day in the life of someone with fabulous locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit of adjusting once the wig cap and wig are on your head but eventually looks right. This is my first wig so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m putting it on correctly. The length of the wig is outrageous, but it can be trimmed to whatever length suits you best. I think I prefer having that option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- realistic coloring and texture&lt;br /&gt;- beautiful shape/cut&lt;br /&gt;- looks very natural (I got the dark brown curly one)&lt;br /&gt;- packaged properly&lt;br /&gt;- price is unbeatable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- not sure of the longevity&lt;br /&gt;- tangles/gets tousled quite easily at the bottom&lt;br /&gt;- not very easy to secure to the head (this may just be my problem as I&#x27;m a total novice, but there weren&#x27;t any instructions included that I could find)&lt;br /&gt;- the bang/fringe is intensely thick. The way it hangs right in front of one of my eyes is enough to keep me from wearing it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;- parting the hair is a bit difficult. I&#x27;ve only tried moving the bangs from one direction to the other and they did move...it just didn&#x27;t look quite right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent first wig to buy. It was cheap, looks beautiful, and gave me a great sense of confidence while wearing it. And I got a TON of compliments.</li>
            <li> very soft at first, mine was damaged after 2 weeks, but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Great for everyday use</li>
            <li> Looks nice and is great quality however this wig sheds a LOT. More than other wigs with cheaper quality and cheaper cost.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEEEEEEEE this wig. It did not tangle easily and looks really natural with side part, or even a middle part.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I ordered dark brown and it wasa lot lighter than what I thought it would&#x27;ve been. It feels nice, however it tangled very easily. I spent about 30 minutes combing it through. I cut about three inches off which helped a lot. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be wearing this wig outside.</li>
            <li> I was expecting dark brown. It came light brown.</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast and the packaging was very neat. The wig looked just like the picture, so what you see is what you get. I am very satisifyed with this product.</li>
            <li> I love love love this wig. It is my first and it came with the cap and brush. My only beef with it is it&#x27;s not dark brown it&#x27;s burgandy. But I love the burgandy color.</li>
            <li> An absolutely amazing wig. Very well made, very thick and it doesn&#x27;t tangle easily. Very easy to manage and it&#x27;s incredibly durable. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really move the hair in any direction... Also the bangs are really messed up. Tangles really easily. It looks real in pictures but for me having long hair already it was hard to put on.</li>
            <li> For the price this is great. It doesn&#x27;t comb out, it will look like dreads if you try that. It&#x27;s so cheap I&#x27;m just going to order another one every two weeks instead of investing my time and money into washing and combing products that don&#x27;t work. I love the look of it fresh out of the box!</li>
            <li> The wig is dark brown, almost a black color. My only complaint about this wig is the fact that I look ridiculous wearing it because the bangs are seriously messed up! I don&#x27;t know how to explain the fuzzy stiffness of the bangs where the synthetic hair parts. Definitely look at the reviews on this item. I took a chance on it and it failed.</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT buy, especially for the price! It was super long and hard to manage, but I took about 4&amp;#34; off the bottom and it&#x27;s the perfect length for me and doesn&#x27;t tangle nearly as easily! I am going to go ahead and order the straight one, too.</li>
            <li> As a person who wears wigs for religious reasons I was very happy with the way the wig looked and felt. I was dissapointrd though I got the wrong color and cut. So I would return it and I am not a fan of the way the top looks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this wig for a cosplay because it is amazing for the price. There are absolutely no tangles when I run my fingers through it like real hair, it&#x27;s very soft and keeps its texture, and I can confirm that it is heat resistant.</li>
            <li> This was nice but it sided a lot and got tangle very easy.</li>
            <li> It feels like real hair, full and thick. this is the 10 which is supposed to be most real like. It isn&#x27;t extra shiny and I fits well on my head. I won&#x27;t buy any other brand of wig of course that is within this price range. this is a wig that I WILL wear out for fun..not just as a halloween costume or cosplay. I absolutely love this wig. I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This is a great cosplay wig. Looks much better than cheesy costume wigs for about the same price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> First off I just want to say that I have a small collection of wigs that I started last year. They all have clips attached to the wig and they all start to hurt my scalp after wearing them more than four hours from the clips. I purchased this wig because I had some left of cash on my gift card and it turned out to be a great idea. I got it in the mail during lunch and slapped it on and went back to work. This wig is sooo soft, life like and just perfect. Everyone wanted to touch it. Even a co worker went online and bought her own. Best part is there is no clips so it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its going to fall off either. Super amazing I say. Buy it. You wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS WIG TO WEAR COUPLE TIME JUZ FOR THE HECK OF IT BUT I ENDED UP WEARING ALMOST EVERYDAY! GREAT LENGTH ,GREAT COLOR AND GREAT STYLING BUT U MAY NEED TO SNIP IT HERE N THERE TO MAKE IT SUITABLE TO UR FACE. IF U NEED TO BLOW IT OUT ON LOW  SETTING IT LOOKS GREAT VERY DURABLE WIG IF U KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF A WIG!</li>
            <li> i opened the package and my expectations were not only met and far more displayed in every good way. The wig was a full head of hair and i very good length. It brought a cap to use for the wig and it had adjustable straps as well. The letter from the seller was especially nice, it showed how much the consumer is important to the seller. (:</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing for as cheap as it is. It looks incredibly natural, but it didn&#x27;t fit my head very well and got reallllllly tangled easily during only 1 use. I will try some wig conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;They included a wig net to hold the wig, a cap that might fit a doll or child but not an adult human, and a great comb. I will buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Good quality but too thick on top. I cant seem to make bangs hang properly.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This wig is very natural looking. I have naturally blonde hair so this color was a little too bold for me. But it&#x27;s good for daily wear. Very think and full</li>
            <li> I must say, this was my first wig purchase. I have short hair and i absolutely hate it. I wanted a long hair wig and i got this wig after alot and ALOT of research on wigs.&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to get this wig, and as soon as i got it out, i put it on a wig stand.&lt;br /&gt;Then i realized something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig basically looks like this.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a short hair wig all around, with about 5 strands of long curly hair attached only on the very back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, i didnt think that it would look like this. I sat down next to my wig and thought for a long time what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to cut the back tangled curls off and style it into a short haired wig. That was the only way to make it manageable. The hair is very soft, 100% kanekalon, and a dark brown color. I really love this wig short, because i know how to cut hair nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that i bought this wig and i absolutely love it but i have to say, the style of the wig made it hard for me to keep the back part and i ended up cutting it because it looked so fake and unnatural. Now, it looks very natural like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like this kind of style, go ahead. Its great. But for those who want normal long haired wig, try something else.</li>
            <li> This wig looks just like real hair. Some wigs look too shiny and are obviously fake, this one does not have that problem, even in full sunlight it still looks like my natural hair.  When I first put it on of course some adjustments were needed.  There was a little bit of short hair sticking out in the bangs and made it look like I was wearing a wig, however once I clipped them it took on a natural look.  I use a large tooth comb to keep the hair from getting tangled and it works fine, no other special products are needed so far.  The adjustment straps in the headpiece work perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to wear a wig once in awhile to change things up and I have recommended this to all my friends.  I do not know how it would hold up to everyday wear, but it would probably need a lot of maintenance.  I will never buy a store bought wig again, I will only be purchasing similar products in the future.</li>
            <li> This wig really isn&#x27;t all that bad for the price. It&#x27;s actually pretty soft. However, it has a lot of bangs to it. So much that the bangs make it look fake. If I don&#x27;t wear a hat, you can absolutely tell that I have a wig on.</li>
            <li> Flattering wig, lots of compliments. Extra care with maintenance of it, such as slow combing and daily detangler. Would love for it to be sold in a variety of colors with highlight options (such as (1B/4, 2/4, 1/4, etc...)</li>
            <li> After reading tons of reviews i decided to buy the wig and keep my hopes high. When it arrived I was delighted and tore it open to find neatly packed inside, a mesh hair cap (I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it as it didnt work well), a wig comb (as many other reviewers have stated it was dirty and scratched up), and the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself was okay and just about that. The texture and material that makes up the synthetic hair is remarkably realistic and beautiful however the wig itself has an odd shape and doesn&#x27;t sit well on the head (it gave me a mushroom head to the max). I was able to fix this with hair pins but ideally i wouldn&#x27;t want to deal with styling my wig with so much fuss everyday.</li>
            <li> This wig is not full enough to be believable unless you naturally have this hair. I have sewn in some synthetic extensions I wasn&#x27;t using and now it is absolutely full and believable. Did have to cut the bangs as well seen as how the covered half my face. LOL.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as pictured. I really like the wig, it almost looks real. I used it for a halloween costume.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this wig. I recently cut my hair short and wanted something to keep my neck warm, and to give a little variety to my looks. This fit the ticket wonderfully. It&#x27;s relatively sturdy (if you understand that the wig is made from synthetics and is simply prone to frizz/tangling) and the styling is nice. The version I got goes all the way down to my waist! It&#x27;s the hair length I always wanted but never had the patience to achieve naturally.&lt;br /&gt;Took off one star because it&#x27;s fairly large on my head (though snug with the adjustable band at the base of the back), and can make my head look rounder than it is. I&#x27;d buy this again though - much better quality than anything else this price.</li>
            <li> This wig is so cute and comfortable! Not too shiny like other wigs I have ordered too. Can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s a wig and it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The wig i got was the long brown curly one. I am impressed with what I got. Very happy. And I got a free bookmark. Can&#x27;t complain about that.</li>
            <li> Love love love it looks great on me!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig! I was extremely skeptical at first because I have never worn a wig before. I thought it would look noticeably fake but it doesn&#x27;t at all! People tell me if I had not told them it&#x27;s a wig, they would have never known&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s beautiful and long, alot longer than I thought when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig not for health reasons but because I needed it for a costume. I had previously purchased a fake synthetic wig at a costume store but wasn&#x27;t happy with it. I really wanted something that looked real and would hold up so I could wear it again and again. What I like about this wig for one is the price, especially after looking else where not only on other websites but also on Amazon. After trying the wig on it fit perfectly and looked JUST like real hair. If I wore this out, not one would guess that it wasn&#x27;t my real hair expect of course my friends and family. I love the color of the wig and the little curls which have a &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; to them. My wig also came with a comb and a wig cap which some on here said they didn&#x27;t get. All in all, if you&#x27;re someone who needs a wig for health reasons, I would highly suggest purchasing one of these. You can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
            <li> Best wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Loved everything about it. Looked completely real. Even the hair part. Color was gorgeous. Wore it everyday for about 2 months and it was starting to get super hard to brush at the ends. Looked like split ends. Had to cut it shoulder link to look better after 2 months. Not good for very long but loved the wig.</li>
            <li> It looked beautiful out of the package and felt very soft. The color was also beautiful. However I wore less than 7 times and barely touched/wore it in general. Hair started to fall out and the wig tangled so easily the special comb couldn&#x27;t save it. I must have got a defect. Returned.</li>
            <li> The dark brown was actually light brown t which sucked. I would have like combs on the inside of the wig for a more tight fit. I suggest adding combs into the wig because it might be to big for you. as it was for me. The wigs was super long so i cut it to the length that i wanted. Other then that it was okay. the wig actually looks better in the picture  then on me but then again it was light brown. It takes heat well just make sure the heat is not super hot. The hair does not take a curling tool at all it can not curl. I tried a lot of times to get the hair to curl and it just wouldn&#x27;t. The package came on time and it included everything that is promised for the hair.</li>
            <li> i really like it except it is a little bit shiny. it is soft and looks like natural human hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a play item for my child.  She loves it.  It tangles very easily though.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig if you wear it only once, after one time use the front of the wig lining started showing. It tangled quickly, and started to frizz as soon as i took it out of the package. I gave it three stars because the first time i wore it; it looked like real hair not a wig.</li>
            <li> Way way way way better than I had even hoped! The wig is of delightful quality, nicer than some wigs I&#x27;ve spent thrice as much on. My long distance family all thought it was my actual hair! The shipping was super so speedy too and it comes with one of those nice wig caps that has the openings on both sides. I will definitely buy from this person again!</li>
            <li> It looked beautiful out of the box, put it on my head and it was gorgeous It got a kink in it only a few minutes of wearing.. the very next day it had tons of kinks and it got very tough to comb. This is good if you&#x27;re only going to use it for halloween but it gets tangled very easily. So sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;I bought a detangler and it works a little but its too late for this wig, its now busted at the top of it (theres a hole). The wig is now itchy and still tangly, man :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it sits pretty oddly with how the bangs are parted. Though, it could just be my face structure. :P Still love it, though! It&#x27;s very soft and looks very real. (:</li>
            <li> This was my first wig purchase ever!  I bought it early to wear to a con I&#x27;m going to with a friend in May!  I was really surprised.  It looks SO real.  I feel like I could wear this daily and get nothing but compliments!  Mine had that black cap already in it and it is re adjustable.  I clipped my hair with pins randomly on my head and could wear the wig without needing to worry about buying a wig cap!  Anyways, if you are looking to buy a wig I recommend this one 100%!  I think I&#x27;m becoming addicted!</li>
            <li> Wrong wig the color was too light brown. Felt like doll hair, cut my fingers on the hair.</li>
            <li> Placed my order Oct. 19 received the item Oct. 24 so it got to me pretty early which is good. OMG this wig is the BOMB.COM it is so soft the color is awesome and it was what I order. The quality is phenemenol for the price. This wig is better than a lot of beauty store wig I have bought. LOVE IT!!! Will be ordering again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST synthetic wig I ever had</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality! It looked so real that all of my friends thought I dyed my hair!!</li>
            <li> Love this wig!!! Yes, you can buy higher quality wigs, but probably for three times as much money. I initially just bought this for Halloween, but now I totally wear it anywhere! Yes, it does tangle easily, but the comb that is included does a great job if you are patient. I sometimes spray some leave in conditioner while I&#x27;m combing.</li>
            <li> I asked for dark brown and they sent me light brown. Did not even open it as this needs to go back asap!</li>
            <li> Beautiful Long wavy believable wig. Compares to units I&#x27;ve spent 75.00 -300.00 for!  I get lot&#x27;s of compliments on my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;...  people tell me they would never believe it was a wig, until I told them. Very Light Light shedding, only when brushed. No fake shine, like most synthetics. Color is gorgeous. I got Dark brown and Light brown.  Since It&#x27;s so very long, use a wig spray detangler each night when you take it off and put it away, and it will keep the ends soft. It is heat friendly, so you can smooth the ends down every few weeks with your flat iron, and it will not damage it.  I love mine, so this is the reason, this is the third one I have purchased, and most definitely not the last. I hope you enjoy yours as much as I have mine. You won&#x27;t regret your purchase. When you receive the pretty little pink box, professionally packaged, you will be able to tell the difference at once! :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig which is wearable right out of the package.  I have a ton of natural hair which is hidden completely by this wig AND no tracts to be seen. I would feel comfortable (sexy even!) to wear this wig out during the day! Im ordering another today!</li>
            <li> Tangled and got frizzy</li>
            <li> Worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li> It came so well packaged. Shipping was fast, I loved how the wig came with a brush and a mesh wig cap. I dont think I completely understand the lower star ratings from other users, because the wig itself out of the box looks okay, but I trimmed and fixed it to match my face and people thought it to be my real hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn it a few times, and because it is so long it does start to tangle, but I have yet to wash it.</li>
            <li> Low shine so the hair looks very real. Very little shedding of hair, I love this wig</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a bit unsure when buying a wig under 20 dollars, since I&#x27;ve had bad experiences in the past with cheap wigs; but I am happy to say that this wig is nothing like those! The wig is soft and comfortable to wear. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for an hour now and I haven&#x27;t even started to itch! Of course, the wig is a bit shiny, but it doesn&#x27;t look completely unreal, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to get the shine out of it such as using dry conditioner or something (I&#x27;ll figure it out later haha). I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet but I am more than excited to. I&#x27;ll do so when it&#x27;s not so windy though, no one likes a tangled wig! You can style this into a low pony tail, arrange the bangs how you want, hell you can go ahead and cut it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be fine. I haven&#x27;t applied heat yet but I&#x27;m sure there are other reviews of people who have. Either way, this is a really good, affordable buy! I suggest you invest in it if you want a good, strong wig that doesn&#x27;t shed for everyday (or cosplay) use!</li>
            <li> I just received my wig and i am in love! Its amazing and it looks great!&lt;br /&gt;Just what i wanted 😄😄😄</li>
            <li> This wig is surprisingly good for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;Being synthetic hair, it does have a bit more shine than real hair and it tangles a bit easier. The included wig comb helps get those strands in place.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to note that if this fake hair pokes you in the eye it hurts more than real hair lol&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on long term wear because I bought this wig purely to wear a few minutes a day. I help my grandmother with my grandfather who has Alzheimers and in order for him to stay at home he has to take his medicine, and he won&#x27;t take it from us! So I come each day in a wig and fake glasses as his &#x27;nurse&#x27; and he takes his pills. So I only wear this maybe 15 minutes a day. It works perfectly for this.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with hair loss due to disease for the past few years. I finally got tired of being insecure and ordered myself a wig for my birthday. I must say that I love this wig and have been wearing it everyday. My only issues are that it constantly tangles and that it slips off my head easily, but perhaps that is because I have a weird head shape. After a few days of wearing this wig in curly dark brown, I have received more compliments on my hair than I have in years! Also, I do not use the wig cap, I just apply the wig right over my hair, which is the same color so it blends in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping&lt;br /&gt;Looks Real&lt;br /&gt;nice quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Tangles super easily&lt;br /&gt;does not stay on head well</li>
            <li> I just trimed some of the areas. The wig cap slips back, but it&#x27;s managable.</li>
            <li> Edit: dropping the rating by one star because after light wear for about an hour this wig tangled horribly. Thats a common complaint ive noticed aboit this wig. Other than that its great and i straightened it with my straightener at 350° with no meltibg or fraying or frizziness. I wish there were more colors other than browns and blacks because I would buy them all. You can&#x27;t see the cap underneath at all, it&#x27;s very full and thick. No shedding so far. It could definitely pass for real hair. In the past wigs I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon were thinning and they shed, you could see the cap completely under the hair. I&#x27;m VERY happy with this wig. The color is also the same as pictured.</li>
            <li> The wig I got definitely wasn&#x27;t dark brown it was a bright copper color and I&#x27;m pissed</li>
            <li> Arrived the day of respected shipping date estimated. The box was a bit damaged and the top&lt;br /&gt;Of the bangs were &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; looking I just hope my bf doesn&#x27;t notice cause he doesn&#x27;t know I&#x27;m bald. The curls are nice. Ends are almost fried looking too but not as bad as you might think. Looks used. Still in good condition tho. Even though it&#x27;s not used. I love it on me but the bangs are retarded so I sweep them&lt;br /&gt;Over brade them&lt;br /&gt;And pin them&lt;br /&gt;With a bobby clip and it looks ok. Overal I like it on but it&#x27;s not the best wig I&#x27;ve ever had. Give it an 8 out of ten. Good for price I guess. Wearing it to prom so I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments with this wig!</li>
            <li> I got this wig so that I could be a brunette whenever I want... Because I am platinum blonde and it took a long time to get my hair blonde and healthy I didn&#x27;t want to dye it. But anyways This wig is AMAZING!!! It&#x27;s extremely long and beautiful. Everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair! Best $20 I ever spent! And I can be blonde and then brunette every other day :) best of both worlds!</li>
            <li> It doesnt exactly look like the photo except its the same color. The top of the wig has WAY too many layers so its very &#x27;poofy&#x27; . It almost looks like a weird mullet or one of those scene kids haircuts. Also, it may look better with anyone with a larger face, but if you have a small little head this wig looks ridiculous. I mean, unless you&#x27;re okay with that look? But I definitely was not going for it and will probably never wear it unless I have a hat on.</li>
            <li> Longer then i expected. looks good and is perfect for my Samantha Winchester cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;when I wore this the other day it was extremely  poofy and everyone could tell it was a wig.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an avid wig wearer or anything but this thing is legit!  Blows Halloween store-bought wigs out of the water.  It is a full head of hair, shiny, exactly as pictured.  It comes with a wig cap and a wig comb.  The only thing I would change about it (and I have found this to be true for every wig ever) is that it&#x27;s a little too full at the crown of the head for my taste -- but I suppose that&#x27;s better than it being too thin.  Def worth $20!</li>
            <li> This is by far the NICEST wig I have ever bought. It is perfect for my Cyclops cosplay and looks fantastic on me. I also got it extremely quickly. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I like this wig minus the way it looks at the top. It makes my head look big but overall it fits perfectly. I have tried curling it using water &amp; a curling iron I can confirm that it curls. I will definitely be buying another one. :)</li>
            <li> I was sceptical. A synthetic wig, under $20, that actually looked nice &amp; stayed nice? According to reviews, it was true, so I had to try. I suffer from psoriasis,  and it&#x27;s worse in the cold months, this year worst yet, having gone from a shiny, healthy, full head of naturally almost black hair, falling to mid back this summer, to dry, brittle, and with over half my hair fallen out by Christmas. I have had to modify this wig some, eliminating the doll hair shine, trimming bangs as well as some of the length, and layering out some of the volume, (it is an extremely full wig, but a bonus in my opinion, as there is more room to personalize it!) But straight out of the package, it looked...real. I got engaged this past year, started work in a very public and appearance focused field, and my hair had gotten so bad, and I was so self conscious and depressed, I had turned into almost a recluse. This wig changed that, and I was my normal, cheerful and happy self again. Again, it takes some adjusting and modifying to get it just right, but it&#x27;s the best deal I&#x27;ve ever seen, and it looks wonderful. Just check out my photo, I had new promo shots done, with my &amp;#34;new hair!&amp;#34;</li>
