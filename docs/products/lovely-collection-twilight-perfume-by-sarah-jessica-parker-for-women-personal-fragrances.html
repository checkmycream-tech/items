    <ol>
            <li>All of the Sarah Jessica Parker perfumes sold by amazon are wonderful.</li>
            <li>She was that happy!</li>
            <li>This perfume is beautifully crafted.  </li>
            <li>I was ordering the scent &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; and saw all the great customer reviews on &amp;#34;Twilight&amp;#34; which I had never tried before.</li>
            <li>It smells great and</li>
            <li>At these great prices I can wear it every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy now.</li>
            <li>Smelled good in the bottle &amp; on the paper strip, not with my chemistry.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of this fragrance before, but since I have loved the Twilight Movie Series I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>She loved it...</li>
            <li>she is an Opium woman and was super happy about this!</li>
            <li>Wife was very pleased with it after all</li>
            <li>I love all SJP fragrances!  </li>
            <li>Light musk scent great fall scent</li>
            <li>i give it a 1 star for being on time and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>I liked it more and more.  </li>
            <li>I Love It</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a much better deal buying through Amazon anyway.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent...</li>
            <li>I love it and how it makes me feel.</li>
            <li>My favorite SJP scent.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I bought</li>
            <li>I gladly wear it when I am out and about or to work.</li>
            <li>Sensual, mysterious fragrance... perfect for night</li>
            <li>I love this perfume by Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was too strong, but as she wore it</li>
            <li>The price is super on amazon!</li>
            <li>Very strong, a bit overwhelming (flowery and woody), seemed more like it&#x27;s a mature scent (50s+).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this perfume locally and was happy to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and vanilla...</li>
            <li>It is light and feminine and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The Dawn smells lightly floral and clean, and the Twilight has a bit of a spicy scent to it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, &amp;#34;Twilight&amp;#34; is a fabulous, reminiscent and powdery smell!</li>
            <li>Just my opinion on those, but for a new scent Twilight is a fun and unique one to try.  </li>
            <li>I have many of SJP&#x27;s products but this is one of my top two scents...not to heavy or flowery...</li>
            <li>Over an hour later, I smell incense and musk, almost like Egyptian musk, but very light with a smoky scent almost burnt odor on me.</li>
            <li>Test Twilight on your skin first before buying.</li>
            <li>I love Sarah Jessica but this product fragrance does not have a lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>It goes on strong and is a very unusual scent, so I would definitely agree with the reviewer who said try it before you buy it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Definitely test it out first before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>later, I smelled a little jasmine, thought was going to get better.</li>
            <li>Personally, I would not buy a random new fragrance as a gift for someone, but this one ended up being a very nice surprise.</li>
            <li>it smelled old and wife threw it away.</li>
            <li>Had a little bit of a sweet smell, perhaps a flower or fruit</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was ordering the scent &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34; and saw all the great customer reviews on &amp;#34;Twilight&amp;#34; which I had never tried before. So I ordered them both. I&#x27;m so glad I did, &amp;#34;Twilight&amp;#34; is a fabulous, reminiscent and powdery smell!</li>
            <li> I Love It, I wish they still carried it at Kohl&#x27;s, that&#x27;s where I used to buy it but it&#x27;s a much better deal buying through Amazon anyway.  Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this perfume locally and was happy to find it here on Amazon.  It smells great and the business I bought it from not only gave me the perfume but lotion as well (which I didn&#x27;t notice in the description of the product when I bought it).  I would definitely buy from this business again.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this as a gift and I thought it was too strong, but as she wore it I liked it more and more.  It goes on strong and is a very unusual scent, so I would definitely agree with the reviewer who said try it before you buy it.  It is not as annoying or even long lasting as some of the sweeter scents are like Eternity or Tresor that last at least until you shower them off.  Just my opinion on those, but for a new scent Twilight is a fun and unique one to try.  Personally, I would not buy a random new fragrance as a gift for someone, but this one ended up being a very nice surprise.</li>
            <li> i give it a 1 star for being on time and packaged nicely. However, the sprayer on perfume bottle doesn&#x27;t work. and with perfume through amazon you can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Love this scent...I have many of SJP&#x27;s products but this is one of my top two scents...not to heavy or flowery...for me it&#x27;s light and vanilla...</li>
            <li> Test Twilight on your skin first before buying. Smelled good in the bottle &amp; on the paper strip, not with my chemistry. Very strong, a bit overwhelming (flowery and woody), seemed more like it&#x27;s a mature scent (50s+). When it dried, about 15 mins. later, I smelled a little jasmine, thought was going to get better. Had a little bit of a sweet smell, perhaps a flower or fruit I&#x27;m not familiar with-reminded me of Suave&#x27;s Balsam Protein conditioner from years ago. Then it got worse, reminded me of Wella Balsam conditioner &amp; I hate that smell as it smells more like roach/bug spray to me. Washed it off, scent is still there. Over an hour later, I smell incense and musk, almost like Egyptian musk, but very light with a smoky scent almost burnt odor on me. Definitely test it out first before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> All of the Sarah Jessica Parker perfumes sold by amazon are wonderful. The fragrances are subtle, yet last all day long. The price is super on amazon! I stocked up and bought several of each fragrance!</li>
            <li> it smelled old and wife threw it away.</li>
            <li> This perfume is beautifully crafted.  It is light and feminine and not overpowering.  I love it and how it makes me feel.</li>
            <li> Light musk scent great fall scent, luv Jessica scents.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Doesn&#x27;t last. Vanishes within 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Has a similar scent as &#x27;Navy&#x27;. Made by &amp;#34;Coty&amp;#34; cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I love Sarah Jessica but this product fragrance does not have a lasting fragrance. I will try another fragrance b</li>
            <li> My favorite SJP scent.</li>
            <li> Ilove this stuff and so does my husband. As long as they sell it I will buy it. At these great prices I can wear it every day.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this fragrance before, but since I have loved the Twilight Movie Series I thought I would give it a try.  I was not dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I love all SJP fragrances!  I have both Dawn and Twilight.  They&#x27;re light and fresh.  The Dawn smells lightly floral and clean, and the Twilight has a bit of a spicy scent to it.  I get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> This is one of my Mothers favorite and I am unable to find it any where in town...  She loved it...</li>
            <li> I like this perfume because it has a musky smell to it. I like it and I am glad that I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to other women who like musk perfumes. I gladly wear it when I am out and about or to work.</li>
            <li> This is a fantasic scent. Wife was very pleased with it after all she is an Opium woman and was super happy about this! I will be buying her another bottle. She was that happy! Thanks</li>
            <li> Sensual, mysterious fragrance... perfect for night</li>
            <li> I love this perfume by Sarah Jessica Parker. I had bought one about 3-4 years ago at JC Penny and have been on the lookout for it recently to no avail. I searched it on Amazon and WALLA....there it is. It was considerably less than what I paid a few years back. I&#x27;m happy now.</li>
