            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was legit, but decided to give it time and see if it would help my skin.  And I&#x27;m very happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely problematic skin, even in my mid-30s.  When I&#x27;ve had facials, I add the glycolic peel because the enzymes work really well with my skin.  The last aesthetician I saw recommended Vivete&#x27;s exfoliating facial scrub and I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times/week for a good 6 months.  It works wonderfully.  When I ran out of daily cleanser, I wanted to try Vivete&#x27;s daily cleanser, and decided to take a risk that it might have been a knock-off and bought on Amazon to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using this product, the only thing I changed was my daily cleanser.  I continued to use the same toner and moisturizer I had been using (not Vivete).  Within a couple days, I ran out of moisturizer, and used up whatever oil-free moisturizer I had at home (2-3 different ones), again to save money.  Big mistake.  I never let my skin even itself out by changing moisturizers, which lead to a lot of break-outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to frequently switching moisturizers, the weather had been excrutiatingly humid where I live.  I have large pores so I was sweating a lot (not \\&quot;glistening\\&quot;).  Between the humidity and moisturizer craziness, I think this cleanser did not have time to fully do what it does and have the effect I see now.  I have since found a daily oil-free moisturizer (not Vivete) that works well with this line and my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story long, patience with a line I KNEW worked for me the past has certainly paid off.  My face has cleared up immensely.  The weather is still quite humid where I live, but my skin looks much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problematic skin and want your skin to look healthier, more vibrant and even-toned, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Both my teens use this facial wash upon recommendation of their dermatologist.  It works very well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My face was a mess! I went to the Dr. and he recommended Vivite to help my rosacea. I was skeptical ay first, buy honestly, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked better in years!!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin but I&#x27;ve noticed the older I get, the more dry my skin has become. This product gives my face a clean feeling without drying it out. But it also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily either. It&#x27;s a good balance.</li>
            <li> The container squirted half of the lotion into the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost 3 ozs at the get go because of bad packaging</li>
            <li> Vivite has a great product line.  This cleanser has several facial benefits.  It cleanses, exfoliates, and the glycolic acid promotes cell growth without drying skin. I recommend the entire line. And the price on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> Vivite is a great product.  I love that is doesn&#x27;t foam and strip my face.  I received it in excellent condition and on time.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years ,I just love this product ,I will keep using as long as it is for sale</li>
            <li> This cleanser combined with the vivite nightly renewal cream has changed my skin.  It looks flawless.  I get comments daily.  Having had bad skin (I used to be on all sorts of serious meds) this combo is a miracle!</li>
            <li> This product must be old. I have used this product over 23 years through all the name changes. I know how this product feels when applying to my skin.This product does not feel the same. Mostly my skin does not glow like before. I am not happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive but this product it&#x27;s great for my skin. I was happy that I got my product on time.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin but I&#x27;ve noticed the older I get, the more dry my skin has become. This product gives my face a clean feeling without drying it out. But it also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily either. It&#x27;s a good balance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vivte for about two weeks and my skin is clear and healthier than it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
            <li> Gotta always have this.  I go without switch and regret it.  No matter what type of skin you have this is the best.  I put it on, walk around the house then use my clarisonic cleanser to take off.  I use it all over even my body.  I never have blackheads and everyone comments on my skin.  My daughter has zits and it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps her face clear.  It leaves a fine layer of glycolic on so nothing can get infected deep in the pore.  It also removes eye makeup.</li>
            <li> It is definitely my favorite facial wash!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived as scheduled, properly packaged.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was obviously from a fresh batch and hadn&#x27;t been sitting on a shelf somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Subscribed.</li>
            <li> I began using this to fight the signs of aging. I let my 13 year old daughter use it when nothing else worked for her acne- she loves it and her skin has greatly improved!</li>
            <li> I used MD FORTE for over 10 years and recently tried Vivite Facial Cleanser.  After cleansing, my face felt very dry and tight, in a painful way.  I never had this problem with MD FORTE.  As MD FORTE and Vivite seem to be phasing out in lieu of Skin Medica (same company) I switched to Skin Medica and love it!!!!  The Vivite also smells very bad and soapy.  Go Skin Medica!!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, dry around chin, oily T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin and I have much less acne since using it. My forehead is still a bit oily but overall think this is a good face wash. Also, it was recommended to me by a skin care clinic.</li>
            <li> Love this daily washer been using it for years and it cheaper here then the spa I go too</li>
            <li> This cleanser is okay, but doesn&#x27;t even come close to MD forte facial cleanser three.</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail and it was a mess. There was product all over the bottle and in the packaging. The bottle looks used because its dirty and the silver at the top is chipping away. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a fake or not. It&#x27;s from Amazon, so I can&#x27;t imagine them selling a fake product, but I&#x27;m not sure what to think.</li>
