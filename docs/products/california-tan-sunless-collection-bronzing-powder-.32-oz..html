            <li>It give me a nice glow that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Nice sun-kissed look.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, best on the market and not at the high end prices of the competitors.</li>
            <li>In fact, I LUV all California Tan products, and Amazon offers them at a great price!!</li>
            <li>This Bronzer is by far the best Bronzer I&#x27;ve every used.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and the value was amazing!</li>

            <li>Beautiful build able color and very airbrushed looking finish ...</li>
            <li>The bronzer is ok.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like the smell, but I can deal with that. :)</li>
            <li>I paid a lot more for it.</li>
            <li>I Love this bronzing powder.</li>
            <li>This product was great &amp; gives you rhe appearance that you have a tan, but I felt that it had too much sparkle to it</li>
            <li>This bronzer has always been my favorite</li>
            <li>I found a 3.00 bronzer at Target by their elf collection that was way better and way cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I used it on both men and women of various ethnic origins, and it was always perfect.</li>
            <li>LOVE the color of this bronzer.</li>
            <li>It looks more glittery in the pan than on the face.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use this on clients, they always inquire about where they can buy it &amp; love the effect it gives.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This company should thank Jessica James Decker because I ordered this after watching her makeup tutorial :)</li>
            <li>I simply love this bronzer</li>
            <li>I have been using Cal Tan Bronzing Powder for 13 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look orange on your skin nor does it look splotchy like most cosmetic powder bronzers tend to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very rich in color</li>
            <li>It works great as a typical bronzer (for your face), but it also works great for your neck, shoulders, chest, etc...  </li>
            <li>This CT bronzer is one of my absolute favs, &amp; the price point is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned</li>
            <li>It blends easily, &amp; lasts most of the day without having to touch it up.</li>
            <li>It has  good coloring, i have used all types of bronzers and this works just as well as the high end ones.</li>
            <li>Not orange and not to dark just perfect.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the hint of glitter it leaves.</li>
            <li>You have to apply it with a light hand.</li>
            <li>Looks good on me (medium-toned brunette) and even better on my blonde, fair-skinned friends.</li>
            <li>I love this because the shade is right.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is it does look kind of greasy if not touched up throughout the day!</li>
            <li>As a make up artist for film and television for over 20 years, I was so excited to discover this non-professional grade bronzer quite by accident in a Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I do get a pro discount with most of those companies, but for a non-pro regular customer, bronzers from most of those brands are $50 and up!</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>it adds just the right amount of color in places that fade easy.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it wasnt full of sparke...</li>
            <li>I recently started work using bronzing powders and I love the heathy glow they give, like a day at the beach at the tip of my brush!</li>
            <li>I am personally porcelain skin coloring, and it looks fantastic!!</li>
            <li>A very light hand gives an incredibly natural glow, and color is even buildable without ever looking cake-y or orange.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that gives you a little bit of color, without overdoing it like a foundation.</li>
            <li>brozer is such a nice color and mataches to any skin tone.</li>
            <li>it was the most glittering bronzer ever and completely unnatural</li>
            <li>I suppose it might be better than nothing at all, but it is most certainly NOT USABLE for me or any of my 200</li>
            <li>The package arrived right on time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and it gives me a slight glow.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Of course, I waited &amp; ordered it off Amazon where I knew it was much cheaper, but I do think that it&#x27;s worth the $26 retail price tag because it&#x27;s quite hard to find a great bronzer for under $30.</li>
            <li>is swirl a soft brush (dedicated to use with this bronzer) maybe twice on the product, tap off excess, and LIGHTLY buff all over until I reach the desired color.</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice sun kissed glow like you spent the day at the beach!</li>
            <li>I use this for contouring as well, &amp; despite the shimmer, it works great for that purpose since the shimmer is subtle once applied.</li>
            <li>and this looks good on me all year round!</li>
            <li>The container looked a little different but the product is still the same amazing powder I have loved for years.</li>
            <li>very natural look on my face when i go out in the day and the evening!!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Jessie James Decker and she is the only reason I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I really did like it</li>
            <li>The color is also very glistening</li>
            <li>so I looked like I was ready for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>It also blends really well.</li>
            <li>I try to avoid too much sun exposure</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a super&lt;br /&gt;bronzer..,, better than any other product</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Bronzer for 6 years now and I will be continuing to use it as long as its available.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is great, but not so intense that it&#x27;s difficult to apply, &amp; the shimmer isn&#x27;t overboard (although it would be nice if they had a matte option.)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has a much more natural look than some of the other bronzers I have tried.</li>
            <li>It looks natural, and isn&#x27;t very shiny.</li>
            <li>I keep a pretty dark tan and this bronzer looks fantastic as a blush,or as a natural looking kiss of color for shoulders and  decolletage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been addicted to it for years, and I&#x27;m so pleased to find it here on Amazon at half the cost that I&#x27;ve been happy to pay for this product at my local tanning salon.</li>
            <li>This lasts a very long time and has a natural light bronze color.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY bronzer I can use year round, as my skin tone varies greatly depending on how much time I&#x27;ve spent exposed to UV.</li>
            <li>contacted the manufacturer of California Tan when I saw the new packaging, and they did inform me that the formula had been changed, but I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I live it.</li>
            <li>It really looks super natural if you&#x27;ve already got a pretty good base tan</li>
            <li>very natural.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Most of these powders that I have used in the past have been from the cosmetic counters and were pricey.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much more than some drugstore brands and way more affordable than department store brands.</li>
            <li>Seriously, ten years, to be exact.</li>
            <li>This one is a matte one and pretty deep in color</li>
            <li>though the old formula had &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; in it, the make up never caused reflective problems under any of the lighting conditions I used it in.</li>
            <li>Not too orange or shimmery, and looks extremely natural.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural matte bronzer, this had a lot of gold glitter in it.</li>
            <li>and this is a natural way to color.</li>
            <li>Natural color (for tan skin).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this company is still around making white girls bronzed all year round.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times and I am looking forward to getting a new one soon.</li>
            <li>The small little brush that comes with it is a nice size and doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers comment that there isn&#x27;t much product in the container, but I wear it every day and one compact lasts me about 4-5 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pretty pale and it doesn&#x27;t make me look too orange either.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Bronzer for 6 years now and I will be continuing to use it as long as its available.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is great, but not so intense that it&#x27;s difficult to apply, &amp; the shimmer isn&#x27;t overboard (although it would be nice if they had a matte option.)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It has a much more natural look than some of the other bronzers I have tried.</li>
            <li> It looks natural, and isn&#x27;t very shiny.</li>
            <li> I keep a pretty dark tan and this bronzer looks fantastic as a blush,or as a natural looking kiss of color for shoulders and  decolletage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been addicted to it for years, and I&#x27;m so pleased to find it here on Amazon at half the cost that I&#x27;ve been happy to pay for this product at my local tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This lasts a very long time and has a natural light bronze color.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY bronzer I can use year round, as my skin tone varies greatly depending on how much time I&#x27;ve spent exposed to UV.</li>
            <li> contacted the manufacturer of California Tan when I saw the new packaging, and they did inform me that the formula had been changed, but I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I live it.</li>
            <li> It really looks super natural if you&#x27;ve already got a pretty good base tan</li>
            <li> very natural.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Most of these powders that I have used in the past have been from the cosmetic counters and were pricey.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much more than some drugstore brands and way more affordable than department store brands.</li>
            <li> Seriously, ten years, to be exact.</li>
            <li> This one is a matte one and pretty deep in color</li>
            <li> though the old formula had &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; in it, the make up never caused reflective problems under any of the lighting conditions I used it in.</li>
            <li> Not too orange or shimmery, and looks extremely natural.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural matte bronzer, this had a lot of gold glitter in it.</li>
            <li> and this is a natural way to color.</li>
            <li> Natural color (for tan skin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this company is still around making white girls bronzed all year round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times and I am looking forward to getting a new one soon.</li>
            <li> The small little brush that comes with it is a nice size and doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers comment that there isn&#x27;t much product in the container, but I wear it every day and one compact lasts me about 4-5 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pretty pale and it doesn&#x27;t make me look too orange either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist, so I have tons of high end bronzers -- Bobbi Brown, Dior, Givenchy, Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, Hourglass, NARS, Smashbox, to name a few.</li>
            <li> This one is similar in price but lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I haven&#x27;t is because I can donate it along with other cosmetic items to a local women&#x27;s shelter.</li>
            <li> So soft and lightweight, a little deff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> There was another woman who had purchased hers the same year I had, 2004, and had run into the same problem a few months prior to our search.</li>
            <li> The powder is dry and does not &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the skin well.</li>
            <li> Although this is a powder, it has a creamy texture, &amp; isn&#x27;t dry or powdery in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Then I put the same brush (no additional product on it) into my makeup bag and use it for a touch-up later in the day if I need it (usually I don&#x27;t, but if I&#x27;ve been wearing a scrub mask all day in the OR the mask can rub away at my makeup</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too expensive luckily, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Other bronzers (even the super expensive products I&#x27;ve tried from the designer lines at department stores) always look oily on my skin a few hours after I&#x27;ve applied, but I can wear this all day long with only a tissue blotting at my lunch break.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I might need a little blending later in the day).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will defiantly buy this bronzer again in the future and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little added glow.</li>
            <li> day long!!!</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of using the same old Hoola bronzer by Benefit, so I tried this</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear foundation or any other skin</li>
            <li> I was surprised because most of the time those brushes are terrible.  </li>
            <li> I purchased about 10 compacts from one of the hotel gift shops, and ordered it online from a site called Dark Desire Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you use it too much, it will make you look fake though.</li>
            <li> With my Prime membership, this only costs about $12, which is unbelievable for the quality!</li>
            <li> Extremely glimmer!</li>
            <li> It does not work well if you have any uneven skin due to acne, it just draws attention to all of your inperfections</li>
            <li> There is a subtle, tiny glitter to the product, but it&#x27;s not garish or noticeable and blends in almost invisibly.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at a tanning salon and the price was crazy, but then I did some research and found it on here.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little redder than I prefer and makes your skin a little oily.</li>
            <li> just this bronzer, a little cream blush</li>
            <li> It is a little sparkly in the pot but when applied it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly &amp; u only have to do a few touch ups during the day!!!</li>
            <li> Looks natural and would recommend product to anyone wanting to add a little color but not look fake.</li>
            <li> I can build it up and it doesnt seem like too much and it does not look dirty like some.</li>
            <li> Meaning you can tell it&#x27;s not a cheap bronzer....</li>
            <li> So I was really sad when I had gotten down to crumbs.</li>
            <li> Not good anymore.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in tanning salons!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the amount paid and how small the palet was.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it would take a LOT of heavy-handed application for the color to look crazy or fake.</li>
            <li> Crazy huh.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> get it you wont be sorry!!</li>
            <li> it has a redish-orangeish tone which is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great powder!!! Hard to find in tanning salons!! Thank God for Amazon!!! It goes on evenly &amp; u only have to do a few touch ups during the day!!!</li>
            <li> The perfect bronzer for that sun-kissed glow. Best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> My favorite bronzer ever!</li>
            <li> I can only find this on Amazon.  This lasts a very long time and has a natural light bronze color.  I use this for contour.</li>
            <li> The bronzer is ok. It goes on a little redder than I prefer and makes your skin a little oily. I did enjoy the hint of glitter it leaves.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Jessie James Decker and she is the only reason I purchased this product. I really did like it and I will but again! Makes me tan and sunkissed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what your skintone- this bronzer is AMAZEBALLS. I&#x27;ve been addicted to it for years, and I&#x27;m so pleased to find it here on Amazon at half the cost that I&#x27;ve been happy to pay for this product at my local tanning salon. The ONLY bronzer I can use year round, as my skin tone varies greatly depending on how much time I&#x27;ve spent exposed to UV. A very light hand gives an incredibly natural glow, and color is even buildable without ever looking cake-y or orange. Other bronzers (even the super expensive products I&#x27;ve tried from the designer lines at department stores) always look oily on my skin a few hours after I&#x27;ve applied, but I can wear this all day long with only a tissue blotting at my lunch break.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers comment that there isn&#x27;t much product in the container, but I wear it every day and one compact lasts me about 4-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;All I do is swirl a soft brush (dedicated to use with this bronzer) maybe twice on the product, tap off excess, and LIGHTLY buff all over until I reach the desired color. Then I put the same brush (no additional product on it) into my makeup bag and use it for a touch-up later in the day if I need it (usually I don&#x27;t, but if I&#x27;ve been wearing a scrub mask all day in the OR the mask can rub away at my makeup and I might need a little blending later in the day).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear foundation or any other skin coverage- just this bronzer, a little cream blush if it&#x27;s winter when I tend to look as if I&#x27;ve been living underground, and mascara.</li>
            <li> It looks natural, and isn&#x27;t very shiny. I just don&#x27;t like the smell, but I can deal with that. :)</li>
            <li> The package arrived right on time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brozer is such a nice color and mataches to any skin tone. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is it does look kind of greasy if not touched up throughout the day!</li>
            <li> Sparkly but nice color</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and the value was amazing! I&#x27;ve used this product before and it is really good. I paid a lot more for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I watched Jessie James (the singer) on you tube do her makeup &amp; it&#x27;s the bronzer she was using...I do like it, it&#x27;s very rich in color so a little goes a long way. Meaning you can tell it&#x27;s not a cheap bronzer.... but the price is! Lol</li>
            <li> I Love this bronzing powder. It makes me look like I have a nice reral tan. Its not orange at all. very natural.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bronzing powder after it was recommended to me by the tanning salon I visit.  I only spray tan, as I am concerned about skin cancer.  If you want to give your skin a glow without the wrinkles - this stuff is for you.  It works great as a typical bronzer (for your face), but it also works great for your neck, shoulders, chest, etc...  The small little brush that comes with it is a nice size and doesn&#x27;t shed.  I was surprised because most of the time those brushes are terrible.  Most of these powders that I have used in the past have been from the cosmetic counters and were pricey.  This one is similar in price but lasts a really long time.  Its a great investment.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a bronzer that actually leaves you tan this is the one! It has  good coloring, i have used all types of bronzers and this works just as well as the high end ones. Even though there is sparkles in the powder it does not show on your face.</li>
            <li> Best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used! Beautiful build able color and very airbrushed looking finish ... I use all year around ... I like it on my face and I also use on my neck and collar bones occasionally.</li>
            <li> i like it a lot!! very natural look on my face when i go out in the day and the evening!!</li>
            <li> This product was great &amp; gives you rhe appearance that you have a tan, but I felt that it had too much sparkle to it</li>
            <li> This bronzer has always been my favorite</li>
            <li> Great bronzer! I will defiantly buy this bronzer again in the future and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little added glow.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon &amp; we decided to order this out of the catalog just to try it. LOVE IT! Every bronzer I&#x27;ve ever tried doesn&#x27;t seem to go on with any color. However this stuff works like a charm. So soft and lightweight, a little deff goes a long way! The color is perfect! Gives you a nice sun kissed glow like you spent the day at the beach! It really looks super natural if you&#x27;ve already got a pretty good base tan it adds just the right amount of color in places that fade easy. Try it &amp; you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It has a much more natural look than some of the other bronzers I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the amount paid and how small the palet was.  I found a 3.00 bronzer at Target by their elf collection that was way better and way cheaper.  The color is also very glistening so I looked like I was ready for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> Color not orange.., looks great&lt;br /&gt;All day long!!! I would recommend to anyone looking for a super&lt;br /&gt;bronzer..,, better than any other product&lt;br /&gt;I have tried.</li>
            <li> They changed the product. Not good anymore. Go with Rimmel</li>
            <li> As a make up artist for film and television for over 20 years, I was so excited to discover this non-professional grade bronzer quite by accident in a Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas. I purchased about 10 compacts from one of the hotel gift shops, and ordered it online from a site called Dark Desire Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the old formula had &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; in it, the make up never caused reflective problems under any of the lighting conditions I used it in. It went on evenly, and I found I could use the same bronzer for a variety of applications, including blush and even eye shadow! I used it on both men and women of various ethnic origins, and it was always perfect. It was the best make up product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the manufacturer of California Tan when I saw the new packaging, and they did inform me that the formula had been changed, but I decided to give it a try. What a disappointment! The powder is dry and does not &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the skin well. it has a redish-orangeish tone which is horrible. I took one brush stroke and wanted to throw it away. The only reason I haven&#x27;t is because I can donate it along with other cosmetic items to a local women&#x27;s shelter. I suppose it might be better than nothing at all, but it is most certainly NOT USABLE for me or any of my 200+ clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that my voice matters, but you asked. So here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Coco Cohen&lt;br /&gt;Wardrobe and Makeup Stylist&lt;br /&gt;coco.cohen@att.net</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer! I keep a pretty dark tan and this bronzer looks fantastic as a blush,or as a natural looking kiss of color for shoulders and  decolletage. I can see why they say this is a one-color-fits-all bronzer. There is a subtle, tiny glitter to the product, but it&#x27;s not garish or noticeable and blends in almost invisibly. No orange! I&#x27;d say it would take a LOT of heavy-handed application for the color to look crazy or fake. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it wasnt full of sparke... it was the most glittering bronzer ever and completely unnatural I will be returning this asap</li>
            <li> LOVE the color of this bronzer. Not too orange or shimmery, and looks extremely natural. Great for just the cheek bones or all over. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this because the shade is right. There are so many shades of tan out there that suck and look so fake. This works on my Irish skin when it is winter and when I have color in my skin from the sun in the summertime. get it you wont be sorry!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spray tan, but I use this as my every day bronzer. It makes my skin look so smooth and soft! It also blends really well. I am pretty pale and it doesn&#x27;t make me look too orange either. I think this is flattering on all skin types. Definitely worth the money! It&#x27;s not much more than some drugstore brands and way more affordable than department store brands.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural matte bronzer, this had a lot of gold glitter in it. It does not work well if you have any uneven skin due to acne, it just draws attention to all of your inperfections</li>
            <li> This is a great product that gives you a little bit of color, without overdoing it like a foundation. Difficult to find. Thankful you can purchase here.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this bronzer from the minute I swatched it at my tanning salon, &amp; I just had to have it! Of course, I waited &amp; ordered it off Amazon where I knew it was much cheaper, but I do think that it&#x27;s worth the $26 retail price tag because it&#x27;s quite hard to find a great bronzer for under $30. With my Prime membership, this only costs about $12, which is unbelievable for the quality! I&#x27;m a makeup artist, so I have tons of high end bronzers -- Bobbi Brown, Dior, Givenchy, Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, Hourglass, NARS, Smashbox, to name a few. I do get a pro discount with most of those companies, but for a non-pro regular customer, bronzers from most of those brands are $50 and up! This CT bronzer is one of my absolute favs, &amp; the price point is amazing! Although this is a powder, it has a creamy texture, &amp; isn&#x27;t dry or powdery in the slightest. The pigmentation is great, but not so intense that it&#x27;s difficult to apply, &amp; the shimmer isn&#x27;t overboard (although it would be nice if they had a matte option.) I also love the color, it is the perfect shade of bronze without any orange. It blends easily, &amp; lasts most of the day without having to touch it up. I use this for contouring as well, &amp; despite the shimmer, it works great for that purpose since the shimmer is subtle once applied. It looks more glittery in the pan than on the face. Whenever I use this on clients, they always inquire about where they can buy it &amp; love the effect it gives. Even though I own bronzers from most every luxury brand, this is the one I use most, which says A LOT about how awesome it is!</li>
            <li> I first bought this at a tanning salon and the price was crazy, but then I did some research and found it on here. I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times and I am looking forward to getting a new one soon.</li>
            <li> I use this as daily make up . if you use it too much, it will make you look fake though.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have fair skin and it gives me a slight glow. It looks very natural. This company should thank Jessica James Decker because I ordered this after watching her makeup tutorial :)</li>
            <li> Years and years ago I purchased this bronzing powder from a local tanning salon. For years I used this powder as a bronzer. Seriously, ten years, to be exact. So I was really sad when I had gotten down to crumbs. My best friend decided to go online as I was telling her my story of my bronzing purchase, when she died laughing. There was another woman who had purchased hers the same year I had, 2004, and had run into the same problem a few months prior to our search. Crazy huh. So I bought the bronzer. It arived in a timely manner. The container looked a little different but the product is still the same amazing powder I have loved for years. I&#x27;m so glad this company is still around making white girls bronzed all year round.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Used to purchase and use it years ago. Now in a smaller package and slighly different color, yet works great.&lt;br /&gt;I never tan my face and this is a natural way to color. Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Good bronzer! Natural color (for tan skin).</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST Bronzing Powder I&#x27;ve used. In fact, I LUV all California Tan products, and Amazon offers them at a great price!!</li>
            <li> I recently started work using bronzing powders and I love the heathy glow they give, like a day at the beach at the tip of my brush! This one is a matte one and pretty deep in color ( i have have fair skin). You have to apply it with a light hand. Am stil unclear whether it has self tanner in it since it is a California Tan product. Do not think so though. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I simply love this bronzer I can build it up and it doesnt seem like too much and it does not look dirty like some. It has sparkles but you cant tell on your skin. Its perfect I been trying bronzers for a bit so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years. I live it. I dont wear a lot of make up. Its perfect!</li>
            <li> This is my fav bronzer! Not orange and not to dark just perfect. I am medium tone and it gives a healthy color to you skin!</li>
            <li> Extremely glimmer! I felt like I tried it once because it looked like I was wearing gold shimmer powder all over my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great bronzer with a great sheen too it. It would work with any skin type, truly Universal!! I am personally porcelain skin coloring, and it looks fantastic!! Highly recommend. If you want to see a video with the product check out Jessie James, youtube channel and tutorial on her makeup.</li>
            <li> Not a hug fan of the shimmer in this bronzer as I wanted to use it for contouring. It wasn&#x27;t too expensive luckily, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. I only bought it after seeing it on a YouTube tutorial.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, best on the market and not at the high end prices of the competitors.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cal Tan Bronzing Powder for 13 years and love it.  It give me a nice glow that lasts all day.  It&#x27;s a great enhancer to a spray tan as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned and this looks good on me all year round! Absolutely NO orange, just natural looking bronze. By far the best bronzer and so much cheaper than all those designer ones!!!!</li>
            <li> This Bronzer is by far the best Bronzer I&#x27;ve every used. It doesn&#x27;t look orange on your skin nor does it look splotchy like most cosmetic powder bronzers tend to do.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Bronzer for 6 years now and I will be continuing to use it as long as its available.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Jesse James recommended it on YouTube and I fell in love. It is a little sparkly in the pot but when applied it&#x27;s gone. It may be a bit orange for my skin tone, even though I am fairly tan.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Used to help blend neck and back into tan lines. Looks natural and would recommend product to anyone wanting to add a little color but not look fake.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid too much sun exposure and I found this product to be one of the nicest bronzers I&#x27;ve ever used. Looks good on me (medium-toned brunette) and even better on my blonde, fair-skinned friends. Nice sun-kissed look.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of using the same old Hoola bronzer by Benefit, so I tried this and I love it.</li>
