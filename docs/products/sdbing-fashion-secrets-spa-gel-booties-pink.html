            <li>I am very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The price of these booties was great!  </li>
            <li>Quality of the product is excellent.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVED them!</li>
            <li>Ordered 2 and was very pleased!</li>
            <li>Great product though</li>
            <li>Great price (beat another website price).</li>
            <li>these booties are great to wear at night with some foot cream or lotion.</li>
            <li>Make my feet feel good.</li>
            <li>Great to wear inside a pair of boots in the winter, your feet are warm and come out smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li>These are great, comfortable moisturizing socks.  </li>
            <li>but kind of do hit and miss.  </li>
            <li>Came in quick, nice color, nice quality ( havent yet washed though), smells nice, and good fit.</li>
            <li>Love these, I use them as foot pads in my Crocks,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>and when I take them off my feet look and feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love the non-slip grips on the bottom since I have hardwood</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more and giving them away as Christmas stocking stuffers :)</li>
            <li>And every time I put them on I was wondering if it is a healthy thing, because when I received this item, it looked like I got it from 99 cents store...</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, easy to slip on and make your feet feel like silk.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and mositurizes well .</li>
            <li>Still waiting on this full order.</li>
            <li>Only thing I wish is that they made more than one size!</li>
            <li>Socks are not as a good quality as other ones I purchased .</li>
            <li>very hot and squeeze my feet too much</li>
            <li>Slow delivery but great product.</li>
            <li>the rubber on the inside just came off first time I washed them and</li>
            <li>My feet get so dry because I love flip-flops and going barefoot.  </li>
            <li>I found they went flat very quickly, and they made my feet sweat.  </li>
            <li>I did wait well over a month to receive them, but I really like them.</li>
            <li>They really make my feet feel soft and help with callouses and moisterizing.  </li>
            <li>I also wear them to sleep so that in the morning my rough feet are smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am 8 and they just fit, but have family and friends with smaller feet and wish they made some different size options so they could use them also.</li>
            <li>Feet stay so soft!</li>
            <li>just right to help me moisturize my dry heels.  </li>
            <li>the pink is a pretty soft color and my daughters keep stealing them.  </li>

            <li> very hot and squeeze my feet too much</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  The price of these booties was great!  Quality of the product is excellent.  Thick gel inside these non-skid booties.  I should wear them nightly but kind of do hit and miss.  They really make my feet feel soft and help with callouses and moisterizing.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Received package of 4 pair of these &amp;#34;booties&amp;#34; recently.  Unlike earlier booties purchased from same seller, these did not have any oils in them, nor any scent. Also, too small.</li>
            <li> Wear them to bed.  Make my feet feel good.</li>
            <li> Love these, I use them as foot pads in my Crocks,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> The product was bought for my daughter who is diabetic and has bone coming through the bottom of her foot. She loves the booties and they give some comfort to her at night. Slow delivery but great product.</li>
            <li> These are not flimsy but instead heavy duty gel lined socks. They are comfortable, easy to slip on and make your feet feel like silk. I did wait well over a month to receive them, but I really like them. I wear them around the house as is because they are too thick to wear with shoes. I also wear them to sleep so that in the morning my rough feet are smooth. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the pink color, but for the price they are worth it. I&#x27;d definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Came in quick, nice color, nice quality ( havent yet washed though), smells nice, and good fit. Feels cool and mositurizes well . Finally for the price i like it a lot</li>
            <li> I had got another brand of these .these are just some cheaper version of them  the rubber on the inside just came off first time I washed them and they where to little</li>
            <li> I found they went flat very quickly, and they made my feet sweat.  I havent tried to wash them yet, and I am not sure how that will go.</li>
            <li> These are great, comfortable moisturizing socks.  My feet get so dry because I love flip-flops and going barefoot.  I put these on when I get home and/or wear overnight and when I take them off my feet look and feel so much better.  I love the non-slip grips on the bottom since I have hardwood floors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these at separate times and gave them away as birthday gifts. My friends called me the day after they used them and ABSOLUTELY LOVED them! I will be purchasing more and giving them away as Christmas stocking stuffers :)</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 and was very pleased! Only thing I wish is that they made more than one size! I&#x27;m am 8 and they just fit, but have family and friends with smaller feet and wish they made some different size options so they could use them also. One was a size 6 and she said they were just too big. Great product though</li>
            <li> Still waiting on this full order. Socks are not as a good quality as other ones I purchased . Stick with a brand name</li>
            <li> just right to help me moisturize my dry heels.  the pink is a pretty soft color and my daughters keep stealing them.  Great price (beat another website price).</li>
            <li> This item is simply not for me.. It didn&#x27;t get any noticeable changes... And every time I put them on I was wondering if it is a healthy thing, because when I received this item, it looked like I got it from 99 cents store... there were no instructions and no information about the active ingredients or something like that...</li>
            <li> Great to wear inside a pair of boots in the winter, your feet are warm and come out smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> these booties are great to wear at night with some foot cream or lotion. Feet stay so soft!</li>
