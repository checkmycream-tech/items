            <li>I love this eye shadow</li>
            <li>, I love Shany products.  </li>
            <li>i love shany</li>

            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>Neon color palate is so pretty!!!</li>
            <li>you can bring it with you right in your purse or a clutch!!</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day, does not smudge, and is very wearable (as the colors are bright, they look bright but natural; no clownishness here!)</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOW FAST THIS CAME!!</li>
            <li>so important.</li>
            <li>Colors are as shown in the picture -- fun, funky, fabulous!  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s the girl who puts on eyeshadow like you&#x27;ve never seen and has special tricks for doing stuff nobody ever thought of with makeup.  </li>
            <li>I used a light cream shadow first and then applied the shadow!</li>
            <li>She told me she loved it, and I know she meant it because the next time I was at her place</li>
            <li>it is great quality, but like ALL eye shadows, dont expect it to last and look vibrant unless you use a primer!</li>
            <li>but, well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Extremely fun to play with.</li>
            <li>exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>the picture is exactly what i got.</li>
            <li>i am so pleased with this especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Urban decay is the best- this stuff makes ANY eyeshadow high quality, pigmented and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I am always on the lookout for new and exciting eye shadow and eye liner.</li>
            <li>i really like this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>now she can style her eyes any way she wants</li>
            <li>Normally, I purchase my eye shadows from Sally Beauty Supply here locally, but I wanted brighter more vivid colors than my Sally&#x27;s carries.</li>
            <li>I am african-american sort of light-skinned and the colors were rich enough to show up on my skin!</li>
            <li>this arrived completely intact and exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the &#x27;easy-to-blend&#x27; nature of this particular shadow.</li>

            <li> and i don&#x27;t worry about the permanent damage that could have occured with the other products.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on the eye shadows, its not worth the diception</li>
            <li> I ORDERED FROM OTHER WEBSITES HAVE NOT EVEN ARRIVED!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> it was a day late to get here</li>
            <li> some people said they got dif colors other than the crazy neon- not me!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i can&#x27;t give a review on how it looks on me because I&#x27;m giving it as a gift to my sister in law</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost scary.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> i have different shany products and they were grate. when i recived this product it  hada a big sticker i peeld it off an it hade another brand name on it, the eye shadows are not as pigmented as reagular shany products. dont waste your money on the eye shadows, its not worth the diception</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow it goes on so smooth and looks beautiful once on. I would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> I have said it before and I will say it again, I love Shany products.  I have several pallets myself but I bought this one as a gift and I now want it for myself.  I do recommend buying a primer to go on your lids before you apply the color, and buy extra sponge like applicators because this product only comes with 2. These colors are very vibrant and look great on the eye.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful.  It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t last long.  I purchased a makeup kit/collection from ELF at about the same time and the ELF stays on/lasts and lasts.  I wish I could say the same about the Shany.</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for new and exciting eye shadow and eye liner. When I saw this set, I was skeptical namely because I wasn&#x27;t able to see the pallet before purchase. Normally, I purchase my eye shadows from Sally Beauty Supply here locally, but I wanted brighter more vivid colors than my Sally&#x27;s carries. I tried out this collection and am I thrilled!!!! They are metallic and yet pearly at one time. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the &#x27;easy-to-blend&#x27; nature of this particular shadow. It&#x27;s wonderful, and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> i just got this today and the colors are absolutely beautiful. exactly as shown in the picture. it was a day late to get here but, well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This is a great color pallet! The colors are bright and vibrant. But you will need a base on before hand to get real rich color. I used a light cream shadow first and then applied the shadow! Awesome!</li>
            <li> Nice color selection and pigmentation. With a primer lasts all day. Packaging was good and nothing was damaged. Will buy Shany cosmetics again!!</li>
            <li> i really like this eyeshadow. the colors are great. the picture is exactly what i got. the only thing i dont like is that the colors dont last all day. especially if you touch your eyes for any reason. other than that i love shany make up and i will continue to buy alot more from them.</li>
            <li> this arrived completely intact and exactly like the picture. some people said they got dif colors other than the crazy neon- not me! i am so pleased with this especially for the price. i am a makeup artist and use this on clients sometimes- it is great quality, but like ALL eye shadows, dont expect it to last and look vibrant unless you use a primer! so important. Urban decay is the best- this stuff makes ANY eyeshadow high quality, pigmented and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette! the colors are awesome. they are bright, silky beautiful colors. the best part is that it is very compact and has a mirror. you can bring it with you right in your purse or a clutch!!</li>
            <li> Great eyeshadow! I am african-american sort of light-skinned and the colors were rich enough to show up on my skin! Great for the price!</li>
            <li> I love all of the possibilities and have received many compliments on the colors. Extremely fun to play with. Lasts all day, does not smudge, and is very wearable (as the colors are bright, they look bright but natural; no clownishness here!)</li>
            <li> I JUST ORDERED THIS PRODUCT AND OTHER THINGS I ORDERED FROM OTHER WEBSITES HAVE NOT EVEN ARRIVED!!! I LOVE HOW FAST THIS CAME!! The Shany 36  Neon color palate is so pretty!!! Unfortunately i can&#x27;t give a review on how it looks on me because I&#x27;m giving it as a gift to my sister in law, it&#x27;s so beautiful i have to share it! I&#x27;ll have to order another one from the same seller for myself!!  great!</li>
            <li> The case cracked after a couple of months, however the eyeshadow&#x27;s are great.</li>
            <li> Shany Cosmetics has just earned themselves a customer for life!  Fantastic product!  Eyeshadow applies beautifully, and lasts all day.  Colors are as shown in the picture -- fun, funky, fabulous!  The fastest shipping ever, as well.</li>
            <li> you wont get the colors that are shown and this product sucks.&lt;br /&gt;plain and simple dont get it...&lt;br /&gt;Your welcome HAHAHAHA&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just saying you will totally regret the money you spend on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on a monday with one day shipping and didnt recieve it for over a week.</li>
            <li> I have this one friend who is so into makeup it&#x27;s almost scary.  She&#x27;s the girl who puts on eyeshadow like you&#x27;ve never seen and has special tricks for doing stuff nobody ever thought of with makeup.  I found this kit and it has colors I knew she would like and it wasn&#x27;t too pricey so I got it for her.  She told me she loved it, and I know she meant it because the next time I was at her place I saw some of the colors were already being used.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves to make her eyes glamorous but she always ends up puffy and irritated no matter what make up i bought her....Until i found shany products!! now she can style her eyes any way she wants and i don&#x27;t worry about the permanent damage that could have occured with the other products. (its not like you can keep a teenage girl from wearing make up now a days)</li>
