            <li>This mask does everything it says it will do and more!</li>
            <li>It smells great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great clay mask, real easy to remove, especially leaving it overnight once, plus it&#x27;s a great price too &amp; just want I needed for my beauty routine!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice and applies easily</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This mask is amazing.</li>
            <li>paired this mask along with the Freeman Pineapple Enzyme mask (which smells amazing</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this mask and think it works great...</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how amazing this is.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>Honestly i would give it 4.5 stars--</li>
            <li>This is a nice, affordable skin treatment for those on a budget.</li>
            <li>Nice mask</li>
            <li>(I know i need to avoid eye area, i know the instruction for using this kind of products, it still cause the tearing reaction)</li>
            <li>It Applies On Nice</li>
            <li>reason for loving this is that I have severe allergic reaction to all bugs- saliva, bites, poison, everything.</li>
            <li>Face feels very refreshed afterwords and looks great!</li>
            <li>A nice cleansing mask.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>if it starts drying at the edges just apply some warm water with a damp washcloth to rehydrate while the rest of it dries.  </li>
            <li>After not even hearing anything from them I decided to contact seller and they were nice, telling me that it is almost here.</li>
            <li>and yes,  the results were nice...  </li>
            <li>You could spend much more, and not get a product this good.</li>
            <li>It works nice.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Smells like warm</li>
            <li>The mask is drying but effective.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, I highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li>the plus side, it leaves your skin feeling VERY soft and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>Comes off very easily, I leave on for 5-10min.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best clay mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and the price is just an unexpected bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been fairly happy with my department store brand clay mask, but this one seemed like fun, and was super-inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face masks out there, and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>but when i do its really nice and refreshing for my skin.</li>
            <li>Great buy and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Great mask for clogged pores and price very reasonable.</li>
            <li>but my face was very smooth when i was done with the mask.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Dries up all my oil without drying my skin, cleans out the gunk, and leaves my face with a nice smooth feel and an even healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It doesnt sting like most masks but you can feel it working.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything drastic from this masque but it does leave my skin softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mask.  </li>
            <li>I love it,,,</li>
            <li>Bought this on a whim and just LOVE it.</li>
            <li>but i have found better.</li>
            <li>I love freeman&#x27;s products and use them every day.  </li>

            <li>Love the product just y&#x27;all charged me for 2</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>The morning after I use this on any blemishes, they are greatly improved and healing at a much quicker pace than without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this face mask.</li>
            <li>I always love  this stuff.</li>
            <li>I used this product three nights ago and the reaction has not gotten much better.  </li>
            <li>I thinks it&#x27;s a great all-around mask.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an overwhelming perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li>but my package was supposed to be here at the latest the 8th</li>
            <li>But I wanted even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>Got this one because the name sounded refreshing.</li>
            <li>I would for sure get this again.</li>
            <li>It is also so cheap!:)</li>
            <li>Could just be me, gave to friend, hopefully it&#x27;ll work out better for her.</li>
            <li>It did the job, and I like it better than anything I have ever tried before.</li>
            <li>but I usually love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Okay so I never bother to write reviews on anything, but I feel like this deserved it.</li>
            <li>There was no redness, if anything my complexion was more even than beforehand.</li>
            <li>Ta-ta, off to buy more freeman masks.</li>
            <li>I love the way this Freeman Clay mask leaves my combination skin.</li>
            <li>My forehead, and nose are my most oily areas.</li>
            <li>I just need to use it more on a routine.</li>
            <li>When the timer went off I figured I&#x27;d look more when I get out of the shower and never found anything</li>
            <li>This mask took away my redness and my skin is sooo free and airy!</li>
            <li>Its so refreshing.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all of the Freeman masks.</li>
            <li>My go-to for many years now.</li>
            <li>It does contain both aluminum as well as more than one paraben compound (linked to hormone receptor interference).  </li>
            <li>In fact, there&#x27;s more aluminum than oatmeal or avacado!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product and very well priced.</li>
            <li>It really tightens your skin and great for those with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I love the cooling sensation of this product on my face.</li>
            <li>Felt so refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>but the smell is sooo so overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is just ok.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat refreshing</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and feels great on my face, even my boyfriend likes using it haha</li>
            <li>And one of my favorite things about this mask, it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>I love this masque.</li>
            <li>This one seemed the best especially  since it included oatmeal.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clean and healthy that night and the morning after!</li>
            <li>It rinses off very cleanly and easily, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and after my first use, my skin felt more incredible and clean than it had in MONTHS.</li>
            <li>Honestly the first couple times I used it it made my face kind of burn.</li>
            <li>evens out my skin, soothes it and makes my skin feel clean and feel really nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the higher priced masks of course</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best budget beauty buy I&#x27;ve run across in a long time.  </li>
            <li>how long you leave it on, to find out what works best for your skin type.</li>
            <li>I just wonder how long I can store a unopened container, and where is best place to store it ?</li>
            <li>Searched a long time to find this product again and am completely happy!</li>
            <li>Not to mention so cheap and easy to find!</li>
            <li>I love this mask, and have now purchased the full size!</li>
            <li>Good facial is always a good thing</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel clean and refreshed also has a nice smell and goes on easily</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I followed up by toning and moisturizing and my skin felt revived and so clean!</li>
            <li>Smells so great and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>My Skin Feels More Hydrated And Smooth.</li>
            <li>Love how it goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a try because I love free products.  </li>
            <li>My aesthetician recommended this, and it really works good.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and it tingles as you put it on and gradually gets better, it&#x27;s easily washable.  </li>
            <li>i am seriously willing to buy more of these products!</li>
            <li>Im really pleased that I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff leaves my face feeling fresh!</li>
            <li>This was easily remedied by using moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- easy to apply and comes off easy with water&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on well and comes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is great for oily skin, it takes away all my shine and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>so if you have issues with strong smells</li>
            <li>I took off one star because this mask does have a strong smell that even for a non-sensitive person like me, I would like for the manufacturer to chill with the scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong smell of baby powder with a tinge of hair perm??  </li>
            <li>It manages to leave my sensitive skin clean and happy -</li>
            <li>anyway I smelled this one in the tube and it smelled fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the plus side is I have seen no side affects from this mask; it makes my skin feel super soft and does not break me out which is a great plus.</li>
            <li>Great scent, easy application, relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>The avocado/oatmeal combination is great, especially if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive/combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Really takes away the oil in your face &amp; cleans it up nicely.</li>
            <li>Would and will buy again if still available.  </li>

            <li>For a cheap face mask, it does work well.</li>

            <li>I have learned my lesson to not use cheap masks again.</li>
            <li>Jesus christ has said: I am the light of the world.he who follows me will never walk in darkness.please</li>
            <li>/&gt;While acne products tend to vary immensely in their effectiveness on a person to person basis, the Freeman Avocado and Oatmeal Mask is a great option for anyone suffering from acne to try.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the avocados delivered and</li>
            <li>its really cheap &lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>product works great, dries in short time and just splash off with water.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it made a difference in just my first use !!</li>
            <li>but I would definitely recommend this mask:]!!</li>

            <li>and i feel clean and smooth after i use it.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed my face it felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is a decent mask on its own but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really creamy and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li>Makes skin really soft &amp; it smells super good.</li>
            <li>Together they really make perfect mask that doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin or burn it but still have all the benefits of both.</li>
            <li>I love this product, this is my first time using a mask</li>
            <li>She has been using proactive for awhile and this product did more in the first use than over $200 worth of proactive products she&#x27;s tried!</li>
            <li>Makes my nose itch sometimes but worth it!</li>
            <li>Fun to use too!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- removes blackheads with ease, I noticed some blackheads on my nose gone after the FIRST time using it, more disappears over time when continuing usage of this product&lt;br /&gt;- shrinks pores&lt;</li>
            <li>its WORTH BUYING!</li>
            <li>(I also like its fresh smell!)</li>
            <li>I love this mask, I&#x27;m at the end of my first bottle and just ordered another.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li>This avocado &amp; oatmeal masque is super cheap</li>
            <li>It does make my face feel really clean.</li>
            <li>It may be that the discount price gives liberty to be generous with the product, or it may simply be more effective overall, but it&#x27;s in my beauty cabinet to stay.</li>
            <li>After I put it on, I feel like my skin is as clean as it can be</li>
            <li>I feel really clean after i use it</li>
            <li>skin feels immediately softer, smoother, refreshed, clean, and non-oily</li>
            <li>And it works well to clean the pores.</li>
            <li>it gets the skin really clean</li>
            <li>What pores?\\&quot; This stuff is super cheap</li>
            <li>broke me out, didn&#x27;t clean anything</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling nice and refreshes and soft!</li>
            <li>mask is everything I was looking for: thick, not too pungent, great ingredients, and best of all, IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mask whenever I&#x27;ve had a long day</li>
            <li>So far I love this!</li>
            <li>, I apply  the mask on, let it sets for 10-15 minutes then clean it off with a warm cloth (my professional skincare friend&#x27;s advise to preclean my mask)</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about the Freeman mask is that it doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been effective drying completely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and nice aftet use.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s just not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This masque works very well at making your face look healthy and evening your skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>My skin also feels delightfully soft after using and it smells pretty good to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very gentle and easy to get off so on stressful days when I just want to relax and not do a lot of face maintenance</li>
            <li>, it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it&#x27;s very easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>have very oily skin in certain areas and dry skin in others, so for me this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Feels great and the only thing that really gets my blackheads out.</li>
            <li>When I do break out it gets rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li>Its refreshing and love the way my skin feels after using, but the only problem for me is that it dries too quickly.</li>
            <li>This is an easy application mask, smells good, and leaves your skin feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>And Is Super Creamy.</li>
            <li>defenitely coming back for more, just hopefully these products will still be able to ship to Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I love this mask and makes my skin feels smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>This is one of the Best Facial Masques that i have ever bought for multiple reasons.</li>
            <li>Quick tip, exfoliate before applying</li>
            <li>I find that when I don&#x27;t use it regularly my skin is much more oily and therefore more break-outs occur.</li>
            <li>There is no burning and works quickly.</li>
            <li>Once I had finished with it, my skin felt more smooth, and silky soft.</li>
            <li>Love this clay mask and everything came in a pretty reasonable time frame!</li>
            <li>but I do not think it does anything worthy of noting to my skin.</li>
            <li>Does not burn, very gentle!</li>
            <li>In time, the burning feeling receded and turned into an almost-pleasant(but not unpleasant) warm/tingly sensation.</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I wasn&#x27;t expected to be so excited after using this!</li>
            <li>The great thing to this is facial clay mask is that it leaves my skin SUPER SOFT after washing it off with warm water and it helps my acne ^-^ , but the downfall for me is that when it is applied onto my face, it is a bit irritating to my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel that great *</li>
            <li>I eventually bought glamglow&#x27;s exfoliating mask because of all its great reviews-- celebrity approved, &amp;#34;60 bucks a pop, it&#x27;s gotta be amazing&amp;#34; and for half price, why not?</li>
            <li>So, I was really happy when this mask not only made my face look more refreshed and healthy, but didn&#x27;t even irritate it a little bit!</li>
            <li>This helps to calm the affected area and sometimes avoid a pimple altogether.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients are perfect for my extra sensitive skin, and make my skin</li>
            <li>Product definitely worth having.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not written any reviews before this one, but with the rave reviews and not finding any that had my experiences on it, I figured that it would be worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has helped with my breakouts and my face looks more clear and looks purified.</li>
            <li>so I bought a bunch of different kind here.</li>
            <li>Face feels fresh and renewed after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>So far my favorite Freeman mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too powerful for something you put on your face.</li>
            <li>I always think the more expensive something is, the better, but I got such great results from this mask!</li>
            <li>The colorful containers lured me to buy one while I was at the store today.</li>
            <li>Okay for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a more natural one.</li>
            <li>It is worth having and at a price that is affordable to the every day person.  </li>
            <li>Despite that, it was fun to put on and wear, and the sensation progression(fun phrase) made the experience more satisfying than other masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and then I can wipe it off clean with warm water and a wet cloth.  </li>
            <li>This mask leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you right now that I&#x27;ll be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now</li>
            <li>Used twice and noticed right away that it got rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going to come right out and say it</li>
            <li>It has a slight, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The Freeman Facial Masque is very easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>and my face is rejuvenated and feels soft, clean, and fresh!</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and leaves face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super in love this facial months.</li>
            <li>It has a high amount of Titanium Dioxide, which is the main ingredient in many foundations and powders.</li>
            <li>First tube I like it, help calm my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Very good product, which was hard to find!  </li>
            <li>and with my normal Neutrogena cleanser/toner and together they have brought my skin (which was blemished and damaged) back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly love this and recommend this to anyone whose skin easily gets oily just like mine.</li>
            <li>Because I have large pores that are getting (ack!)</li>
            <li>I let it completely dry before stepping in the shower and washing it all off with warm water.</li>
            <li>When I put it on it was cool and refreshing and it took about 5-10 minutes to dry on my face.</li>
            <li>This is a very mask, very gentle, doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry, works for me, and very good price too, it&#x27;s big tube.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it was fine for me to use.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, within 15 mins,removes easily  and actually made my face smoother.</li>
            <li>My forehead, which is usually a disaster zone, feels absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, as well a huge pores.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay, if you want something better, pay extra to get something fancy to suit your needs.</li>
            <li>I love the clay mask and it&#x27;s definitely a winner!</li>
            <li>Love Freeman Facial Products!</li>
            <li>I just tried this mask for the first time today.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve had this mask on, my pores are much much smaller, my blackheads are much much better</li>
            <li>Love this facial masque.  </li>
            <li>This is my first mask I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Very Well !</li>
            <li>I am an avid Clinique and Aveda user...  </li>
            <li>If it were more than ten dollars, I would never buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this facial mask.</li>
            <li>and also it has a funny smell.</li>
            <li>i love freemans facial masque!</li>
            <li>I would only do it once a week to start to make sure your skin can handle it.</li>
            <li>But the cost is too much!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial mask!</li>
            <li>Is the only product that really helps to keep my skin calm and healthy and it dose not let it get flaky</li>
            <li>Using more often might cause irritation and actually worsen your skin</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how cheap it was , but when it comes to this product, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth after an application.</li>
            <li>For someone with consistent acne, this is quite the</li>
            <li>what because the first tube I didn&#x27;t have no issue.</li>
            <li>Works great use it every week at least twice a week.</li>
            <li>What can I say this is my favorite facial treatment.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Glad I only bought a sample packet, it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I put it on and within two minutes began smelling vomit.</li>
            <li>I only use it about 1x a week or more if my face breaks out.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive, but aside from some redness the product does leave my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>it also kinda dried my face out but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>also use this on my back (followed by a sand scrub) for the beach season or before wearing a low-back dress because it really makes the skin look clean/bright with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more taut and firm and clean....</li>
            <li>Really leaves my face feeling, soft, and a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The reason I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 however, is due to the fact that the mask produces very strong fumes which makes my eyes sting and tear up profusely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; large pores, but this masque certainly helps keep them in check.</li>
            <li>feel like this mask does a great job of keeping my face less oily for several days at a time.</li>
            <li>Decent pricing as well!</li>
            <li>I like using the clay masks because they are much easier to remove than the ones that \\&quot;peel\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The mask works really well on my skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much softer after use.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this mask if you have oily skin or acne problems.</li>
            <li>Removes excess oil without too much drying of the skin.  </li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s just because my skin is very sensitive.i</li>
            <li>ty shipping was fast....</li>
            <li>I really like to use this on my face.</li>
            <li>i really like this mask as well</li>
            <li>I have a really oily akin and I have a problem with acne.</li>
            <li>I feel like you could use it as much as you&#x27;d like and it&#x27;ll help.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin soft and feeling fresh taking away the oils that surface on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper than Amazon, I got it for 3.27 compared to 6.63 on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The mask didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin, and oh my god, the smell.</li>
            <li>Bought this after much research, and the product did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very stubborn.</li>
            <li>And after applying moisturizer like normal, I could feel that my skin was also really hydrated!</li>
            <li>It really can&#x27;t be beat in my boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for absolute certainty because I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a week and notice that it does help a lot in absorbing the oil in my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial care products--too numerous to mention--for much more money and have not had the same satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind the smell much.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask because &lt;</li>
            <li>husband has really oily skin</li>
            <li>Really cleans out pours.</li>
            <li>Really dries my skin and causes breakout.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>And it seems to work really well smoothing out my skin -</li>
            <li>so I have to wash my face very well, twice a day.</li>
            <li>I also have combination skin, and this works VERY well with it.</li>
            <li>It is sensitive enough to not cause my skin to flare up, but it refreshes my face and I don&#x27;t have as many break outs.</li>
            <li>This product works much better than putting just regular old avocado and oatmeal on your face and smearing it around.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand why this product and other freeman products have such good ratings?</li>
            <li>It does not take long to apply and or rinse off ,The end result is perfectly clean and healthy skin all day and night long.</li>
            <li>and i plan to buy more of it and maybe try other Freeman products.</li>
            <li>But after washing this mask off, I first noticed that it left my skin extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I do recommend a moisturizer afterwards and only applying it once or twice a week, but it is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>I just wish it left my face feeling clean and purified.</li>
            <li>It makes things feel nice and tight and supper soft!</li>
            <li>I give this a  high rating for fast delivering and packaging.</li>
            <li>it really does help clear my skin!!</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin and keeps my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is such a relief to put it on because it is both cool and helps control the stinging pain.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, so far.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s not bad of a product because I do feel my face being cleaner after use.</li>
            <li>I live in Boston where the weather kills my combo skin!</li>
            <li>I love that the mask is very thick and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This drugstore steal outperforms my favorite department store mask for less than 1/6 of the price.  </li>
            <li>Makes my oily and dry skin silky smooth</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really helped clear up my acne, but my skin is smoother and clean after using this facial masque.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent masque for the price but don&#x27;t expect miracles from this.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li>my face was tomato red one time when I left it on for more than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it at all!</li>
            <li>no redness or peeling at all, unlike many products for oily skin that leave you feeling itchy and tight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>high end</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend both to you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finally gave it a chance, I could seriously see the dirt and oil coming out of my pores when the mask was drying.</li>
            <li>But because the bottle is so large it&#x27;s worth the price you pay, just do not leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mask 3-4 times now, so it&#x27;s a bit early to know if it&#x27;s having a real effect.</li>
            <li>normal</li>
            <li>Kind of a thick consistency.</li>
            <li>the price is right, not bad after it&#x27;s washed off either, little or no moisturizer needed.</li>
            <li>It does not leave your face dry, but rather smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I let it dry for about 10-20 minutes just to make sure it picked up as much as it possibly could and used a wash cloth to take it off.</li>
            <li>Within the first week her face and back cleared remarkably fast, and leaves her skin baby soft!</li>
            <li>The mask didn&#x27;t solidify or dry like normal due to the super-steamy bathroom, but was still effective.  </li>
            <li>I also opted to cut back on exfoliating and let my skin do its own thing with just a little oomph--</li>
            <li>This mask alleviated the rough patches and eliminated  the blackheads at the same time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle yet effective mask, non irritating.</li>
            <li>My pores are much clearer and squeezing the blackheads on the nose, which my esthetician used to do, (the only place I would squeeze d/t scarring), has become much easier</li>
            <li>This mask is gentle and has left me with dewy, hydrated and blackhead free skin every single time.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller/invisible and my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t been able to see how it acts on my pores since they&#x27;re small anyway.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I use this on my face everynight before bed and since then my face has cleared up considerably and its never felt silkier!  </li>
            <li>I use clinique products on a daily basis, but I love doing this mask either weekly or every other week depending on how my skin is feeling.  </li>
            <li>Just order way early from when you expect it to be there!</li>
            <li>I like this mask because it&#x27;s one of the only ones that you don&#x27;t have to wash your face first.</li>
            <li>and I will buy it again, but I would keep the fumes in mind if you have eyes that are sensitive to that sort of thing!</li>
            <li>And I generally don&#x27;t because I have had acne my whole life even after seeing a Derm.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this from my pharmacy, and it was quite funny that I just now got done washing it off my face before finding it here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll leave Mint julep because I love that mask</li>
            <li>I love clay masks and stuff and usually use the cvs mint clay mask but was at bed bath and have used freeman products before</li>
            <li>I have used several of the other Freeman masks and have had great results (cucumber, Dead Sea, etc...)</li>
            <li>After I use the mask, my skin is amazingly soft and supple, like brand new.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- if you live near a Walmart, buy from there.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, and was worried that this would really dry out my skin even more.</li>
            <li>First off, if you have an Ulta near by, you can find this product there for four dollars in the same size.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and have tried a number of different masks through out the years</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth, refreshed, and tight.</li>
            <li>My skin feels tight and smooth after using.</li>
            <li>After the application according to the directions, my face felt so relax, smooth and a little bit</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know much about a bad or a good mask.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, along with a Biore pore strip, and my face is so clear.</li>
            <li>I makes your skin look clear and poreless.</li>
            <li>My only complains are that whenever I apply this on my face, it stings my eyes so much although I did not apply it close around the eyes either, just around cheek area.</li>
            <li>This Mask has made a difference in my face and my skin feels soft and refreshed .</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li>oh so soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and tightens up my pores.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This mask made my face INSANELY soft.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin I would not suggest this product.  </li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive nose or sensitive skin with fragrance this is not for you.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t put it directly around my eyes either.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Feels soft.</li>
            <li>After this 1-2 procedure, I look like I&#x27;ve had a professional facial!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard it was good and not to expensive, so that&#x27;s why I ordered it.</li>
            <li>and I love how it&#x27;s creamier and goes on easier than my thick, chunky, queen helene masque.</li>
            <li>Even though I am pushing 50, and my skin is pretty dry, I still keep this clay masque on hand.</li>
            <li>Usually a washcloth, warm/tepid water, and a strong hand to scrub is needed.</li>
            <li>A Lot Of Face Washes Tends To Leave My Face Extra Oily Or Super Dry.</li>
            <li>it cools my face down quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to see my dark spots get lighter and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This mask smells nothing like avocado, instead it has more of a cotton candy scent, which is a little strange.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily but not particularly acne prone skin, and I&#x27;m pretty lazy about caring for it (wash with an apricot scrub in the shower, use a toner in the mornings, and dab on lotion as needed).I was hoping that this would control the oil and leave me with soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my daughter who&#x27;s in high school and has acne on her face and back.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, dry &amp; oily, acne prone (not a lot of zits, mainly blackheads and some whiteheads).</li>
            <li>I saw a huge improvement in my skin within a few weeks of use!</li>
            <li>I have used this mask for a few years now and find it more and more difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually notice much difference in my skin- a little less oily and more evenly moisterized.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely eradicate every spot, but it definitely clears up my face considerably overnight.</li>
            <li>After letting it dry on my face for about 10 minutes and rinsing off, my skin is completely oil free without being tight or irritated.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh and tight after I use this.</li>
            <li>I can absolutely say that after a single week,  my skin had never in my ENTIRE life been so clear and even-toned.  </li>
            <li>my favorite way to use it is half of this mask with half mint julpe mask from queen Helen.</li>
            <li>This tube is big enough so this should last me longer than 6 months really since I use it maybe once a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never thought of myself as having sensitive skin before, but I noticed immediately while putting this on that there was a definite burning feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel a bit firmer now, but it doesn&#x27;t feel especially cleansed or soft or anything.</li>
            <li>It left the soft, refreshed and relaxed feelings after each use.</li>
            <li>Next morning when I wash it off, my skin is so soft and refreshed looking.  </li>
            <li>My skin is left soft and supple.</li>
            <li>This mask dramatically helped my blackheads, after using the mask they&#x27;re almost totally gone but not quite, granted NOTHING has ever completely cleared them out.</li>
            <li>but it definitely smooths my skin &amp; makes it baby soft.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft &amp; my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li>All this after only one use so far.</li>
            <li>I have had this for 3 months now and have only used it 3 times but still my skin is to sensitive for it.</li>
            <li>They were nice, but I don&#x27;t have time to always mix the ingredients and one day, I randomly went on amazon and typed avocado masque.</li>
            <li>Just frustrating I can get a foot spa bath, facail sauna system and many more larger items from other sellers on time, but not this little mask tube.</li>
            <li>The next day I exfoliate really well to get rid of any dry skin flakes.</li>
            <li>I apply a thick layer because I think leaving it on a bit longer helps even more and the thicker the layer, the longer the dry time.</li>
            <li>The mask makes my skin feel clean and clear, without drying out my face like some other masks I&#x27;ve previously owned.</li>
            <li>It is also a vibrant powder blue color, which makes my face look like a big, blue Smarties Candy.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you feel you might have a pimple coming on, I dab a little on the area, let it dry and clean it off.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal, I use Dove Men&#x27;s Sensitive Face Lotion after ANY facial cleaning product</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t not dry it out or create excess oil.</li>
            <li>It has a good consistency and is easy to apply, though if you wash it off with a wash cloth it looks sort of nasty, but no big deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure exactly how it does this, but it works!</li>
            <li>It does have a little bit of a scent to it, but it&#x27;s not a fake perfumey type of scent</li>
            <li>The results don&#x27;t last very long for me; I have a very oily face due to hormone imbalances and it&#x27;s very hard to control this for more than one day.</li>
            <li>so I have to be really careful when trying new skin products</li>
            <li>I usually throw on alpha hydroxy moisturizer right after, and haven&#x27;t noticed any adverse affects from that.</li>
            <li>For one, I found this in a store for almost half the price as what I paid on Amazon, so really I would not purchase it on here again.</li>
            <li>only draw back so far is that my skin seems slightly drier but it is winter and that&#x27;s normal for me</li>
            <li>the only things i don&#x27;t like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them, and it&#x27;s a little itchy when it dries.</li>
            <li>Do not use this masque or any other masque too much because it will dry your face.</li>
            <li>I usually hate masks because they leave my skin bright red and sensitive to the touch for hours after use.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin clear minus the occasional hormonal breakout...  </li>

            <li> Love this mask!</li>
            <li> This mask does everything it says it will do and more!</li>
            <li> It smells great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great clay mask, real easy to remove, especially leaving it overnight once, plus it&#x27;s a great price too &amp; just want I needed for my beauty routine!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice and applies easily</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing.</li>
            <li> paired this mask along with the Freeman Pineapple Enzyme mask (which smells amazing</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this mask and think it works great...</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how amazing this is.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> Honestly i would give it 4.5 stars--</li>
            <li> This is a nice, affordable skin treatment for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> Nice mask</li>
            <li> (I know i need to avoid eye area, i know the instruction for using this kind of products, it still cause the tearing reaction)</li>
            <li> It Applies On Nice</li>
            <li> reason for loving this is that I have severe allergic reaction to all bugs- saliva, bites, poison, everything.</li>
            <li> Face feels very refreshed afterwords and looks great!</li>
            <li> A nice cleansing mask.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> if it starts drying at the edges just apply some warm water with a damp washcloth to rehydrate while the rest of it dries.  </li>
            <li> After not even hearing anything from them I decided to contact seller and they were nice, telling me that it is almost here.</li>
            <li> and yes,  the results were nice...  </li>
            <li> You could spend much more, and not get a product this good.</li>
            <li> It works nice.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> Smells like warm</li>
            <li> The mask is drying but effective.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, I highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> the plus side, it leaves your skin feeling VERY soft and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> Comes off very easily, I leave on for 5-10min.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best clay mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and the price is just an unexpected bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been fairly happy with my department store brand clay mask, but this one seemed like fun, and was super-inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face masks out there, and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> but when i do its really nice and refreshing for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great buy and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great mask for clogged pores and price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> but my face was very smooth when i was done with the mask.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Dries up all my oil without drying my skin, cleans out the gunk, and leaves my face with a nice smooth feel and an even healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It doesnt sting like most masks but you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything drastic from this masque but it does leave my skin softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask.  </li>
            <li> I love it,,,</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim and just LOVE it.</li>

            <li> I really enjoyed this face mask.</li>
            <li> I always love  this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used this product three nights ago and the reaction has not gotten much better.  </li>
            <li> I thinks it&#x27;s a great all-around mask.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an overwhelming perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li> but my package was supposed to be here at the latest the 8th</li>
            <li> But I wanted even better.  </li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> Got this one because the name sounded refreshing.</li>
            <li> I would for sure get this again.</li>
            <li> It is also so cheap!:)</li>
            <li> Could just be me, gave to friend, hopefully it&#x27;ll work out better for her.</li>
            <li> It did the job, and I like it better than anything I have ever tried before.</li>
            <li> but I usually love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Okay so I never bother to write reviews on anything, but I feel like this deserved it.</li>
            <li> There was no redness, if anything my complexion was more even than beforehand.</li>
            <li> Ta-ta, off to buy more freeman masks.</li>
            <li> I love the way this Freeman Clay mask leaves my combination skin.</li>
            <li> My forehead, and nose are my most oily areas.</li>
            <li> I just need to use it more on a routine.</li>
            <li> When the timer went off I figured I&#x27;d look more when I get out of the shower and never found anything</li>
            <li> This mask took away my redness and my skin is sooo free and airy!</li>
            <li> Its so refreshing.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all of the Freeman masks.</li>
            <li> My go-to for many years now.</li>
            <li> It does contain both aluminum as well as more than one paraben compound (linked to hormone receptor interference).  </li>
            <li> In fact, there&#x27;s more aluminum than oatmeal or avacado!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very well priced.</li>
            <li> It really tightens your skin and great for those with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love the cooling sensation of this product on my face.</li>
            <li> Felt so refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is okay.</li>
            <li> but the smell is sooo so overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is just ok.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat refreshing</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and feels great on my face, even my boyfriend likes using it haha</li>
            <li> And one of my favorite things about this mask, it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I love this masque.</li>
            <li> This one seemed the best especially  since it included oatmeal.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clean and healthy that night and the morning after!</li>
            <li> It rinses off very cleanly and easily, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and after my first use, my skin felt more incredible and clean than it had in MONTHS.</li>
            <li> Honestly the first couple times I used it it made my face kind of burn.</li>
            <li> evens out my skin, soothes it and makes my skin feel clean and feel really nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the higher priced masks of course</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best budget beauty buy I&#x27;ve run across in a long time.  </li>
            <li> how long you leave it on, to find out what works best for your skin type.</li>
            <li> I just wonder how long I can store a unopened container, and where is best place to store it ?</li>
            <li> Searched a long time to find this product again and am completely happy!</li>
            <li> Not to mention so cheap and easy to find!</li>
            <li> I love this mask, and have now purchased the full size!</li>
            <li> Good facial is always a good thing</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel clean and refreshed also has a nice smell and goes on easily</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I followed up by toning and moisturizing and my skin felt revived and so clean!</li>
            <li> Smells so great and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My Skin Feels More Hydrated And Smooth.</li>
            <li> Love how it goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a try because I love free products.  </li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended this, and it really works good.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and it tingles as you put it on and gradually gets better, it&#x27;s easily washable.  </li>
            <li> i am seriously willing to buy more of these products!</li>
            <li> Im really pleased that I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff leaves my face feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> This was easily remedied by using moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- easy to apply and comes off easy with water&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on well and comes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is great for oily skin, it takes away all my shine and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> so if you have issues with strong smells</li>
            <li> I took off one star because this mask does have a strong smell that even for a non-sensitive person like me, I would like for the manufacturer to chill with the scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong smell of baby powder with a tinge of hair perm??  </li>
            <li> It manages to leave my sensitive skin clean and happy -</li>
            <li> anyway I smelled this one in the tube and it smelled fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the plus side is I have seen no side affects from this mask; it makes my skin feel super soft and does not break me out which is a great plus.</li>
            <li> Great scent, easy application, relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> The avocado/oatmeal combination is great, especially if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive/combination skin.  </li>
            <li> Really takes away the oil in your face &amp; cleans it up nicely.</li>
            <li> Would and will buy again if still available.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth...</li>
            <li> Makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> For a cheap face mask, it does work well.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s cheap  </li>
            <li> I have learned my lesson to not use cheap masks again.</li>
            <li> Jesus christ has said: I am the light of the world.he who follows me will never walk in darkness.please</li>
            <li> /&gt;While acne products tend to vary immensely in their effectiveness on a person to person basis, the Freeman Avocado and Oatmeal Mask is a great option for anyone suffering from acne to try.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the avocados delivered and</li>
            <li> its really cheap &lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> product works great, dries in short time and just splash off with water.</li>
            <li> contains Vitamin E which is essential for great skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am allergic to literally everything (confirmed by an allergy doctor)</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels like it&#x27;s tightening my face and pores and how fresh my face looks.</li>
            <li> its made of natural ingredients that are good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It really does the job well!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it made a difference in just my first use !!</li>
            <li> but I would definitely recommend this mask:]!!</li>
            <li> It was really easy to apply and was super smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> and i feel clean and smooth after i use it.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed my face it felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is a decent mask on its own but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really creamy and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li> Makes skin really soft &amp; it smells super good.</li>
            <li> Together they really make perfect mask that doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin or burn it but still have all the benefits of both.</li>
            <li> I love this product, this is my first time using a mask</li>
            <li> She has been using proactive for awhile and this product did more in the first use than over $200 worth of proactive products she&#x27;s tried!</li>
            <li> Makes my nose itch sometimes but worth it!</li>
            <li> Fun to use too!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- removes blackheads with ease, I noticed some blackheads on my nose gone after the FIRST time using it, more disappears over time when continuing usage of this product&lt;br /&gt;- shrinks pores&lt;</li>
            <li> its WORTH BUYING!</li>
            <li> (I also like its fresh smell!)</li>
            <li> I love this mask, I&#x27;m at the end of my first bottle and just ordered another.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> This avocado &amp; oatmeal masque is super cheap</li>
            <li> It does make my face feel really clean.</li>
            <li> It may be that the discount price gives liberty to be generous with the product, or it may simply be more effective overall, but it&#x27;s in my beauty cabinet to stay.</li>
            <li> After I put it on, I feel like my skin is as clean as it can be</li>
            <li> I feel really clean after i use it</li>
            <li> skin feels immediately softer, smoother, refreshed, clean, and non-oily</li>
            <li> And it works well to clean the pores.</li>
            <li> it gets the skin really clean</li>
            <li> What pores?\\&quot; This stuff is super cheap</li>
            <li> broke me out, didn&#x27;t clean anything</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling nice and refreshes and soft!</li>
            <li> mask is everything I was looking for: thick, not too pungent, great ingredients, and best of all, IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mask whenever I&#x27;ve had a long day</li>
            <li> So far I love this!</li>
            <li> , I apply  the mask on, let it sets for 10-15 minutes then clean it off with a warm cloth (my professional skincare friend&#x27;s advise to preclean my mask)</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about the Freeman mask is that it doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been effective drying completely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and nice aftet use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s just not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This masque works very well at making your face look healthy and evening your skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> My skin also feels delightfully soft after using and it smells pretty good to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very gentle and easy to get off so on stressful days when I just want to relax and not do a lot of face maintenance</li>
            <li> , it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it&#x27;s very easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> have very oily skin in certain areas and dry skin in others, so for me this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Feels great and the only thing that really gets my blackheads out.</li>
            <li> When I do break out it gets rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li> Its refreshing and love the way my skin feels after using, but the only problem for me is that it dries too quickly.</li>
            <li> This is an easy application mask, smells good, and leaves your skin feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> And Is Super Creamy.</li>
            <li> defenitely coming back for more, just hopefully these products will still be able to ship to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I love this mask and makes my skin feels smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> This is one of the Best Facial Masques that i have ever bought for multiple reasons.</li>
            <li> Quick tip, exfoliate before applying</li>
            <li> I find that when I don&#x27;t use it regularly my skin is much more oily and therefore more break-outs occur.</li>
            <li> There is no burning and works quickly.</li>
            <li> Once I had finished with it, my skin felt more smooth, and silky soft.</li>
            <li> Love this clay mask and everything came in a pretty reasonable time frame!</li>
            <li> but I do not think it does anything worthy of noting to my skin.</li>
            <li> Does not burn, very gentle!</li>
            <li> In time, the burning feeling receded and turned into an almost-pleasant(but not unpleasant) warm/tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> The scent is sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I wasn&#x27;t expected to be so excited after using this!</li>
            <li> The great thing to this is facial clay mask is that it leaves my skin SUPER SOFT after washing it off with warm water and it helps my acne ^-^ , but the downfall for me is that when it is applied onto my face, it is a bit irritating to my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel that great *</li>
            <li> I eventually bought glamglow&#x27;s exfoliating mask because of all its great reviews-- celebrity approved, &amp;#34;60 bucks a pop, it&#x27;s gotta be amazing&amp;#34; and for half price, why not?</li>
            <li> So, I was really happy when this mask not only made my face look more refreshed and healthy, but didn&#x27;t even irritate it a little bit!</li>
            <li> This helps to calm the affected area and sometimes avoid a pimple altogether.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients are perfect for my extra sensitive skin, and make my skin</li>
            <li> Product definitely worth having.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not written any reviews before this one, but with the rave reviews and not finding any that had my experiences on it, I figured that it would be worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has helped with my breakouts and my face looks more clear and looks purified.</li>
            <li> so I bought a bunch of different kind here.</li>
            <li> Face feels fresh and renewed after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite Freeman mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too powerful for something you put on your face.</li>
            <li> I always think the more expensive something is, the better, but I got such great results from this mask!</li>
            <li> The colorful containers lured me to buy one while I was at the store today.</li>
            <li> Okay for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a more natural one.</li>
            <li> It is worth having and at a price that is affordable to the every day person.  </li>
            <li> Despite that, it was fun to put on and wear, and the sensation progression(fun phrase) made the experience more satisfying than other masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and then I can wipe it off clean with warm water and a wet cloth.  </li>
            <li> This mask leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you right now that I&#x27;ll be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now</li>
            <li> Used twice and noticed right away that it got rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to come right out and say it</li>
            <li> It has a slight, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The Freeman Facial Masque is very easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> and my face is rejuvenated and feels soft, clean, and fresh!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and leaves face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super in love this facial months.</li>
            <li> It has a high amount of Titanium Dioxide, which is the main ingredient in many foundations and powders.</li>
            <li> First tube I like it, help calm my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Very good product, which was hard to find!  </li>
            <li> and with my normal Neutrogena cleanser/toner and together they have brought my skin (which was blemished and damaged) back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly love this and recommend this to anyone whose skin easily gets oily just like mine.</li>
            <li> Because I have large pores that are getting (ack!)</li>
            <li> I let it completely dry before stepping in the shower and washing it all off with warm water.</li>
            <li> When I put it on it was cool and refreshing and it took about 5-10 minutes to dry on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a very mask, very gentle, doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry, works for me, and very good price too, it&#x27;s big tube.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it was fine for me to use.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, within 15 mins,removes easily  and actually made my face smoother.</li>
            <li> My forehead, which is usually a disaster zone, feels absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, as well a huge pores.  </li>
            <li> You get what you pay, if you want something better, pay extra to get something fancy to suit your needs.</li>
            <li> I love the clay mask and it&#x27;s definitely a winner!</li>
            <li> Love Freeman Facial Products!</li>
            <li> I just tried this mask for the first time today.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve had this mask on, my pores are much much smaller, my blackheads are much much better</li>
            <li> Love this facial masque.  </li>
            <li> This is my first mask I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very Well !</li>
            <li> I am an avid Clinique and Aveda user...  </li>
            <li> If it were more than ten dollars, I would never buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this facial mask.</li>
            <li> and also it has a funny smell.</li>
            <li> i love freemans facial masque!</li>
            <li> I would only do it once a week to start to make sure your skin can handle it.</li>
            <li> But the cost is too much!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial mask!</li>
            <li> Is the only product that really helps to keep my skin calm and healthy and it dose not let it get flaky</li>
            <li> Using more often might cause irritation and actually worsen your skin</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how cheap it was , but when it comes to this product, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth after an application.</li>
            <li> For someone with consistent acne, this is quite the</li>
            <li> what because the first tube I didn&#x27;t have no issue.</li>
            <li> Works great use it every week at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> What can I say this is my favorite facial treatment.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Glad I only bought a sample packet, it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I put it on and within two minutes began smelling vomit.</li>
            <li> I only use it about 1x a week or more if my face breaks out.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive, but aside from some redness the product does leave my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> it also kinda dried my face out but not in a good way.</li>
            <li> also use this on my back (followed by a sand scrub) for the beach season or before wearing a low-back dress because it really makes the skin look clean/bright with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more taut and firm and clean....</li>
            <li> Really leaves my face feeling, soft, and a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 however, is due to the fact that the mask produces very strong fumes which makes my eyes sting and tear up profusely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; large pores, but this masque certainly helps keep them in check.</li>
            <li> feel like this mask does a great job of keeping my face less oily for several days at a time.</li>
            <li> Decent pricing as well!</li>
            <li> I like using the clay masks because they are much easier to remove than the ones that \\&quot;peel\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The mask works really well on my skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much softer after use.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this mask if you have oily skin or acne problems.</li>
            <li> Removes excess oil without too much drying of the skin.  </li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s just because my skin is very sensitive.i</li>
            <li> ty shipping was fast....</li>
            <li> I really like to use this on my face.</li>
            <li> i really like this mask as well</li>
            <li> I have a really oily akin and I have a problem with acne.</li>
            <li> I feel like you could use it as much as you&#x27;d like and it&#x27;ll help.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin soft and feeling fresh taking away the oils that surface on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper than Amazon, I got it for 3.27 compared to 6.63 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The mask didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin, and oh my god, the smell.</li>
            <li> Bought this after much research, and the product did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very stubborn.</li>
            <li> And after applying moisturizer like normal, I could feel that my skin was also really hydrated!</li>
            <li> It really can&#x27;t be beat in my boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for absolute certainty because I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a week and notice that it does help a lot in absorbing the oil in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial care products--too numerous to mention--for much more money and have not had the same satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind the smell much.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask because &lt;</li>
            <li> husband has really oily skin</li>
            <li> Really cleans out pours.</li>
            <li> Really dries my skin and causes breakout.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> And it seems to work really well smoothing out my skin -</li>
            <li> so I have to wash my face very well, twice a day.</li>
            <li> I also have combination skin, and this works VERY well with it.</li>
            <li> It is sensitive enough to not cause my skin to flare up, but it refreshes my face and I don&#x27;t have as many break outs.</li>
            <li> This product works much better than putting just regular old avocado and oatmeal on your face and smearing it around.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand why this product and other freeman products have such good ratings?</li>
            <li> It does not take long to apply and or rinse off ,The end result is perfectly clean and healthy skin all day and night long.</li>
            <li> and i plan to buy more of it and maybe try other Freeman products.</li>
            <li> But after washing this mask off, I first noticed that it left my skin extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I do recommend a moisturizer afterwards and only applying it once or twice a week, but it is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> I just wish it left my face feeling clean and purified.</li>
            <li> It makes things feel nice and tight and supper soft!</li>
            <li> I give this a  high rating for fast delivering and packaging.</li>
            <li> it really does help clear my skin!!</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin and keeps my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is such a relief to put it on because it is both cool and helps control the stinging pain.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, so far.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s not bad of a product because I do feel my face being cleaner after use.</li>
            <li> I live in Boston where the weather kills my combo skin!</li>
            <li> I love that the mask is very thick and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This drugstore steal outperforms my favorite department store mask for less than 1/6 of the price.  </li>
            <li> Makes my oily and dry skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really helped clear up my acne, but my skin is smoother and clean after using this facial masque.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent masque for the price but don&#x27;t expect miracles from this.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> my face was tomato red one time when I left it on for more than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it at all!</li>
            <li> no redness or peeling at all, unlike many products for oily skin that leave you feeling itchy and tight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> high end</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend both to you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally gave it a chance, I could seriously see the dirt and oil coming out of my pores when the mask was drying.</li>
            <li> But because the bottle is so large it&#x27;s worth the price you pay, just do not leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask 3-4 times now, so it&#x27;s a bit early to know if it&#x27;s having a real effect.</li>
            <li> normal</li>
            <li> Kind of a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> the price is right, not bad after it&#x27;s washed off either, little or no moisturizer needed.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your face dry, but rather smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I let it dry for about 10-20 minutes just to make sure it picked up as much as it possibly could and used a wash cloth to take it off.</li>
            <li> Within the first week her face and back cleared remarkably fast, and leaves her skin baby soft!</li>
            <li> The mask didn&#x27;t solidify or dry like normal due to the super-steamy bathroom, but was still effective.  </li>
            <li> I also opted to cut back on exfoliating and let my skin do its own thing with just a little oomph--</li>
            <li> This mask alleviated the rough patches and eliminated  the blackheads at the same time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle yet effective mask, non irritating.</li>
            <li> My pores are much clearer and squeezing the blackheads on the nose, which my esthetician used to do, (the only place I would squeeze d/t scarring), has become much easier</li>
            <li> This mask is gentle and has left me with dewy, hydrated and blackhead free skin every single time.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller/invisible and my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t been able to see how it acts on my pores since they&#x27;re small anyway.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face everynight before bed and since then my face has cleared up considerably and its never felt silkier!  </li>
            <li> I use clinique products on a daily basis, but I love doing this mask either weekly or every other week depending on how my skin is feeling.  </li>
            <li> Just order way early from when you expect it to be there!</li>
            <li> I like this mask because it&#x27;s one of the only ones that you don&#x27;t have to wash your face first.</li>
            <li> and I will buy it again, but I would keep the fumes in mind if you have eyes that are sensitive to that sort of thing!</li>
            <li> And I generally don&#x27;t because I have had acne my whole life even after seeing a Derm.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this from my pharmacy, and it was quite funny that I just now got done washing it off my face before finding it here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll leave Mint julep because I love that mask</li>
            <li> I love clay masks and stuff and usually use the cvs mint clay mask but was at bed bath and have used freeman products before</li>
            <li> I have used several of the other Freeman masks and have had great results (cucumber, Dead Sea, etc...)</li>
            <li> After I use the mask, my skin is amazingly soft and supple, like brand new.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- if you live near a Walmart, buy from there.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin, and was worried that this would really dry out my skin even more.</li>
            <li> First off, if you have an Ulta near by, you can find this product there for four dollars in the same size.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have tried a number of different masks through out the years</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth, refreshed, and tight.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and smooth after using.</li>
            <li> After the application according to the directions, my face felt so relax, smooth and a little bit</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know much about a bad or a good mask.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, along with a Biore pore strip, and my face is so clear.</li>
            <li> I makes your skin look clear and poreless.</li>
            <li> My only complains are that whenever I apply this on my face, it stings my eyes so much although I did not apply it close around the eyes either, just around cheek area.</li>
            <li> This Mask has made a difference in my face and my skin feels soft and refreshed .</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> oh so soft.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft and tightens up my pores.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This mask made my face INSANELY soft.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin I would not suggest this product.  </li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive nose or sensitive skin with fragrance this is not for you.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t put it directly around my eyes either.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Feels soft.</li>
            <li> After this 1-2 procedure, I look like I&#x27;ve had a professional facial!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard it was good and not to expensive, so that&#x27;s why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> and I love how it&#x27;s creamier and goes on easier than my thick, chunky, queen helene masque.</li>
            <li> Even though I am pushing 50, and my skin is pretty dry, I still keep this clay masque on hand.</li>
            <li> Usually a washcloth, warm/tepid water, and a strong hand to scrub is needed.</li>
            <li> A Lot Of Face Washes Tends To Leave My Face Extra Oily Or Super Dry.</li>
            <li> it cools my face down quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see my dark spots get lighter and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This mask smells nothing like avocado, instead it has more of a cotton candy scent, which is a little strange.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily but not particularly acne prone skin, and I&#x27;m pretty lazy about caring for it (wash with an apricot scrub in the shower, use a toner in the mornings, and dab on lotion as needed).I was hoping that this would control the oil and leave me with soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter who&#x27;s in high school and has acne on her face and back.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, dry &amp; oily, acne prone (not a lot of zits, mainly blackheads and some whiteheads).</li>
            <li> I saw a huge improvement in my skin within a few weeks of use!</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for a few years now and find it more and more difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually notice much difference in my skin- a little less oily and more evenly moisterized.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely eradicate every spot, but it definitely clears up my face considerably overnight.</li>
            <li> After letting it dry on my face for about 10 minutes and rinsing off, my skin is completely oil free without being tight or irritated.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh and tight after I use this.</li>
            <li> I can absolutely say that after a single week,  my skin had never in my ENTIRE life been so clear and even-toned.  </li>
            <li> my favorite way to use it is half of this mask with half mint julpe mask from queen Helen.</li>
            <li> This tube is big enough so this should last me longer than 6 months really since I use it maybe once a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never thought of myself as having sensitive skin before, but I noticed immediately while putting this on that there was a definite burning feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel a bit firmer now, but it doesn&#x27;t feel especially cleansed or soft or anything.</li>
            <li> It left the soft, refreshed and relaxed feelings after each use.</li>
            <li> Next morning when I wash it off, my skin is so soft and refreshed looking.  </li>
            <li> My skin is left soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This mask dramatically helped my blackheads, after using the mask they&#x27;re almost totally gone but not quite, granted NOTHING has ever completely cleared them out.</li>
            <li> but it definitely smooths my skin &amp; makes it baby soft.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft &amp; my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> All this after only one use so far.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 3 months now and have only used it 3 times but still my skin is to sensitive for it.</li>
            <li> They were nice, but I don&#x27;t have time to always mix the ingredients and one day, I randomly went on amazon and typed avocado masque.</li>
            <li> Just frustrating I can get a foot spa bath, facail sauna system and many more larger items from other sellers on time, but not this little mask tube.</li>
            <li> The next day I exfoliate really well to get rid of any dry skin flakes.</li>
            <li> I apply a thick layer because I think leaving it on a bit longer helps even more and the thicker the layer, the longer the dry time.</li>
            <li> The mask makes my skin feel clean and clear, without drying out my face like some other masks I&#x27;ve previously owned.</li>
            <li> It is also a vibrant powder blue color, which makes my face look like a big, blue Smarties Candy.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you feel you might have a pimple coming on, I dab a little on the area, let it dry and clean it off.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal, I use Dove Men&#x27;s Sensitive Face Lotion after ANY facial cleaning product</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t not dry it out or create excess oil.</li>
            <li> It has a good consistency and is easy to apply, though if you wash it off with a wash cloth it looks sort of nasty, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly how it does this, but it works!</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of a scent to it, but it&#x27;s not a fake perfumey type of scent</li>
            <li> The results don&#x27;t last very long for me; I have a very oily face due to hormone imbalances and it&#x27;s very hard to control this for more than one day.</li>
            <li> so I have to be really careful when trying new skin products</li>
            <li> I usually throw on alpha hydroxy moisturizer right after, and haven&#x27;t noticed any adverse affects from that.</li>
            <li> For one, I found this in a store for almost half the price as what I paid on Amazon, so really I would not purchase it on here again.</li>
            <li> only draw back so far is that my skin seems slightly drier but it is winter and that&#x27;s normal for me</li>
            <li> the only things i don&#x27;t like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them, and it&#x27;s a little itchy when it dries.</li>
            <li> Do not use this masque or any other masque too much because it will dry your face.</li>
            <li> I usually hate masks because they leave my skin bright red and sensitive to the touch for hours after use.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin clear minus the occasional hormonal breakout...  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily, rough and acne prone skin, as well as large pores.  </li>
            <li> This mask dries up fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait that long to wash it off after waiting for a little.</li>
            <li> I really like that \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\</li>
            <li> My skin appears soft after but other than that,  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and helps to tone down the redness.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who like me has had acne even in their late 20s, its gentle enough it does not dry out skin.  </li>
            <li> I am mainly using this to help with the exfoliation process to get rid of dead skin</li>
            <li> Only down fall is that it burns you&#x27;re eyes when appling near the eye area.</li>
            <li> And it left my skin red, dry, and irritated.</li>
            <li> however this one left face extremely red and dry.</li>
            <li> and I have to do it less frequently with regular use.</li>
            <li> such a treat after a long day.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m almost 45, I want to reduce the looks of 45 for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> its lasted so long that my bottle isn&#x27;t updated to this photo, but its the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel noticeable better and this is a little irritating to the skin after washing it off.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, no tears from fumes, my skin is sensitive and no stinging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You simply apply it, let it dry, rinse, then continue to wash your face with you</li>
            <li> But 3 times of application and I jumped from extreme pain and swelling to barely feel it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I highly recommend for anyone that has blackheads, it will definitely help at least.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and feels silky, it isnt thick and heavy like other mask.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not nearly as drying as some masks I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a mask person, but I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave on too long though...</li>
            <li> It is a clay mask, and clays are known for being drying, so that&#x27;s not a complete surprise.</li>
            <li> One tube lasted me a long time.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients list for this product is only partial and jumbled.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> For some strange reason my face picks up a lot of dirt</li>
            <li> Not only is my face less oily if at all, it gives my face a glow and definitely decreases my acne.</li>
            <li> Dislikes: If you have it on for too long it will dry out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use this again, after I use the last of my other mask tube.</li>
            <li> so strange!</li>
            <li> Makes skin softer but also look dry</li>
            <li> It made my skin dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Also, whenever I was waiting for it to dry, my eyes couldn&#x27;t stop tearing...</li>
            <li> It took care of my dry skin after just 1-2 uses.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on my face until it dry up</li>
            <li> and i have fairly dry skin</li>
            <li> It tends to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I justed used this product a few days ago to detoxify my face after wearing heavy makeup for 4-5 days straight.  </li>
            <li> and I can say I have not had one single breakout or dryness of my face.</li>
            <li> My face is red, there are small bumps all over my face, and the red areas are swollen.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I was pretty sceptical of trying this mask out, but I was also desperate for a mask that could help get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for the past few days and it really has cleaned out my bores.</li>
            <li> The one issue I have is that a little section of my cheek was left feeling rather dry.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin a little, tiny teeny bit dry</li>
            <li> and I really needed something due to some serious skin issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this face mask based on all the positive reviews it got, but I was not completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I went over-bored one week and my face became very dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this may have been a little harsh for it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have that dry feeling afterwards like other skin care products.</li>
            <li> The only dislike for me personally is how hard it feels on my face when it&#x27;s drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this product did not irritate my skin in the least.</li>
            <li> anything, I now look forward to trying the other products in the Freeman line because this one has worked so well and now is cleaning up the mess left by said</li>
            <li> One of the few face products that actually work.</li>
            <li> By the time the product had dried on my skin, it had drained, and the next morning it was healing.</li>
            <li> It also smelled kinda gross after it dried on my face.</li>
            <li> Only takes a few days to flatten my pimples.</li>
            <li> There is not much of a smell</li>
            <li> It applies like a regular mask and after a few minutes, it dries up</li>
            <li> skin doesn&#x27;t feel raw or irritated after the fact, and outside of a flush there is no undue redness.</li>
            <li> I typically use a spa line, but have dry skin so do not need mask as often.</li>
            <li> If my skin is a little dried out I tend to get those little bumps on the outer edges of my cheeks, but they always clear up when I use this.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Other Than That</li>
            <li> I did feel a little dry, but some face moisturizer put that to rest almost immediately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it is easy to apply,  ansaid does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> Despite this, though, I decided to soldier on for at least ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually use this during the weekends when I want to relax from a long week of work.</li>
            <li> wet face, squeeze a dime shape drop onto your finger, apply to face, look at yourself turn green, and watch it harden.</li>
            <li> Took a while for the redness to die down.</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 10-15 minutes for it to dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;General 411: I usually put this all over my face (except eyes and mouth, of course),leave it on 20-ish minutes to let it dry.</li>
            <li> I also break out less.  </li>
            <li> for WAY LESS.</li>
            <li> I have never really used any masks in the past</li>
            <li> I wanted something a little less drying than my purifying mint mask and since this has avocado in it</li>
            <li> like how this helped me a little with reducing the size of pores.</li>
            <li> The mask tightens up a lot as it dries, and I sped up the process a little by fanning myself.</li>
            <li> I also feel a little itchy when it is on my face.</li>
            <li> I did break out a little as well.</li>
            <li> but I can already see my brown spots fading a little.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of products and seen dermatologists with little help.</li>
            <li> I use it about every other day or less!!</li>
            <li> After fifteen minutes, I took it off with a warm+wet towel with little trouble.</li>
            <li> There were a few spots that I needed to go over again because of lingering green tinges, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week between my chemical peel and microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> Dried</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was shipped a few days after I ordered  it.</li>
            <li> I use Benzaclin to control it but every morning I still have a few pimples and oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> so i had to follow up with some heavy, soothing face cream.</li>
            <li> This way my drier areas do not get over dried.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use again a few days.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> Waste of money since product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I also like the Dead Sea Minerals masque from Freeman as well.</li>
            <li> (I think the worse one was one in a yellow tube)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see what happens in a few months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been obsessed watching natural masque for my face.</li>
            <li> This mask does not magically dissolve blackheads, but my pores are less noticeable after I use it.</li>
            <li> It Can Sometimes Crack And Make Your Face Feel Stiff</li>
            <li> it very SLIGHTLY dries my skin.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li> I did not have bad skin to begin with, I just get the occasional bad breakout on my chin or nose and have some lightly visible dark pores in those areas.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I got a trial size of the freeman avocado and oatmeal mask, just looking for something inexpensive to give me a little break during one of my late night study sessions.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not the same effect as using a moisturizer or anything - you&#x27;re still going to lose some moisture -</li>
            <li> I usually use clay masks on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with acne and dryness for the past 18 years.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s usually where I get my masks.</li>
            <li> I usually use this when I get a lot of breakouts</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not sure if it stops acne</li>
            <li> it got my face cleared up in just a few hours!</li>
            <li> They now have the small, one time use containers.</li>
            <li> $2.99&lt;br /&gt;I usually use another brand that I have also purchased from Walgreens</li>
            <li> I usually try and use this mask in the morning before work</li>
            <li> Hard to wash off</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t want to use this mask because I&#x27;m a die hard fan of Queen Helena Mint Julep Mask.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it stung my skin so badly I had to take it off immediately.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for at least 20 years</li>
            <li> this sucks</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product it dried out my skin and left it red and irritated!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I had a small whitehead forming that was painful and red.</li>
            <li> or if I fell asleep the night before and was too lazy and tired to wash my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the mask drys it can be uncomfortable and tight so</li>
            <li> The smell is not as bad as other clay masks I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> By now I&#x27;ve used it four times and every time it smells like vomit, not kind of like vomit, just like vomit!</li>
            <li> Got tired of the packets anyway.</li>
            <li> did not purchase this item from Amazon, it was half the price at Schnucks (I was shocked too)</li>
            <li> Difficult to remove from my face, very hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I brought expensive acne products that would help with one thing and create another.  </li>
            <li> My skin type is moderately oily at its worst.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy another expensive mask to replace the Biore but decided to try the Freeman brand since it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this maskm</li>
            <li> Sadly this got expensive after a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> As I said though,  an avocado a day got expensive and I needed an alternative.</li>
            <li> Two words: Not impressed.</li>
            <li> con - I knocked off a star because this stuff is extremely difficult to take off your face.</li>
            <li> I basically can&#x27;t use it anymore, it was just so unbearable to use, very irritating to my skin and eyes</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s how dirty my face gets).</li>
            <li> and they almost always either make my face itchy, or cause me to break out after using them (in those horrible, big and painful zits!)...</li>
            <li> Wasnt a unpleasant smell either</li>
            <li> It had a really bad smell, like vomit.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get why it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t smell too bad for me.</li>
            <li> The mask was damaged :(</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to do that annoying $25 thing that Amazon is now pushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face horribly will never use this product again</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product definitely worth having. Works just as described. Was a god sent for my face.</li>
            <li> The mask was damaged :(</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This avocado &amp; oatmeal masque is super cheap and I know some people complain about the ingredients. People! You get what you pay, if you want something better, pay extra to get something fancy to suit your needs. This tube is big enough so this should last me longer than 6 months really since I use it maybe once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how this helped me a little with reducing the size of pores. My face feels fresh and tight after I use this. My only complains are that whenever I apply this on my face, it stings my eyes so much although I did not apply it close around the eyes either, just around cheek area. Overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I love the clay mask and it&#x27;s definitely a winner! I feel happy and comfortable with my purchase and so happy that i got this product. This Mask has made a difference in my face and my skin feels soft and refreshed . I will definitely be a regular customer.</li>
            <li> Love this. Super easy to apply. Feels great. Leaves my skin feeling and looking great. I also appreciate that it is cruelty free. Great buy!</li>
            <li> There are times, about once a week, when I feel like my skin and pores need a good thorough cleaning. I alternate between using an abrasive scrub to using this mask. It really does the job well!!! My skin feels more taut and firm and clean....just great!!!</li>
            <li> This mask dries up fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait that long to wash it off after waiting for a little.</li>
            <li> I like this mask a lot. I wanted something a little less drying than my purifying mint mask and since this has avocado in it I thought it would be a nice alternative. It&#x27;s very nice and applies easily and my skin feels softer after I use it without feeling like it&#x27;s stripped me of all moisture. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not the same effect as using a moisturizer or anything - you&#x27;re still going to lose some moisture - but it&#x27;s not nearly as drying as some masks I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Honestly i would give it 4.5 stars-- the is a great product and i plan to buy more of it and maybe try other Freeman products. The great thing to this is facial clay mask is that it leaves my skin SUPER SOFT after washing it off with warm water and it helps my acne ^-^ , but the downfall for me is that when it is applied onto my face, it is a bit irritating to my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel that great **it&#x27;s stingy** (probably because its drying though -_-) Amazing product though! Will get more :D</li>
            <li> Love Freeman Facial Products! They work and smell great!</li>
            <li> I WISH I could rant and rave about this mask, but I just can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s supposed to be purifying, however it&#x27;s anything but.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it leaves your skin feeling VERY soft and it smells wonderful! I have sensitive skin, and it was fine for me to use. I just wish it left my face feeling clean and purified.</li>
            <li> Local store stopped carrying it so I ordered the tube. Got tired of the packets anyway. I use this stuff almost every day. Feels great and the only thing that really gets my blackheads out. Dries up all my oil without drying my skin, cleans out the gunk, and leaves my face with a nice smooth feel and an even healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not written any reviews before this one, but with the rave reviews and not finding any that had my experiences on it, I figured that it would be worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never thought of myself as having sensitive skin before, but I noticed immediately while putting this on that there was a definite burning feeling. Despite this, though, I decided to soldier on for at least ten minutes. In time, the burning feeling receded and turned into an almost-pleasant(but not unpleasant) warm/tingly sensation. After fifteen minutes, I took it off with a warm+wet towel with little trouble. There were a few spots that I needed to go over again because of lingering green tinges, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t feel raw or irritated after the fact, and outside of a flush there is no undue redness. My skin does feel a bit firmer now, but it doesn&#x27;t feel especially cleansed or soft or anything. Despite that, it was fun to put on and wear, and the sensation progression(fun phrase) made the experience more satisfying than other masks I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll probably use this again, after I use the last of my other mask tube.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  The avocado/oatmeal combination is great, especially if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive/combination skin.  I like using the clay masks because they are much easier to remove than the ones that \\&quot;peel\\&quot;.  After I use the mask, my skin is amazingly soft and supple, like brand new.  It usually takes about 10-15 minutes for it to dry and then I can wipe it off clean with warm water and a wet cloth.  I like to do it before I go to bed because it does make your skin \\&quot;glow\\&quot; a bit afterwards and this way my skin has time to fully absorb the nutrients and relax.  I really like that \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;, so one bottle lasts quite a while. Also, if you feel you might have a pimple coming on, I dab a little on the area, let it dry and clean it off.  This helps to calm the affected area and sometimes avoid a pimple altogether.</li>
            <li> Very good cleaning the face, works best used after removing the blackheads with a metal tool first.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a Whim at the store one day. I usually hate masks because they leave my skin bright red and sensitive to the touch for hours after use. This one does not. It is sensitive enough to not cause my skin to flare up, but it refreshes my face and I don&#x27;t have as many break outs. When I do break out it gets rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. One of the few face products that actually work. Leaves the skin feeling great and evens out the tone, clears out irritation and prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> Supposing it&#x27;s the fumes, my eyes also get irritated, but it goes away. Really takes away the oil in your face &amp; cleans it up nicely. Not to mention so cheap and easy to find!</li>
            <li> I just tried this mask for the first time today. I usually use clay masks on a weekly basis. This product applies nicely and has a pleasant fragrance. I have sensitive/combo skin that worked great with it. My forehead, which is usually a disaster zone, feels absolutely amazing! The one issue I have is that a little section of my cheek was left feeling rather dry. This was easily remedied by using moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mask for two years now and it always delivers. It goes on smooth and it tingles as you put it on and gradually gets better, it&#x27;s easily washable.  The results are great, my face feels really clean! i haven&#x27;t been able to see how it acts on my pores since they&#x27;re small anyway. I noticed that it takes out gunk out of my pores too, overall it&#x27;s 5 stars from my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see my dark spots get lighter and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> The mask works really well on my skin. It left the soft, refreshed and relaxed feelings after each use. I have breakout problems, so after exfoliate my skin, I apply  the mask on, let it sets for 10-15 minutes then clean it off with a warm cloth (my professional skincare friend&#x27;s advise to preclean my mask) After that, I wash all the left over off with water.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling nice and refreshes and soft!</li>
            <li> Feels good to pamper yourself now and then.  My face feels so much softer after use.</li>
            <li> As promised.  Does what I wanted.  Would and will buy again if still available.  Very good product, which was hard to find!  Decent pricing as well!</li>
            <li> Works as well as any high-end clarifying mask I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing. I use it every week and its just wonderful. It doesnt sting like most masks but you can feel it working. Its creamy and it smells good..its made of natural ingredients that are good for your skin. I definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I can not believe the change in my skin after just 2 uses! My husband even tried and swears we both look younger.</li>
            <li> I have always had good skin but oil was my number one problem. I had oily skin and clogged pores on my nose and had tried everything to fix it. I was losing hope, but one day while shopping in the beauty sections at walmart, I saw a rack of facial masks for about a dollar and tried one. This clay avocado mask has been my favorite and works wonders! My skin feels so soft, refreshed after using it. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week and my oily face is not longer a problem! yay!</li>
            <li> A friend and I tried it. I have sensitive skin and it stung my skin so badly I had to take it off immediately. My friend said he tried it and it was ineffective and irritated his skin.</li>
            <li> is this some sort of miracle masque; no. This is a nice, affordable skin treatment for those on a budget. I use this a few times a week between my chemical peel and microdermabrasion. I don&#x27;t see anything drastic from this masque but it does leave my skin softer and more hydrated. It&#x27;s a decent masque for the price but don&#x27;t expect miracles from this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask.  I have extremely oily, rough and acne prone skin, as well as large pores.  After I&#x27;ve had this mask on, my pores are much much smaller, my blackheads are much much better and my skin is softer.  I also break out less.  Can&#x27;t beat this price, either!!</li>
            <li> This is a very mask, very gentle, doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry, works for me, and very good price too, it&#x27;s big tube.</li>
            <li> Makes skin softer but also look dry</li>
            <li> I really recommend this mask if you have oily skin or acne problems. It helps with my acne a lot and I&#x27;m very impressed with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super in love this facial months. did work very good to me. I love it,,,</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good. Has helped with my breakouts and my face looks more clear and looks purified.</li>
            <li> I typically use a spa line, but have dry skin so do not need mask as often. Bought this on a whim and just LOVE it. What a great product! Dries quickly, no tears from fumes, my skin is sensitive and no stinging. Excellent product, I highly recommend this mask. FYI,. would be great to put on bug bites! Stops the sting and itch.</li>
            <li> Great! I put it on before bed and Wake up with my acne reduced!</li>
            <li> Love this facial masque.  My skin feels so soft and dewy.  It is wonderful...such a treat after a long day.</li>
            <li> I wear this all the time. it really does help clear my skin!! i recommend it!</li>
            <li> Its refreshing and love the way my skin feels after using, but the only problem for me is that it dries too quickly.</li>
            <li> Difficult to remove from my face, very hard to wash off. Does remove a lot of redness and inflammation.</li>
            <li> Nice mask but i have found better. This one made my skin itch as soon as it started drying  but my face was very smooth when i was done with the mask. Wasnt a unpleasant smell either so thats a plus. Kind of a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand why this product and other freeman products have such good ratings? It made my skin dry and itchy. Also, whenever I was waiting for it to dry, my eyes couldn&#x27;t stop tearing...I must be allergic to some ingredients in freeman products, I tried anti-stress one, my skin and eyes had the same reaction! I basically can&#x27;t use it anymore, it was just so unbearable to use, very irritating to my skin and eyes (I know i need to avoid eye area, i know the instruction for using this kind of products, it still cause the tearing reaction)</li>
            <li> It was on time and undamaged.</li>
            <li> Good facial is always a good thing</li>
            <li> Great mask.  Removes excess oil without too much drying of the skin.  Great smell as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product, this is my first time using a mask and I have to say I wish I knew about this sooner.  I have been having problems with acne and dryness for the past 18 years. I brought expensive acne products that would help with one thing and create another.  I tried this product 3 months ago, using 3 times a week nightly before I go to bed leaving it on.  Next morning when I wash it off, my skin is so soft and refreshed looking.  I also have not used my acne products since I started using this and I can say I have not had one single breakout or dryness of my face.</li>
            <li> I love freeman&#x27;s products and use them every day.  The natural ingredients are perfect for my extra sensitive skin, and make my skin oh so soft.  I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin! BUY FREEMAN PRODUCTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite of all Freeman products btw!</li>
            <li> Smells so great and leaves your skin feeling soft. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Threw it away.. Dried my face horribly will never use this product again&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find mud masks anywhere anymore. Needed some stuff for a weekend campout with girls so I bought a bunch of different kind here. Not the best value but I needed clay masks.</li>
            <li> Honestly the first couple times I used it it made my face kind of burn. But I think it&#x27;s just because my skin is very sensitive.i have been using it up to 3 times a week for a month now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results! My pores have diminished in size and my skin has evened out in tone.love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my first mask I&#x27;ve tried. As I&#x27;m almost 45, I want to reduce the looks of 45 for as long as possible. Easy to put on, easy to wash off. It does make my face feel really clean. Oh yeah, it&#x27;s dirt cheap too!</li>
            <li> I received this item today, and I tried it out before my evening shower. And it is wonderful! I have sensitive skin, but this product did not irritate my skin in the least. The mask tightens up a lot as it dries, and I sped up the process a little by fanning myself. I let it completely dry before stepping in the shower and washing it all off with warm water. The result is silky skin, and the pores on my face have visibly shrunk. I&#x27;ve never really been a mask person, but I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
            <li> I love this so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is everything I was looking for: thick, not too pungent, great ingredients, and best of all, IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mask whenever I&#x27;ve had a long day and I know the oil/dirt buildup on my skin is a lot or if I fell asleep the night before and was too lazy and tired to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply apply it, let it dry, rinse, then continue to wash your face with you normal cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired this mask along with the Freeman Pineapple Enzyme mask (which smells amazing might I add!) and with my normal Neutrogena cleanser/toner and together they have brought my skin (which was blemished and damaged) back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly love this and recommend this to anyone whose skin easily gets oily just like mine.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask! I live in Boston where the weather kills my combo skin! This mask alleviated the rough patches and eliminated  the blackheads at the same time! I saw a huge improvement in my skin within a few weeks of use! I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped a few days after I ordered  it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it at all! It leaves my skin very soft and helps to tone down the redness. This mask does not magically dissolve blackheads, but my pores are less noticeable after I use it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Face feels fresh and renewed after every use.&lt;br /&gt;Balances oil/dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I use this almost every day :)</li>
            <li> I use this on my face everynight before bed and since then my face has cleared up considerably and its never felt silkier!  I would recommend this product to anyone who like me has had acne even in their late 20s, its gentle enough it does not dry out skin.  My skin type is moderately oily at its worst.</li>
            <li> This is an easy application mask, smells good, and leaves your skin feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Since I Have A Oily/Acne Prone Skin This Mask Has Helped With Containing The Oil Very Well ! After Rinsing Off The Mask My Skin Feels More Hydrated And Smooth. Which Is Great Cause A Lot Of Face Washes Tends To Leave My Face Extra Oily Or Super Dry. This Is A Great Mask It Applies On Nice And Is Super Creamy. The Only Thing That I Have A Problem With Is Tht It Can Sometimes Crack And Make Your Face Feel Stiff Or If Yu Move Yur Face Around It Makes It Feel Somewhat Itchy. Other Than That I Would Recommend This To Anyone :)</li>
            <li> Freeman Facial Masque, Purifying - 6 fl oz great price  good for all diffrent types of skin types.makes skin looking clearer and healthier,love the scent please come out with more  kinds ty shipping was fast....</li>
            <li> Great for softening skin</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, along with a Biore pore strip, and my face is so clear. If you have extra oily places on your face, use this product.</li>
            <li> This one is soooo GREAN ! And I love it...my daughter stole it from me after one use. My face feels so smooth...we love it!</li>
            <li> I am an avid Clinique and Aveda user...  with that said...  neither of these brands has a face mask that fits my needs...  THIS MASK IS WONDERFUL!!!  I use it at least once a week and it keeps my skin clear minus the occasional hormonal breakout...  the price is a bargain for the quality!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> First off, if you have an Ulta near by, you can find this product there for four dollars in the same size. I used to use the Biore oil control clay mask which is an excellent product but they&#x27;re no longer selling it anywhere. I was going to buy another expensive mask to replace the Biore but decided to try the Freeman brand since it was so inexpensive. It&#x27;s not as good as the higher priced masks of course but it works well enough for me to purchase again. It leaves my face feeling soft and tightens up my pores. The results don&#x27;t last very long for me; I have a very oily face due to hormone imbalances and it&#x27;s very hard to control this for more than one day. I use this mask every three days and use an oil-control cream cleanser the rest of the time. My favorite thing about the Freeman mask is that it doesn&#x27;t cost much. If it were more than ten dollars, I would never buy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know much about a bad or a good mask. I heard it was good and not to expensive, so that&#x27;s why I ordered it. It seems to do the job. Makes your skin smooth. Would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask 3-4 times now, so it&#x27;s a bit early to know if it&#x27;s having a real effect. I do like the feel of it though. You feel cleaner and fresher after using it. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter who&#x27;s in high school and has acne on her face and back. She has been using proactive for awhile and this product did more in the first use than over $200 worth of proactive products she&#x27;s tried! Within the first week her face and back cleared remarkably fast, and leaves her skin baby soft! She still has some acne but this is the clearest her acne has been in years! I will definitely be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> FYI, you can buy this at any dollar store for about $3. For a cheap face mask, it does work well. After using it for 10-20 minutes my skin is softer and pimples are virtually gone. Likes: 1. It smells good 2. It works well &amp; it&#x27;s cheap  Dislikes: If you have it on for too long it will dry out</li>
            <li> Hard to wash off but it smells so good and i feel clean and smooth after i use it. love it</li>
            <li> Love the product just y&#x27;all charged me for 2 and I only received 1. How do I get a refund?</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of facial masks. I shop at sephora all the time. And that&#x27;s usually where I get my masks. But I have to tell you, freeman avocado and oatmeal is just as good. It made my face feel great. I&#x27;ve noticed a visible difference in my skin vibrancy and acne. And the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I really like to use this on my face. I don&#x27;t actually notice much difference in my skin- a little less oily and more evenly moisterized. But it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;My reason for loving this is that I have severe allergic reaction to all bugs- saliva, bites, poison, everything. And I just recently discovered that I can cut my recovery time to 1/4 by applying this regularly to the infection site. It is such a relief to put it on because it is both cool and helps control the stinging pain. It starts to hurt as it gets crusty and then I know to wash it off. But 3 times of application and I jumped from extreme pain and swelling to barely feel it.</li>
            <li> I have acne and oily skin. I use Benzaclin to control it but every morning I still have a few pimples and oil on my face. Every time I use this clay mask I can instantly tell the difference as soon as I wake up. Not only is my face less oily if at all, it gives my face a glow and definitely decreases my acne. I love, love, love it. Makes my nose itch sometimes but worth it!</li>
            <li> I got a packet of this in a product sample box and thought I&#x27;d give it a go. I had a small whitehead forming that was painful and red. By the time the product had dried on my skin, it had drained, and the next morning it was healing. I&#x27;ve never had a blemish with such a short lifespan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product draws oil out of your pores like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried. My skin is left soft and supple. I usually throw on alpha hydroxy moisturizer right after, and haven&#x27;t noticed any adverse affects from that. The morning after I use this on any blemishes, they are greatly improved and healing at a much quicker pace than without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or redness when I used it, but my husband tried it on a spot and did have redness afterward. he said he did have a bit of tingling, which I&#x27;ve never had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best clay mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and the price is just an unexpected bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;ll throw it on my problem areas and jump in the tub and wipe it off when it dries. It does a good job of evening out my oiliness, and keeping any blemishes at bay.</li>
            <li> Great clay mask, real easy to remove, especially leaving it overnight once, plus it&#x27;s a great price too &amp; just want I needed for my beauty routine!!  I&#x27;ve used Freeman&#x27;s Pineapple Enzyme mask as well, these products are great, I&#x27;ve had no skin reaction to these products, did I mention they&#x27;re a great price too!!</li>
            <li> I picked up this masque on a whim.  I&#x27;d been fairly happy with my department store brand clay mask, but this one seemed like fun, and was super-inexpensive.  I applied the mask before a steamy bath.  The mask didn&#x27;t solidify or dry like normal due to the super-steamy bathroom, but was still effective.  It&#x27;s been effective drying completely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask needs water to rinse off, unlike some clay masks that feel like you could just flake them off.  My skin was noticeably clearer in appearance - pores were minimized and there appeared to be fewer blackheads for several days afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best budget beauty buy I&#x27;ve run across in a long time.  This drugstore steal outperforms my favorite department store mask for less than 1/6 of the price.  It may be that the discount price gives liberty to be generous with the product, or it may simply be more effective overall, but it&#x27;s in my beauty cabinet to stay.</li>
            <li> Great product. Face feels very refreshed afterwords and looks great!</li>
            <li> I bought this face mask based on all the positive reviews it got, but I was not completely happy with it. I have sensitive skin and this may have been a little harsh for it. I only left the mask on my face for about 10 minutes and then washed it off. Afterwards I felt a burning/rashy feeling around my nose. It also smelled kinda gross after it dried on my face. I may give it another shot though.</li>
            <li> i went to the drugstore looking for queen helene&#x27;s mint julep mask, but i couldn&#x27;t find it, so i picked this up instead. i really like this mask as well, it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it&#x27;s very easy to rinse off. i have sensitive skin and i haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or adverse reactions to it after using it. the only things i don&#x27;t like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them, and it&#x27;s a little itchy when it dries.</li>
            <li> It took care of my dry skin after just 1-2 uses.  However it has parabens!  I am so disappointed. Parabens are associated with cancer and hormone disruptions. Why do they need to put paraben? I am now going to look for this same product in europe without the parabens added.</li>
            <li> I give this a  high rating for fast delivering and packaging. And how great this product makes my skin feel and look.  And I bought 3 for myself and daughters. And will.purchased again from the seller. Great buy and very reasonable price. I will definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Love how it goes on smooth.  Tightens up my skin.  Don&#x27;t leave on too long though...my face was tomato red one time when I left it on for more than 30 minutes.  Took a while for the redness to die down.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite Freeman mask. Does not dry out my skin and keeps my face smooth and soft. Love the ingredients and very inexpensive. I usually use this when I get a lot of breakouts and I put this on my T-zone for consecutive days until my pimple is almost gone. Only takes a few days to flatten my pimples. Great product.</li>
            <li> A nice cleansing mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this maskm I have a really oily akin and I have a problem with acne. After I put it on, I feel like my skin is as clean as it can be and it definitely helps me out with acne. I&#x27;ve noticed fewer blemishes after one use, its magical! I&#x27;ll be definitely using it on my body as well and I can tell you right now that I&#x27;ll be ordering this again. Its wonderful!</li>
            <li> This mask made my face INSANELY soft. I have severish acne and i&#x27;m not sure if it stops acne, I&#x27;ve only used it twice and it hasn&#x27;t made and obvious changes yet but it might provent future acne. Over all, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this facial mask. I feel really clean after i use it and it is very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this face mask. I&#x27;ve only see it once but it left my face feeling refreshed. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> For the price, really great product. I feel like you could use it as much as you&#x27;d like and it&#x27;ll help.</li>
            <li> This clay mask doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. and also it has a funny smell. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> i love freemans facial masque! it makes my skin soft and feeling fresh taking away the oils that surface on my face. i am seriously willing to buy more of these products! i currently bought 2 and gave it to my friend as a gift, she used one of the products &amp; she likes it as well. defenitely coming back for more, just hopefully these products will still be able to ship to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> just soso,the merit is low price high-capacity</li>
            <li> This product works much better than putting just regular old avocado and oatmeal on your face and smearing it around.</li>
            <li> I always love  this stuff. It smells really good and works awesome! Once you put it on it&#x27;s soothing, it dries, and then you scrub it off. I would only do it once a week to start to make sure your skin can handle it.</li>
            <li> I love this mask and makes my skin feels smooth &amp; soft. But I buys this at Walmart, it&#x27;s cheaper there for $3.99.</li>
            <li> It irritated my eyes even though I didn&#x27;t apply around the eyes. I can&#x27;t stop my tears. I also feel a little itchy when it is on my face. But after I washed it out, I did feel my face become cleaner than before. But the cost is too much! My eyes can&#x27;t open when it is on my face.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and leaves face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin I would not suggest this product.  I have a wedding to attend tomorrow and my face is looking like it got smacked a million times. My face is red, there are small bumps all over my face, and the red areas are swollen.  I used this product three nights ago and the reaction has not gotten much better.  I have learned my lesson to not use cheap masks again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial mask! It is so soothing and calming. I especially love it after a work out. it cools my face down quickly. Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I love this mask!  It is part of my regular beauty routine.  When I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores I came to Amazon.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine life without it!</li>
            <li> What a Great Purchase. This is one of the Best Facial Masques that i have ever bought for multiple reasons. It does not take long to apply and or rinse off ,The end result is perfectly clean and healthy skin all day and night long. Is the only product that really helps to keep my skin calm and healthy and it dose not let it get flaky (i have rosacea). I recommend this product and seller 100% for its Amazing! Value and Product!</li>
            <li> This product does an excellent job of cleaning and conditioning your face! Fun to use too! Jesus christ has said: I am the light of the world.he who follows me will never walk in darkness.please follow jesus christ.your face will be beautiful and you will have eternal life.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- smells good&lt;br /&gt;- easy to apply and comes off easy with water&lt;br /&gt;- skin feels immediately softer, smoother, refreshed, clean, and non-oily&lt;br /&gt;- removes blackheads with ease, I noticed some blackheads on my nose gone after the FIRST time using it, more disappears over time when continuing usage of this product&lt;br /&gt;- shrinks pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- it very SLIGHTLY dries my skin. Not a big deal, I use Dove Men&#x27;s Sensitive Face Lotion after ANY facial cleaning product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Notes&lt;br /&gt;- if you live near a Walmart, buy from there. It&#x27;s so much cheaper than Amazon, I got it for 3.27 compared to 6.63 on Amazon. Same 6oz, same product&lt;br /&gt;- personally, I use twice a week per instructions. Using more often might cause irritation and actually worsen your skin&lt;br /&gt;- I let it sit on my skin for a solid 20 minutes to get rid of dirt and oil</li>
            <li> The best!  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for at least 20 years (packaging has changed over time).  Tightens up the skin without drying.  Great for sensitive skin.  I thinks it&#x27;s a great all-around mask.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for a couple of weeks and I love it.  My skin is so soft and nice aftet use.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks.  My skin does not feel noticeable better and this is a little irritating to the skin after washing it off.</li>
            <li> Oh my god you have to order this! it got my face cleared up in just a few hours! its WORTH BUYING!</li>
            <li> The mask didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin, and oh my god, the smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell. It&#x27;s an overwhelming perfume-y smell. It smells like fabric softener. It&#x27;s way too powerful for something you put on your face. My boyfriend could smell it across the room. If you have a sensitive nose or sensitive skin with fragrance this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this masque for several years, and when compared to more expensive competitors, this item works just as well, and for a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use clinique products on a daily basis, but I love doing this mask either weekly or every other week depending on how my skin is feeling.  It makes things feel nice and tight and supper soft!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s just not what I was hoping for. I have oily but not particularly acne prone skin, and I&#x27;m pretty lazy about caring for it (wash with an apricot scrub in the shower, use a toner in the mornings, and dab on lotion as needed).I was hoping that this would control the oil and leave me with soft, smooth skin. It definitely helps on the oil. After letting it dry on my face for about 10 minutes and rinsing off, my skin is completely oil free without being tight or irritated. However, it does nothing to the texture of my skin and doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all. It is a clay mask, and clays are known for being drying, so that&#x27;s not a complete surprise. It manages to leave my sensitive skin clean and happy - no redness or peeling at all, unlike many products for oily skin that leave you feeling itchy and tight. I would 100% recommend this for troublesome, oily skin, but do plan on moisturizing separately - it can&#x27;t do both.</li>
            <li> Bought this after much research, and the product did not disappoint. It leaves my skin feeling smoother, cleaner and breathable. Also, it has a nice scent to it. All in all, a winner for me</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how cheap it was , but when it comes to this product, you get what you pay for. It had a really bad smell, like vomit. And it left my skin red, dry, and irritated. Some spots on my skin started peeling so i had to follow up with some heavy, soothing face cream. I did break out a little as well. Will definitely not use again.</li>
            <li> This mask leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and clean. (I also like its fresh smell!) I use it once a week, so it&#x27;s lasted a good while. I only leave the mask on for about 10 minutes, or else it dries my skin. I follow up with moisturizer. My skin looks clean and healthy that night and the morning after! Definitely recommend, though do experiment with how often you use it and how long you leave it on, to find out what works best for your skin type.</li>
            <li> This mask does what it claims, deep cleans your skin. I have pretty bad blackheads on my nose and they are constant, no matter what I do they&#x27;re always there. This mask dramatically helped my blackheads, after using the mask they&#x27;re almost totally gone but not quite, granted NOTHING has ever completely cleared them out. They&#x27;re very stubborn. For the price and the results it&#x27;s a great buy &amp; I highly recommend for anyone that has blackheads, it will definitely help at least.  My skin is very sensitive, dry &amp; oily, acne prone (not a lot of zits, mainly blackheads and some whiteheads). It&#x27;s a gentle yet effective mask, non irritating. I apply a thick layer because I think leaving it on a bit longer helps even more and the thicker the layer, the longer the dry time. When the mask drys it can be uncomfortable and tight so if it starts drying at the edges just apply some warm water with a damp washcloth to rehydrate while the rest of it dries.  Quick tip, exfoliate before applying, it helps the mask get deeper into the pores.</li>
            <li> The Freeman Facial Masque is very easy to apply and remove. I like that I can feel the mask tightening as it dries. My skin feels soft and smooth after an application. Also, the prodcluct does not clog my pores and cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I used this before, and hope this is the same thing but they changed the outside look of the tube. I really enjoy this mask and think it works great...but my package was supposed to be here at the latest the 8th and I still have yet to receive it. After not even hearing anything from them I decided to contact seller and they were nice, telling me that it is almost here. Just frustrating I can get a foot spa bath, facail sauna system and many more larger items from other sellers on time, but not this little mask tube. But end of story is this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone! Just order way early from when you expect it to be there!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on anything, but I just had to for this! I got a trial size of the freeman avocado and oatmeal mask, just looking for something inexpensive to give me a little break during one of my late night study sessions. I can honestly say I wasn&#x27;t expected to be so excited after using this! I always think the more expensive something is, the better, but I got such great results from this mask! I have dry, sensitive skin, and was worried that this would really dry out my skin even more. But after washing this mask off, I first noticed that it left my skin extremely soft and smooth. And after applying moisturizer like normal, I could feel that my skin was also really hydrated! I love this mask, and have now purchased the full size! I will be using once a week, and think it has been a great addition to my beauty regimen. And I have learned a lesson- not everything wonderful has to be top-of-the-line!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very big fan of this product. I use it about twice a week at night and it definitely keeps my acne at bay. It doesn&#x27;t completely eradicate every spot, but it definitely clears up my face considerably overnight. For someone with consistent acne, this is quite the feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this mask does a great job of keeping my face less oily for several days at a time. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how it does this, but it works! My skin also feels delightfully soft after using and it smells pretty good to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, the product is a great value. For four dollars you get six weeks to two months of clear(er) skin! It really can&#x27;t be beat in my boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While acne products tend to vary immensely in their effectiveness on a person to person basis, the Freeman Avocado and Oatmeal Mask is a great option for anyone suffering from acne to try.</li>
            <li> 2nd time purchasing this. First tube I like it, help calm my acne-prone skin. But this time when I used it, I didn&#x27;t put any around eye area but my eyes was stinging and after I rinse the mask off my skin kinda had an allergic reaction to the mask. My skin was pink/red in some areas. I don&#x27;t know if the company change the ingredients or what because the first tube I didn&#x27;t have no issue.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time,  I started up on some health kick with avocados and began eating them daily.  Sadly this got expensive after a couple of weeks and I decided to stop (yes,  short lived,  I know).  Fortunately the avocados delivered and I can absolutely say that after a single week,  my skin had never in my ENTIRE life been so clear and even-toned.  Not exaggerating. As I said though,  an avocado a day got expensive and I needed an alternative. I also opted to cut back on exfoliating and let my skin do its own thing with just a little oomph-- so I got the Freeman avocado and oatmeal facial clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets good. This mask is gentle and has left me with dewy, hydrated and blackhead free skin every single time. For a while, I was using it once to twice a week and yes,  the results were nice...  But I wanted even better.  I eventually bought glamglow&#x27;s exfoliating mask because of all its great reviews-- celebrity approved, &amp;#34;60 bucks a pop, it&#x27;s gotta be amazing&amp;#34; and for half price, why not? Two words: Not impressed. And it effin burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, I now look forward to trying the other products in the Freeman line because this one has worked so well and now is cleaning up the mess left by said high end product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it is easy to apply,  ansaid does what it says it does.  Highly recommended especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Makes skin really soft &amp; it smells super good. After two uses i seen and felt a differnce</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It really works well.</li>
            <li> The colorful containers lured me to buy one while I was at the store today. Got this one because the name sounded refreshing. I&#x27;m wearing it right now and I love how it&#x27;s creamier and goes on easier than my thick, chunky, queen helene masque. Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so much more expensive on amazon since all these 6oz masques were 3.99 at my nearby makeup store.</li>
            <li> This mask is absolutely wonderful. The scent is sweet and fresh. I love that the mask is very thick and glides on smoothly. I had high hopes and Im really pleased that I was not disappointed. I have a couple of the Freeman products and each one has been great (Pineapple Enzyme, Cucumber peel) You cant beat it for the price at the drug store.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended this, and it really works good. It does not leave your face dry, but rather smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I like this mask because it&#x27;s one of the only ones that you don&#x27;t have to wash your face first. It&#x27;s also very gentle and easy to get off so on stressful days when I just want to relax and not do a lot of face maintenance this is my go to mask. It&#x27;s really creamy and spreads very easily. I never have to fight with the bottle either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great use it every week at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin a little, tiny teeny bit dry but it definitely smooths my skin &amp; makes it baby soft. It has a slight, pleasant smell. I&#x27;ve used it twice lolol but I can already see my brown spots fading a little.[:</li>
            <li> I like this mask a lot because it smells yummy! And it works well to clean the pores. I would for sure get this again.</li>
            <li> I THINK this product has been helping to even my skin tone and reduce acne breakouts.  I can&#x27;t say for absolute certainty because I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with Proactiv.  This mask smells nothing like avocado, instead it has more of a cotton candy scent, which is a little strange.  It is also a vibrant powder blue color, which makes my face look like a big, blue Smarties Candy.  The reason I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 however, is due to the fact that the mask produces very strong fumes which makes my eyes sting and tear up profusely.  I cry every time I put this stuff on and I don&#x27;t put it directly around my eyes either.  The stinging does subside once the mask starts to harden though. Overall it works well and I will buy it again, but I would keep the fumes in mind if you have eyes that are sensitive to that sort of thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  One tube lasted me a long time.  I makes your skin look clear and poreless.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel great, the best masque treatment I have found on the consumer market. You could spend much more, and not get a product this good.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t expecting anything but noticed people say &amp;#34;hey you look good&amp;#34; after I&#x27;ve used this-  hmmm- neat!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes your face feel clean and refreshed also has a nice smell and goes on easily a little goes a long way so it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> This masque works very well at making your face look healthy and evening your skin tone. It has a high amount of Titanium Dioxide, which is the main ingredient in many foundations and powders. I use it once a week, and it is great! I would recommend it!!! It is also so cheap!:)</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for a few years now and find it more and more difficult to find in stores. It really is a great face mask. I use it once a week and notice that it does help a lot in absorbing the oil in my skin. I find that when I don&#x27;t use it regularly my skin is much more oily and therefore more break-outs occur. This really is a very effective product. Goes on well and comes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> Left with clogged pores, peely skin, and an unclean feeling. Could just be me, gave to friend, hopefully it&#x27;ll work out better for her.</li>
            <li> Great mask for clogged pores and price very reasonable. Recommend ! Okay for sensitive skin. There is no burning and works quickly.</li>
            <li> It did the job, and I like it better than anything I have ever tried before. It makes me  love my skin! And I generally don&#x27;t because I have had acne my whole life even after seeing a Derm. for 8 yrs!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, as well a huge pores.  So, I was really happy when this mask not only made my face look more refreshed and healthy, but didn&#x27;t even irritate it a little bit!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so maybe it&#x27;s just me but I usually love this stuff but it gives me cystic acne which I NEVER GET. And it leaves scars from them</li>
            <li> What can I say this is my favorite facial treatment. I leave it on my face until it dry up and my face is rejuvenated and feels soft, clean, and fresh!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. I have used several of the other Freeman masks and have had great results (cucumber, Dead Sea, etc...) however this one left face extremely red and dry. I would never use it again. If you are using it i would suggest trying on a small section of your neck first to see if you breakout in a rash.</li>
            <li> This mask is wonderful. There is not much of a smell so if you have issues with strong smells this is perfect. When I put it on it was cool and refreshing and it took about 5-10 minutes to dry on my face. When I rinsed my face it felt smooth and clean. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased 2 of the Freeman masks--the one for stress-relief and the one for purifying. I would highly recommend both to you.  I&#x27;ve tried many facial care products--too numerous to mention--for much more money and have not had the same satisfaction.  I even purchased some deep sea mask products while on vacation in the Caribbean.  The \\&quot;mud\\&quot; sucked out any necessary oil I had left in my skin. The price and value on this product is excellent.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s butt. I love it. It smells great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is a decent mask on its own but my favorite way to use it is half of this mask with half mint julpe mask from queen Helen. Together they really make perfect mask that doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin or burn it but still have all the benefits of both.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face smooth and soft. Only down fall is that it burns you&#x27;re eyes when appling near the eye area.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this from my pharmacy, and it was quite funny that I just now got done washing it off my face before finding it here. This is great for oily skin, it takes away all my shine and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t like avocado but I don&#x27;t mind the smell much. I would recommend this product, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Okay so I never bother to write reviews on anything, but I feel like this deserved it. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face masks out there, and this is by far the best one. It rinses off very cleanly and easily, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and after my first use, my skin felt more incredible and clean than it had in MONTHS. There was no redness, if anything my complexion was more even than beforehand. My skin was quite literally glowing. Along with how great it made my skin feel, it also smelled nice and wasn&#x27;t a bother to leave on. I do recommend a moisturizer afterwards and only applying it once or twice a week, but it is definitely worth buying! Ta-ta, off to buy more freeman masks. (:</li>
            <li> I really like this mask because &lt;br /&gt;1. its really cheap &lt;br /&gt;2. it gets the skin really clean &lt;br /&gt;3. it doesn&#x27;t dryout the skin &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My husband has really oily skin and i have fairly dry skin but it still works great for both of us.  He uses it almost everynight, but I only use it once a week or whenever I feel like my pores are starting to get buildup. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my back (followed by a sand scrub) for the beach season or before wearing a low-back dress because it really makes the skin look clean/bright with a healthy glow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I was pretty sceptical of trying this mask out, but I was also desperate for a mask that could help get rid of my acne. This is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used!! Once I had finished with it, my skin felt more smooth, and silky soft. My acne flare ups were reduced drastically as well! I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I love the way this Freeman Clay mask leaves my combination skin. Feels soft. Looks smoother. Looks healthier.  My forehead, and nose are my most oily areas. So they are the last to be rinsed. This way my drier areas do not get over dried. Goodness this stuff really is great ! I just need to use it more on a routine. I have noticed that Walmart, and CVS stopped carrying the 6oz tube. They now have the small, one time use containers. You might want to stock up on this product. I just wonder how long I can store a unopened container, and where is best place to store it ?</li>
            <li> Great and cheap product! I suggest you get it at your local drug store, or grocery store though. It&#x27;s cheaper there.</li>
            <li> Works! Really cleans out pours. Used twice and noticed right away that it got rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li> Makes my oily and dry skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> It tends to dry out my skin. But because the bottle is so large it&#x27;s worth the price you pay, just do not leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why Freeman feels the need to put fragrance in these. It&#x27;s Avocado and Oatmeal, not Avocado and Migraine Inducing Stench. Glad I only bought a sample packet, it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This smells really good and makes my face feel so good after.</li>
            <li> Just got this in mail today. Used immediately. I was so pleasantly pleased ! My face feels so soft &amp; my pores are smaller. My face looks refreshed..All this after only one use so far. I even put it on my neck. I can&#x27;t believe it made a difference in just my first use !! Can&#x27;t wait to use again a few days. I would recommend this product. Price is great too !!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I put it on and within two minutes began smelling vomit. I thought my dog had thrown up somewhere so I walked all over the house with the mask on looking for vomit. When the timer went off I figured I&#x27;d look more when I get out of the shower and never found anything nor did I smell the vomit after I showered. Never associated the smell with the mask. The second time I used this I immediately noticed a vomit smell and put 1 and 2 together. By now I&#x27;ve used it four times and every time it smells like vomit, not kind of like vomit, just like vomit! The product works well enough, but considering it has fragrance as an ingredient I just don&#x27;t get why it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> This mask took away my redness and my skin is sooo free and airy! Its so refreshing. BUT I bought this product from an Ulta nearby but could&#x27;ve bought it from Walmart etc. for WAY LESS. I got it for $3.99.</li>
            <li> So far I love this! Really leaves my face feeling, soft, and a clean feeling. Comes off very easily, I leave on for 5-10min.</li>
            <li> It is a good mask. Makes my skin softer and cleaner. Helps to make my pores around nose area smaller.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference, maybe it&#x27;s the type of skin I have I don&#x27;t know, but I know I&#x27;m not going to ever purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Even though I am pushing 50, and my skin is pretty dry, I still keep this clay masque on hand. Why? Because I have large pores that are getting (ack!) even bigger as I age. With one use, I can see my pores visibly reduced. With two I&#x27;m almost back to \\&quot;Pores? What pores?\\&quot; This stuff is super cheap, you get a lot for your money and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General 411: I usually put this all over my face (except eyes and mouth, of course),leave it on 20-ish minutes to let it dry. Rinse with a wash cloth then follow with a good moisturizer on my drier bits. The next day I exfoliate really well to get rid of any dry skin flakes. After this 1-2 procedure, I look like I&#x27;ve had a professional facial!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; large pores, but this masque certainly helps keep them in check.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and feels silky, it isnt thick and heavy like other mask. I could pick up no scent so its a neutral there. It dries quickly, within 15 mins,removes easily  and actually made my face smoother. I am 42 with combo skin so it works for me, going to be part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> My skin looks refreshed after using it. What a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I like the angel of the product and it makes my face feel wonderful, it was delivered on time and i definitely would recommend this to someone else.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  I never used a face mask before,  until now. It work great on my skin and after a couple weeks of using it, I noticed a differences. And it smells great also.</li>
            <li> Love this! Does not burn, very gentle!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement while using this product. Will try to find something else that will help tighten up facial skin.</li>
            <li> product works great, dries in short time and just splash off with water. I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> Really dries my skin and causes breakout. I have had this for 3 months now and have only used it 3 times but still my skin is to sensitive for it. Waste of money since product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> the price is right, not bad after it&#x27;s washed off either, little or no moisturizer needed. would recommend</li>
            <li> Love this stuff leaves my face feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> It works nice. It hasn&#x27;t really helped clear up my acne, but my skin is smoother and clean after using this facial masque. I also like the Dead Sea Minerals masque from Freeman as well.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to come right out and say it, I didn&#x27;t want to use this mask because I&#x27;m a die hard fan of Queen Helena Mint Julep Mask. There, now the cat is out of the bag. I decided to give Freeman a chance because my best friend is always using this mask and swears by it. I&#x27;m so happy I finally gave it a chance, I could seriously see the dirt and oil coming out of my pores when the mask was drying. It was really easy to apply and was super smooth on my skin. I let it dry for about 10-20 minutes just to make sure it picked up as much as it possibly could and used a wash cloth to take it off. The after effects were great! My skin felt smooth, refreshed, and tight. I did feel a little dry, but some face moisturizer put that to rest almost immediately. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll leave Mint julep because I love that mask but I would definitely recommend this mask:]!!</li>
            <li> My favorite of all of the Freeman masks. My go-to for many years now.</li>
            <li> I saw a friend of mine using it recently and decided to check out the reviews online. On my skin it looks like toothpaste but afterwards my face felt great. It didn&#x27;t have that dry feeling afterwards like other skin care products.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list for this product is only partial and jumbled.  It does contain both aluminum as well as more than one paraben compound (linked to hormone receptor interference).  In fact, there&#x27;s more aluminum than oatmeal or avacado!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product ingredients as listed on the container are:&lt;br /&gt;Water, kaolin, bentonite, titanium dioxide, propylene glycol, magnesium aluminum silicate, colloidal oatmeal, tocopherol, avocado oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, montmorillonite, disodium EDTA, sodium polyacrylate, diazolidinyl urea, methylparaben, propylparaben, methylchloroisothiazolinone, methylisothiazolinone, fragrance, Yellow #5.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very well priced. I have been using this mask for the past few days and it really has cleaned out my bores. I am mainly using this to help with the exfoliation process to get rid of dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mask contains Vitamin E which is essential for great skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I use it about every other day or less!!</li>
            <li> broke me out, didn&#x27;t clean anything this sucks</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It made my skin feel very refreshed. Even after I rinsed it off I felt as though it was still working by cleaning out my pores. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne, blackheads, and scars since age 11. I have tried lots of products and seen dermatologists with little help. Now, about to turn 30 and still dealing with these issues, I tried this product after all of the reviews. I cannot tell you how amazing this is. It&#x27;s so affordable, too. Admittedly, I use it 1 to 2 times a day for my best results. My pores are much clearer and squeezing the blackheads on the nose, which my esthetician used to do, (the only place I would squeeze d/t scarring), has become much easier and I have to do it less frequently with regular use. For the price, I would recommend everyone try it until the product is gone and see how it goes for you!</li>
            <li> Love this mask! It really tightens your skin and great for those with acne prone skin. My skin feels tight and smooth after using.</li>
            <li> I usually use this during the weekends when I want to relax from a long week of work. I love the cooling sensation of this product on my face. Felt so refreshing. After the application according to the directions, my face felt so relax, smooth and a little bit tighter.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4 because I&#x27;m not a fan of a powdery smell, given the fact that it will be powdery when it dries. Overall, I recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this from Walgreens it was around $2.99&lt;br /&gt;I usually use another brand that I have also purchased from Walgreens however they were out of it at the time and I really needed something due to some serious skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me start with I am allergic to literally everything (confirmed by an allergy doctor) so I have to be really careful when trying new skin products or I will look like I am 15 all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin in certain areas and dry skin in others, so for me this works perfectly. The smell is not as bad as other clay masks I have tried in the past. The only dislike for me personally is how hard it feels on my face when it&#x27;s drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the plus side is I have seen no side affects from this mask; it makes my skin feel super soft and does not break me out which is a great plus. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product it dried out my skin and left it red and irritated! I would never recommend this to anyone! Don&#x27;t buy it! Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is okay. I like the actual mask but the smell is sooo so overwhelming. It smells like liquid antibiotics.</li>
            <li> Love this clay mask and everything came in a pretty reasonable time frame!</li>
            <li> I saw this clay mask at CVS and it had a rebate thing stating \\&quot;Try For Free\\&quot;.  I gave it a try because I love free products.  This thing is actually good.  I have watched Youtube and saw reviews here that say this thing is wonderful.  I might have to agree with everyone.  It applies like a regular mask and after a few minutes, it dries up and you wash it off and voila, you&#x27;ll feel great afterwards.  I took off one star because this mask does have a strong smell that even for a non-sensitive person like me, I would like for the manufacturer to chill with the scent.  It&#x27;s a strong smell of baby powder with a tinge of hair perm??  Some of you guys might disagree but personally, that&#x27;s what comes to mind when I apply it  on my face.  Overall it&#x27;s not bad of a product because I do feel my face being cleaner after use.</li>
            <li> This is just ok. For one, I found this in a store for almost half the price as what I paid on Amazon, so really I would not purchase it on here again. It is somewhat refreshing but I do not think it does anything worthy of noting to my skin. My skin appears soft after but other than that,  it&#x27;s not really an amazing product.</li>
            <li> My new everytime mask, great great!</li>
            <li> I only use it about 1x a week or more if my face breaks out. Works pretty well, so far. My skin is fairly sensitive, but aside from some redness the product does leave my skin feeling smooth. I do use additional facial cleansers besides this one though. Directions are simple: wet face, squeeze a dime shape drop onto your finger, apply to face, look at yourself turn green, and watch it harden. As I said, simple. And it didn&#x27;t smell too bad for me. Smells like warm fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con - I knocked off a star because this stuff is extremely difficult to take off your face. Usually a washcloth, warm/tepid water, and a strong hand to scrub is needed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face mask, its the best one i have used.&lt;br /&gt;It evens out my skin, soothes it and makes my skin feel clean and feel really nice. I use this product once and a while and do spot treatment on places where i am prone to get breakouts (i touch my face a lot on my chin and i use this to wash this area to prevent breakouts)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for years now, and I still haven&#x27;t run out. I dont use it too often but when i do its really nice and refreshing for my skin. its lasted so long that my bottle isn&#x27;t updated to this photo, but its the same ingredients. I will be re purchasing this product as im almost finally running out. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I justed used this product a few days ago to detoxify my face after wearing heavy makeup for 4-5 days straight.  I followed up by toning and moisturizing and my skin felt revived and so clean!</li>
            <li> I have never really used any masks in the past so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. It is a little hard to get out of the tube. It leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, I&#x27;m at the end of my first bottle and just ordered another. I have very oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t not dry it out or create excess oil. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I would definitely recommend this product as it is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Great product and love the way my skin looks with use. Searched a long time to find this product again and am completely happy! Clays and muds work wonder on the skin</li>
            <li> Great scent, easy application, relatively inexpensive. And it seems to work really well smoothing out my skin - without over-drying it - when used regularly.  If you&#x27;re looking for a facial masque, try this one!</li>
            <li> I love clay masks and stuff and usually use the cvs mint clay mask but was at bed bath and have used freeman products before so I picked this one up. (I think the worse one was one in a yellow tube) anyway I smelled this one in the tube and it smelled fine. but when I put this on my face it literally smelled like puke and fragrance. so strange! it also kinda dried my face out but not in a good way. will be returning and buying the cvs brand</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Refreshing and feels great on my face, even my boyfriend likes using it haha</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have tried a number of different masks through out the years and they almost always either make my face itchy, or cause me to break out after using them (in those horrible, big and painful zits!)...this one doesn&#x27;t! It seems like it both dries out the extra oil in my skin, and moisturizes at the same time. After washing it off my skin is always a lot softer. If my skin is a little dried out I tend to get those little bumps on the outer edges of my cheeks, but they always clear up when I use this. It has a good consistency and is easy to apply, though if you wash it off with a wash cloth it looks sort of nasty, but no big deal. It does have a little bit of a scent to it, but it&#x27;s not a fake perfumey type of scent, it&#x27;s a more natural one. And one of my favorite things about this mask, it&#x27;s cheap! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase. I did not have bad skin to begin with, I just get the occasional bad breakout on my chin or nose and have some lightly visible dark pores in those areas. After having just used this product twice (once on a Sunday and then later on Wednesday) I could already tell a difference. My pores are smaller/invisible and my skin is very soft. As an added bonus, I keep getting compliments from my boyfriend on how great my skin smells after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not purchase this item from Amazon, it was half the price at Schnucks (I was shocked too) and I didn&#x27;t have to do that annoying $25 thing that Amazon is now pushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back so far is that my skin seems slightly drier but it is winter and that&#x27;s normal for me so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see what happens in a few months but this is definitely something I will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> I love this masque. I even got my mom into it. I&#x27;ve been obsessed watching natural masque for my face. I follow bubz beauty on YouTube and she had some great videos on an avocado masque, oatmeal masque and a rice flour masque. They were nice, but I don&#x27;t have time to always mix the ingredients and one day, I randomly went on amazon and typed avocado masque. This one seemed the best especially  since it included oatmeal. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I love how it feels like it&#x27;s tightening my face and pores and how fresh my face looks. For some strange reason my face picks up a lot of dirt so I have to wash my face very well, twice a day. I usually try and use this mask in the morning before work and I use another masque at night. (That&#x27;s how dirty my face gets). I also have combination skin, and this works VERY well with it. Do not use this masque or any other masque too much because it will dry your face. I went over-bored one week and my face became very dry. So, two to three times a week is good. Some of you may just need it once a week.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a week, and the results are spectacular! The mask makes my skin feel clean and clear, without drying out my face like some other masks I&#x27;ve previously owned. My acne has also improved dramatically since I purchased this product. This mask does everything it says it will do and more! Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that helps with my nose white heads . Apply it rigt after washing face and leave it on for 10 minutes . The cooling sensation is amazing ! So relaxing .</li>
            <li> The mask is drying but effective.  My face looked smoother and brighter.  No blackheads were on my nose and my pores had seem to shrink.  It is worth having and at a price that is affordable to the every day person.  It works great on men faces too.</li>
