            <li>I have shared it with a number of my friends and they also find the smell pleasant.  </li>
            <li>These leave a lingering smell that it not too pleasant.</li>
            <li>That said, now when I walk by the bag, it is a sort of quality, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>scent, to me, isn&#x27;t very pleasant at all... more of a \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; stench smell for my taste.</li>
            <li>Good service and price for a quality product.</li>
            <li>Arroved on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>this incense smells so good it smells like leather like the smell</li>
            <li>I was worried about them not being as good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the scent of nag champa but could never burn it because it would give me a migraine.  </li>
            <li>I like this, good for taking away</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>Good quality product!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>The lingering scent, the perfumed sweetness being dominant when not burning, is as good as others assert.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly potent and beautiful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The authentic Nag Champra incense is a great gift for anyone to give or receive.</li>
            <li>When fresh, this is a wonderful smelling incense - one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; box, however, is just phenomenal!  </li>
            <li>I love this smell!</li>
            <li>It is the perfect balance between sweet perfume and earthy smells as you can get, I love it!:)</li>
            <li>it has too strong a scent for me, but burned it smells great.</li>
            <li>To be honest, this incense is amazing.</li>
            <li>These smell amazing.</li>
            <li>The incense is well made and nicely packaged</li>
            <li>not my favorite smell, but good quality.</li>
            <li>This brand, however, smells like what I remember loving about nag champa.</li>
            <li>Smells good more mellow than agrabati</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s musk, like another reviewer insinuated, but to be honest</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s musk, like another reviewer insinuated, but to be honest</li>
            <li>The sticks arrived &amp;#34;slightly damp&amp;#34;, and even sitting in my drawer, that area of the room smells nice.</li>
            <li>Really liked the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is still a nice scent</li>
            <li>they both have VERY uniform sizes, plus they both smelled great!</li>
            <li>I burned another stick towards the end of the night and while this is a very strong incense it also has that greasy undercurrent to it.</li>
            <li>Very strong, however.</li>
            <li>And it still is very strong when not burning.</li>
            <li>I think this has got to be the best Nag Champa incense sticks I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and makes the house smell so good and fresh.</li>
            <li>They burn nicely and consistently and the smell is nice and sweet and great.  </li>
            <li>This is easily my favorite incense.</li>
            <li>Nag Champa is my favorite incense, and this one is one of the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I came across this incense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything about the Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s blue-box Nag Champa I love, yet accentuated to the max without overpowering my nostrils/lungs.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on review recommendations and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I prefer more spice than floral scents.</li>
            <li>Or better yet i&#x27;ll stick with my oil diffuser and burn sun&#x27;s eye nag champa oil.</li>
            <li>Even though some of the sticks weren&#x27;t fully coated, I removed the part that wasn&#x27;t coated well, lit the remaining piece, and got about fifteen minutes or more of scent.</li>
            <li>Champ brand incense really are great for those looking</li>
            <li>It is ok..</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this incense.</li>
            <li>Also one reviewer noted it smelled better after sitting for a week allowing to dry/cure.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>The Shanthimalai is one of the top scents of the  Nag Champa family For</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;I find it burns slower and puts out a lot more smoke, so the scent lingers</li>
            <li>One of my favorite nag champa incense varieties.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Will take you to India for sure.  </li>
            <li>The Red Nag Champa is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>These incense sticks are a great deal stronger than the blue nag champa but equally as good.</li>
            <li>I love this incense.</li>
            <li>I sure hope this is not the experience I have been looking forward to.</li>
            <li>I love musk and have never had that reaction.</li>
            <li>and my roommate would love to have it.</li>
            <li>I love musk and have never had that reaction.</li>
            <li>and my roommate would love to have it.</li>
            <li>Everytime I would go into my favorite stores to purchase these incense, they would always be out.  </li>
            <li>but i can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t think of people that need it more.</li>
            <li>I am a lover of incense and quite often purchase different varieties in my quest to find the perfect assortment.</li>
            <li>and man did I love it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something more earthy about it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i love the scent and</li>
            <li>made, an important topic for this kind of products</li>
            <li>These have a more pungent smell and seem to linger longer.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like burnt wood like most others.</li>
            <li>I burn a lot of incense of all types and love nag champa.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad to have stumbled upon this brand and would recommend it to anyone who loves Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s \\&quot;blue-box\\&quot; Nag Champa as a worthy replacement, or as a tag-along for</li>
            <li>First I must say that the aroma is sweetly pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely perfect - not too strong, very relaxing and fills a large room nicely.</li>
            <li>The aroma is pleasant, but nowhere near as good as the original.  </li>
            <li>It also smells very clean while burning.</li>
            <li>and it burns very clean.</li>
            <li>&quot; left in the room is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t make it look good, you can make it smell pretty.  </li>
            <li>They are all good, but the scent of this Red Nag Champa has a depth and appeal I found unique and always welcome.</li>
            <li>incense is very sweet, aromatic incense.</li>
            <li>Shipping was reasonable and the price was fair with the seller.</li>
            <li>but this really IS the Nag Champa I have always loved.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I chose this over the original Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>We love the scent of the original, so we tried this one out...  </li>
            <li>Burning, it smells nothing like it does in the package, it&#x27;s a very rich, deep, woody yet sweet smell that lingers in the most beautiful way.</li>
            <li>Originally chose it to help rid the house of pet odors, assuming it would be better than canned stuff.  </li>
            <li>However I can only compare to morning star sandalwood, so I will leave the formal review to those more experienced.</li>
            <li>If you like strong incense</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you like Nag Champa and are looking for a good scent.</li>
            <li>Very earthy and the scent is very appealing.</li>
            <li>This one veers away from sweet and is more of a foresty type.</li>
            <li>It departs with more sweet spice, adding allspice, clove, and an overpowering sage.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best nag champagne your money can buy.</li>
            <li>But the Halmaddi is very strong in this incense and the price is higher because of it because Halmaddi is becoming rarer in India.</li>
            <li>It smells fine, it just won&#x27;t say lit.</li>
            <li>Now the blue Nag Champa smells more like baby powder to me, which is still pleasant</li>
            <li>This has a much more pleasant odor than the blue Nag Champa that everyone has.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy Nag Champa, this incense deserves a spot in your rotation.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth every cent plus the women who make these get a part of profit. :)</li>
            <li>As of today I would move this up to 2/5 rating, still preferring the smooth and pleasing fragrance of Satya Sai Baba over this but who knows, as these incense sticks age a bit</li>
            <li>They did not stay lite and some didn&#x27;t light at all.</li>
            <li>This one is every bit as good as it&#x27;s blue box cousin, perhaps even better.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the product is good, just not my personal favorite.</li>
            <li>now- if you love the blue, the closest I&#x27;ve found is Blue Pearl Classic Champa which is beautiful, and OM Nagchampa is another great bet.</li>
            <li>The sticks are beautiful, thick and nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite!</li>
            <li>The smell is rich.  </li>
            <li>Just a great fragrance,and burns a long time.  </li>
            <li>The red box variant is so much more potent and I love it for that.</li>
            <li>I love the smell but this is really smokey!  </li>
            <li>Go with the original.</li>
            <li>I love the sweetness and the whole atmosphere it creates!  </li>
            <li>It has a rich aroma.</li>
            <li>The scent instantly puts me in a peaceful state of mind and makes my house (with two cats and a dog) smell great without strong perfumed candles and air-fresheners.  </li>
            <li>but over 30 years ago I used to frequent the Hari Krsna temple in Manhattan for a nice free veggie Indian meal and would smell THIS.</li>
            <li>It is actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Extraordinary scent of real Nag Champa!!!</li>
            <li>Not the same as the Original Nag Champa, but has a good burn rate.  </li>
            <li>I will most certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>Also, this scent is great alone but also blends well with Sai Baba Blue and Super Hit (another new favorite).</li>
            <li>, this is one of those incenses that that burns true to the scent.  </li>
            <li>I have a burner that holds the incense straight up and sits on top of a bowl of sand.</li>
            <li>If you are a true incense lover please try these.     </li>
            <li>Good incense is less smoke and more aroma.  </li>
            <li>Not being an incense afficionado, I cannot offer much other than it works great.  </li>
            <li>If you like Super Hit you will like this.</li>
            <li>I love the blue box nag champa, but this is my favorite of all.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you like the way blue smells and don&#x27;t need it to be any stronger, this may be slightly overwhelming but my boyfriend and I love this stuff and we will be buying it from now on.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to order \\&quot;Goloka\\&quot;, as well as \\&quot;Super Hit\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Midnight\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I would have been much more happy with the typical blue box, as I already love that fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a lot of depth... and easily permeates a large space.  </li>
            <li>B0012UKCVY Super Hit]] or my new favorite, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>A new favorite.</li>
            <li>In retrospect, it may be the musk tones that the less than happy reviews were referring to as \\&quot;rancid\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Now, to be fair my roommate did make some rather strong smelling lunch and that smell was pretty much thick in the house for many hours</li>
            <li>Burned traditional Nag Champa since the 1970&#x27;s, my favorite!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>it instantly became my favorite!</li>
            <li>Spend the extra, if you love STRONG NAG CHAMPA</li>
            <li>I have tried another brand of Nag Champa but my research has led me to understand that it is a plant resin called Halamddi which is the ingredient that give Nag its unusual and beautiful aroma-- along with Sandalwood, Plumeria and other resins.</li>
            <li>Simply put, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Shanthimalai Red smells amazing in the box, yet maintains it&#x27;s character and complexity even when burning.    </li>
            <li>This version of Nag Champa is nothing short of Amazing.</li>
            <li>and I knew it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is so much better, I&#x27;ll probably buy the blue box again only if I let myself run out of this \\&quot;good stuff.\\</li>
            <li>These are my favorite Nag Champa by far.</li>
            <li>This stuff does smell different, but still has those nice earthy tones to it and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my personal favorite nag champa (I prefer Satya Sai Baba brand), but this one has a more intense aroma.</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and crisp.</li>
            <li>This will definitely always be on hand now though, and a part of the proceeds go to a charitable organization described on the box (helps women in India)&lt;br /&gt;Try, it won&#x27;t disappoint</li>
            <li>Red Nag Champa has a fragrance which brings to mind a perfume popular 50 years ago called &amp;#34;Heaven Scent&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It is along the same lines, but, to me, seems to have an even more pleasantly rich scent.</li>
            <li>Now I do because I love walking into my house after a long day, and the lingering scent of Shanthimalai adds to the good feeling of being back in my sanctuary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I have to be in the right mood for the earthiness of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Nag Champa fan and have pretty much always stayed with Sai Baba brand Nag Champa (</li>
            <li>Better than Blue or SUper Hit.  </li>
            <li>Very pungent and sweet.  </li>
            <li>and I received it super fast.</li>
            <li>Its burned slowly each time and filled the whole house with a warm sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I like regular nag champa much better.</li>
            <li>I love the blue nag champa</li>
            <li>I wish Tom&#x27;s Incense had the 250g red box since it opens from the top and no dust spills in the room.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the Nag champa in the blue box.</li>
            <li>brand of Nag Champa is also recommended by several sites that review incense and you would find it appearing within the top five on any reviewers list.</li>
            <li>It is similarly close to the Goloka Nag Champa which is more earthy</li>
            <li>I love the red nag champa.</li>
            <li>Nothing smells exactly like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the red Nag Champa&#x27;s, and have decided that I like the gold ones way better.</li>
            <li>and I most definitely prefer that to this.</li>
            <li>I wish I had gotten a 10-15 gram box instead.ew more over the last couple days</li>
            <li>and I most definitely prefer that to this.</li>
            <li>but the scent is not one of my favorites that I will go to first.</li>
            <li>So, this incense has a more private aspect to it.  </li>
            <li>I like these better than the blue Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you are in a well-ventilated place, or, a large room (or outside even).</li>
            <li>Burns cleanly and completely; none of my sticks have required re-lighting.  </li>
            <li>If you love real nag champa stick with the blue box!</li>
            <li>I will be looking for more of this in the future, as I really like the nag champa scent</li>
            <li>there seems to be a less earthy but more sweet scent to this one.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews won me over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if i just got a good batch or</li>
            <li>It keeps the scents fresh and allows you to continue to smell new ones.</li>
            <li>(albeit with rather large expectations, now...hope it doesn&#x27;t disappoint)</li>
            <li>If you have tried the Satya Blue or Super Hit or others, this one is worth a try and you will like it.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality incense.</li>
            <li>They produce fragrances that really enhances one&#x27;s meditation time and brings one a sense of tranquility, harmony and peace; body, mind and spirit.</li>
            <li>It may have some halmaddi in it; regardless, it does use real botanicals.</li>
            <li>the reviews of this seemed promising.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pungent and NOT for the timid...reminiscent of the 1960&#x27;s when sex, drugs and rock n&#x27; roll were prevalent.  </li>
            <li>and that is much preferred to this.</li>
            <li>and that is much preferred to this.</li>
            <li>My very 1st</li>
            <li>I really liked each one as I tried it, sort of like trying different flavors of gourmet ice cream, but when I got to the Shanthimalai Red</li>
            <li>I like to burn a few sticks while camping/BBQing, creates a nice ambiance.  </li>
            <li>One downside is that every few sticks will go out on its own before it burns all the way.</li>
            <li>Red is far superior to blue Nag--</li>
            <li>It burns slowly and is good quality.</li>
            <li>I still love the classic &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; box nag champa, even though it really is a watered down version of what It was.  </li>
            <li>It masks the old home smell of this victorian apartment pretty well.</li>
            <li>Personal preferences in scent is an absolute subjective thing, and this RED NAG CHAMPA is certainly prominently exotic.  </li>
            <li>As a long time Sai Baba fan, I was reluctant to try something different, but after reading so many positive reviews, I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>All week and the week previous I sometimes would get this strong wiff of the special scent it gives, but only in certain parts of the room.</li>
            <li>no one else will know the smell right-off-the-bat, but this is more cedar and less floral.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to favor the 100 gram boxes for the better, albeit slightly more expensive (per stick), experience.</li>
            <li>I have been burning incense for over 20 years and have tried several different versions of Nag Champa (My favorite)  and have not found one that equals this.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it, and I just left it in the box after burning the first stick and didn&#x27;t burn anything else in my room for a week.</li>
            <li>I tend to enjoy the scent of incense out of the box, but once lit, I often loose interest.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is obviously high quality incense.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand of Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li>It is a high quality incense that burns forever</li>
            <li>I use these incense constantly to create a calm energy in my home.  </li>
            <li>It burns more slowly than cheap incense, which makes it last longer.</li>
            <li>I bought these as an alternative to the normal nag I buy.</li>
            <li>Considering it&#x27;s dried clumps of stuff on sticks intended to burn, the fragrant/clear smell came as a surprise, and is precisely the reasoning behind the very long lingering smell that&#x27;s now embedded into everything I own (gladly too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a nag champa classic, a little strong</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001BAL7EG Red Nag Champa]] is of high and consistent quality.  </li>
            <li>This Shanthimalai Incense is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to trying something else new as well.</li>
            <li>I find this to be one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this out as I am a big fan of the classic blue nag champa and</li>
            <li>For years, I&#x27;ve used the blue Nag Champa that is readily available at almost every store that sells traditional incense.  </li>
            <li>I had heard of and seen it before, but smelling it in the box it smells far too intense to think you&#x27;d want to burn it, but I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t feel like a compromise at all, and for me the old classic just can&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li>With Satya it has a sweet-ish fragrance with woody notes mixed in as well as just overall a light fragrance</li>
            <li>With Satya it has a sweet-ish fragrance with woody notes mixed in as well as just overall a light fragrance</li>
            <li>Though &amp;#34;Green Mountain&amp;#34; cones do have very little smoke, &amp;#34;Red Nag&amp;#34; has the milder more desirable scent.  </li>
            <li>but this is the first time I have tried the red.</li>
            <li>I surprised!  </li>
            <li>Love ..if you are not sure, try the multi-trial packs ...</li>
            <li>inner Nag Champa variety ;).</li>
            <li>but after trying out 5 other types.. we will stick with the original..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say just burn part of a stick and don&#x27;t put near a smoke detector!</li>
            <li>It was my mistake originally thinking this was the same brand, didn&#x27;t realize it was a different company... which would explain the stench.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different than most other Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>I just got a box of the Red Nag Champa, and I REALLY like it!</li>
            <li>This is a nice change from the blue box I usually buy.</li>
            <li>not bad, slightly different from blue Nag Champa</li>
            <li>I searched Amazon for the blue Nag Champa incense, because it is hands down my favorite of all time.  </li>
            <li>and I know the trick about turning the stick upside down to hopefully get the incense to burn right, but this is just too much.  </li>
            <li>Since the supplier probably sells many more 100 gram boxes than 250 gram boxes, I found the sticks in the larger box old, a bit stale with a tendency to crumble, and even quickly go out when burnt in a closed &amp;#34;coffin&amp;#34; type incense burner (my solution is to keep the lid open).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 11/12/2014 as of 1:53 am&lt;br /&gt;I got up yesterday morning and, with a clear smelling atmosphere lit this incense</li>
            <li>I find I like the RED Nag Champa much more than the blue, so if you like the blue give the RED a try, I think you&#x27;ll be hooked as well.</li>
            <li>This smells similar but is way stronger than the blue stuff, so open a window when you light it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using incense since the early 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li>junky) old interiors which has no scientific basis but is based on a hunch that smoked food tends resist spoilage.  </li>
            <li>I may be alone here, but the smell is far from soothing or relaxing.</li>
            <li>In complete honesty, I&#x27;d rate the burning scent 4 stars, and the lingering scent 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I burned a few more over the last couple days</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t precisely explain Red Nag Champa&#x27;s scent, (or even ballpark it) other than to say it seems a bit...</li>
            <li>It has a sweet, floral, slightly feminine quality to it that bodes well for scenting our home.  </li>
            <li>This incense is the most aggravating incense I&#x27;ve ever used, and how anyone can like/accept this as normal is very confusing to me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone&#x27;s smell is different, so I would highly recommend to smell it in person before purchasing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this version when deciding to purchase your next batch of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even waste money on the blue, there are such better options out there</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is it&#x27;s a little sweet for my incense senses...</li>
            <li>Nice smelling incense at not too bad a price, but this paticular fragrance burns very fast.</li>
            <li>those wanting something sweeter than the standard blue box, I highly recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I had been a fan of the old standby, Sai Baba Blue, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this Shanthimalai Red.  </li>
            <li>Early last year (2014)</li>
            <li>This Nag Champa is comparable in scent to the Shrinivas Sugandhalaya Sai Baba Nag Champa (Blue Box) and has a sweet lingering scent that lasts a few days after it has been burnt.</li>
            <li>robust, moderately strong earthiness with spiced musk tones and mellow sweetness;  not one of your shallow, one note scents, which Satya Sai Baba tends to produce.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that I don&#x27;t care for the scent as much as some of the other ones I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>Decent consistency, evenly burning, and average bare stick length,</li>
            <li>Simply smelling the stick unburned will let you know what&#x27;s exceedingly different about the Shanthimalai red-box Nag Champa, as it smells as clear/strong as perfume (if Nag Champa made a perfume, generally as sandalwood?</li>
            <li>The scent can fill a hall and persons entering your home would be surprised by the sweet scent and would offer compliments often times inquiring as to the product - don&#x27;t worry you can keep it a secret - until the come to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lately now I seem to really prefer Nag Champa &#x27;red box&#x27; because it is softer, more subtle yet sweeter.</li>
            <li>To make my first purchase last a little longer, I burn alternately with blue Nag Champa.(One or two sessions of burning blue Nag Champa</li>

            <li> That said, now when I walk by the bag, it is a sort of quality, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> scent, to me, isn&#x27;t very pleasant at all... more of a \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; stench smell for my taste.</li>
            <li> Good service and price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> Arroved on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> this incense smells so good it smells like leather like the smell</li>
            <li> I was worried about them not being as good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the scent of nag champa but could never burn it because it would give me a migraine.  </li>
            <li> I like this, good for taking away</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> Good quality product!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li> The lingering scent, the perfumed sweetness being dominant when not burning, is as good as others assert.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly potent and beautiful fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The authentic Nag Champra incense is a great gift for anyone to give or receive.</li>
            <li> When fresh, this is a wonderful smelling incense - one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; box, however, is just phenomenal!  </li>
            <li> I love this smell!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect balance between sweet perfume and earthy smells as you can get, I love it!:)</li>
            <li> it has too strong a scent for me, but burned it smells great.</li>
            <li> To be honest, this incense is amazing.</li>
            <li> These smell amazing.</li>
            <li> The incense is well made and nicely packaged</li>
            <li> not my favorite smell, but good quality.</li>
            <li> This brand, however, smells like what I remember loving about nag champa.</li>
            <li> Smells good more mellow than agrabati</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s musk, like another reviewer insinuated, but to be honest</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s musk, like another reviewer insinuated, but to be honest</li>
            <li> The sticks arrived &amp;#34;slightly damp&amp;#34;, and even sitting in my drawer, that area of the room smells nice.</li>
            <li> Really liked the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is still a nice scent</li>
            <li> they both have VERY uniform sizes, plus they both smelled great!</li>
            <li> I burned another stick towards the end of the night and while this is a very strong incense it also has that greasy undercurrent to it.</li>
            <li> Very strong, however.</li>
            <li> And it still is very strong when not burning.</li>
            <li> I think this has got to be the best Nag Champa incense sticks I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and makes the house smell so good and fresh.</li>
            <li> They burn nicely and consistently and the smell is nice and sweet and great.  </li>
            <li> This is easily my favorite incense.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my favorite incense, and this one is one of the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad I came across this incense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything about the Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s blue-box Nag Champa I love, yet accentuated to the max without overpowering my nostrils/lungs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on review recommendations and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I prefer more spice than floral scents.</li>
            <li> Or better yet i&#x27;ll stick with my oil diffuser and burn sun&#x27;s eye nag champa oil.</li>
            <li> Even though some of the sticks weren&#x27;t fully coated, I removed the part that wasn&#x27;t coated well, lit the remaining piece, and got about fifteen minutes or more of scent.</li>
            <li> Champ brand incense really are great for those looking</li>
            <li> It is ok..</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this incense.</li>
            <li> Also one reviewer noted it smelled better after sitting for a week allowing to dry/cure.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> The Shanthimalai is one of the top scents of the  Nag Champa family For</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;I find it burns slower and puts out a lot more smoke, so the scent lingers</li>
            <li> One of my favorite nag champa incense varieties.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Will take you to India for sure.  </li>
            <li> The Red Nag Champa is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> These incense sticks are a great deal stronger than the blue nag champa but equally as good.</li>
            <li> I love this incense.</li>
            <li> I sure hope this is not the experience I have been looking forward to.</li>
            <li> I love musk and have never had that reaction.</li>
            <li> and my roommate would love to have it.</li>
            <li> I love musk and have never had that reaction.</li>
            <li> and my roommate would love to have it.</li>
            <li> Everytime I would go into my favorite stores to purchase these incense, they would always be out.  </li>
            <li> but i can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t think of people that need it more.</li>
            <li> I am a lover of incense and quite often purchase different varieties in my quest to find the perfect assortment.</li>
            <li> and man did I love it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something more earthy about it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i love the scent and</li>
            <li> made, an important topic for this kind of products</li>
            <li> These have a more pungent smell and seem to linger longer.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like burnt wood like most others.</li>
            <li> I burn a lot of incense of all types and love nag champa.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad to have stumbled upon this brand and would recommend it to anyone who loves Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s \\&quot;blue-box\\&quot; Nag Champa as a worthy replacement, or as a tag-along for</li>
            <li> First I must say that the aroma is sweetly pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely perfect - not too strong, very relaxing and fills a large room nicely.</li>
            <li> The aroma is pleasant, but nowhere near as good as the original.  </li>
            <li> It also smells very clean while burning.</li>
            <li> and it burns very clean.</li>
            <li> &quot; left in the room is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t make it look good, you can make it smell pretty.  </li>
            <li> They are all good, but the scent of this Red Nag Champa has a depth and appeal I found unique and always welcome.</li>
            <li> incense is very sweet, aromatic incense.</li>
            <li> Shipping was reasonable and the price was fair with the seller.</li>
            <li> but this really IS the Nag Champa I have always loved.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I chose this over the original Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> We love the scent of the original, so we tried this one out...  </li>
            <li> Burning, it smells nothing like it does in the package, it&#x27;s a very rich, deep, woody yet sweet smell that lingers in the most beautiful way.</li>
            <li> Originally chose it to help rid the house of pet odors, assuming it would be better than canned stuff.  </li>
            <li> However I can only compare to morning star sandalwood, so I will leave the formal review to those more experienced.</li>
            <li> If you like strong incense</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you like Nag Champa and are looking for a good scent.</li>
            <li> Very earthy and the scent is very appealing.</li>
            <li> This one veers away from sweet and is more of a foresty type.</li>
            <li> It departs with more sweet spice, adding allspice, clove, and an overpowering sage.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best nag champagne your money can buy.</li>
            <li> But the Halmaddi is very strong in this incense and the price is higher because of it because Halmaddi is becoming rarer in India.</li>
            <li> It smells fine, it just won&#x27;t say lit.</li>
            <li> Now the blue Nag Champa smells more like baby powder to me, which is still pleasant</li>
            <li> This has a much more pleasant odor than the blue Nag Champa that everyone has.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy Nag Champa, this incense deserves a spot in your rotation.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth every cent plus the women who make these get a part of profit. :)</li>
            <li> As of today I would move this up to 2/5 rating, still preferring the smooth and pleasing fragrance of Satya Sai Baba over this but who knows, as these incense sticks age a bit</li>
            <li> They did not stay lite and some didn&#x27;t light at all.</li>
            <li> This one is every bit as good as it&#x27;s blue box cousin, perhaps even better.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the product is good, just not my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> now- if you love the blue, the closest I&#x27;ve found is Blue Pearl Classic Champa which is beautiful, and OM Nagchampa is another great bet.</li>
            <li> The sticks are beautiful, thick and nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite!</li>
            <li> The smell is rich.  </li>
            <li> Just a great fragrance,and burns a long time.  </li>
            <li> The red box variant is so much more potent and I love it for that.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but this is really smokey!  </li>
            <li> Go with the original.</li>
            <li> I love the sweetness and the whole atmosphere it creates!  </li>
            <li> It has a rich aroma.</li>
            <li> The scent instantly puts me in a peaceful state of mind and makes my house (with two cats and a dog) smell great without strong perfumed candles and air-fresheners.  </li>
            <li> but over 30 years ago I used to frequent the Hari Krsna temple in Manhattan for a nice free veggie Indian meal and would smell THIS.</li>
            <li> It is actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Extraordinary scent of real Nag Champa!!!</li>
            <li> Not the same as the Original Nag Champa, but has a good burn rate.  </li>
            <li> I will most certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Also, this scent is great alone but also blends well with Sai Baba Blue and Super Hit (another new favorite).</li>
            <li> , this is one of those incenses that that burns true to the scent.  </li>
            <li> I have a burner that holds the incense straight up and sits on top of a bowl of sand.</li>
            <li> If you are a true incense lover please try these.     </li>
            <li> Good incense is less smoke and more aroma.  </li>
            <li> Not being an incense afficionado, I cannot offer much other than it works great.  </li>
            <li> If you like Super Hit you will like this.</li>
            <li> I love the blue box nag champa, but this is my favorite of all.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you like the way blue smells and don&#x27;t need it to be any stronger, this may be slightly overwhelming but my boyfriend and I love this stuff and we will be buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to order \\&quot;Goloka\\&quot;, as well as \\&quot;Super Hit\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Midnight\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I would have been much more happy with the typical blue box, as I already love that fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a lot of depth... and easily permeates a large space.  </li>
            <li> B0012UKCVY Super Hit]] or my new favorite, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> A new favorite.</li>
            <li> In retrospect, it may be the musk tones that the less than happy reviews were referring to as \\&quot;rancid\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Now, to be fair my roommate did make some rather strong smelling lunch and that smell was pretty much thick in the house for many hours</li>
            <li> Burned traditional Nag Champa since the 1970&#x27;s, my favorite!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> it instantly became my favorite!</li>
            <li> Spend the extra, if you love STRONG NAG CHAMPA</li>
            <li> I have tried another brand of Nag Champa but my research has led me to understand that it is a plant resin called Halamddi which is the ingredient that give Nag its unusual and beautiful aroma-- along with Sandalwood, Plumeria and other resins.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Shanthimalai Red smells amazing in the box, yet maintains it&#x27;s character and complexity even when burning.    </li>
            <li> This version of Nag Champa is nothing short of Amazing.</li>
            <li> and I knew it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is so much better, I&#x27;ll probably buy the blue box again only if I let myself run out of this \\&quot;good stuff.\\</li>
            <li> These are my favorite Nag Champa by far.</li>
            <li> This stuff does smell different, but still has those nice earthy tones to it and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my personal favorite nag champa (I prefer Satya Sai Baba brand), but this one has a more intense aroma.</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet and crisp.</li>
            <li> This will definitely always be on hand now though, and a part of the proceeds go to a charitable organization described on the box (helps women in India)&lt;br /&gt;Try, it won&#x27;t disappoint</li>
            <li> Red Nag Champa has a fragrance which brings to mind a perfume popular 50 years ago called &amp;#34;Heaven Scent&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It is along the same lines, but, to me, seems to have an even more pleasantly rich scent.</li>
            <li> Now I do because I love walking into my house after a long day, and the lingering scent of Shanthimalai adds to the good feeling of being back in my sanctuary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I have to be in the right mood for the earthiness of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Nag Champa fan and have pretty much always stayed with Sai Baba brand Nag Champa (</li>
            <li> Better than Blue or SUper Hit.  </li>
            <li> Very pungent and sweet.  </li>
            <li> and I received it super fast.</li>
            <li> Its burned slowly each time and filled the whole house with a warm sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I like regular nag champa much better.</li>
            <li> I love the blue nag champa</li>
            <li> I wish Tom&#x27;s Incense had the 250g red box since it opens from the top and no dust spills in the room.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the Nag champa in the blue box.</li>
            <li> brand of Nag Champa is also recommended by several sites that review incense and you would find it appearing within the top five on any reviewers list.</li>
            <li> It is similarly close to the Goloka Nag Champa which is more earthy</li>
            <li> I love the red nag champa.</li>
            <li> Nothing smells exactly like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the red Nag Champa&#x27;s, and have decided that I like the gold ones way better.</li>
            <li> and I most definitely prefer that to this.</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten a 10-15 gram box instead.ew more over the last couple days</li>
            <li> and I most definitely prefer that to this.</li>
            <li> but the scent is not one of my favorites that I will go to first.</li>
            <li> So, this incense has a more private aspect to it.  </li>
            <li> I like these better than the blue Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you are in a well-ventilated place, or, a large room (or outside even).</li>
            <li> Burns cleanly and completely; none of my sticks have required re-lighting.  </li>
            <li> If you love real nag champa stick with the blue box!</li>
            <li> I will be looking for more of this in the future, as I really like the nag champa scent</li>
            <li> there seems to be a less earthy but more sweet scent to this one.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews won me over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if i just got a good batch or</li>
            <li> It keeps the scents fresh and allows you to continue to smell new ones.</li>
            <li> (albeit with rather large expectations, now...hope it doesn&#x27;t disappoint)</li>
            <li> If you have tried the Satya Blue or Super Hit or others, this one is worth a try and you will like it.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality incense.</li>
            <li> They produce fragrances that really enhances one&#x27;s meditation time and brings one a sense of tranquility, harmony and peace; body, mind and spirit.</li>
            <li> It may have some halmaddi in it; regardless, it does use real botanicals.</li>
            <li> the reviews of this seemed promising.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pungent and NOT for the timid...reminiscent of the 1960&#x27;s when sex, drugs and rock n&#x27; roll were prevalent.  </li>
            <li> and that is much preferred to this.</li>
            <li> and that is much preferred to this.</li>
            <li> My very 1st</li>
            <li> I really liked each one as I tried it, sort of like trying different flavors of gourmet ice cream, but when I got to the Shanthimalai Red</li>
            <li> I like to burn a few sticks while camping/BBQing, creates a nice ambiance.  </li>
            <li> One downside is that every few sticks will go out on its own before it burns all the way.</li>
            <li> Red is far superior to blue Nag--</li>
            <li> It burns slowly and is good quality.</li>
            <li> I still love the classic &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; box nag champa, even though it really is a watered down version of what It was.  </li>
            <li> It masks the old home smell of this victorian apartment pretty well.</li>
            <li> Personal preferences in scent is an absolute subjective thing, and this RED NAG CHAMPA is certainly prominently exotic.  </li>
            <li> As a long time Sai Baba fan, I was reluctant to try something different, but after reading so many positive reviews, I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> All week and the week previous I sometimes would get this strong wiff of the special scent it gives, but only in certain parts of the room.</li>
            <li> no one else will know the smell right-off-the-bat, but this is more cedar and less floral.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to favor the 100 gram boxes for the better, albeit slightly more expensive (per stick), experience.</li>
            <li> I have been burning incense for over 20 years and have tried several different versions of Nag Champa (My favorite)  and have not found one that equals this.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it, and I just left it in the box after burning the first stick and didn&#x27;t burn anything else in my room for a week.</li>
            <li> I tend to enjoy the scent of incense out of the box, but once lit, I often loose interest.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is obviously high quality incense.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brand of Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li> It is a high quality incense that burns forever</li>
            <li> I use these incense constantly to create a calm energy in my home.  </li>
            <li> It burns more slowly than cheap incense, which makes it last longer.</li>
            <li> I bought these as an alternative to the normal nag I buy.</li>
            <li> Considering it&#x27;s dried clumps of stuff on sticks intended to burn, the fragrant/clear smell came as a surprise, and is precisely the reasoning behind the very long lingering smell that&#x27;s now embedded into everything I own (gladly too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a nag champa classic, a little strong</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001BAL7EG Red Nag Champa]] is of high and consistent quality.  </li>
            <li> This Shanthimalai Incense is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying something else new as well.</li>
            <li> I find this to be one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out as I am a big fan of the classic blue nag champa and</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve used the blue Nag Champa that is readily available at almost every store that sells traditional incense.  </li>
            <li> I had heard of and seen it before, but smelling it in the box it smells far too intense to think you&#x27;d want to burn it, but I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel like a compromise at all, and for me the old classic just can&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li> With Satya it has a sweet-ish fragrance with woody notes mixed in as well as just overall a light fragrance</li>
            <li> With Satya it has a sweet-ish fragrance with woody notes mixed in as well as just overall a light fragrance</li>
            <li> Though &amp;#34;Green Mountain&amp;#34; cones do have very little smoke, &amp;#34;Red Nag&amp;#34; has the milder more desirable scent.  </li>
            <li> but this is the first time I have tried the red.</li>
            <li> I surprised!  </li>
            <li> Love ..if you are not sure, try the multi-trial packs ...</li>
            <li> inner Nag Champa variety ;).</li>
            <li> but after trying out 5 other types.. we will stick with the original..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say just burn part of a stick and don&#x27;t put near a smoke detector!</li>
            <li> It was my mistake originally thinking this was the same brand, didn&#x27;t realize it was a different company... which would explain the stench.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than most other Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> I just got a box of the Red Nag Champa, and I REALLY like it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice change from the blue box I usually buy.</li>
            <li> not bad, slightly different from blue Nag Champa</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for the blue Nag Champa incense, because it is hands down my favorite of all time.  </li>
            <li> and I know the trick about turning the stick upside down to hopefully get the incense to burn right, but this is just too much.  </li>
            <li> Since the supplier probably sells many more 100 gram boxes than 250 gram boxes, I found the sticks in the larger box old, a bit stale with a tendency to crumble, and even quickly go out when burnt in a closed &amp;#34;coffin&amp;#34; type incense burner (my solution is to keep the lid open).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 11/12/2014 as of 1:53 am&lt;br /&gt;I got up yesterday morning and, with a clear smelling atmosphere lit this incense</li>
            <li> I find I like the RED Nag Champa much more than the blue, so if you like the blue give the RED a try, I think you&#x27;ll be hooked as well.</li>
            <li> This smells similar but is way stronger than the blue stuff, so open a window when you light it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using incense since the early 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> junky) old interiors which has no scientific basis but is based on a hunch that smoked food tends resist spoilage.  </li>
            <li> I may be alone here, but the smell is far from soothing or relaxing.</li>
            <li> In complete honesty, I&#x27;d rate the burning scent 4 stars, and the lingering scent 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I burned a few more over the last couple days</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t precisely explain Red Nag Champa&#x27;s scent, (or even ballpark it) other than to say it seems a bit...</li>
            <li> It has a sweet, floral, slightly feminine quality to it that bodes well for scenting our home.  </li>
            <li> This incense is the most aggravating incense I&#x27;ve ever used, and how anyone can like/accept this as normal is very confusing to me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s smell is different, so I would highly recommend to smell it in person before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this version when deciding to purchase your next batch of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even waste money on the blue, there are such better options out there</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is it&#x27;s a little sweet for my incense senses...</li>
            <li> Nice smelling incense at not too bad a price, but this paticular fragrance burns very fast.</li>
            <li> those wanting something sweeter than the standard blue box, I highly recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I had been a fan of the old standby, Sai Baba Blue, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this Shanthimalai Red.  </li>
            <li> Early last year (2014)</li>
            <li> This Nag Champa is comparable in scent to the Shrinivas Sugandhalaya Sai Baba Nag Champa (Blue Box) and has a sweet lingering scent that lasts a few days after it has been burnt.</li>
            <li> robust, moderately strong earthiness with spiced musk tones and mellow sweetness;  not one of your shallow, one note scents, which Satya Sai Baba tends to produce.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that I don&#x27;t care for the scent as much as some of the other ones I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> Decent consistency, evenly burning, and average bare stick length,</li>
            <li> Simply smelling the stick unburned will let you know what&#x27;s exceedingly different about the Shanthimalai red-box Nag Champa, as it smells as clear/strong as perfume (if Nag Champa made a perfume, generally as sandalwood?</li>
            <li> The scent can fill a hall and persons entering your home would be surprised by the sweet scent and would offer compliments often times inquiring as to the product - don&#x27;t worry you can keep it a secret - until the come to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lately now I seem to really prefer Nag Champa &#x27;red box&#x27; because it is softer, more subtle yet sweeter.</li>
            <li> To make my first purchase last a little longer, I burn alternately with blue Nag Champa.(One or two sessions of burning blue Nag Champa</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricier than the other&#x27;s but completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the general reviews for this RED NAG CHAMPA that I finally threw it in an order, just simply curious.  </li>
            <li> , I was wrong, they are a fantastic alternative to the one I regularly  purchase.</li>
            <li> I became curious about Indian incense so ordered a variety of different Satya Sai Baba scents, the Goloka, the Song of India &amp;#34;India Temple Incense&amp;#34;, and this Red Nag Champa, all in 100 gram boxes.</li>
            <li> So, if you get an &#x27;off&#x27; smelling box, it&#x27;s probably the vendor keeping it on the shelf too long - and not the product itself.</li>
            <li> it fills the air with natural aromas and I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Ive been a long time nag champa fan</li>
            <li> I may have only tried Nag Champa in the blue box and now this, but I have realized one thing typical to both kinds...</li>
            <li> Other Amazon incense sellers have the 250g red box</li>
            <li> I saw a couple of other reviews that noted the same thing having happened</li>
            <li> I have not had a single problem with it staying lit.</li>
            <li> I am going to try this again later tonight when it&#x27;s time to wind down for bed</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this incense because I started using Nag Champa in the blue box less than two years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like this, only less spicy.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle burner in the other room, which holds the incense upside down, and unless I have the ceiling fan going, it will need relighting several times.</li>
            <li> the money made from this incense the smell is a little stronger than the blue goes to help the women that make it in India!</li>
            <li> It smells like moth balls with a little extra fragrance but not much.</li>
            <li> Sorry red box, you will remain at a 2/5 rating and that&#x27;s being very generous</li>
            <li> Sorry red box, you will remain at a 2/5 rating and that&#x27;s being very generous</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> , I am not really feeling this incense.</li>
            <li> Why use this crap when one is able to buy the blue?  </li>
            <li> Conversely, I&#x27;ve burned half sticks because it&#x27;s long burning.</li>
            <li> This incense burns slower than other incense I have.  </li>
            <li> A giant box for a small price...</li>
            <li> IMO it is stronger than the other version.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d burn this on a regular basis as I just had the house repainted.</li>
            <li> Definitely disappointed as I was looking forward to enjoying them.</li>
            <li> Like their other products this burns well.</li>
            <li> Sharp fragrance on the stick, evaporates when lit?</li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t know any other ways to describe it.</li>
            <li> This is the only negative comment.</li>
            <li> but if so then perhaps I prefer the fake over the real.</li>
            <li> but if so then perhaps I prefer the fake over the real.</li>
            <li> I have a personal opinion that the use of incense has an anti-biotic effect in complex (read</li>
            <li> Resultant vapors tend not to spread to the rest of the house or waft down the street.  </li>
            <li> Having gone through the first 100 gram box quickly, I next ordered the 250 gram box but was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> just a little sweeter-milder..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll repeat this purchase down the line!</li>
            <li> Over time this much smoke would dirty the interior paint.</li>
            <li> To me it smells dry, shallow, and feels almost corrosive to the nose.</li>
            <li> Missing dead mouse or rat corpse?  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the samples of other product (as described above) were not actually included in my package.  </li>
            <li> This variety however is intensely acrid and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years this incense has had a problem.  </li>
            <li> The smoke burns my nose and is not enjoyable.</li>
            <li> As did the fact that it&#x27;s made by people who are employed by this company in their small village, and proceeds help their community.</li>
            <li> Also, I have&#x27;nt tried Nag Champa in the blue box for a while, but I remember the scent vaguely...</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive but not real great</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot less in the way of an artificial perfume smell, and it does feel a bit wet to the touch.</li>
            <li> Least offensive incense I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> BUT they are slow to ship.</li>
            <li> so when I read all the rave reviews for this red one I ignored the one bad review.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be bad incense if not for the fact that some sticks will burn, others will go out several times.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t read the previous sentence as a negative!!!</li>
            <li> and i often try different scents, but this has to be one of the worst Ive ever wasted money on.</li>
            <li> I could not keep the sticks lit and had to re-light each stick approximately 6 or 7 times.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind a bit of a burnt wood smell when burning.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stop me from ordering this product again, but it is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> These incense are not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the greasy/heavy undertones to it that is rubbing me wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the greasy/heavy undertones to it that is rubbing me wrong.</li>
            <li> Stale attic?</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t cause a crazy amount of dust when burned indoors.</li>
            <li> The lingering smell of sage leaves an ashy or sooty smell that I find unpleasant for indoor uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> all bad smells.</li>
            <li> so I suppose it is a roll of the dice if you receive a bad batch or not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems I have gotten a bad batch as it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Well, let me tell you this stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stay lit, and this renders it worthless.  </li>
            <li> But sadly very disappointed with my choice .</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible in the box.</li>
            <li> And it smells terrible when burning.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A new favorite. I have used the regular nag champa for years but this is the first time I have tried the red. Good service and price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve recently returned to burning incense as opposed to the chemical plug-in scents we&#x27;ve been utilizing in our home for a number of years.  I had been a fan of the old standby, Sai Baba Blue, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this Shanthimalai Red.  Simply put, this stuff is amazing.  It has a sweet, floral, slightly feminine quality to it that bodes well for scenting our home.  Something else I couldn&#x27;t help but notice, this is one of those incenses that that burns true to the scent.  I tend to enjoy the scent of incense out of the box, but once lit, I often loose interest.  Shanthimalai Red smells amazing in the box, yet maintains it&#x27;s character and complexity even when burning.    If you enjoy Nag Champa, this incense deserves a spot in your rotation.  Burns cleanly and completely; none of my sticks have required re-lighting.  Also, this scent is great alone but also blends well with Sai Baba Blue and Super Hit (another new favorite).</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fragrance.  It has a lot of depth... and easily permeates a large space.  LOVE it!  I&#x27;ll repeat this purchase down the line!</li>
            <li> This is easily my favorite incense. I was a bit reluctant to pay the price asked, but one whiff and I knew it was well worth it. Then I found that it burns very slowly, so it is actually a great bargain at that price!</li>
            <li> Even though I like the scent of this incense, I will not purchase it again. I could not keep the sticks lit and had to re-light each stick approximately 6 or 7 times.</li>
            <li> not bad, slightly different from blue Nag Champa</li>
            <li> Burned traditional Nag Champa since the 1970&#x27;s, my favorite!  Took a chance on this product, am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I chose this over the original Nag Champa. It is along the same lines, but, to me, seems to have an even more pleasantly rich scent. I definitely recommend this to anyone who burns incense. It burns slowly and is good quality.</li>
            <li> This is a nice change from the blue box I usually buy. Its burned slowly each time and filled the whole house with a warm sweet scent. Nag Champa is my favorite incense, and this one is one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of mixing it up a bit next time and get some Sandalwood and Nag Champa in the blue box. Then next time back to this. It keeps the scents fresh and allows you to continue to smell new ones.</li>
            <li> This incense burns slower than other incense I have.  The smell is rich.  I have shared it with a number of my friends and they also find the smell pleasant.  I am glad I came across this incense. It is a welcome addition to my home.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to give this brand a try.  Oh boy was I surprised!  It&#x27;s wonderful!!!  Heavenly scented!</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected. I like regular nag champa much better.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality incense. It isn&#x27;t too overpowering of a smell. It burns more slowly than cheap incense, which makes it last longer. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the blue nag champa so when I read all the rave reviews for this red one I ignored the one bad review. Well, let me tell you this stuff stinks! All my friends think so too. If you love real nag champa stick with the blue box!</li>
            <li> This Shanthimalai Incense is one of my new favorites. As a long time Sai Baba fan, I was reluctant to try something different, but after reading so many positive reviews, I had to give it a try. As I said, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have...um...alternative reasons for burning incense. Now I do because I love walking into my house after a long day, and the lingering scent of Shanthimalai adds to the good feeling of being back in my sanctuary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that some reviewers had a problem keeping their incense lit. I have found that different types of burners, and different air circulation can make a big difference in the way it burns. I have a burner that holds the incense straight up and sits on top of a bowl of sand. I have not had a single problem with it staying lit. I have a bottle burner in the other room, which holds the incense upside down, and unless I have the ceiling fan going, it will need relighting several times. I hope this will help. I&#x27;d hate for you to miss out on this great incense.</li>
            <li> Placing my second order of this incense--two boxes this time.  Just a great fragrance,and burns a long time.  For years, I&#x27;ve used the blue Nag Champa that is readily available at almost every store that sells traditional incense.  This is so much better, I&#x27;ll probably buy the blue box again only if I let myself run out of this \\&quot;good stuff.\\&quot;  Ordering two boxes should help me avoid that.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A giant box for a small price... These are my favorite Nag Champa by far. The smell is amazing and makes the house smell so good and fresh.</li>
            <li> Switched from Gonesh to Nag Champa blue box a couple years ago. Lately now I seem to really prefer Nag Champa &#x27;red box&#x27; because it is softer, more subtle yet sweeter. I don&#x27;t like the 100g box because it opens on the ends. I wish Tom&#x27;s Incense had the 250g red box since it opens from the top and no dust spills in the room.  Other Amazon incense sellers have the 250g red box BUT they are slow to ship. Tom..stock the 250g red box man!!</li>
            <li> Nice smelling incense at not too bad a price, but this paticular fragrance burns very fast. I averaged 30 mins.</li>
            <li> Awsome is all that can be said about this variety of Nag Champa. It is the perfect balance between sweet perfume and earthy smells as you can get, I love it!:)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! Perfect for meditation or relaxing. Much better than the Nag champa in the blue box. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Between the blue and red nag champa..I prefer the red version..just a little sweeter-milder..but both are great to cleanse the energy in any room.  I use these incense constantly to create a calm energy in my home.  Love ..if you are not sure, try the multi-trial packs ...</li>
            <li> Extraordinary scent of real Nag Champa!!!</li>
            <li> To be honest, this incense is amazing. It&#x27;s everything about the Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s blue-box Nag Champa I love, yet accentuated to the max without overpowering my nostrils/lungs. Simply smelling the stick unburned will let you know what&#x27;s exceedingly different about the Shanthimalai red-box Nag Champa, as it smells as clear/strong as perfume (if Nag Champa made a perfume, generally as sandalwood? I&#x27;m guessing...). Please don&#x27;t read the previous sentence as a negative!!! Considering it&#x27;s dried clumps of stuff on sticks intended to burn, the fragrant/clear smell came as a surprise, and is precisely the reasoning behind the very long lingering smell that&#x27;s now embedded into everything I own (gladly too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad to have stumbled upon this brand and would recommend it to anyone who loves Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s \\&quot;blue-box\\&quot; Nag Champa as a worthy replacement, or as a tag-along for inner Nag Champa variety ;).</li>
            <li> I ordered this on review recommendations and I am glad I did. The incense is well made and nicely packaged and I received it super fast. The only issue I have is it&#x27;s a little sweet for my incense senses...I prefer more spice than floral scents. And I have had no problems with lighting it or it going out. Conversely, I&#x27;ve burned half sticks because it&#x27;s long burning.</li>
            <li> Not a fan at all. Bring me back my blue box! Or better yet i&#x27;ll stick with my oil diffuser and burn sun&#x27;s eye nag champa oil. Nothing compares to its perfect aroma.</li>
            <li> All of the Indian Nag Champra incense products are excellent. They produce fragrances that really enhances one&#x27;s meditation time and brings one a sense of tranquility, harmony and peace; body, mind and spirit. The authentic Nag Champra incense is a great gift for anyone to give or receive.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this incense because I started using Nag Champa in the blue box less than two years ago. First I must say that the aroma is sweetly pleasant. IMO it is stronger than the other version. Even though some of the sticks weren&#x27;t fully coated, I removed the part that wasn&#x27;t coated well, lit the remaining piece, and got about fifteen minutes or more of scent. These incense are not for the faint of heart. If you are a true incense lover please try these.     To make my first purchase last a little longer, I burn alternately with blue Nag Champa.(One or two sessions of burning blue Nag Champa then one of Red and keep repeating) I will definitely order a bigger box each time that I place an order. Shipping was reasonable and the price was fair with the seller. Definitely worth every cent plus the women who make these get a part of profit. :)</li>
            <li> This Nag Champa is comparable in scent to the Shrinivas Sugandhalaya Sai Baba Nag Champa (Blue Box) and has a sweet lingering scent that lasts a few days after it has been burnt. The scent can fill a hall and persons entering your home would be surprised by the sweet scent and would offer compliments often times inquiring as to the product - don&#x27;t worry you can keep it a secret - until the come to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand of Nag Champa is also recommended by several sites that review incense and you would find it appearing within the top five on any reviewers list. It is similarly close to the Goloka Nag Champa which is more earthy but it lasts longer. Definitely a recommended buy.</li>
            <li> Well, after receiving the order, I was very happy. The red box variant is so much more potent and I love it for that. I will be looking for more of this in the future, as I really like the nag champa scent and I want my apartment to smell like it at all times! Lost a star for the shipping experience as it took almost 2 weeks for me to receive my order.</li>
            <li> This one is every bit as good as it&#x27;s blue box cousin, perhaps even better.  This has become my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Champ brand incense really are great for those looking&lt;br /&gt;for a bouquet of smells that are present yet not too overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand delivers and Red Nag champ has the type of scent which you won&#x27;t elsewhere.</li>
            <li> We love the scent of the original, so we tried this one out...  It is ok.. but after trying out 5 other types.. we will stick with the original.. great for a change of pace though...</li>
            <li> I find I like the RED Nag Champa much more than the blue, so if you like the blue give the RED a try, I think you&#x27;ll be hooked as well.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but this is really smokey!  I lit a stick and placed it in the burner and went into another room to work in my office. It set off my smoke detector.  I had to open a window.  It bothered the cats eyes too.  I&#x27;d say just burn part of a stick and don&#x27;t put near a smoke detector! LOL  Not sure I&#x27;d burn this on a regular basis as I just had the house repainted. Over time this much smoke would dirty the interior paint.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Arroved on time and in good condition.  Great price!</li>
            <li> I love the red nag champa. The scent instantly puts me in a peaceful state of mind and makes my house (with two cats and a dog) smell great without strong perfumed candles and air-fresheners.  Guests always compliment the smell, too.</li>
            <li> This is obviously high quality incense.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that I don&#x27;t care for the scent as much as some of the other ones I&#x27;ve bought.  Great seller.</li>
            <li> a nag champa classic, a little strong but I knew that when I bought it.  Make sure that you are in a well-ventilated place, or, a large room (or outside even).</li>
            <li> Early last year (2014) I became curious about Indian incense so ordered a variety of different Satya Sai Baba scents, the Goloka, the Song of India &amp;#34;India Temple Incense&amp;#34;, and this Red Nag Champa, all in 100 gram boxes. I really liked each one as I tried it, sort of like trying different flavors of gourmet ice cream, but when I got to the Shanthimalai Red it instantly became my favorite! They are all good, but the scent of this Red Nag Champa has a depth and appeal I found unique and always welcome. Having gone through the first 100 gram box quickly, I next ordered the 250 gram box but was a little disappointed. Since the supplier probably sells many more 100 gram boxes than 250 gram boxes, I found the sticks in the larger box old, a bit stale with a tendency to crumble, and even quickly go out when burnt in a closed &amp;#34;coffin&amp;#34; type incense burner (my solution is to keep the lid open). This is the only negative comment. My recommendation is to favor the 100 gram boxes for the better, albeit slightly more expensive (per stick), experience.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this incense. This is what the blue Nag Champa used to smell like. Now the blue Nag Champa smells more like baby powder to me, which is still pleasant but I want Nag Champa. I do think that some batches of Shanthimalai Nag Champa are &amp;#34;wetter&amp;#34; than others and may need to air out a bit. This may fix the issue with staying lit. Also one reviewer noted it smelled better after sitting for a week allowing to dry/cure.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the blue stuff, try this.  It&#x27;s warmer and sweeter than the blue nag champa.  I LOVE IT.  Bonus, it repels bugs.  I like to burn a few sticks while camping/BBQing, creates a nice ambiance.  It also doesn&#x27;t cause a crazy amount of dust when burned indoors.</li>
            <li> this incense smells so good it smells like leather like the smell and ya should buy this brand its the good stuff for the house when ya got nosy neighbors around lol</li>
            <li> This has a much more pleasant odor than the blue Nag Champa that everyone has.  Buy it and you won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> I bought these as an alternative to the normal nag I buy. I was worried about them not being as good, I was wrong, they are a fantastic alternative to the one I regularly  purchase. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great price for this nice incense!  I&#x27;ve always loved the scent of nag champa but could never burn it because it would give me a migraine.  This stuff does smell different, but still has those nice earthy tones to it and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the Original Nag Champa, but has a good burn rate.  Leaves behind a bit of a burnt wood smell when burning.</li>
            <li> Vendor delivered as promised and order was timely. Would order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This incense is very sweet, aromatic incense. It&#x27;s not my personal favorite nag champa (I prefer Satya Sai Baba brand), but this one has a more intense aroma. The \\&quot;after-aroma\\&quot; left in the room is very pleasant. One downside is that every few sticks will go out on its own before it burns all the way. It won&#x27;t stop me from ordering this product again, but it is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> This champa smells earthier and deeper than Goloka and SaiBaba incense. There&#x27;s a lot less in the way of an artificial perfume smell, and it does feel a bit wet to the touch. It may have some halmaddi in it; regardless, it does use real botanicals.</li>
            <li> not my favorite smell, but good quality.</li>
            <li> The Shanthimalai is one of the top scents of the  Nag Champa family For me.&lt;br /&gt;I find it burns slower and puts out a lot more smoke, so the scent lingers longer.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this one and recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite nag champa incense varieties. This one veers away from sweet and is more of a foresty type. Nothing smells exactly like it. If you like to have about 5000 different incense varieties on hand to suit every mood, you&#x27;ve got to have Shanthimalai Red.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for the blue Nag Champa incense, because it is hands down my favorite of all time.  I found some links to this one, and the reviews convinced me to give it a try.  I do like the scent of these sticks, though I don&#x27;t prefer it over the blue.    I was disappointed that the samples of other product (as described above) were not actually included in my package.  I was looking forward to trying something else new as well.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years this incense has had a problem.  Every box I\\&quot;ve bought is the same.  It won&#x27;t stay lit, and this renders it worthless.  It smells fine, it just won&#x27;t say lit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the blue box nag champa since I was a teenager and I feel like the scent has changed in the last couple years. This brand, however, smells like what I remember loving about nag champa. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect - not too strong, very relaxing and fills a large room nicely. It stays lit all the way through, but sometimes can take a bit of work to get it properly lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again and again. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the red Nag Champa&#x27;s, and have decided that I like the gold ones way better. These leave a lingering smell that it not too pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you like strong incense this is the one .  Very pungent and sweet.  Will take you to India for sure.  I like this, good for taking away all bad smells. If you like Super Hit you will like this.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out as I am a big fan of the classic blue nag champa and the reviews of this seemed promising. Unfortunately, it seems I have gotten a bad batch as it smells terrible. It smells like it has somehow gone rancid. I saw a couple of other reviews that noted the same thing having happened so I suppose it is a roll of the dice if you receive a bad batch or not. Definitely disappointed as I was looking forward to enjoying them.</li>
            <li> Smells good more mellow than agrabati</li>
            <li> Amazingly potent and beautiful fragrance.  I will buy these again and again.</li>
            <li> The smoke burns my nose and is not enjoyable. Always buy Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa. Go with the original.</li>
            <li> I love the blue box nag champa, but this is my favorite of all. The smell is sweet and crisp. Like their other products this burns well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling incense that I have ever used. I highly recommend this product if you like Nag Champa and are looking for a good scent.</li>
            <li> The Red Nag Champa is AWESOME! It&#x27;s very pungent and NOT for the timid...reminiscent of the 1960&#x27;s when sex, drugs and rock n&#x27; roll were prevalent.  These incense sticks are a great deal stronger than the blue nag champa but equally as good. WONDERFUL product!</li>
            <li> This smells similar but is way stronger than the blue stuff, so open a window when you light it or it might give you a headache.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is good, just not my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent! Very earthy and the scent is very appealing. Everyone I have had in the house has commented about the great scent!</li>
            <li> Red is far superior to blue Nag--no one else will know the smell right-off-the-bat, but this is more cedar and less floral.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Nag Champa fan and have pretty much always stayed with Sai Baba brand Nag Champa (majority of the variety of their nag champa is great)... and I think I will continue to do so after smelling this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent, to me, isn&#x27;t very pleasant at all... more of a \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; stench smell for my taste. It was my mistake originally thinking this was the same brand, didn&#x27;t realize it was a different company... which would explain the stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s smell is different, so I would highly recommend to smell it in person before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Satya Sai Baba blue box nag changed their recipe a while back, and has since then lost it&#x27;s intrigue. To me it smells dry, shallow, and feels almost corrosive to the nose. I stopped by my local stationery shop that carries hundreds of incense and the woman recommended this box to me. I had heard of and seen it before, but smelling it in the box it smells far too intense to think you&#x27;d want to burn it, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Burning, it smells nothing like it does in the package, it&#x27;s a very rich, deep, woody yet sweet smell that lingers in the most beautiful way. It also smells very clean while burning. I won&#x27;t even waste money on the blue, there are such better options out there now- if you love the blue, the closest I&#x27;ve found is Blue Pearl Classic Champa which is beautiful, and OM Nagchampa is another great bet. This will definitely always be on hand now though, and a part of the proceeds go to a charitable organization described on the box (helps women in India)&lt;br /&gt;Try, it won&#x27;t disappoint</li>
            <li> I still love the classic &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; box nag champa, even though it really is a watered down version of what It was.  The &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; box, however, is just phenomenal!  I love the sweetness and the whole atmosphere it creates!  This doesn&#x27;t feel like a compromise at all, and for me the old classic just can&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if i just got a good batch or what but these were packaged and made well.  They burned slowely unlike the cheaper stuff</li>
            <li> I love this incense. It has a rich aroma. I find this to be one of my new favorites. I will most certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> So...I received my red nag today and I don&#x27;t understand these reviews. Upon taking the initial whiff of the stick I found that I was not too fond of that fragrance. Smells like....moth balls? It smells like moth balls with a little extra fragrance but not much. I went on and lit it because I have read that the fragrance off the stick doesn&#x27;t smell like the smoke and I almost smelled nothing at all while it was burning. Sharp fragrance on the stick, evaporates when lit? Now, to be fair my roommate did make some rather strong smelling lunch and that smell was pretty much thick in the house for many hours so perhaps the incense had a fragrance while being burned but was being enveloped by the food smells. I am going to try this again later tonight when it&#x27;s time to wind down for bed but as it stands this is a 1.5/5. I sure hope this is not the experience I have been looking forward to. I have a feeling I would have been much more happy with the typical blue box, as I already love that fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/12/2014 as of 1:53 am&lt;br /&gt;I got up yesterday morning and, with a clear smelling atmosphere lit this incense and I have to say it smells like the Satya Sai Baba that I am used to but there seems to be an unclean feel to it, dare I say almost greasy fragrance/feel in the smoke. I burned another stick towards the end of the night and while this is a very strong incense it also has that greasy undercurrent to it. I was in a medium-sized room and I had the door to another room open and the fragrance definitely enveloped both. No windows open. When I get up I am going to try again but with open windows to see if maybe that will make a difference in the greasiness I seem to be experiencing. As of today I would move this up to 2/5 rating, still preferring the smooth and pleasing fragrance of Satya Sai Baba over this but who knows, as these incense sticks age a bit I may change my tune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Update 11/14/2014 5:27 pm&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I am not really feeling this incense. I burned a few more over the last couple days and I just don&#x27;t like it. I did order the Satya Sai Baba and I most definitely prefer that to this. With Satya it has a sweet-ish fragrance with woody notes mixed in as well as just overall a light fragrance and that is much preferred to this. It&#x27;s the greasy/heavy undertones to it that is rubbing me wrong. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s musk, like another reviewer insinuated, but to be honest I love musk and have never had that reaction. Maybe this is what Nag Champa is supposed to smell like but if so then perhaps I prefer the fake over the real. Sorry red box, you will remain at a 2/5 rating and that&#x27;s being very generous and my roommate would love to have it. Definitely try and find this in smaller quantities if you have never smelled it before. I wish I had gotten a 10-15 gram box instead.ew more over the last couple days and I just don&#x27;t like it.

            <li> The aroma is pleasant, but nowhere near as good as the original.  This wouldn&#x27;t be bad incense if not for the fact that some sticks will burn, others will go out several times.  I&#x27;ve been using incense since the early 60&#x27;s and I know the trick about turning the stick upside down to hopefully get the incense to burn right, but this is just too much.  This incense is the most aggravating incense I&#x27;ve ever used, and how anyone can like/accept this as normal is very confusing to me.  Why use this crap when one is able to buy the blue?  I bought two boxes of these, and once they are gone I&#x27;ll never buy this incense again, I&#x27;ll stick either to the blue, or incense from Nepal,and Tibet.</li>
            <li> I love this smell! It&#x27;s different than most other Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> These smell amazing. The sticks arrived &amp;#34;slightly damp&amp;#34;, and even sitting in my drawer, that area of the room smells nice. Very happy I purchased these. However I can only compare to morning star sandalwood, so I will leave the formal review to those more experienced.</li>
            <li> Not being an incense afficionado, I cannot offer much other than it works great.  Originally chose it to help rid the house of pet odors, assuming it would be better than canned stuff.  Unburned it has too strong a scent for me, but burned it smells great.</li>
            <li> Everytime I would go into my favorite stores to purchase these incense, they would always be out.  They smell heavenly and the smell lasts along time.  Receive lots of compliments, asking, what is the name of that incense.</li>
            <li> there seems to be a less earthy but more sweet scent to this one.  i thought maybe dragon&#x27;s blood but i can&#x27;t be sure.  very nice difference, though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this item twice before in the 40g box and it&#x27;s smelled wonderful. When I bought it in a 100g box, the smell was musty like mold or mildew. So, if you get an &#x27;off&#x27; smelling box, it&#x27;s probably the vendor keeping it on the shelf too long - and not the product itself. When fresh, this is a wonderful smelling incense - one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> the money made from this incense the smell is a little stronger than the blue goes to help the women that make it in India! i can&#x27;t think of people that need it more.</li>
            <li> These do smell divine. The only problem was in burning. They did not stay lite and some didn&#x27;t light at all. They are inexpensive but not real great</li>
            <li> I think this has got to be the best Nag Champa incense sticks I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Better than Blue or SUper Hit.  They burn nicely and consistently and the smell is nice and sweet and great.  Highly recommend this brand of Nag Champa.  If you have tried the Satya Blue or Super Hit or others, this one is worth a try and you will like it.</li>
            <li> Before buying I read all the reviews . But sadly very disappointed with my choice . Some sticks stop burning all through and it has no smell . All I could smell was of burnt wood .</li>
            <li> I am a lover of incense and quite often purchase different varieties in my quest to find the perfect assortment. This version of Nag Champa is nothing short of Amazing. I have been burning incense for over 20 years and have tried several different versions of Nag Champa (My favorite)  and have not found one that equals this. It&#x27;s a little pricier than the other&#x27;s but completely worth it. It&#x27;s scent is not overpowering and it burns very clean. The scent lingers on for hours and is great for relaxing and meditation. I highly recommend trying this version when deciding to purchase your next batch of Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> Really liked the smell of this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t leave an overpowering fragrance on everything in your house like the blue stuff. It masks the old home smell of this victorian apartment pretty well.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you like the way blue smells and don&#x27;t need it to be any stronger, this may be slightly overwhelming but my boyfriend and I love this stuff and we will be buying it from now on. Nag Champa has always been my brand of choice and these sticks are likely for a larger space like the living room it fills the air with natural aromas and I use them everyday. great buy</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001BAL7EG Red Nag Champa]] is of high and consistent quality.  The sticks are beautiful, thick and nicely packaged.  The scent profile starts similarly to the blue box with Eastern spice, jasmine, mace, and lavender.  It departs with more sweet spice, adding allspice, clove, and an overpowering sage.  The lingering smell of sage leaves an ashy or sooty smell that I find unpleasant for indoor uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wanting something sweeter than the standard blue box, I highly recommend [[ASIN:B0012UKCVY Super Hit]] or my new favorite, [[ASIN:B001VE4MU8 Midnight -Satya Sai Baba Incense]].</li>
            <li> I had to try it to believe it but this really IS the Nag Champa I have always loved. I am a Christian now but over 30 years ago I used to frequent the Hari Krsna temple in Manhattan for a nice free veggie Indian meal and would smell THIS. I still love Indian food, the people and the incense!! I have tried another brand of Nag Champa but my research has led me to understand that it is a plant resin called Halamddi which is the ingredient that give Nag its unusual and beautiful aroma-- along with Sandalwood, Plumeria and other resins. But the Halmaddi is very strong in this incense and the price is higher because of it because Halmaddi is becoming rarer in India. SO!!! Spend the extra, if you love STRONG NAG CHAMPA then THIS IS IT!!! So beautiful!</li>
            <li> The positive reviews won me over. As did the fact that it&#x27;s made by people who are employed by this company in their small village, and proceeds help their community. But it&#x27;s a terrible smell. It smells terrible in the box. And it smells terrible when burning. I had to put it in two plastic bags and put it in the basement.    That said, now when I walk by the bag, it is a sort of quality, pleasant smell. I still have not tried burning it again.    Update 2014: I have burned it. It is actually quite pleasant. Very strong, however. And it still is very strong when not burning. I&#x27;m upping my rating to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it, and I just left it in the box after burning the first stick and didn&#x27;t burn anything else in my room for a week. A week later I decided to give it another go and man did I love it. All week and the week previous I sometimes would get this strong wiff of the special scent it gives, but only in certain parts of the room. I loved it and I still do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again, and I prefer this over blue box nag champa now.</li>
            <li> I bought this Red Rag Champa because of all the rave reviews. It is a high quality incense that burns forever but the scent is not one of my favorites that I will go to first. There&#x27;s something more earthy about it. It is still a nice scent and I will use it but I have to be in the right mood for the earthiness of it.</li>
            <li> I keep this incense displayed like sachet &amp;#34;reeds&amp;#34; -- like potpourri!  The fragrance beckons and delights. Sticks are long-burning. Excellent product, timely delivered, I will continue to order!  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good incense is less smoke and more aroma.  Red Nag Champa has a fragrance which brings to mind a perfume popular 50 years ago called &amp;#34;Heaven Scent&amp;#34;.  Dank moldy basement?  Stale attic? Leaking stinking car?  Motor oiled garage?  Missing dead mouse or rat corpse?  If you can&#x27;t make it look good, you can make it smell pretty.  I have a personal opinion that the use of incense has an anti-biotic effect in complex (read junky) old interiors which has no scientific basis but is based on a hunch that smoked food tends resist spoilage.  Resultant vapors tend not to spread to the rest of the house or waft down the street.  So, this incense has a more private aspect to it.  Least offensive incense I have ever used.  Ranks just above &amp;#34;Green Mountain&amp;#34; for aroma desirability.  Though &amp;#34;Green Mountain&amp;#34; cones do have very little smoke, &amp;#34;Red Nag&amp;#34; has the milder more desirable scent.  Does not have an &amp;#34;old tobacco smell&amp;#34;.  No after-reeking like a rained on house fire.  No aromatic hangover at all.</li>
            <li> Ive been a long time nag champa fan and i often try different scents, but this has to be one of the worst Ive ever wasted money on. I may be alone here, but the smell is far from soothing or relaxing.</li>
            <li> My very 1st Nag Champa ever. I love it. I also tried the blue box. Very similar to me. i love the scent and the burn time is around 45 minutes per stick. WILL buy again and again!! Great price for a great incense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Joe</li>
            <li> Good quality product!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent smell!&lt;br /&gt;Hand made, an important topic for this kind of products&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I like these better than the blue Nag Champa. These have a more pungent smell and seem to linger longer. I&#x27;m converted.</li>
            <li> I just got a box of the Red Nag Champa, and I REALLY like it! I may have only tried Nag Champa in the blue box and now this, but I have realized one thing typical to both kinds...they both have VERY uniform sizes, plus they both smelled great! Since I already have Flora Nag Champa, (also realized that they had uniform sizes, as well) I&#x27;m going to try that (albeit with rather large expectations, now...hope it doesn&#x27;t disappoint) and I&#x27;m going to order \\&quot;Goloka\\&quot;, as well as \\&quot;Super Hit\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Midnight\\&quot;. I can&#x27;t precisely explain Red Nag Champa&#x27;s scent, (or even ballpark it) other than to say it seems a bit...spicy? Sorry I can&#x27;t be any more specific than that, I just don&#x27;t know any other ways to describe it. Also, I have&#x27;nt tried Nag Champa in the blue box for a while, but I remember the scent vaguely...It&#x27;s like this, only less spicy. Again, I can&#x27;t be any more specific than that, sorry.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the general reviews for this RED NAG CHAMPA that I finally threw it in an order, just simply curious.  Decent consistency, evenly burning, and average bare stick length, approx. 2 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A robust, moderately strong earthiness with spiced musk tones and mellow sweetness;  not one of your shallow, one note scents, which Satya Sai Baba tends to produce.  In retrospect, it may be the musk tones that the less than happy reviews were referring to as \\&quot;rancid\\&quot;.  Personal preferences in scent is an absolute subjective thing, and this RED NAG CHAMPA is certainly prominently exotic.  The lingering scent, the perfumed sweetness being dominant when not burning, is as good as others assert.  (I keep smelling my hands after handling one  LOL)  In complete honesty, I&#x27;d rate the burning scent 4 stars, and the lingering scent 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love these. Thats all that needs to be said. :)</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best nag champagne your money can buy. Doesn&#x27;t smell like burnt wood like most others.</li>
            <li> I burn a lot of incense of all types and love nag champa. This variety however is intensely acrid and unpleasant.</li>
