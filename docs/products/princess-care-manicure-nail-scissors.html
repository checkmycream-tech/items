            <li>If you are looking to cut cuticles or hangnails these scissors are not the best choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product; you get what you buy.</li>
            <li>bottom line is if you are looking for manicure scissors to cut nail this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Nice feel and cut.</li>
            <li>Its great and very high quality.</li>
            <li>Best to carry in a bag you check but only once out of a dozen trips did APO security find them in my carry-on, that was Honduras!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done better nail cuts with my Swiss Army knife.</li>
            <li>In any store you can find better nail scissors for better price</li>
            <li>I think that they are better for using on the toe nails than on the fingernails.</li>
            <li>This scissor appears to have a real, tightenable screw hinge, so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>I wanted a fine crafted, precision instrument.  </li>
            <li>and hey, free shipping too.</li>
            <li>but so far I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love these so much</li>
            <li>These are very high quality and worth the price</li>
            <li>These might work much better on larger hands.</li>
            <li>Much better than the stuff I bought last year from Sallys, I bought the whole set.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be good construction, but too dull to cut my toe nails.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t recommend you.</li>
            <li>I try to document pluses and minuses as I see them and contribute a video demo to add as much information as I can to help you make a decision.</li>
            <li>I prefer The Princess Care Solo straight tip cuticle scissors for my fingernails.</li>
            <li>even that not worth it, I&#x27;m off to find a better solution.</li>
            <li>Hence, the need for a new one!</li>
            <li>decent sissors.  </li>
            <li>I love these little cutters.</li>
            <li>However, when I bought them, they were advertised as new.</li>
            <li>This means while the cut the nail very well, they are not thin enough to cut cuticles or hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are a much better option, and they are sharp and durable enough to work on finger and toenails.</li>
            <li>but they seem comparable to other more expensive scissors I&#x27;ve owned in the past Great item for the price!</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers for similar items, I usually get this kind of stuff from the cosmetics section of the local grocery store.</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp and finger holes comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Quality scissors, very clean cutting action, very sharp and good finish.</li>
            <li>These scissors have thicker blades than my old manicure scissors.</li>
            <li>Actually surprised by the price</li>
            <li>The handles fit my small hands comfortably, but someone with bug thumbs will be less</li>
            <li>&quot; Though I am overall happy with my purchase, I am skeptical as to whether or not these trimmers were used before, which is a bit yucky, given that this is a personal hygiene product.</li>
            <li>These trimmers did not come in the original packaging and were, instead, sent in a small plastic bag labeled</li>
            <li>/&gt;Total length is 3.5\\&quot;, the blades are straight, the ends are sharp, the blades are 1\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell when you first get them, so I&#x27;ll be posting an update in a few months, but most of these generally get a) dull or b)</li>

            <li> these numbers aside, the short and long of it is that this scissor is highly-accurate and very sturdy and well-built, at the cost of being a little on the bulky side making it a poor choice for precision work such as removing cuticles or trimming down nails or hairs to a fine point.</li>
            <li> The trimmers are great--feel like they&#x27;re durable and that they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> good for cutting toenails!</li>
            <li> The old pair was REALLY old and quite dull.  </li>
            <li> They are strong and sturdy enough for cutting fingernails.</li>
            <li> Not only are the nail cuts not crisp, you have to fiddle a lot to attempt the cleanest cut.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very well made, but they are a little bit too thick for my fingernails.</li>
            <li> They are about the same quality as the last pair that I had for years until they became dull, which was a brand name.</li>
            <li> very loose and squiggly around</li>
            <li> At the very end (at its thinnest), it comes down to approximately 1.5mm, with each blade being 0.75mm.</li>
            <li> so I find it hard to get an even cut because just cutting straight across doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Scissors are sharp and work well.</li>
            <li> no curve to the blade, no case to keep the tips from piercing other items in a travel bag, but it came as advertised.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, and cut with precision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got small hands and regular nail cutters</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small enough to toss in your bag to carry around, too.</li>
            <li> These scissors are extremely sharp and well made.</li>
            <li> Its sharp thoguh</li>
            <li> mo3W3XG41ZQSX84]]The blades are sharp and cut well.  </li>
            <li> Buy these for some great cuticle cutting and film cutting.</li>
            <li> In comparison, all my other scissors start off at around 1.7mm and work their way down to around 0.8mm at the finest (with the blades being asymmetrically paired at 0.6mm and 0.2mm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> are always a little too wide</li>
            <li> cheaper scissors don&#x27;t even have a real screw to tighten: it&#x27;s a rivet that has a fake screwhead.</li>
            <li> they are very sharp, and well constructed.</li>
            <li> The straight tip makes for ease and flexibility in cutting.  </li>
            <li> Different than on picture, poor quality.</li>
            <li> Convenient small size.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> problem that I have is that the scissor blades are very thick.</li>

            <li> good for cutting toenails!</li>

            <li> Like many of the other reviewers for similar items, I usually get this kind of stuff from the cosmetics section of the local grocery store. It&#x27;s hard to tell when you first get them, so I&#x27;ll be posting an update in a few months, but most of these generally get a) dull or b) very loose and squiggly around the \\&quot;hinge.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheaper scissors don&#x27;t even have a real screw to tighten: it&#x27;s a rivet that has a fake screwhead. This scissor appears to have a real, tightenable screw hinge, so that&#x27;s a good thing. They&#x27;re sharp, and cut with precision. There&#x27;s no play in their movement, and they act the way a quality scissor should act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I have is that the scissor blades are very thick. My caliper gives me a reading of 3.3mm across both blades, just before they begin thinning out. At the very end (at its thinnest), it comes down to approximately 1.5mm, with each blade being 0.75mm. In comparison, all my other scissors start off at around 1.7mm and work their way down to around 0.8mm at the finest (with the blades being asymmetrically paired at 0.6mm and 0.2mm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these numbers aside, the short and long of it is that this scissor is highly-accurate and very sturdy and well-built, at the cost of being a little on the bulky side making it a poor choice for precision work such as removing cuticles or trimming down nails or hairs to a fine point.</li>
            <li> I love these so much I bought two pairs! I&#x27;ve got small hands and regular nail cutters are always a little too wide so I find it hard to get an even cut because just cutting straight across doesn&#x27;t really work for me. These are a much better option, and they are sharp and durable enough to work on finger and toenails. They&#x27;re small enough to toss in your bag to carry around, too.</li>
            <li> I love these little cutters. they are very sharp, and well constructed. I haven&#x27;t had anything slip between the edges yet. Buy these for some great cuticle cutting and film cutting.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good construction, but too dull to cut my toe nails. Tried my finger nails, which are thinner, still no go.</li>
            <li> These scissors are extremely sharp and well made. I&#x27;ve only had them for about 1 month but they seem comparable to other more expensive scissors I&#x27;ve owned in the past Great item for the price!</li>
            <li> Not only are the nail cuts not crisp, you have to fiddle a lot to attempt the cleanest cut. I&#x27;ve done better nail cuts with my Swiss Army knife. Seriously. I appreciate the low price but even that not worth it, I&#x27;m off to find a better solution.</li>
            <li> Different than on picture, poor quality. Really don&#x27;t recommend you. In any store you can find better nail scissors for better price</li>
            <li> I wanted a fine crafted, precision instrument.  What I got is another tool for my tool box on my workbench.</li>
            <li> Quality scissors, very clean cutting action, very sharp and good finish. These are very high quality and worth the price</li>
            <li> Great product; you get what you buy. Nice feel and cut. Convenient small size. Its sharp thoguh; I am keeping it in my office.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3W3XG41ZQSX84]]The blades are sharp and cut well.  These scissors have thicker blades than my old manicure scissors. This means while the cut the nail very well, they are not thin enough to cut cuticles or hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total length is 3.5\\&quot;, the blades are straight, the ends are sharp, the blades are 1\\&quot; long. The handles fit my small hands comfortably, but someone with bug thumbs will be less comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon description describes packaging as \\&quot;loose\\&quot;, what this means is that they arrive in a plastic zip lock baggy with a bar code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is if you are looking for manicure scissors to cut nail this is a good choice. If you are looking to cut cuticles or hangnails these scissors are not the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a sample for review. Getting a sample does not effect what I say. I try to document pluses and minuses as I see them and contribute a video demo to add as much information as I can to help you make a decision.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very well made, but they are a little bit too thick for my fingernails. I think that they are better for using on the toe nails than on the fingernails. I prefer The Princess Care Solo straight tip cuticle scissors for my fingernails. They are strong and sturdy enough for cutting fingernails. I have female hands. These might work much better on larger hands.</li>
            <li> This scissors do not cut anything they are really very low, low quality. I am extremely disappointed, I wasted my money</li>
            <li> The old pair was REALLY old and quite dull.  These seem to be well made.  The blades are very sharp and finger holes comfortable.  The straight tip makes for ease and flexibility in cutting.  I don&#x27;t know how well they will hold up but so far I am very pleased.  Seems to be a good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Much better than the stuff I bought last year from Sallys, I bought the whole set.  Its great and very high quality. Actually surprised by the price and hey, free shipping too.</li>
