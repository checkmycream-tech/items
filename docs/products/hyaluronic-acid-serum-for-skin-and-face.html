            <li>I was impressed with how well this was packaged and the ingredients</li>

            <li>the serum goes on perfectly.  </li>

            <li>great price</li>
            <li>I feel that this product is great because it will change with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice that it has Vitamin C in it as well as Vit.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!  </li>
            <li>So products that hydrate and moisturize my skin without oiliness are good, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The additional good thing about the Day by Day Hyaluronic Acid Serum is the Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>I loved how I could feel a tightening around my mouth and neck area.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good formula.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fairly comparable, though this one also has the Vit. C and E in it.</li>
            <li>After using it for a while, I can say that it&#x27;s a good hyaluronic acid serum and that I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li>My face looked and felt good all day.</li>
            <li>Feels good</li>
            <li>Even after using the product for weeks, I still have a good amount</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>I positively LOVED the Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>When you put this on your skin your face immediately feels tighter, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I knew that these two serums could work together in combination to produce even more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I experienced great customer service form Day by Day, with follow up emails with instructions for using the product and one a couple of weeks afterward to make sure I was enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>It has a good texture and absorbs nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li>5 of 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li>So glad to know that there are no parabens, fillers, or skin drying alcohol in it!</li>
            <li>Love this serum!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love the vitamin C from this company too!</li>
            <li>I really love the results from using this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The pump applicator is great for easy application &amp; minimizes serum’s contact with air &amp; bacteria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that this contains both vitamins A &amp; C, which provide amazing benefits to the skin.</li>
            <li>I liked this because it didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product!!</li>
            <li>All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>But, with that said, it went on my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I have been loving the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>When you hear something with the word ACID in it of course you are kind of turned off.</li>
            <li>My skin feels good and smooth, with a nice glow.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a very strong concentration of C</li>
            <li>I was excited to review Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid, mostly because I found their Vitamin C Serum to be a great product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nice - so many products</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other things to note: This company offers excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>At times I used both products together, although I liked using it without the Vitamin C Serum better.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to read through the ingredients and be able to understand what you are putting on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky, so you can put it on in the morning</li>
            <li>Love it, after use the skin becomes very smooth)</li>
            <li>They have so many benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin looked noticeably more ‘glowly’.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, my skin looks so much better since using this product.  </li>
            <li>Even better customer service.</li>
            <li>it seems to be ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is already plumper, softer and more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>so I will be looking into trying more products from this company.</li>
            <li>But its all for the love of our beauty friends and clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;See more on http://daybydaybeauty.com</li>
            <li>I also am happy that it is anti-aging and anti-wrinkle, not that I really have too many signs of aging yet, and hopefully with a product like this I won&#x27;t have to worry about getting any, any time</li>
            <li>The tone, texture and feel of my skin drastically showed a more youthful appearance and feel.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for awhile and well pleased with the results</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels like most hyaluronic acid serums</li>
            <li>Most have been closer to $30.</li>
            <li>I did not receive an applicator and have to take the top off and pour it out or stick my finger in it to get some product to use.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone was more even.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Will keep buying for sure.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed that after using this for awhile that my skin is softer, more hydrated and</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this better than anything I have used.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and paraben free too!</li>
            <li>I love how this feels on my skin--it just glides on when I apply it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this serum.</li>
            <li>I often put make-up on afterwards when using both products and it felt like I had more products on my skin (which I did).</li>
            <li>I received this product free of charge for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for more of their products to come out.  </li>
            <li>On my 4rth bottle and just love this Hyaluronic Acid serum.</li>
            <li>Once this bottle gets depleted, I will definitely need to order more to keep my skin looking its best as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>As beauty bloggers we are always in search for the latest and greatest and sometimes we find the worse and not so great.</li>
            <li>It makes me skin completely radiant and beautiful.</li>
            <li>There was no bad after effects or stickiness to it at all which I really liked also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of use, my skin feels more tightened and some of the fine lines on my face are disappearing.</li>
            <li>I really noticed an improvement after a week of using the product and loved that it was gentle on my skin and had a pleasant fragrance that was not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>noticed that when it shipped, my bottle was very full.</li>
            <li>After using, I can&#x27;t help but smile at myself because the results are amazing</li>
            <li>The light gel feels refreshing after I put it on.</li>
            <li>Also love the fact it has a light scent.  </li>
            <li>After using this product, my skin actually glows, it is incredible.</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels light and refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li>a product tester, I was sent a complimentary bottle, in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly, which I really liked, and when combined with my daily moisturizer, it made my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>My skin is not being kind right now.</li>
            <li>I just love this SO much, my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!</li>
            <li>The serum comes with a pump which I like because it keeps it sanitary and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, is non-irritating, and moisturizes my skin</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great for all types of skin, I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>I can easily apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li>I also like the pump for easy dispensing, but sometimes it squirts out too forcefully and gets onto the counter, so</li>
            <li>:) I can&#x27;t wait to continue using and see the full benefits of this serum.</li>
            <li>This is the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is truly targeting my skin problems and aiding my fight against fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this serum will help prevent wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li>This serum has helped reduce those fine lines that appear once you approach forty and leaves your skin glowing.</li>
            <li>With continued use I hope to minimize the appearance of some of my fine lines.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone that is trying to even out their skin tone, reduce pore size, hydrate skin and reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li>I ordered this since I was very interested in keeping the skin on my face healthy.</li>
            <li>It is light on my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My experience using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum has been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I received this product free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>Great product especially combined with the Vitamin C!</li>
            <li>I was given this product for free, for review purposes</li>
            <li>&gt;  Risk-free.</li>
            <li>The company genuinely seems to care about that their buyers think!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice a drastic reduction in my pores as well, along with a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very into my skin care and have used many face serums, mostly Vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>A advanced moisturizing serum with Vitamin C a rich antioxidant for collagen building, Vitamin E</li>
            <li>The key to this product being so successful for my skin type, was the ingredients (or lack there of).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this with the Vitamin C Serum and have had remarkable results in only week.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at healing any dry skin and blemishes as well.</li>
            <li>There is no real odor, which is good for me because many beauty products with odor bother my allergies.</li>
            <li>serum is super smooth with no flaws that I could find and no scent.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the fact that after using the product, I could go out of the house wearing less makeup and still look and feel more confident!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, as time goes on, I will continue to get positive results.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and soaks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>My complextion is better and the texture of my face is smooth the sun spots have disappeared and the fine lines have diminished considerably.</li>
            <li>Many skincare products include Alcohols or sulfates which are really damaging and tend to make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li>This is a full ounce of product.</li>
            <li>(See full review on the Vitamin C Serum.)</li>
            <li>They are also quick to answer questions posted about their product.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m doing it good in long run and</li>
            <li>I will definitely reorder more of serum!</li>
            <li>- ABSOLUTELY!!</li>
            <li>I will be a regular customer for sure!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this daily, and will update my review as more time passes!</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to try this new product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much when it comes to the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>really makes skin smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is safe for all skin types including sensitive skin, which I have.</li>
            <li>premium  natural plant-based Hyaluronic Acid is a gentle and yet so deeply effective serum</li>
            <li>absolutely love how natural this product is.</li>
            <li>and I love that they are natural.</li>
            <li>I rarely rave about skin products.  </li>
            <li>When I put the serum on my face it rapidly absorbed into the skin, this could be because of the lack of moisture.</li>
            <li>another rich antioxidant needed for repairing skin from damage, Witch Hazel for soothing, balancing, and calming, and more key ingredients to help my skin restore, build, hydrate, plump and repair my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Acid Serum from Day by day does it right</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Serum can deliver beautiful results when used daily as part of a regular skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>this is the first time he has consistently mentioned my skin!  </li>
            <li>We are talking a Cruel-Free, paraben free, alcohol free, filler free, and simply gentle product that transformed your skin with daily consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I won my first bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum in a contest - nothing to lose, right?  </li>
            <li>He was quickly able to pick the correct hand and surprised at how much smoother the skin was.</li>
            <li>It absorbed instantly and my skin felt smooth immediately!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much for it to cover your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>and I use it with the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum and absolutely love how young and vibrant my skin looks while I have been using this serum.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful day or night if you need a little more of a boost to your dull skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff really work!</li>
            <li>At first I did not like this at all.</li>
            <li>I love this product I&#x27;ve only had it two days</li>
            <li>The product itself is clear, light scented and a gel.</li>
            <li>Thank you Day by day beauty for giving me exactly what you promised.</li>
            <li>I did find that today the serum did not absorb rapidly, which is the first time.</li>
            <li>a bit.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a pump style top that makes it easy to squirt a little bit at a time, into my hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of my new favorite beauty products and I like that I have soft, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Right now the price on this serum is very competitive with others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It also took a little longer to get absorbed into my skin, probably because it was thicker, but honestly, that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me at all.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the product so much I&#x27;ve purchased my second</li>
            <li>My review of the product is positive.</li>
            <li>I could really feel the anti aging effects begin to work in just 1 hour of the first application.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker than other serums and goes on smooth and rich.</li>
            <li>I will say that this serum certainly hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>This one will be part of my skin care regimen for certain.</li>
            <li>As I have stated before, I have combination skin (oily sometimes, dry at others), so it is hard to get the perfect conditions to relieve all blemishes.</li>
            <li>It gives my rather dry face much needed moisture and for a longer period than most things I have used.</li>
            <li>This is actually diminishing my fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Certain spots on my face are even beginning to diminish, I can&#x27;t wait to continue using to see how much lighter the spots get.  </li>
            <li>It didn’t have much of a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My complexion has really benefitted, too.</li>
            <li>Whole review with pictures can be found on blogspot under the name</li>
            <li>ReviewStuffz.&lt;br /&gt;Update still using it, after my initial sensitivity I haven&#x27;t had any more issues whatsoever and really think its worth using adding back the star, its not the serums fault I am an anomaly.</li>
            <li>It is a product that really works,my skin is so much softer and the wrinkles around my eyes are vusubly reduced.</li>
            <li>Two drops of the hyaluronic acid serum covered my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>My face looked really oily.</li>
            <li>Immediately after dabbing it on my skin, I can feel a gentle tightening and firming.</li>
            <li>I did NOT expect to see much difference.</li>
            <li>It is so silky and smooth, and instantly made my skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is very humid here today.</li>
            <li>really like there products and excrllent customer service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving this serum and already seeing benefits after a few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exceptional service with follow-up inquiry from the company owners - really nice to see such a personal touch and ability to provide feedback.</li>
            <li>I am getting older and while I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, I am starting to get some fine lines.</li>
            <li>I always am unsure when I try a new beauty product as far as how quickly I may see results from it.</li>
            <li>So, I am planning on using this Hyaluronic Acid product on days when I do not plan on putting any or many other products on my face.    </li>
            <li>I was worried the 1oz bottle size would not be enough to cover my face and neck for a full month.  </li>
            <li>The eyedropper shipped separately and when I put it in the bottle, I had a completely full bottle with just enough space that it didn&#x27;t spill and stayed neat.</li>
            <li>I have tried other HA serums and it seems it&#x27;s pretty comparable to them in price and product, but the company&#x27;s values make it worth a little more I think!</li>
            <li>but I spend a lot of time outside, esp during the summer, so not only does my skin feel more hydrated, but</li>
            <li>I Haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that works as well in such a short time.</li>
            <li>It is not irritating to my sensitive skin at all, and I really don&#x27;t detect any fragrance, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>The serum comes in a glass bottle with a convenient pump which is a major plus when your getting ready and only have one free hand and with being a mom</li>
            <li>I do wish it smelled a little better..</li>
            <li>Great product at a fraction of the expensive mall prices.</li>
            <li>I have been blessed thus far, not to have any that are bothersome, but with the results that I have seen with this product, I can really see how it would help with those bothersome lines.me lines.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel refreshed and firm.</li>
            <li>smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wash my face as normal.</li>
            <li>After just a few days, my skin looks healthier and more youthful.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li>serum was more watery than other facial serums I have tried.</li>
            <li>As someone who has really sensitive skin I always cringe a bit when it comes to trying out new skin care products.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major benefit to this particular serum is the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed my skin is soft while using the product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>The serum is clear, has a gel consistency, and not heavily scented.</li>
            <li>young</li>
            <li>One pump is enough to use over my whole face.</li>
            <li>this product just enhance my natural beauty.  </li>
            <li>it does I assume its getting rid of old skin.</li>
            <li>I am not one to use skin care products as I am always worried about a reaction with my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>The product is reasonable and makes my wife&#x27;s skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, and clear, and even my under eye circles seem lighter.  </li>
            <li>This product makes your skin look young again.</li>
            <li>My face felt really greasy in places throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>98% Naturally Derived, 72% Organic and NOT tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>98% Naturally Derived, 72% Organic and NOT tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>They are almost completely gone since using this product.  </li>
            <li>This is another reason why I really like hyaluronic acid products, such as Day By Day Hyaluronic Serum.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product with an under eye serum that I just finished reviewing, and by far this is the product that stands out in my mind.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a try because of its all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Works really well at tightening my skin and improving the overall texture and appearance.</li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s aloe based, fairly thin and very easy to spread on, and very quick to absorb with very little if any residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was offered the product at a significant discount (but not free) for purposes of unbiased review.</li>
            <li>we know, as you get older you skin tends to get dry really quickly and with the summer months upon us I&#x27;m constantly cleaning my face which only adds to the issue.</li>
            <li>The price seems high to me for something that only offers temporary effects (for-me).  </li>
            <li>so its no surprise that it left my skin looking vibrant and</li>
            <li>After using twice daily for a week, I noticed less fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>liked the fact that the Hyaluronic Acid Serum is neither too thick nor too thin, and spreads easily across my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product, especially if you are using a Vitamin C</li>
            <li>these days are giving way more packaging than product, and products look half empty when they come.</li>
            <li>a couple of drops after your normal facial cleansing routine and start seeing your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The second day using this product I washed my face as normal, did not use a toner afterwards.</li>
            <li>next day I washed my face as normal.</li>
            <li>I let dry and used my normal moisturizer not the new one.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I also used a new moisturizer that I applied after the hyaluronic acid serum dried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came in a small blue bottle with a screw cap and a pump that was easily attachable.</li>
            <li>At first, it left me feeling kind of dried out, and I&#x27;m not sure if that was just because I was hitting my skin with several different products in one day, but eventually it softened off.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an amazing thing since I usually get red irritated eyes from other products.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using this product for a week-ish and saw any SMALL changes I&#x27;d noticed in my fine lines go back to where they were.</li>
            <li>though - it has not made my skin red once, even though I am often outside in the garden during the high sun of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps, especially as the Vitamin C can sometimes make skin a bit sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>This also left my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Since I had success with LESS acne and softer skin using the Vitamin C Serum, I wanted to see if I could take it to the next level with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>I applied toner as normal and let dry.</li>
            <li>I did notice other results, but I wanted to let you all know, what I really found different with this product.</li>
            <li>They have toned down so much since beginning this routine.</li>
            <li>After just a few times of applying this Vitamin C Serum, I was amazed at how less noticeable my fine lines and wrinkles were.</li>
            <li>I like the thick gel substance and the mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>Once applying it to your face the gel sinks right in, no oily mess later and no greasy look.</li>

            <li> I loved how I could feel a tightening around my mouth and neck area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good formula.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fairly comparable, though this one also has the Vit. C and E in it.</li>

            <li> I positively LOVED the Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> When you put this on your skin your face immediately feels tighter, which is a good thing.</li>

            <li> The pump applicator is great for easy application &amp; minimizes serum’s contact with air &amp; bacteria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that this contains both vitamins A &amp; C, which provide amazing benefits to the skin.</li>
            <li> I liked this because it didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product!!</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> But, with that said, it went on my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been loving the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> When you hear something with the word ACID in it of course you are kind of turned off.</li>
            <li> My skin feels good and smooth, with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a very strong concentration of C</li>
            <li> I was excited to review Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid, mostly because I found their Vitamin C Serum to be a great product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s nice - so many products</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other things to note: This company offers excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> At times I used both products together, although I liked using it without the Vitamin C Serum better.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to be able to read through the ingredients and be able to understand what you are putting on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky, so you can put it on in the morning</li>
            <li> Love it, after use the skin becomes very smooth)</li>
            <li> They have so many benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin looked noticeably more ‘glowly’.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> , my skin looks so much better since using this product.  </li>
            <li> Even better customer service.</li>
            <li> it seems to be ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is already plumper, softer and more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> so I will be looking into trying more products from this company.</li>
            <li> But its all for the love of our beauty friends and clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;See more on http://daybydaybeauty.com</li>
            <li> I also am happy that it is anti-aging and anti-wrinkle, not that I really have too many signs of aging yet, and hopefully with a product like this I won&#x27;t have to worry about getting any, any time</li>
            <li> The tone, texture and feel of my skin drastically showed a more youthful appearance and feel.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for awhile and well pleased with the results</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels like most hyaluronic acid serums</li>
            <li> Most have been closer to $30.</li>
            <li> I did not receive an applicator and have to take the top off and pour it out or stick my finger in it to get some product to use.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone was more even.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying for sure.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that after using this for awhile that my skin is softer, more hydrated and</li>

            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic and paraben free too!</li>
            <li> I love how this feels on my skin--it just glides on when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum.</li>
            <li> I often put make-up on afterwards when using both products and it felt like I had more products on my skin (which I did).</li>
            <li> I received this product free of charge for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for more of their products to come out.  </li>
            <li> On my 4rth bottle and just love this Hyaluronic Acid serum.</li>
            <li> Once this bottle gets depleted, I will definitely need to order more to keep my skin looking its best as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> As beauty bloggers we are always in search for the latest and greatest and sometimes we find the worse and not so great.</li>
            <li> It makes me skin completely radiant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> There was no bad after effects or stickiness to it at all which I really liked also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of use, my skin feels more tightened and some of the fine lines on my face are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I really noticed an improvement after a week of using the product and loved that it was gentle on my skin and had a pleasant fragrance that was not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> noticed that when it shipped, my bottle was very full.</li>
            <li> After using, I can&#x27;t help but smile at myself because the results are amazing</li>
            <li> The light gel feels refreshing after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Also love the fact it has a light scent.  </li>
            <li> After using this product, my skin actually glows, it is incredible.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels light and refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li> a product tester, I was sent a complimentary bottle, in exchange for my honest review.</li>

            <li> I just love this SO much, my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!</li>
            <li> The serum comes with a pump which I like because it keeps it sanitary and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, is non-irritating, and moisturizes my skin</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great for all types of skin, I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I can easily apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I also like the pump for easy dispensing, but sometimes it squirts out too forcefully and gets onto the counter, so</li>
            <li> :) I can&#x27;t wait to continue using and see the full benefits of this serum.</li>
            <li> This is the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is truly targeting my skin problems and aiding my fight against fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this serum will help prevent wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li> This serum has helped reduce those fine lines that appear once you approach forty and leaves your skin glowing.</li>
            <li> With continued use I hope to minimize the appearance of some of my fine lines.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone that is trying to even out their skin tone, reduce pore size, hydrate skin and reduce fine lines.</li>

            <li> I did notice a drastic reduction in my pores as well, along with a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very into my skin care and have used many face serums, mostly Vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> A advanced moisturizing serum with Vitamin C a rich antioxidant for collagen building, Vitamin E</li>
            <li> The key to this product being so successful for my skin type, was the ingredients (or lack there of).</li>

            <li> I rarely rave about skin products.  </li>

            <li> He was quickly able to pick the correct hand and surprised at how much smoother the skin was.</li>
            <li> It absorbed instantly and my skin felt smooth immediately!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much for it to cover your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> and I use it with the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum and absolutely love how young and vibrant my skin looks while I have been using this serum.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful day or night if you need a little more of a boost to your dull skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff really work!</li>
            <li> At first I did not like this at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve only had it two days</li>
            <li> The product itself is clear, light scented and a gel.</li>
            <li> Thank you Day by day beauty for giving me exactly what you promised.</li>
            <li> I did find that today the serum did not absorb rapidly, which is the first time.</li>
            <li> a bit.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a pump style top that makes it easy to squirt a little bit at a time, into my hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of my new favorite beauty products and I like that I have soft, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Right now the price on this serum is very competitive with others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It also took a little longer to get absorbed into my skin, probably because it was thicker, but honestly, that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me at all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the product so much I&#x27;ve purchased my second</li>
            <li> My review of the product is positive.</li>
            <li> I could really feel the anti aging effects begin to work in just 1 hour of the first application.  </li>
            <li> It is thicker than other serums and goes on smooth and rich.</li>
            <li> I will say that this serum certainly hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> This one will be part of my skin care regimen for certain.</li>
            <li> As I have stated before, I have combination skin (oily sometimes, dry at others), so it is hard to get the perfect conditions to relieve all blemishes.</li>
            <li> It gives my rather dry face much needed moisture and for a longer period than most things I have used.</li>
            <li> This is actually diminishing my fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Certain spots on my face are even beginning to diminish, I can&#x27;t wait to continue using to see how much lighter the spots get.  </li>
            <li> It didn’t have much of a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My complexion has really benefitted, too.</li>
            <li> Whole review with pictures can be found on blogspot under the name</li>
            <li> ReviewStuffz.&lt;br /&gt;Update still using it, after my initial sensitivity I haven&#x27;t had any more issues whatsoever and really think its worth using adding back the star, its not the serums fault I am an anomaly.</li>
            <li> It is a product that really works,my skin is so much softer and the wrinkles around my eyes are vusubly reduced.</li>
            <li> Two drops of the hyaluronic acid serum covered my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> My face looked really oily.</li>
            <li> Immediately after dabbing it on my skin, I can feel a gentle tightening and firming.</li>
            <li> I did NOT expect to see much difference.</li>
            <li> It is so silky and smooth, and instantly made my skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is very humid here today.</li>
            <li> really like there products and excrllent customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this serum and already seeing benefits after a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exceptional service with follow-up inquiry from the company owners - really nice to see such a personal touch and ability to provide feedback.</li>
            <li> I am getting older and while I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, I am starting to get some fine lines.</li>
            <li> I always am unsure when I try a new beauty product as far as how quickly I may see results from it.</li>
            <li> So, I am planning on using this Hyaluronic Acid product on days when I do not plan on putting any or many other products on my face.    </li>
            <li> I was worried the 1oz bottle size would not be enough to cover my face and neck for a full month.  </li>
            <li> The eyedropper shipped separately and when I put it in the bottle, I had a completely full bottle with just enough space that it didn&#x27;t spill and stayed neat.</li>
            <li> I have tried other HA serums and it seems it&#x27;s pretty comparable to them in price and product, but the company&#x27;s values make it worth a little more I think!</li>
            <li> but I spend a lot of time outside, esp during the summer, so not only does my skin feel more hydrated, but</li>
            <li> I Haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that works as well in such a short time.</li>
            <li> It is not irritating to my sensitive skin at all, and I really don&#x27;t detect any fragrance, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> The serum comes in a glass bottle with a convenient pump which is a major plus when your getting ready and only have one free hand and with being a mom</li>
            <li> I do wish it smelled a little better..</li>
            <li> Great product at a fraction of the expensive mall prices.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed thus far, not to have any that are bothersome, but with the results that I have seen with this product, I can really see how it would help with those bothersome lines.me lines.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel refreshed and firm.</li>
            <li> smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wash my face as normal.</li>
            <li> After just a few days, my skin looks healthier and more youthful.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> serum was more watery than other facial serums I have tried.</li>
            <li> As someone who has really sensitive skin I always cringe a bit when it comes to trying out new skin care products.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major benefit to this particular serum is the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed my skin is soft while using the product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> The serum is clear, has a gel consistency, and not heavily scented.</li>
            <li> young</li>
            <li> One pump is enough to use over my whole face.</li>
            <li> this product just enhance my natural beauty.  </li>
            <li> it does I assume its getting rid of old skin.</li>
            <li> I am not one to use skin care products as I am always worried about a reaction with my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> The product is reasonable and makes my wife&#x27;s skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, and clear, and even my under eye circles seem lighter.  </li>
            <li> This product makes your skin look young again.</li>
            <li> My face felt really greasy in places throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> 98% Naturally Derived, 72% Organic and NOT tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> 98% Naturally Derived, 72% Organic and NOT tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They are almost completely gone since using this product.  </li>
            <li> This is another reason why I really like hyaluronic acid products, such as Day By Day Hyaluronic Serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with an under eye serum that I just finished reviewing, and by far this is the product that stands out in my mind.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try because of its all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Works really well at tightening my skin and improving the overall texture and appearance.</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s aloe based, fairly thin and very easy to spread on, and very quick to absorb with very little if any residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was offered the product at a significant discount (but not free) for purposes of unbiased review.</li>
            <li> we know, as you get older you skin tends to get dry really quickly and with the summer months upon us I&#x27;m constantly cleaning my face which only adds to the issue.</li>
            <li> The price seems high to me for something that only offers temporary effects (for-me).  </li>
            <li> so its no surprise that it left my skin looking vibrant and</li>
            <li> After using twice daily for a week, I noticed less fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> liked the fact that the Hyaluronic Acid Serum is neither too thick nor too thin, and spreads easily across my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this product, especially if you are using a Vitamin C</li>
            <li> these days are giving way more packaging than product, and products look half empty when they come.</li>
            <li> a couple of drops after your normal facial cleansing routine and start seeing your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second day using this product I washed my face as normal, did not use a toner afterwards.</li>
            <li> next day I washed my face as normal.</li>
            <li> I let dry and used my normal moisturizer not the new one.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I also used a new moisturizer that I applied after the hyaluronic acid serum dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a small blue bottle with a screw cap and a pump that was easily attachable.</li>
            <li> At first, it left me feeling kind of dried out, and I&#x27;m not sure if that was just because I was hitting my skin with several different products in one day, but eventually it softened off.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an amazing thing since I usually get red irritated eyes from other products.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using this product for a week-ish and saw any SMALL changes I&#x27;d noticed in my fine lines go back to where they were.</li>
            <li> though - it has not made my skin red once, even though I am often outside in the garden during the high sun of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps, especially as the Vitamin C can sometimes make skin a bit sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> This also left my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Since I had success with LESS acne and softer skin using the Vitamin C Serum, I wanted to see if I could take it to the next level with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> I applied toner as normal and let dry.</li>
            <li> I did notice other results, but I wanted to let you all know, what I really found different with this product.</li>
            <li> They have toned down so much since beginning this routine.</li>
            <li> After just a few times of applying this Vitamin C Serum, I was amazed at how less noticeable my fine lines and wrinkles were.</li>
            <li> I like the thick gel substance and the mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> Once applying it to your face the gel sinks right in, no oily mess later and no greasy look.</li>
            <li> Although I have been using Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, along with other assorted facial products that are part of my daily regimen, I have not yet completely cleared the tiny patches of acne that I tend to get on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> They usually do, but this time they disappeared much quicker.</li>
            <li> And the slight, clear, gel like material disappears in a minute or so on your skin.</li>
            <li> so 1-oz goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You know that old school thinking that says it has to be harsh in order to be affective.</li>
            <li> I will be a long time customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But you have to remember, you spent your entire life getting wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it has any long term effects.</li>
            <li> The serum did not leave any greasy residue behind and easily absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my brown bumps are less obvious and my necks seems smoother.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is coming a long way!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid will adjust its absorption rate, due to these factors such as humidity and environment.</li>
            <li> After applying my Vitamin C Serum on cleansed skin, and allowing it to dry, I like to apply this serum.</li>
            <li> It stung quite a bit and made my skin feel quite dry.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use it under my moisturizer because I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> After my face was dry I would apply the hyaluronic acid serum and let dry.</li>
            <li> I applied the hyaluronic acid serum and let it dry.</li>
            <li> My face was extremely dry all day</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve also been putting some on the back of one hand every night for the last few days and had my husband guess which hand</li>
            <li> Each time only requires a small amount so the bottle can last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skins has always been very dry in places and this product has helped.</li>
            <li> , Its made up of some essential products like aloe, witch hazel, green tea, vitamin C and E</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no reaction to the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a small bottle that will last a long time--a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have noticed another slight reduction in the amount of blemishes that I am getting, and a softer, less rough feeling to my skin overall.</li>
            <li> Very important to me because I would hate to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> After starting again I’m not really sure why I stopped.</li>
            <li> The dryer patches of skin on my face (forehead and sunburned cheeks) soaked it up faster than other parts of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum, on the other hand, I never want to be without.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Comparable to other HA serums</li>
            <li> Within a few days though that dry skin was going away and along with it was making my face look and feel smoother.</li>
            <li> Thicker consistency than other serums I&#x27;ve tried, meaning less falls off your fingers and is wasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do see results, I suffer from dark rings around my eyes and after using Day by Day Hyaluronic Acid Serum</li>
            <li> at least my skin is never the same day-to-day.</li>
            <li> I did not feel oily or weighed down by the product.  </li>
            <li> It did not let me down.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forwards to using other product from this company!</li>
            <li> I am seeing a difference in my skin being smoother, softer and having less redness.</li>
            <li> It even is making me break out less though that&#x27;s not something it says</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t moisturize at all due to my oily face tendency.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs a little faster than I would like (before I can get it everywhere that I want it), but I guess that means it is doing its job.</li>
            <li> This product smoothed my skin even though it felt a little bit greasy on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> it smells a little..</li>
            <li> I had milia on my face - little flesh colored bumps.  </li>
            <li> The serum is a bit thicker than another hyaluronic acid serum I tried a few months ago.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin feeling hydrated without any heavy, greasy</li>
            <li> I will update my review in a few weeks and let you know how well it is holding up.</li>
            <li> This product is not skin stripping or harsh at all.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this everyday</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days since I received it</li>
            <li> At one point I noticed my skin peeling, but I think that was a day I had this Hyaluronic Acid, the Vitamin C Serum, SPF moisturizer, and a few make-up products on.</li>
            <li> There were no more of those dark spots.</li>
            <li> You have to use very little per application.</li>
            <li> Biggest result I have seen is improvement in skin discoloration and that was just in a few days!</li>
            <li> In fact, I  usually give up on them about 3 months in.  </li>
            <li> Even knowing this product, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to spend the money on it for the rest of my life just to help the lines...</li>
            <li> negative skin</li>
            <li> Because of the absorbancy and thickness (not at all too thick)</li>
            <li> The word acid is just a little scary.</li>
            <li> If the reviews have turned you off, throw up any questions that you have and base your decision on responses directly from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product until I received and used.</li>
            <li> This is wasteful and I am afraid I could contaminate the product.</li>
            <li> IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results :-(</li>
            <li> Which I hate because I never know if it is because the product is clearing out my skin or the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I stopped using facial serums for my face a while ago because I don’t like to use a lot of different products on my face. After starting again I’m not really sure why I stopped. They have so many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a small blue bottle with a screw cap and a pump that was easily attachable. The pump applicator is great for easy application &amp; minimizes serum’s contact with air &amp; bacteria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum was more watery than other facial serums I have tried. I liked this because it didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy at all. It makes my skin feel hydrated without having to wait for it to soak in. It didn’t have much of a noticeable smell. Each time only requires a small amount so the bottle can last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is safe for all skin types including sensitive skin, which I have. Whenever I switch beauty my beauty routine I get breakouts for a while. Which I hate because I never know if it is because the product is clearing out my skin or the product doesn’t work well with my skin. The best part with this serum is I didn’t have any breakouts at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a little over two weeks my skin looked noticeably more ‘glowly’. I saw the biggest difference in my pores around my nose and cheeks. They are a lot smaller.  It does a great job at healing any dry skin and blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I love it, my skin looks so much better since using this product.  Day by Day Beauty is a great company to deal with.  I received everything I ordered as promised!</li>
            <li> Have used it for a short time, but it does seem to help. Ask me again in about 30 days.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product!! After using, I can&#x27;t help but smile at myself because the results are amazing and I feel I look 5-10 yrs younger!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product. Wonderful results. Even better customer service.</li>
            <li> The darkness under my eyes are lighter after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a difference in my skin being smoother, softer and having less redness.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results :-(</li>
            <li> As someone who has really sensitive skin I always cringe a bit when it comes to trying out new skin care products. The key to this product being so successful for my skin type, was the ingredients (or lack there of). Many skincare products include Alcohols or sulfates which are really damaging and tend to make my skin breakout. This Hyaluronic Acid Serum from Day by day does it right, Its made up of some essential products like aloe, witch hazel, green tea, vitamin C and E so its no surprise that it left my skin looking vibrant and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we know, as you get older you skin tends to get dry really quickly and with the summer months upon us I&#x27;m constantly cleaning my face which only adds to the issue. I will say that this serum certainly hydrates my skin. Once applying it to your face the gel sinks right in, no oily mess later and no greasy look. The serum comes in a glass bottle with a convenient pump which is a major plus when your getting ready and only have one free hand and with being a mom I&#x27;ll take all the convenience I can get.</li>
            <li> it seems to be ok.  I&#x27;ve only used for a couple of months and can see some improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this serum and already seeing benefits after a few days. The serum comes with a pump which I like because it keeps it sanitary and easy to use. It has a good texture and absorbs nicely into my skin. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is already plumper, softer and more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using it on my face, I&#x27;ve also been putting some on the back of one hand every night for the last few days and had my husband guess which hand I put it on. He was quickly able to pick the correct hand and surprised at how much smoother the skin was. I was impressed with how well this was packaged and the ingredients so I will be looking into trying more products from this company.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t moisturize at all due to my oily face tendency.  I tried Day By Day for three days and have noticed some benefits.  My face feels hydrated and moisturized throughout the day without any side effects like an oilier face. I only use a bit of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum so 1-oz goes a long way.  I immediately noticed my skin is soft while using the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is not being kind right now. That is the part of the job that is not always glamorous.

            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum can deliver beautiful results when used daily as part of a regular skin care regimen. Day By Day has done a wonderful job packaging up this magic in a bottle! It is not greasy or smelly. Works wonderful day or night if you need a little more of a boost to your dull skin. I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product! I have sensitive skin &amp; it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.! 5 of 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> After applying my Vitamin C Serum on cleansed skin, and allowing it to dry, I like to apply this serum. It goes on easily, is non-irritating, and moisturizes my skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a pump style top that makes it easy to squirt a little bit at a time, into my hands. The serum is clear, has a gel consistency, and not heavily scented. It is light on my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I can use it under my makeup, which is what I like to do.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love how natural this product is. So glad to know that there are no parabens, fillers, or skin drying alcohol in it! Very important to me because I would hate to dry my skin out. I also am happy that it is anti-aging and anti-wrinkle, not that I really have too many signs of aging yet, and hopefully with a product like this I won&#x27;t have to worry about getting any, any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my new favorite beauty products and I like that I have soft, hydrated skin. I do highly recommend this product, especially if you are using a Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester, I was sent a complimentary bottle, in exchange for my honest review. No other compensation was received. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The serum is a bit thicker than another hyaluronic acid serum I tried a few months ago. But, with that said, it went on my skin nicely. It also took a little longer to get absorbed into my skin, probably because it was thicker, but honestly, that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me at all. The dryer patches of skin on my face (forehead and sunburned cheeks) soaked it up faster than other parts of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m young but I spend a lot of time outside, esp during the summer, so not only does my skin feel more hydrated, but I know I&#x27;m doing it good in long run and this serum will help prevent wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Day by Day Hyaluronic Acid serum for about a month. My skin feels good and smooth, with a nice glow. The light gel feels refreshing after I put it on. I like how it feels on my skin. My skin feels tighter and firmer after using the serum. My complexion has really benefitted, too. I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after showering in the morning and before bed. During the day I try to avoid anything that will add oil to my skin, especially in the hotter summer weather when my skin feels oilier. So products that hydrate and moisturize my skin without oiliness are good, in my opinion. It keeps my skin feeling hydrated without any heavy, greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump because it dispenses a generous amount, plenty to apply to my face, neck and decolletage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced great customer service form Day by Day, with follow up emails with instructions for using the product and one a couple of weeks afterward to make sure I was enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! This stuff really work! great price.. Keep my skin moist and glowing</li>
            <li> One pump is enough to use over my whole face. It is not drying and is in fact hydrating. I have been applying it every night and every morning. The additional good thing about the Day by Day Hyaluronic Acid Serum is the Vitamin C. This added benefit helps with my hyper pigmentation. I have been loving the texture of my skin. I am very into my skin care and have used many face serums, mostly Vitamin C serums. Although this has Vit C incorporated, I think this is perfect to add to my skin regime and I use this before my Vitamin C and moisturizer. I have noticed my skins texture improving. I received the product for an unbiased and uncompensated review.</li>
            <li> My experience using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum has been fantastic.  I don&#x27;t use alot of makeup and this product just enhance my natural beauty.  I love how it makes my skin feel refreshed and firm. Also love the fact it has a light scent.  I will be a long time customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really appreciate how the seller also checks in by email to see if I have any concerns about there product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold for life.</li>
            <li> I waited to give my review so I could use it for awhile and I have to say this product is the wonderful.My complextion is better and the texture of my face is smooth the sun spots have disappeared and the fine lines have diminished considerably.This product should be called the miracle worker.</li>
            <li> really makes skin smooth</li>
            <li> At first I did not like this at all. It stung quite a bit and made my skin feel quite dry. Within a few days though that dry skin was going away and along with it was making my face look and feel smoother. I&#x27;m actually getting compliments on my skin. It even is making me break out less though that&#x27;s not something it says it does I assume its getting rid of old skin. I received this product free for review purposes. Whole review with pictures can be found on blogspot under the name ReviewStuffz.&lt;br /&gt;Update still using it, after my initial sensitivity I haven&#x27;t had any more issues whatsoever and really think its worth using adding back the star, its not the serums fault I am an anomaly.</li>
            <li> My skins has always been very dry in places and this product has helped. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky, so you can put it on in the morning and you won&#x27;t look like you have goo on your face!&lt;br /&gt;It moisturized my face as describe and I&#x27;m looking forwards to using other product from this company!</li>
            <li> After only 3 weeks of Using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum from Day by Day I noticed a 100% improvement in the moisture level on my skin.  The tone, texture and feel of my skin drastically showed a more youthful appearance and feel.  I was worried the 1oz bottle size would not be enough to cover my face and neck for a full month.  Because of the absorbancy and thickness (not at all too thick) the serum goes on perfectly.  You don&#x27;t need very much for it to cover your face and neck.  The moisture on my face was locked in all day.  I did not feel oily or weighed down by the product.  Certain spots on my face are even beginning to diminish, I can&#x27;t wait to continue using to see how much lighter the spots get.  I could really feel the anti aging effects begin to work in just 1 hour of the first application.  I loved how I could feel a tightening around my mouth and neck area.  I am not one to use skin care products as I am always worried about a reaction with my sensitive eyes.  I had absolutely no reaction to the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  That&#x27;s an amazing thing since I usually get red irritated eyes from other products.  It was quite a boost for my confidence when my husband noticed a difference and said my skin looked glowing :) I can&#x27;t wait to continue using and see the full benefits of this serum.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for awhile and well pleased with the results</li>
            <li> Fastest delivery ever ..I love this product I&#x27;ve only had it two days but I&#x27;m impressed already.i use the vitamin c serum after it dries I apply the acid serum I can actually  see a difference already&lt;br /&gt;  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks after two weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good formula. It&#x27;s very nice that it has Vitamin C in it as well as Vit. E and the hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like most hyaluronic acid serums I&#x27;ve used- like it&#x27;s aloe based, fairly thin and very easy to spread on, and very quick to absorb with very little if any residue.&lt;br /&gt;I always follow mine with moisturizer. It helps, especially as the Vitamin C can sometimes make skin a bit sensitive to the sun. This isn&#x27;t a very strong concentration of C though - it has not made my skin red once, even though I am often outside in the garden during the high sun of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s working fine. I&#x27;ve been using another hyaluronic acid serum and it&#x27;s fairly comparable, though this one also has the Vit. C and E in it. My skin is looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that when it shipped, my bottle was very full. The eyedropper shipped separately and when I put it in the bottle, I had a completely full bottle with just enough space that it didn&#x27;t spill and stayed neat. That&#x27;s nice - so many products these days are giving way more packaging than product, and products look half empty when they come. This is a full ounce of product. Right now the price on this serum is very competitive with others I&#x27;ve tried. Most have been closer to $30. It seems like a very good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered the product at a significant discount (but not free) for purposes of unbiased review. After using it for a while, I can say that it&#x27;s a good hyaluronic acid serum and that I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> My review of the product is positive. The product itself is clear, light scented and a gel. You have to use very little per application. It gives my rather dry face much needed moisture and for a longer period than most things I have used. After a couple of weeks of use, my skin feels more tightened and some of the fine lines on my face are disappearing. I&#x27;m sure, as time goes on, I will continue to get positive results. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I did not receive an applicator and have to take the top off and pour it out or stick my finger in it to get some product to use.  This is wasteful and I am afraid I could contaminate the product.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product and it works. We checked out the ingredients and I love that they are natural. The product is easy to use and soaks right into the skin. There is no real odor, which is good for me because many beauty products with odor bother my allergies. It seems like the product takes awhile to do the job. But you have to remember, you spent your entire life getting wrinkles. This product takes a week or two to begin taking the wrinkles away. The product is reasonable and makes my wife&#x27;s skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than other serums and goes on smooth and rich. It leaves no after scent and my skin looks and feels healthier after using this serum. It&#x27;s my daytime serum and I use it with the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum and absolutely love how young and vibrant my skin looks while I have been using this serum.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Started seeing results almost immediately!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product until I received and used. This is actually diminishing my fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead. I&#x27;ve never done botox and will not. This also left my skin so soft. My skin is very sensitive and I had no problems with this product. I will use this forever!</li>
            <li> Great product especially combined with the Vitamin C!</li>
            <li> Visible difference  in the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It is the perfect addition to my beauty routine. This serum has helped reduce those fine lines that appear once you approach forty and leaves your skin glowing. I will definitely reorder more of serum! It makes me skin completely radiant and beautiful. After using this product, my skin actually glows, it is incredible.To my surprise- best product I&#x27;ve ever applied to my face. Biggest result I have seen is improvement in skin discoloration and that was just in a few days! My face was noticeably brighter. My skin tone was more even. Markings and redness had disappeared. They usually do, but this time they disappeared much quicker. My results continue to improve with use. My pores are smaller, my brown bumps are less obvious and my necks seems smoother. In fact, my entire face looks smoother. And the slight, clear, gel like material disappears in a minute or so on your skin. It looks and feels invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things to note: This company offers excellent customer service. It is always a bonus. They are also quick to answer questions posted about their product. If the reviews have turned you off, throw up any questions that you have and base your decision on responses directly from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you Day by day beauty for giving me exactly what you promised.I am a fan and customer for life!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AS ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR READING AND PEACE LOVE AND SUNSHINE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my HA!!! It is a product that really works,my skin is so much softer and the wrinkles around my eyes are vusubly reduced.I could not be happier,I have finally found a product that works!!! Thank you Day By Day!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this. Will keep buying for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT. I TRIED IT &amp; DIDN&#x27;T SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN. IT DIDN&#x27;T PRODUCE WHAT IT GUARANTEED. WISH I HAD RETURNED IT FOR MY MONEY BACK. IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE. I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Great product at a fraction of the expensive mall prices.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great for all types of skin, I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I rarely rave about skin products.  In fact, I  usually give up on them about 3 months in.  This serum, on the other hand, I never want to be without.  My skin is soft, and clear, and even my under eye circles seem lighter.  Bonus!</li>
            <li> I won my first bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum in a contest - nothing to lose, right?  I LOVE the product so much I&#x27;ve purchased my second bottle!&lt;br /&gt;My husband LOVES this product but he doesn&#x27;t know it.  He has been commenting on how good my skin looks!  Mind you in 45 years of marriage this is the first time he has consistently mentioned my skin!  Will I make future purchases of this product - ABSOLUTELY!!</li>
            <li> Good HA..worth the money! Love the vitamin C from this company too!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a short time but I do see results, I suffer from dark rings around my eyes and after using Day by Day Hyaluronic Acid Serum the rings seem to be diminishing quite a bit. I will keep using it to see if they get even lighter. I Haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that works as well in such a short time. I will update my review in a few weeks and let you know how well it is holding up.</li>
            <li> No instructions on how to use...weird!</li>
            <li> When you hear something with the word ACID in it of course you are kind of turned off. The word acid is just a little scary. Especially if it is something that is going to be going on your face. Now after trying this product I urge everyone else to not let the word &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; fool you. This product makes your skin look young again. If you GOOGLE Hyaluronic Acid, you will see phrases such as &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Perfectly Dewy Baby Skin.&amp;#34; This product helps to keep your skin plump, hydrated and young-looking. This product is not skin stripping or harsh at all. Hyaluronic Acid benefits all skin types. You can use this alone or under a moisturizer. I prefer to use it under my moisturizer because I have extremely dry skin. Of course this does not provide instant results but I have noticed that after using this for awhile that my skin is softer, more hydrated and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wash my face as normal. The I would use a toner. After my face was dry I would apply the hyaluronic acid serum and let dry. Two drops of the hyaluronic acid serum covered my whole face and neck. A little definitely goes a long way. The first time I used this product I also used a new moisturizer that I applied after the hyaluronic acid serum dried. My face looked really oily. My face felt really greasy in places throughout the entire day. I did not like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second day using this product I washed my face as normal, did not use a toner afterwards. I applied the hyaluronic acid serum and let it dry. I did not use a moisturizer afterwards either because I did not want to have a greasy face again all day. My face was extremely dry all day so obviously this way was not going to work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I washed my face as normal. I applied toner as normal and let dry. I then applied the serum, using just enough to cover my face and neck. I let dry and used my normal moisturizer not the new one. My face looked and felt good all day. I finally found a solution for this. I have continued to use this everyday and I can say my face has never looked or felt so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received is 1 fl oz. 98% Naturally Derived, 72% Organic and NOT tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like about this product is the smell. I felt like this product smelled like alcohol.lly found a solution for this.

I felt like this product smelled like alcohol.</li>
            <li> I love it. I can tell a big difference in my skin and the wrinkles. I am 62 and my face even looks tighter. Love this better than anything I have used. With the Vitamin C also.</li>
            <li> This is the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m thrilled with it. I like the thick gel substance and the mild fragrance. I can actually feel the serum and I can tell where I&#x27;m applying it. It doesn&#x27;t dissolve on contact so I actually feel like it is working. Immediately after dabbing it on my skin, I can feel a gentle tightening and firming. After just a few days, my skin looks healthier and more youthful. I love that it&#x27;s organic and paraben free too! This one will be part of my skin care regimen for certain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with the Vitamin C Serum and have had remarkable results in only week. I did NOT expect to see much difference. I will be a regular customer for sure! (See full review on the Vitamin C Serum.)</li>
            <li> I ordered this since I was very interested in keeping the skin on my face healthy. I am getting older and while I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, I am starting to get some fine lines. I want to keep my skin as youthful as possible without surgical means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small bottle that will last a long time--a little goes a long way. I love how this feels on my skin--it just glides on when I apply it. I like that this contains both vitamins A &amp; C, which provide amazing benefits to the skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days since I received it and my skin does look healthier now than before. Once this bottle gets depleted, I will definitely need to order more to keep my skin looking its best as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> so far so good. I like the way it feels light and refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum. It is so silky and smooth, and instantly made my skin feel moisturized. It absorbed quickly, which I really liked, and when combined with my daily moisturizer, it made my skin feel wonderful. I have only been using it a short time, but I am already noticing the results. My skin is smoother, and more vibrant. Even my husband mentioned how beautiful my skin looked! I will continue to use this daily, and will update my review as more time passes! *I was given this product for free, for review purposes*</li>
            <li> I was excited to review Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid, mostly because I found their Vitamin C Serum to be a great product. I knew that these two serums could work together in combination to produce even more beautiful skin. Although I have been using Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, along with other assorted facial products that are part of my daily regimen, I have not yet completely cleared the tiny patches of acne that I tend to get on my cheeks and chin. As I have stated before, I have combination skin (oily sometimes, dry at others), so it is hard to get the perfect conditions to relieve all blemishes. Since I had success with LESS acne and softer skin using the Vitamin C Serum, I wanted to see if I could take it to the next level with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I feel like my skin will never be perfect -- there is always room for improvement, and also preventative care against the sun and allergens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that the Hyaluronic Acid Serum is neither too thick nor too thin, and spreads easily across my face and neck. It absorbs a little faster than I would like (before I can get it everywhere that I want it), but I guess that means it is doing its job. It is not irritating to my sensitive skin at all, and I really don&#x27;t detect any fragrance, which I prefer. At first, it left me feeling kind of dried out, and I&#x27;m not sure if that was just because I was hitting my skin with several different products in one day, but eventually it softened off. I like that the Hyaluronic Acid is not oily and does not leave residue on my skin. I can easily apply makeup over it. I have noticed another slight reduction in the amount of blemishes that I am getting, and a softer, less rough feeling to my skin overall. I like the combination of the Vitamin C Serum and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum together. I feel like my skin is coming a long way!</li>
            <li> This product smoothed my skin even though it felt a little bit greasy on my face and neck. My skin looked healthier after using it. The bottle says to use it with Day By Day&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for optimal results. At times I used both products together, although I liked using it without the Vitamin C Serum better. I often put make-up on afterwards when using both products and it felt like I had more products on my skin (which I did). At one point I noticed my skin peeling, but I think that was a day I had this Hyaluronic Acid, the Vitamin C Serum, SPF moisturizer, and a few make-up products on. So, I am planning on using this Hyaluronic Acid product on days when I do not plan on putting any or many other products on my face.    I received this product free of charge for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Here are my pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Feels good when you apply.&lt;br /&gt;  Makes your face feel tighter as it dries!&lt;br /&gt;  Risk-free. Results or your money back.&lt;br /&gt;  No negative skin reactions- break outs.. etc.&lt;br /&gt;  The company genuinely seems to care about that their buyers think!&lt;br /&gt;  Thicker consistency than other serums I&#x27;ve tried, meaning less falls off your fingers and is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;  A little goes a long way! Even after using the product for weeks, I still have a good amount left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t feel like it has any long term effects. I stopped using this product for a week-ish and saw any SMALL changes I&#x27;d noticed in my fine lines go back to where they were. I realize it&#x27;s nto a cure-all but....&lt;br /&gt;  The price seems high to me for something that only offers temporary effects (for-me).  Even knowing this product, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to spend the money on it for the rest of my life just to help the lines...&lt;br /&gt;  I do wish it smelled a little better.. it smells a little.. sterile?&lt;br /&gt;  Comparable to other HA serums I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product. I have tried other HA serums and it seems it&#x27;s pretty comparable to them in price and product, but the company&#x27;s values make it worth a little more I think!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Wonderful moisturizing qualities!  I think it will be a viable winter option as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exceptional service with follow-up inquiry from the company owners - really nice to see such a personal touch and ability to provide feedback.</li>
            <li> I positively LOVED the Vitamin C serum so I was very excited to try this new product.  It did not let me down.  I had milia on my face - little flesh colored bumps.  They are almost completely gone since using this product.  Can&#x27;t wait for more of their products to come out.  I am a Day By Day believer!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference the frist week I used it.  It does tighten the skin and make it look smoother.  I am going to continue to use.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference in skin.  Used for 3 consecutive weeks.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I always am unsure when I try a new beauty product as far as how quickly I may see results from it. After just a few times of applying this Vitamin C Serum, I was amazed at how less noticeable my fine lines and wrinkles were. I really noticed an improvement after a week of using the product and loved that it was gentle on my skin and had a pleasant fragrance that was not too overpowering. The serum did not leave any greasy residue behind and easily absorbed into your skin. I was so pleased with the fact that after using the product, I could go out of the house wearing less makeup and still look and feel more confident!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out and applied some on my facial skin to see how it felt. It absorbed instantly and my skin felt smooth immediately! There was no bad after effects or stickiness to it at all which I really liked also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using the Day by Day Hyaluronic Acid I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels firmer and even plumper. I really love the results from using this product! With continued use I hope to minimize the appearance of some of my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for review purposes. Everything contained in my reviews are my sole opinions.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is super smooth with no flaws that I could find and no scent. When I put the serum on my face it rapidly absorbed into the skin, this could be because of the lack of moisture. I did find that today the serum did not absorb rapidly, which is the first time. I have to contribute this to the humidity in the air. It is very humid here today. Hyaluronic acid will adjust its absorption rate, due to these factors such as humidity and environment. This is another reason why I really like hyaluronic acid products, such as Day By Day Hyaluronic Serum. Because of its properties it will take into consideration the environment around you. I know for me at least my skin is never the same day-to-day. It is always changing and I feel that this product is great because it will change with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major benefit to this particular serum is the ingredients. It is so nice to be able to read through the ingredients and be able to understand what you are putting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this serum was a dream when it comes to my skin tone. Everything just seemed to even out. There were no more of those dark spots. They have toned down so much since beginning this routine. I have been using this product with an under eye serum that I just finished reviewing, and by far this is the product that stands out in my mind. I did notice other results, but I wanted to let you all know, what I really found different with this product. I did notice a drastic reduction in my pores as well, along with a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that is trying to even out their skin tone, reduce pore size, hydrate skin and reduce fine lines. I can&#x27;t say much when it comes to the fine lines and wrinkles. I have been blessed thus far, not to have any that are bothersome, but with the results that I have seen with this product, I can really see how it would help with those bothersome lines.me lines.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week, I use it in conjunction with the Day By Day Vitamin C serum, which I&#x27;ve loved for a while now! When you put this on your skin your face immediately feels tighter, which is a good thing. I use a moisturizer (an argan oil) after this absorbs into my skin...I just love this SO much, my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> I have been trying different serums to combat signs of aging. I gave this product a try because of its all natural ingredients. This product has a gel-like consistency and it absorbs well into my oily combination dehydrated skin. I use it after washing and toning my face and before applying moisturizer. It has a temporarily tingling feeling on the skin, which makes me think something is working. After using twice daily for a week, I noticed less fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t cause any breakout either. I also like the pump for easy dispensing, but sometimes it squirts out too forcefully and gets onto the counter, so I aim it on my palm instead of on my finger tips to avoid wasting the product.</li>
            <li> Love it, after use the skin becomes very smooth)</li>
