            <li>This is a great buy!</li>
            <li>This one is perfect!</li>
            <li>Its great!</li>
            <li>Perfect size</li>
            <li>Want to buy more!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so very pleased by the product!</li>
            <li>Works great for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>Great for me.</li>
            <li>Nice absorbent light-weight towel!</li>
            <li>I had another Aquis Towel and loved it,</li>
            <li>This towel performed surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>I love the shade of this &amp;#34;sweet pink&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>This is not the kind of towel one would want to use for anything but hair.</li>
            <li>I made my own \\&quot;towel\\&quot; out of t-shirt material, and it works a lot better than this.  </li>
            <li>Soft, cushy, nice to use.</li>
            <li>So okay,</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would absorb more water than the \\&quot;Turbie</li>
            <li>She is equally pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>When I use it on my hair, it is more frizzy etc.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I went ahead and bought 2.</li>
            <li>Just okay - not the dream towel I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better microfiber towels for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this product I was so excited to receive it in the mail!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size to dry my hair and for me to wrap it around my head so I can move around</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also HUGE.</li>
            <li>I bought one for my sister who has a huge head of hair.</li>
            <li>It worked great for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>super quick.</li>
            <li>It soaks of water from hair and dries quickly afterward when I hang it over the side of the tub.</li>
            <li>The towel is nicely sized, soaks in water easily and quickly and the colour pink is very uplifting :) Recommend</li>
            <li>This works really good to dry your hair when coming out of the shower or just when you don&#x27;t feel like styling it.</li>
            <li>First of all, it dries my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs sooooo much water!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different ones, but this is so much better, and nicer looking if you end up having to leave it on your head (as a turban) than trying to use the wraps</li>
            <li>Could be better if it was just a bit longer, falls off of your head if you don&#x27;t twist it properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that it really is better in comparison to regular towels in terms of pulling and tearing at the hair.</li>
            <li>I will be buying several for gifts for Christmas for sure.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I got the new one that I realized how much better it worked than my old one.</li>
            <li>If you have straight hair, I think this towel would work well, but curly hair is a different story :)</li>
            <li>This towel has been great and has worked the exact same as my other aquis microfiber hair towel.</li>
            <li>Very light and efficient, keeps my hair up and dry while I applying lotion and make up after shower every time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect size for the little one and it does dry her dry very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I used to use just a T shirt to dry my hair, but so glad I switched over to this towel.</li>
            <li>This microfiber towel is soft, absorbant, and quick drying.  </li>
            <li>Okay, this may bother some folks, but this towel is used to dry my Toy Poodle.  </li>
            <li>This towel is perfect for wrapping my hair up but, it does not encompass miraculous drying power like other hair towels and hair turbans I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Really reduces drying time.</li>
            <li>I might try washing it with loads of detergent, but my boyfriend has a point when he asks if I really want to wrap my head with a towel drenched in chemicals.</li>
            <li>Really pulls water from hair without the frizz.</li>
            <li>I really like these towels.</li>
            <li>I love the pink color!</li>
            <li>Nice size to dry dogs when it&#x27;s raining outside</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other Aquis microfiber towels and countless other brands and types, but this is by far THE BEST hair towel out there.  </li>
            <li>This light weight towel makes it easier to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>It absorbs way more than my old t-shirt that I was using and although these towels aren&#x27;t large perse, it does do the job of at least absorbing a lot of water.</li>
            <li>Was trying something new after years of using microfiber...</li>
            <li>I needed a new hair towel, that I could wrap around and tuck.</li>
            <li>were looking a little worn, although they still work fine.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough to wrap and tuck around my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of a soft, microfiber fabric.</li>
            <li>&quot; nicely, helping me blow dry what little water is left on her body.  </li>
            <li>It really does dry your hair faster!</li>
            <li>My hair was almost dry much sooner than usual ,it remained frizz free for the rest of the day and the size is enough for my long hair!!!I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a way to avoid the blow-dryer/difuser.</li>
            <li>I bought the white one first, then a pink.</li>
            <li>This towel took my super curly locks from soaking wet to nearly dry in ten minutes - it just sat on my head while I did my make-up and got dressed.  </li>
            <li>I have very heavy, thick hair that usually takes hours to dry, but this attractive-looking microfiber towel does an excellent job of shortening the job.</li>
            <li>I will never dry my hair with a regular bath towel again!</li>
            <li>The pink one is a little bit thicker than the white one, but both are super absorbant.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Most other microfiber hair towels I&#x27;ve tried are really thin and soak through.</li>
            <li> Then when I read the other reviews I realized my old one stopped working because I put it in the dryer after washing it.</li>
            <li> Dries hair fast, not sure if it works on helping with split ends, but I like the towel.</li>
            <li> I did the same with this product and woke up with soaking wet hair several hours later.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it is pretty absorbent.</li>
            <li> You can wrap it turban-style or just towel dry your hair in the towel to reduce total blow drying time.</li>
            <li> These towels are a must for anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> When I step out of the shower, I pop it over my hair and twist it into a turban (it&#x27;s big enough) and it cuts drying time way down.</li>
            <li> Dryer\\&quot; would be any different from the other microfiber hair towels.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it helps my hair get dry quicker</li>
            <li> When you touch it (and any microfiber towel for that matter), it feels like your skin is very, very dry because it catches on every fiber.</li>
            <li> It would help if it were a little bit wider, but this size seems to be the standard.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink towel</li>
            <li> I typically can wear a hair turban to bed and wake up with dry and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I like the towel and for me it has reduced my diffuser time down.</li>
            <li> I bought this after advice from a curly hair forum, in that it speeds drying and therefore cuts down on frizz.</li>
            <li> Plus the Turbie&#x27;s are like half the price.</li>
            <li> This towel is pretty much useless for the purpose it claims: it will not hold your hair in a towel turban, and it can&#x27;t be used for flopping whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Now i want to buy it in other colours as well!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this towel on my hair for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had for a few years</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not live up to previous drying towels I have used.</li>
            <li> and I wholeheartedly agree with a previous reviewer about how bad the towel smells when you open the package.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the previous reviewers meant by the so-called \\&quot;bad smell\\&quot;, but my towel smelled like, well, a towel!</li>
            <li> or they make them for very small heads!!</li>
            <li> I will agree it does seem to speed drying time for hair when it&#x27;s wrapped in this, but it feels terrible against the skin.</li>

            <li> Not sure what the previous reviewers meant by the so-called \\&quot;bad smell\\&quot;, but my towel smelled like, well, a towel! It absorbs way more than my old t-shirt that I was using and although these towels aren&#x27;t large perse, it does do the job of at least absorbing a lot of water. Being a curly girl, this towel is just what I needed. So okay, yeah you can get a \\&quot;sham-wow\\&quot; towel for about the same price at your local Wal-Mart or CVS, but why? Why use something that&#x27;s not meant for your hair? I&#x27;m just a bit biased. I like the towel and for me it has reduced my diffuser time down. I say, try for yourslf and see!</li>
            <li> She loves it. Really reduces drying time.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would absorb more water than the \\&quot;Turbie Twist\\&quot; I already have.....nope. Plus the Turbie&#x27;s are like half the price.</li>
            <li> What sets this one apart is the thickness. Most other microfiber hair towels I&#x27;ve tried are really thin and soak through. It&#x27;s also HUGE. Blows away a regular towel!</li>
            <li> This is a great towel for all you curly girls! I used to use just a T shirt to dry my hair, but so glad I switched over to this towel. It absorbs sooooo much water! And it does NOT frizz my hair! I love the pink color! I wish they made one big enough for the body. This is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink towel and I wholeheartedly agree with a previous reviewer about how bad the towel smells when you open the package. It&#x27;s truly unbearable. I even tried airing out the towel by leaving it on the couch for a day. Didn&#x27;t work. I might try washing it with loads of detergent, but my boyfriend has a point when he asks if I really want to wrap my head with a towel drenched in chemicals. I might try to return it.</li>
            <li> Nice size to dry dogs when it&#x27;s raining outside</li>
            <li> These towels are a must for anyone with long hair. I cut my hair drying time from 15 minutes to 5 when I use these towels. The pink one is a little bit thicker than the white one, but both are super absorbant.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying this hair towel because I didn&#x27;t know if \\&quot;Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer\\&quot; would be any different from the other microfiber hair towels. This towel has been great and has worked the exact same as my other aquis microfiber hair towel.</li>
            <li> This towel does not absorb water...even after washing.  Was trying something new after years of using microfiber...lesson learned!</li>
            <li> This microfiber towel is soft, absorbant, and quick drying.  It is not bulky to carry.  I took it along when I traveled overseas.  It worked great for my long hair.  It was so practical that I purchased this one for a friend who is a traveler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other Aquis microfiber towels and countless other brands and types, but this is by far THE BEST hair towel out there.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to dry my hair and for me to wrap it around my head so I can move around and it dries my hair super quick. I loved it so much I ordered a bunch extra for myself and all the ladies in my family for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Works great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> This towel is pretty much useless for the purpose it claims: it will not hold your hair in a towel turban, and it can&#x27;t be used for flopping whatsoever! I would have asked for a refund if I hadn&#x27;t thrown away the package.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it helps my hair get dry quicker but it does help reducing hair puffiness.</li>
            <li> This towel took my super curly locks from soaking wet to nearly dry in ten minutes - it just sat on my head while I did my make-up and got dressed.  I had another Aquis Towel and loved it, thought I would get another color to switch out. It wasn&#x27;t until I got the new one that I realized how much better it worked than my old one. Then when I read the other reviews I realized my old one stopped working because I put it in the dryer after washing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different ones, but this is so much better, and nicer looking if you end up having to leave it on your head (as a turban) than trying to use the wraps that have you twist your hair up with the towel and use a loop and button. My friends and I have \\&quot;one of those\\&quot; and all of our heads are too big, I guess!\\&quot;.. or they make them for very small heads!! This one is perfect! Please come out with a VARIETY OF COLORS! Want to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product I was so excited to receive it in the mail! Unfortunately, it did not live up to previous drying towels I have used. This towel is perfect for wrapping my hair up but, it does not encompass miraculous drying power like other hair towels and hair turbans I have used in the past. I typically can wear a hair turban to bed and wake up with dry and wavy hair. I did the same with this product and woke up with soaking wet hair several hours later. I would not purchase this hair towel again but will continue to use to wrap my hair following a shower while putting on make-up.</li>
            <li> This works really good to dry your hair when coming out of the shower or just when you don&#x27;t feel like styling it.</li>
            <li> The towel is nicely sized, soaks in water easily and quickly and the colour pink is very uplifting :) Recommend</li>
            <li> I wanted a microfiber towel for my waist length wavy har which tends to get frizzy often.....This towel performed surprisingly well.My hair was almost dry much sooner than usual ,it remained frizz free for the rest of the day and the size is enough for my long hair!!!I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a way to avoid the blow-dryer/difuser.Now i want to buy it in other colours as well!!</li>
            <li> Dries hair fast, not sure if it works on helping with split ends, but I like the towel.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Really pulls water from hair without the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have arthritic hands. This light weight towel makes it easier to dry my hair. I recommend Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer Towel.</li>
            <li> Very light and efficient, keeps my hair up and dry while I applying lotion and make up after shower every time. I bought the white one first, then a pink. I love the shade of this &amp;#34;sweet pink&amp;#34;! And next time the hotel room service won&#x27;t take my towel &amp;#34;by accident&amp;#34; again as I always brought a white hair towel on my trips.</li>
            <li> Could be better if it was just a bit longer, falls off of your head if you don&#x27;t twist it properly. But it does absorb well.</li>
            <li> I like this hair towel. It&#x27;s made of a soft, microfiber fabric. I have thick hair and it is pretty absorbent. You can wrap it turban-style or just towel dry your hair in the towel to reduce total blow drying time. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Okay, this may bother some folks, but this towel is used to dry my Toy Poodle.  It&#x27;s a perfect size for the little one and it does dry her dry very quickly.  It fluffs her poodle \\&quot;do\\&quot; nicely, helping me blow dry what little water is left on her body.  I&#x27;m so very pleased by the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this towel on my hair for a few weeks now and I see a big difference. First of all, it dries my hair so quickly. I can&#x27;t believe how well it absorbs the water. I feel like using this for a couple weeks has also made my hair softer. I&#x27;m guessing that it really is better in comparison to regular towels in terms of pulling and tearing at the hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a regular towel on my hair in years!  Just purchased another one since the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had for a few years were looking a little worn, although they still work fine.  Nice absorbent light-weight towel!</li>
            <li> I bought this after advice from a curly hair forum, in that it speeds drying and therefore cuts down on frizz. I will agree it does seem to speed drying time for hair when it&#x27;s wrapped in this, but it feels terrible against the skin. This is not the kind of towel one would want to use for anything but hair. When you touch it (and any microfiber towel for that matter), it feels like your skin is very, very dry because it catches on every fiber. It soaks of water from hair and dries quickly afterward when I hang it over the side of the tub. It would help if it were a little bit wider, but this size seems to be the standard.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this towel is a must for me.  It has cut my drying time to practically nothing.  It is large enough to wrap and tuck around my shoulder length hair.  Great price too. I bought one for my sister who has a huge head of hair. She is equally pleased with it.  I will be buying several for gifts for Christmas for sure.</li>
            <li> The fibers of this towel don&#x27;t agree with my skin or my hair.  When I use it on my hair, it is more frizzy etc.  I made my own \\&quot;towel\\&quot; out of t-shirt material, and it works a lot better than this.  If you have straight hair, I think this towel would work well, but curly hair is a different story :)</li>
            <li> I really like these towels. I heard a lot about microtones towels and started to only purchase one. I am glad I went ahead and bought 2. I will never dry my hair with a regular bath towel again!</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair towel, that I could wrap around and tuck. This is not a turbo, and i did not want a turbo. Great for me. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It really does dry your hair faster! Its great!</li>
            <li> Just okay - not the dream towel I was hoping for. I&#x27;ve had better microfiber towels for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Wife loves these.  Perfect size and does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy, thick hair that usually takes hours to dry, but this attractive-looking microfiber towel does an excellent job of shortening the job. When I step out of the shower, I pop it over my hair and twist it into a turban (it&#x27;s big enough) and it cuts drying time way down. Soft, cushy, nice to use.</li>
