    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent products.  </li>
            <li>I believe anyone can use it, you just have to figure out how it works best for you.</li>
            <li>Goes great with a hood dryer too!</li>
            <li>which is great!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works the best for me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it on my scalp, and that was the best idea ever.</li>
            <li>my scalp feels great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had curls before, but using this product I&#x27;ve gotten the best definition I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>this is the perfect styling gel to use for either look.</li>
            <li>and Im very happy</li>
            <li>For instance, if you are using a shampoo or conditioner with &#x27;cones or sulfates, you will not get the best results.  </li>
            <li>I brush thru with a denman brush to get the best distribution throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>Here is a checklist to get te best results.</li>
            <li>but this is perfect.</li>
            <li>The results are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have a mixture of 3c/3b curls in my hair and this works wonderful.</li>
            <li>My results are awesome.  </li>
            <li>Both products made my hair smell very good.</li>
            <li>Great product if you find how it works best for your hair type.</li>
            <li>say that she loved it!</li>
            <li>My hair still look great</li>
            <li>This method leaves my twists shiny and gives them great hang.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I tried this product on a weekend rather than a day I had to go to work, because then I would have been SOL.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair curly and moisturized, and the shine is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, after Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner, this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried on my hair.</li>
            <li>I use this gel in the morning after a shower, and it holds all day, which is great...</li>
            <li>Deva curl and Ouidad are GREAT for washing ..co-washing and conditioning</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>but once it dries, it gives great hold with shine.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>What a winning combination!!</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed was that this does elongate and stretch curls very nicely and helps keep hair detangled.  </li>
            <li>It provides great stretch, great curl definition, and my hair looks good day to day</li>
            <li>The product was amazing on my hair!</li>
            <li>I still use it because it smells great and can be a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>The thing my hair craves most is moisture and the curling souffle provides the perfect amount for me.</li>
            <li>have 4 b/c hair and had just about given up on having a successful twistout.</li>
            <li>Loving this!</li>
            <li>On the bright side.</li>
            <li>and I was good to go.  </li>
            <li>and I still continue to have good results.</li>
            <li>It adds beautiful shine and hold to the 3c/4a/4b types of hair in my family, and defines our curls much better than KCCC.  </li>
            <li>They need to tweak this because it did NOT make my hair feel great, and the curl definition was just okay.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I am very pleased with Shea Moisture&#x27;s curling souffle.</li>
            <li>If there was a 4z, I am sure THAT would be my hair, LOL.</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t look at the reviews BEFORE I bought it, cause I wouldn&#x27;t have touched it!</li>
            <li>Love my Shea Moisture products!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it is way better  moisturizing and also is cheaper!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>to say I love this product and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE RESULTS!</li>
            <li>I can now do wash n go&#x27;s and it looks better than when I took time to twist it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and I was able to get coupons!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>but I like this product better!</li>
            <li>We love this product and 100% recommend to others!</li>
            <li>The outcome was fantastic!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>get amazing and well-moisturized afro results now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>but i do not recommend make your own flax gel recipe</li>
            <li>Kind of like Kinky Curly Curling Custard (KCCC).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried KCCC and I really liked it</li>
            <li>I have cheaper products that moisturize and style my hair on their own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to be a hair chemist to make my hair look nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell really nice as all Shea Moisture products do.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a sticky residue on anything in touches which I&#x27;m not too thrilled about.</li>
            <li>I had used the Shea Moisture SHAMPOO for curly hair and it worked nicely..</li>
            <li>I love that this product has good ingredients</li>
            <li>It felt sticky and tacky, and it just kind of sat on my hair.</li>
            <li>And with seborrhic dermatitis in and on my scalp the benefits of these and this product are nice.</li>
            <li>I have 2b-3a fine dense high porosity hair, I use this a sealer before mousse and gel, it works great for clumping and curl retention and gives incredible shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>HUGE FAN!</li>
            <li>This product is a staple for my bantu knot outs and twist outs because I love the hold, shine, and moisture is gives my fro.</li>
            <li>she commented on how healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>, so I was hoping the souffle would be just as outstanding...</li>
            <li>This product managed to maintain the \\&quot;hang\\&quot; of my hair more than 12 hours after applying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure a lot of you curly ladies know that products get discontinued at a rapid pace</li>
            <li>For starters, it is much more oily and a bit looser than KCCC.  </li>
            <li>There are too many products out there for me to try.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product once now, but I can already say I am in love with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I spray my hair with water and conditioner and then apply some more gel or mousse, well with this</li>
            <li>but it was ok since it makes me look well styled at work but</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of combinations of products on my 3B/C hair, and nothing works better than than the combination of this gel souffle and the SM Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li>Adds more shine than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, but leaves the hair feeling sticky and straw-like.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the product.</li>
            <li>Just ordered 2 more jars just in case.</li>
            <li>I love this product and very happy that I was able to replace the only thing that worked which had cones in it.  </li>
            <li>I really love it, and my hair hates almost everything.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying that I love all Shae Moisture products.</li>
            <li>But as the week progressed my hair just kept getting better and the stickiness wore off  for the most part.</li>
            <li>I would love to give this product 5 stars</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li>I would love to try the liquid form and see how that varies.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the liquid form is much better</li>
            <li>Now I am 10 months in and have learned more about my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am using this on top of my homemade Shea butter mixture that I found on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>More</li>
            <li>Retwisting tonight with a bit more gel</li>
            <li>Gels like eco-gel were drying and have way too many chemicals that strip color..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the smoothie, too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I find their products work so much better together.  </li>
            <li>Which means more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>You just have to know how to apply it :)</li>
            <li>I purchased this at Walmart, with the intention of making my curls more defined.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than the eco-styler I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it looks like a may have gotten a curl!:)</li>
            <li>anyhow, this works way better than eco styler.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love all of shea moisture products, so I was eager to try this one.  </li>
            <li>but I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then did a 70% SheaMoisture Curling Smoothie/30% Gel Soufflé mix and that was pretty good for the cooler Autumn/Winter months where I live.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a winning combination, and I hope these two products will always be available.</li>
            <li>Also applying to wet hair seems to work best for my family.  </li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive scalp that&#x27;s easily irritated, you&#x27;ll have to find something to keep it happy.</li>
            <li>Pros: smells wonderful, gives awesome shine, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Might be good for looser curls, but not so great for tightly coiled hair (I have</li>
            <li>I have elbow-length, ultra-dry, 4C hair, zero visible curl pattern, tangles extraordinarily easily, must be kept in protective styles to be manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair tangles very quickly</li>
            <li>I have 4a/4b hair and this does just fine for my twists and twistouts.  </li>
            <li>So I will probably buy it again especially if my next effort is more successful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li>The one positive I can think of it is it has a really nice smell.</li>
            <li>This is a great gel and its available in duane reade, also its only 11.99 there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Shea Moisture products but this Curling Souffle is just not where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li>This was just a huge pain for me.  </li>
            <li>I was making a huge mistake</li>
            <li>I cant say enough about SM---its great</li>
            <li>my curls looked great and shiny and bouncy that morning but by the end of the day they shrunk and was starting to revert to my curl pattern.</li>
            <li>I used lightly</li>
            <li>This gel works great in conjunction with steaming your hair in the shower for ultimate moisture as well.</li>
            <li>I place a finger in it and the product is so light it almost feels like no product is on my hand, but it is.</li>
            <li>the curls came out smooth and defined...</li>
            <li>this product is fantastic...</li>
            <li>use a light leave in conditioner 3)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter but it does the job just as well as eco, and you can actually eat this lol.</li>
            <li>We use after washing/conditioning and after lightly spritzing with water for morning touch ups to our styles.  </li>
            <li>the best curl definition and moisture boost (I only wash weekly)&lt;br /&gt;You could try using just one of the products instead of two, but for my hair they work very well together.</li>
            <li>The result is a beautifully defined twist out if your hair is completely dry.  </li>
            <li>First I apply the Shea Coconut Hibiscus Styling Milk and then a very light application of the souffle.  </li>
            <li>I want something that is quick and easy, and this is not it.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s so great about the souffle is that less is more.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m sooo excited about this product.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>First  of all like most reviewers say this product is way too slimy,  greasy &amp; leaves a sticky film on your hands when it dries  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair with come clean.</li>
            <li>1) use it on clean hair 2)</li>
            <li>/in 1-2 hours), I have about 20 large cute chunky S and Z shapes all over, so</li>
            <li>The ingredients are very high quality, but this product is clearly better suited to those with type 3 curls.</li>
            <li>It has really great ingredients and of course, I&#x27;d already spent the money.</li>
            <li>After rinsing the dc with cool water I detangled with kimmaytube leave in and used this Shea Moisture Souffle to bantu knot my hair.</li>
            <li>After I did a conditioner washed, I applied a fairly generous amount combed my hair back into a ponytail and tied a scarf around my hair.  </li>
            <li>I try all kind of products for natural curly hair all the time</li>
            <li>I finally found a good use for this.</li>
            <li>I must say that I have really fallen in love with the Shea Moisture line.</li>
            <li>so I was cool with that</li>
            <li>It really helped with stretch and gave my &#x27;fro more definition and character.</li>
            <li>My hair kept the curls all day without much frizz (I will put more towards the roots</li>
            <li>I have decided to use this product as more of a finishing gel to refresh and for shine, which it does very well.</li>
            <li>but I love this line so much</li>
            <li>I adore this stuff and dont have any problems with it, only stating facts that Im sure will come up or already have &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li>I have brown super curly corkscrew hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to deal with these things for the sake of the great results, but if you&#x27;re looking for a light product that won&#x27;t weigh your hair down, this might not be it.</li>
            <li>We range from wavy/straight to kinky/kinky and the results are always long lasting and superb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this product I was WAY too heavy-handed!</li>
            <li>They make a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light-handed with all of my products and don&#x27;t like anything heavy in my hair at all, so this is a great product for me.</li>
            <li>Also, this stuff is a bit messy lol.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice smell and will definitely last for awhile.  </li>
            <li>I use it to set my twists  but make sure apply a butter over it to keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li>For now I will keep looking for the best product to stretch curls but not be sticky and unappealing to the touch.</li>
            <li>love that this line is 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;ve been natural since birth, so no doubt I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products.</li>
            <li>I put this on freshly washed hair, and then sat under the hood dryer.</li>
            <li>Since I became natural, I can&#x27;t tell you how many products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The twists held well and then on day four I took the twists out for a twist out and let&#x27;s just say this helped me fall deeper in love with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>To keep it fresh, I add a chunk of it to a spray bottle, with water, and I used this on my twists.</li>
            <li>Also, I liked Shea Moisture&#x27;s page on Facebook (sometime last year)</li>
            <li>I wore flat twists in the front and used the curling souffle like a gel to make sure my twists stayed smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>First, I made four large sections in my hair, lightly misted with water so my hair was just damp</li>
            <li>hope this review could help you to decide if this product will be right for you.  </li>
            <li>The trick is the right mix and right amount of product.  </li>
            <li>This method keeps my hair MOISTURIZEd and when I&#x27;m lazy I can get 2 weeks out of it and it still looks great, but by that time it&#x27;s time for a wash.</li>
            <li>Ok, so by reading the reviews here and talking to friends in person, this is a product that if you love it (and more importantly, if your HAIR loves it), you really LOVE it, but if you hate it...</li>
            <li>This defines very very well.  </li>
            <li>And its true--a little does go a long way, which is excellent for the price.</li>
            <li>Buy this product if you deal with curly hair issues on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;I am officially a HUGE fan!</li>
            <li>My hair feels exactly like I want it to....</li>
            <li>I recently used this product on a bantu knot out and it turned out fabulous!</li>
            <li>This was consistent with the reviews I&#x27;d read, but I thought, why not use it as a moisturizer instead of a gel.</li>
            <li>but I love this product and it will be a staple for my curly fro&#x27;s now and in the future</li>
            <li>(or at least until something else great comes</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I was expecting it to be like a gel of some sort.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried the product, I washed, conditioned, and towel-dried my hair.</li>
            <li>The cashier actually tried to discourage me from buying it stating many naturals did not like it.</li>
            <li>I have mostly 4b/c hair with 4a in the back and this product gives me a defined moisturized twist out all the time.  </li>
            <li>I use it pretty liberally (package recommends using sparingly)</li>
            <li>This was hairstylist and my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the pink label Shea Moisture Products.  </li>
            <li>My curls a shiny, frizz free, soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>Do not use too much!</li>
            <li>I have been able to get 4-5 day hair from this with the occasional frizzies but this blows eco-styler out of the water.</li>
            <li>I first bought the SM Curl Souffle then the Curl Smoothie.</li>
            <li>More recently I discovered that I was a 4C curl type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty yummy.</li>
            <li>First &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I get soft curls, no frizz, and a good amount of non-crunchy hold if I scrunch again after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>My curls look just as good on the third and fourth day as they did on the first.</li>
            <li>This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>This time, however, because I had the SM curling souffle underneath it, my hair, after it dried, was soft without being sticky or tacky, but had really great hold.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will, and when I wash it out in the morning, my hair feels soft and is still super curly.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, this stuff smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>My first time using the souffle I used way too much</li>
            <li>I wash my hair with sheamoisture (skip the restorative conditioner I used to use, made my hair dry) and then add this on top.</li>
            <li>Most gels leave my hair dry as straw</li>
            <li>; that leaves my hair still feeling like hair; great curl and hold for my finger coils and flat twists; i have used both wet and dry/misted; i have several textures ranging from very kinky to fine.</li>
            <li>I part off a section, make sure my hair is thoroughly wet, apply a good amount of the souffle, comb it through with my wide-tooth comb, and then twist into small sections.</li>
            <li>Nice tight defined curls.</li>
            <li>There was definitely a learning curve using this product on my fine, kinky hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is much stronger.</li>
            <li>I have very dense 4c hair.</li>
            <li>But I might need to use something else as my hair gets longer because it coats the hair rather than absorbing into it, and I&#x27;d be worried about breakouts.</li>
            <li>Using way too much.</li>
            <li>Very oily</li>
            <li>I really like this gel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really sticky and goopy, so now I just rub my fingers on the surface of the gel rather than scooping it up.</li>
            <li>I am usually very hesitate to give a product 5 stars</li>
            <li>consistency is gritty/oily/runny, very sticky on hands and after hair has been set with it.</li>
            <li>With this product, it was harder to gather in your hands and much more slippery.  </li>
            <li>This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li>really make reviews often,</li>
            <li>but I really needed to talk about this.  </li>
            <li>agave nectar really attracted the moisture in the air, the flaxseed gave me a bit of shine and hold, and the shea butter really conditioned and moisturized my hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally I really just separate my hair with my fingers and apply soufflé all over then shake.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li>wish I had known about this sooner, before using so much crappy hairspray.</li>
            <li>OR THERE WILL BE A HIGH LEVEL OF STICKINESS!</li>
            <li>It does what KC does but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I tried using it for kinky twist, and it worked really well for that.</li>
            <li>and it really minimized my frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Needless</li>
            <li>One day I was braiding my hair and thought why not use it as a moisturizer and it worked very well...</li>
            <li>I really think SheaMoisture needs to start marketing this product as a moisturizer and not a styling gel...</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t notice the product in it until I&#x27;m trying to get ready for bed, but it will make itself known during the day if you touch your hair</li>
            <li>I no longer use terry and avoid microfiber even, because my hair is very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>It feels very oily and it the consistency is  like jello.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really give the desired effect</li>
            <li>I apply it to each section of my hair then gently comb it through.</li>
            <li>no sulfates..and REAL oils..</li>
            <li>then used the diffuser as i untwisted gently...</li>
            <li>and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Its also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>A lot off people complain about the stickiness or crunchiness and its probably because they applied too much product.</li>
            <li>use very sparingly...</li>
            <li>I thought since I was doing a twistout, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt too much.</li>
            <li>I suspect you are using way too much.</li>
            <li>(my hair will not tolerate straight grease-it just sits on my scalp and hair and doesn&#x27;t moisturize.)</li>
            <li>but when I applied this product, my hair felt really moisturized.</li>
            <li>I had a really defined twist out that stayed moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>I repeated the process the next night and got the same great results the next day.</li>
            <li>I co-wash, use leave-in and use a coat (not too much) of Curling Gel Souffle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased I&#x27;ve finally found natural products that work, and as a bonus they smell heavenly too.</li>
            <li>It also rinses off your hands very nicely, which means I can look forward to little or no product being left in my hair.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I have pretty decent second and even third day hair.</li>
            <li>But when I finally took my hair down it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li>live in a very humid place and my hair tends to get very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Users suggest going lightly on the product because it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have medium fine hair dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Cremes, oddly enough, do not completely absorb into my hair in these hot months and seem to just sit on top of and coat my hair.</li>
            <li>First let me say, this product is no where near $31 at Target or Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Will come back with full results and review.  </li>
            <li>I repeat a very LIGHT application of the souffle so that your hair won&#x27;t be a sticky mess.  </li>
            <li>and I was sure to wear a satin bonnet whenever I laid down because my hair was so juicy.</li>
            <li>night i use just a little of the smoothie on its own to keep my hair soft overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Smoothie and the Styling Milk previously and they were just okay.  </li>
            <li>But when I used this product with my curl former set, (weather was about 70-75 very low humidity and mostly sunny)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet tried it on a wash-n-go and probably won&#x27;t as it will probably not have any effect on my particularly porous hair texture.  </li>
            <li>It was highly moisturized, glossy and defined...</li>
            <li>It does define my curls, but only if I can apply it in very small sections--this would be great for finger coils if you have the time.</li>
            <li>It provides absolutely no definition that you would expect from \\&quot;gel\\&quot; for me, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>So the 3 stars is just for my texture hair, if your hair is a little softer im sure you will have some luck</li>
            <li>I am completely sold!!..</li>
            <li>With the use of these/this products my hair has been moisturized and curly for days with cute little curls.</li>
            <li>It smells really great and the jar lasts a long time, a little bit of this goes a long way if you use too much you may end up with really greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that it made my natural hair really curly and defined as I applied it to each section.</li>
            <li>I believe people who have commented about it being too sticky may have been using far too much.</li>
            <li>This advice was given by Felicia Leatherwood, a natural hair stylist, and it really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I re-knotted my hair every few days or so for almost two weeks without needing to add more product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed and towel dried my hair and used a lil bit of captivating curls as a leave in under this gel.  </li>
            <li>I tried to pineapple my hair like normal to keep the curls longer</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because Sally’s was out of the product I normally use.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel the rawness that I normally would...</li>
            <li>I am a true natural with mixed type 3b and 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li>Thick with product, kind of tacky.</li>
            <li>It keeps them very moist and when it is time to undo the twists, they come out smoothly without the typical, tangled, nightmare.</li>
            <li>The next day I just allow a lil water from the shower in my hair, if needed add a lil more soufflé, shake and blow dry.</li>
            <li>and I easily achieve 2nd, 3rd and 4th day hair.</li>
            <li>This is the only gel that had EVER been able to hold my hair this long with no need to style in the morning!!</li>
            <li>It also provides a good hold for my hair without it being stiff and dry.</li>
            <li>I have been transferring away from the non-organic non-natural sulfate and alcohol loaded products and am always trying new organic ones.</li>
            <li>I divided a section in two, dipped JUST my index finger into the Curling Souffle, then applied the Souffle to one of the newly divided sections.</li>
            <li>I moved on to a new section repeating these steps until all of my hair was in twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>raw shea butter version works better)</li>
            <li>use this and shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie mixed together in the palm of my hand, rub it all over my slightly wet (but not driping) hair in the mornings then let it air dry, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Its a nice subtle coconut smell.</li>
            <li>Once it does, my hair doesn&#x27;t look like it has product in it and becomes very soft yet holds</li>
            <li>Which I would usually not do based on the feedback I got from YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the kinky curly but only use it sometimes due to the cost.</li>
            <li>Admittedly I may have used to much based on the other reviews, but the product is so watery it’s hard to determine how much to use to be effective.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that although its the same texture.. it was made much better than Kinky Curly and costs MUCH less...</li>
            <li>I was able to actually comb thru my hair with little to no damage.</li>
            <li>If you use more it makes hair sticky and too hard.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it has good things for my hair, agave, coconut oil, flax seed, a little bit of glycerin, shea butter and vitamin E just to name a few.</li>
            <li>Also, it did not have my hair hard and brittle, instead it left it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and this keeps them soft.  </li>
            <li>But its natural with agave so its bound to happen.</li>
            <li>If you use this product frequently, you may have to up your wash routine for control of product build up.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a leave in conditioner, onyx natural curl conditioner.</li>
            <li>, I applied firts the same brand Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Milk  ad then a gentle amount of the curling souffle.  </li>
            <li>Hair was soft to the touch but no sheen.</li>
            <li>however it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing for my hair especially since I used it all the time with out a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pro low maintence</li>
            <li>I have 4a hair and after wearing weave as a protective style, I take the weave out and rock the natural for a bit.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff leaves my hair sticky and undefined.</li>
            <li>It has a goopy consistency and will sit tacky on the hair, especially if you&#x27;ve used too much.</li>
            <li>My twist-out afterwards feels soft and moisturized for days while still being softly defined.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have been transitioning to natural for 7 months now and still learning what products work for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>the curls came out soft, shiny, and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this product to enhance her natural curl pattern for the &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have not had the chance to really get a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; use from it.</li>
            <li>..looked at the ingredients which were yummy looking and natural..</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it is very sticky and can leave my hair sticky as well.</li>
            <li>I saw this product at Target and it smell heavenly, the ingredients were literally all natural things you find in a flower shop, or in nature and so...</li>
            <li>Do not worry about the negative reviews, try it for yourself and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Or at least I didn&#x27;t :)    </li>
            <li>Leaves my two-strand twist outs soft, shiny, and elongated.  </li>
            <li>I have natural 4b/4c hair.</li>
            <li>Irritated that I paid $9 for this product that is going directly in the trash.</li>
            <li>The smell is lush and lingers on the hair for days, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>My twists/curls were defined and had a soft hold.</li>
            <li>After making the decision to go natural</li>
            <li>I had decided to read up on the products after I had bought them and was surprised to learn I had the results that some of the individuals represented here had--</li>
            <li>But it defines my curls very well like regular gel.</li>
            <li>curl definition came slowly but surely after my hair took on and accepted the moisture</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid environment, so it takes a couple hours for it to dry</li>
            <li>The natural part of my hair was stretched and shiny and if u don&#x27;t put to much the ends of your permed hair will be soft and curly.  </li>
            <li>(a tad bit of pure organic coconut is much better).I almost gave up because the moist shiny curl would only last during day 1..and about 6 hours later.. after my hair has touched my sweaters..chair..coat..</li>
            <li>next time)it was a 90+ degree day with high humidity.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t understand why it is being sold for such a high price on this site when it is $9.99 at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>keep the product in the shower and apply generously to my just rinsed hair and then \\&quot;plop\\&quot; (on top of head, not twisted in the material) in a long sleeved t-shirt or similar material and wrap my head up in it for at least 30 minutes to get the excess moisture out.</li>
            <li>When applying to the hair, you really need much less than you think, if it starts to feel sticky on your fingers, you&#x27;ve got too much.</li>
            <li>I came across these products at Walgreens and after much deliberation and following through on the decision to only use natural products on my hair</li>
            <li>Normally I need to apply lots of gel one day and next day</li>
            <li>So calm down, Amazon is not trying to steal your money.  </li>
            <li>Every little bit helps especially when they are running a buy one get one free sale.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything from Eco Styler Gel to Kinky Curly and everything worked pretty much the same with slight differences.</li>
            <li>She was very surprised because that day before, my hair was looking like a hot mess.</li>
            <li>Just an update giving my conclusion: If you use too much of this your hair simply won&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li>Like others who have posted reviews about this product, I:&lt;br /&gt;1. Am glad that I didn&#x27;t read the negative reviews prior to making my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>and I quickly discovered that I didn&#x27;t have to apply the souffle as heavy as the smoothie on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I think most naturals use too much of the wrong products on their hair.  </li>
            <li>and I was left with soft, moisturized, lightweight hair that was shiny!</li>
            <li>Like others, I am so glad I didn&#x27;t let the negative comments stop me from purchasing this product!</li>
            <li>My curls are very tight and springy, but they are also full of movement and shine.  </li>
            <li>Also, it may be pricey, but even though I have a lot of hair and use a decent amount, a jar of this lasts me a realllllly long time.</li>
            <li>After reading some suggestions from other reviewers, I applied the Shea Moisture Extra Moisture Transitioning Milk on top of the souffle to cut down on the stickiness.</li>
            <li>I also use a little bit to slick down the edges of my hair which works great btw.</li>
            <li>This is BARELY a gel.</li>
            <li>Now my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair is manageable and I can wear it out in different styles without fear of it getting wild.  </li>
            <li>I recently went natural and needed a styler for my twa.</li>
            <li>NOT wet</li>
            <li>a tiny bit of PURE coconut oil..and a dime sized dollop of SM Curling Souffle for each section..twisted each section ..let air dry for 20 minutes..</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product due to the ingredients.</li>
            <li>and i looked a hot sticky frizzy homeless mess.</li>
            <li>The Souffle smells like heaven and my hair was SUPER SOFT while it was wet, but once it dried, it was crunchy and tangly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Native/African American mixed woman, at the end of my transition from chemically relaxed to natural hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and shiny and I get 2nd and 3rd day hair!</li>
            <li>it is not dry but not oily either which I like.</li>
            <li>and those so called \\&quot;oils\\&quot; like argan and macadamia are actually filled with silicones and only lend a temporary shine to thick, curly somewhat pourous hair...</li>
            <li>I have tried twist outs in the past that didn&#x27;t last more than a day due to frizzing.  </li>
            <li>Finally I will scrunch about a little more than a quarter-size amount of the pink ecostyler gel into my hair and let air dry.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product, I towel dried my hair and applied it to damp hair.</li>
            <li>I would not dare put too much on my ends because I don&#x27;t want anything to weigh me down.</li>
            <li>I never seen my hair lay down and shine so much.</li>
            <li>The back of my hair that was untwisted was very shiny, fluffy and soft but with just enough hold</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really set throughout the day, and the feel of both the product itself and the product in your hair feels like a LOT of oil and honey, and less gel-like.</li>
            <li>My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the first time I used it, it left my hair sticky and tacky after it dried, which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>works well for my children&#x27;s hair who are mixed along with the Shea moisture leave in hair care, I might by it again but not sure if it is worth the $</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first, but I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>i usually have very curly hair and my sets---curlformers, twist-outs---come out fine and last for at least a week or two.</li>
            <li>I go through this in 2 months, but my hair is very dense and tightly curled.</li>
            <li>but I do think that it&#x27;s good, less expensive than kinky curly product and will go further because you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>why not just use a little shea instead of THAT much coconut oil?</li>
            <li>so if there&#x27;s too much product after detangling then I rinse a little.</li>
            <li>Then I add a little of Jane carter condition and sculpt all over and gently pull and even my kinky curls with my fingers then shake shake shake my hair again.</li>
            <li>It can be a little sticky and will make curls crunchy if too much is used</li>
            <li>The first time I applied too much and it left my hair feeling stiff, crunchy and dry, dry, dry.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from psoriasis for years now, and nothing short of using a medicated oil (suspended steroids, which will thin your hair with prolonged use) has ever given me sustained relief... my scalp always sheds huge brown flakes</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Excellent products.  </li>
            <li> I believe anyone can use it, you just have to figure out how it works best for you.</li>
            <li> Goes great with a hood dryer too!</li>
            <li> which is great!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works the best for me.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it on my scalp, and that was the best idea ever.</li>
            <li> my scalp feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had curls before, but using this product I&#x27;ve gotten the best definition I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect styling gel to use for either look.</li>
            <li> and Im very happy</li>
            <li> For instance, if you are using a shampoo or conditioner with &#x27;cones or sulfates, you will not get the best results.  </li>
            <li> I brush thru with a denman brush to get the best distribution throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Here is a checklist to get te best results.</li>
            <li> but this is perfect.</li>
            <li> The results are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have a mixture of 3c/3b curls in my hair and this works wonderful.</li>
            <li> My results are awesome.  </li>
            <li> Both products made my hair smell very good.</li>
            <li> Great product if you find how it works best for your hair type.</li>
            <li> say that she loved it!</li>
            <li> My hair still look great</li>
            <li> This method leaves my twists shiny and gives them great hang.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I tried this product on a weekend rather than a day I had to go to work, because then I would have been SOL.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair curly and moisturized, and the shine is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, after Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner, this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried on my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this gel in the morning after a shower, and it holds all day, which is great...</li>
            <li> Deva curl and Ouidad are GREAT for washing ..co-washing and conditioning</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> but once it dries, it gives great hold with shine.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> What a winning combination!!</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed was that this does elongate and stretch curls very nicely and helps keep hair detangled.  </li>
            <li> It provides great stretch, great curl definition, and my hair looks good day to day</li>
            <li> The product was amazing on my hair!</li>
            <li> I still use it because it smells great and can be a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> The thing my hair craves most is moisture and the curling souffle provides the perfect amount for me.</li>
            <li> have 4 b/c hair and had just about given up on having a successful twistout.</li>
            <li> Loving this!</li>
            <li> On the bright side.</li>
            <li> and I was good to go.  </li>
            <li> and I still continue to have good results.</li>
            <li> It adds beautiful shine and hold to the 3c/4a/4b types of hair in my family, and defines our curls much better than KCCC.  </li>
            <li> They need to tweak this because it did NOT make my hair feel great, and the curl definition was just okay.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I am very pleased with Shea Moisture&#x27;s curling souffle.</li>
            <li> If there was a 4z, I am sure THAT would be my hair, LOL.</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t look at the reviews BEFORE I bought it, cause I wouldn&#x27;t have touched it!</li>
            <li> Love my Shea Moisture products!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> it is way better  moisturizing and also is cheaper!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> to say I love this product and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE RESULTS!</li>
            <li> I can now do wash n go&#x27;s and it looks better than when I took time to twist it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> and I was able to get coupons!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> but I like this product better!</li>
            <li> We love this product and 100% recommend to others!</li>
            <li> The outcome was fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> get amazing and well-moisturized afro results now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> but i do not recommend make your own flax gel recipe</li>
            <li> Kind of like Kinky Curly Curling Custard (KCCC).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried KCCC and I really liked it</li>
            <li> I have cheaper products that moisturize and style my hair on their own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be a hair chemist to make my hair look nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell really nice as all Shea Moisture products do.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a sticky residue on anything in touches which I&#x27;m not too thrilled about.</li>
            <li> I had used the Shea Moisture SHAMPOO for curly hair and it worked nicely..</li>
            <li> I love that this product has good ingredients</li>
            <li> It felt sticky and tacky, and it just kind of sat on my hair.</li>
            <li> And with seborrhic dermatitis in and on my scalp the benefits of these and this product are nice.</li>
            <li> I have 2b-3a fine dense high porosity hair, I use this a sealer before mousse and gel, it works great for clumping and curl retention and gives incredible shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> HUGE FAN!</li>
            <li> This product is a staple for my bantu knot outs and twist outs because I love the hold, shine, and moisture is gives my fro.</li>
            <li> she commented on how healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> , so I was hoping the souffle would be just as outstanding...</li>
            <li> This product managed to maintain the \\&quot;hang\\&quot; of my hair more than 12 hours after applying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure a lot of you curly ladies know that products get discontinued at a rapid pace</li>
            <li> For starters, it is much more oily and a bit looser than KCCC.  </li>
            <li> There are too many products out there for me to try.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product once now, but I can already say I am in love with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I spray my hair with water and conditioner and then apply some more gel or mousse, well with this</li>
            <li> but it was ok since it makes me look well styled at work but</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of combinations of products on my 3B/C hair, and nothing works better than than the combination of this gel souffle and the SM Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li> Adds more shine than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, but leaves the hair feeling sticky and straw-like.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the product.</li>
            <li> Just ordered 2 more jars just in case.</li>
            <li> I love this product and very happy that I was able to replace the only thing that worked which had cones in it.  </li>
            <li> I really love it, and my hair hates almost everything.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I love all Shae Moisture products.</li>
            <li> But as the week progressed my hair just kept getting better and the stickiness wore off  for the most part.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this product 5 stars</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li> I would love to try the liquid form and see how that varies.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the liquid form is much better</li>
            <li> Now I am 10 months in and have learned more about my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am using this on top of my homemade Shea butter mixture that I found on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> More</li>
            <li> Retwisting tonight with a bit more gel</li>
            <li> Gels like eco-gel were drying and have way too many chemicals that strip color..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the smoothie, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I find their products work so much better together.  </li>
            <li> Which means more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> You just have to know how to apply it :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walmart, with the intention of making my curls more defined.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than the eco-styler I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, it looks like a may have gotten a curl!:)</li>
            <li> anyhow, this works way better than eco styler.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love all of shea moisture products, so I was eager to try this one.  </li>
            <li> but I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then did a 70% SheaMoisture Curling Smoothie/30% Gel Soufflé mix and that was pretty good for the cooler Autumn/Winter months where I live.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a winning combination, and I hope these two products will always be available.</li>
            <li> Also applying to wet hair seems to work best for my family.  </li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive scalp that&#x27;s easily irritated, you&#x27;ll have to find something to keep it happy.</li>
            <li> Pros: smells wonderful, gives awesome shine, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Might be good for looser curls, but not so great for tightly coiled hair (I have</li>
            <li> I have elbow-length, ultra-dry, 4C hair, zero visible curl pattern, tangles extraordinarily easily, must be kept in protective styles to be manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair tangles very quickly</li>
            <li> I have 4a/4b hair and this does just fine for my twists and twistouts.  </li>
            <li> So I will probably buy it again especially if my next effort is more successful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li> The one positive I can think of it is it has a really nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel and its available in duane reade, also its only 11.99 there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Shea Moisture products but this Curling Souffle is just not where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li> This was just a huge pain for me.  </li>
            <li> I was making a huge mistake</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about SM---its great</li>
            <li> my curls looked great and shiny and bouncy that morning but by the end of the day they shrunk and was starting to revert to my curl pattern.</li>
            <li> I used lightly</li>
            <li> This gel works great in conjunction with steaming your hair in the shower for ultimate moisture as well.</li>
            <li> I place a finger in it and the product is so light it almost feels like no product is on my hand, but it is.</li>
            <li> the curls came out smooth and defined...</li>
            <li> this product is fantastic...</li>
            <li> use a light leave in conditioner 3)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter but it does the job just as well as eco, and you can actually eat this lol.</li>
            <li> We use after washing/conditioning and after lightly spritzing with water for morning touch ups to our styles.  </li>
            <li> the best curl definition and moisture boost (I only wash weekly)&lt;br /&gt;You could try using just one of the products instead of two, but for my hair they work very well together.</li>
            <li> The result is a beautifully defined twist out if your hair is completely dry.  </li>
            <li> First I apply the Shea Coconut Hibiscus Styling Milk and then a very light application of the souffle.  </li>
            <li> I want something that is quick and easy, and this is not it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s so great about the souffle is that less is more.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m sooo excited about this product.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> First  of all like most reviewers say this product is way too slimy,  greasy &amp; leaves a sticky film on your hands when it dries  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair with come clean.</li>
            <li> 1) use it on clean hair 2)</li>
            <li> /in 1-2 hours), I have about 20 large cute chunky S and Z shapes all over, so</li>
            <li> The ingredients are very high quality, but this product is clearly better suited to those with type 3 curls.</li>
            <li> It has really great ingredients and of course, I&#x27;d already spent the money.</li>
            <li> After rinsing the dc with cool water I detangled with kimmaytube leave in and used this Shea Moisture Souffle to bantu knot my hair.</li>
            <li> After I did a conditioner washed, I applied a fairly generous amount combed my hair back into a ponytail and tied a scarf around my hair.  </li>
            <li> I try all kind of products for natural curly hair all the time</li>
            <li> I finally found a good use for this.</li>
            <li> I must say that I have really fallen in love with the Shea Moisture line.</li>
            <li> so I was cool with that</li>
            <li> It really helped with stretch and gave my &#x27;fro more definition and character.</li>
            <li> My hair kept the curls all day without much frizz (I will put more towards the roots</li>
            <li> I have decided to use this product as more of a finishing gel to refresh and for shine, which it does very well.</li>
            <li> but I love this line so much</li>
            <li> I adore this stuff and dont have any problems with it, only stating facts that Im sure will come up or already have &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li> I have brown super curly corkscrew hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to deal with these things for the sake of the great results, but if you&#x27;re looking for a light product that won&#x27;t weigh your hair down, this might not be it.</li>
            <li> We range from wavy/straight to kinky/kinky and the results are always long lasting and superb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used this product I was WAY too heavy-handed!</li>
            <li> They make a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light-handed with all of my products and don&#x27;t like anything heavy in my hair at all, so this is a great product for me.</li>
            <li> Also, this stuff is a bit messy lol.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell and will definitely last for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I use it to set my twists  but make sure apply a butter over it to keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li> For now I will keep looking for the best product to stretch curls but not be sticky and unappealing to the touch.</li>
            <li> love that this line is 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been natural since birth, so no doubt I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products.</li>
            <li> I put this on freshly washed hair, and then sat under the hood dryer.</li>
            <li> Since I became natural, I can&#x27;t tell you how many products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The twists held well and then on day four I took the twists out for a twist out and let&#x27;s just say this helped me fall deeper in love with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> To keep it fresh, I add a chunk of it to a spray bottle, with water, and I used this on my twists.</li>
            <li> Also, I liked Shea Moisture&#x27;s page on Facebook (sometime last year)</li>
            <li> I wore flat twists in the front and used the curling souffle like a gel to make sure my twists stayed smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> First, I made four large sections in my hair, lightly misted with water so my hair was just damp</li>
            <li> hope this review could help you to decide if this product will be right for you.  </li>
            <li> The trick is the right mix and right amount of product.  </li>
            <li> This method keeps my hair MOISTURIZEd and when I&#x27;m lazy I can get 2 weeks out of it and it still looks great, but by that time it&#x27;s time for a wash.</li>
            <li> Ok, so by reading the reviews here and talking to friends in person, this is a product that if you love it (and more importantly, if your HAIR loves it), you really LOVE it, but if you hate it...</li>
            <li> This defines very very well.  </li>
            <li> And its true--a little does go a long way, which is excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> Buy this product if you deal with curly hair issues on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;I am officially a HUGE fan!</li>
            <li> My hair feels exactly like I want it to....</li>
            <li> I recently used this product on a bantu knot out and it turned out fabulous!</li>
            <li> This was consistent with the reviews I&#x27;d read, but I thought, why not use it as a moisturizer instead of a gel.</li>
            <li> but I love this product and it will be a staple for my curly fro&#x27;s now and in the future</li>
            <li> (or at least until something else great comes</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I was expecting it to be like a gel of some sort.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried the product, I washed, conditioned, and towel-dried my hair.</li>
            <li> The cashier actually tried to discourage me from buying it stating many naturals did not like it.</li>
            <li> I have mostly 4b/c hair with 4a in the back and this product gives me a defined moisturized twist out all the time.  </li>
            <li> I use it pretty liberally (package recommends using sparingly)</li>
            <li> This was hairstylist and my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the pink label Shea Moisture Products.  </li>
            <li> My curls a shiny, frizz free, soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> Do not use too much!</li>
            <li> I have been able to get 4-5 day hair from this with the occasional frizzies but this blows eco-styler out of the water.</li>
            <li> I first bought the SM Curl Souffle then the Curl Smoothie.</li>
            <li> More recently I discovered that I was a 4C curl type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty yummy.</li>
            <li> First &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I get soft curls, no frizz, and a good amount of non-crunchy hold if I scrunch again after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> My curls look just as good on the third and fourth day as they did on the first.</li>
            <li> This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> This time, however, because I had the SM curling souffle underneath it, my hair, after it dried, was soft without being sticky or tacky, but had really great hold.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will, and when I wash it out in the morning, my hair feels soft and is still super curly.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, this stuff smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> My first time using the souffle I used way too much</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with sheamoisture (skip the restorative conditioner I used to use, made my hair dry) and then add this on top.</li>
            <li> Most gels leave my hair dry as straw</li>
            <li> ; that leaves my hair still feeling like hair; great curl and hold for my finger coils and flat twists; i have used both wet and dry/misted; i have several textures ranging from very kinky to fine.</li>
            <li> I part off a section, make sure my hair is thoroughly wet, apply a good amount of the souffle, comb it through with my wide-tooth comb, and then twist into small sections.</li>
            <li> Nice tight defined curls.</li>
            <li> There was definitely a learning curve using this product on my fine, kinky hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is much stronger.</li>
            <li> I have very dense 4c hair.</li>
            <li> But I might need to use something else as my hair gets longer because it coats the hair rather than absorbing into it, and I&#x27;d be worried about breakouts.</li>
            <li> Using way too much.</li>
            <li> Very oily</li>
            <li> I really like this gel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sticky and goopy, so now I just rub my fingers on the surface of the gel rather than scooping it up.</li>
            <li> I am usually very hesitate to give a product 5 stars</li>
            <li> consistency is gritty/oily/runny, very sticky on hands and after hair has been set with it.</li>
            <li> With this product, it was harder to gather in your hands and much more slippery.  </li>
            <li> This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> really make reviews often,</li>
            <li> but I really needed to talk about this.  </li>
            <li> agave nectar really attracted the moisture in the air, the flaxseed gave me a bit of shine and hold, and the shea butter really conditioned and moisturized my hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally I really just separate my hair with my fingers and apply soufflé all over then shake.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li> wish I had known about this sooner, before using so much crappy hairspray.</li>
            <li> OR THERE WILL BE A HIGH LEVEL OF STICKINESS!</li>
            <li> It does what KC does but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I tried using it for kinky twist, and it worked really well for that.</li>
            <li> and it really minimized my frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Needless</li>
            <li> One day I was braiding my hair and thought why not use it as a moisturizer and it worked very well...</li>
            <li> I really think SheaMoisture needs to start marketing this product as a moisturizer and not a styling gel...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t notice the product in it until I&#x27;m trying to get ready for bed, but it will make itself known during the day if you touch your hair</li>
            <li> I no longer use terry and avoid microfiber even, because my hair is very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> It feels very oily and it the consistency is  like jello.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really give the desired effect</li>
            <li> I apply it to each section of my hair then gently comb it through.</li>
            <li> no sulfates..and REAL oils..</li>
            <li> then used the diffuser as i untwisted gently...</li>
            <li> and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> Its also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> A lot off people complain about the stickiness or crunchiness and its probably because they applied too much product.</li>
            <li> use very sparingly...</li>
            <li> I thought since I was doing a twistout, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt too much.</li>
            <li> I suspect you are using way too much.</li>
            <li> (my hair will not tolerate straight grease-it just sits on my scalp and hair and doesn&#x27;t moisturize.)</li>
            <li> but when I applied this product, my hair felt really moisturized.</li>
            <li> I had a really defined twist out that stayed moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I repeated the process the next night and got the same great results the next day.</li>
            <li> I co-wash, use leave-in and use a coat (not too much) of Curling Gel Souffle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased I&#x27;ve finally found natural products that work, and as a bonus they smell heavenly too.</li>
            <li> It also rinses off your hands very nicely, which means I can look forward to little or no product being left in my hair.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I have pretty decent second and even third day hair.</li>
            <li> But when I finally took my hair down it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li> live in a very humid place and my hair tends to get very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Users suggest going lightly on the product because it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have medium fine hair dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Cremes, oddly enough, do not completely absorb into my hair in these hot months and seem to just sit on top of and coat my hair.</li>
            <li> First let me say, this product is no where near $31 at Target or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Will come back with full results and review.  </li>
            <li> I repeat a very LIGHT application of the souffle so that your hair won&#x27;t be a sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> and I was sure to wear a satin bonnet whenever I laid down because my hair was so juicy.</li>
            <li> night i use just a little of the smoothie on its own to keep my hair soft overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Smoothie and the Styling Milk previously and they were just okay.  </li>
            <li> But when I used this product with my curl former set, (weather was about 70-75 very low humidity and mostly sunny)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet tried it on a wash-n-go and probably won&#x27;t as it will probably not have any effect on my particularly porous hair texture.  </li>
            <li> It was highly moisturized, glossy and defined...</li>
            <li> It does define my curls, but only if I can apply it in very small sections--this would be great for finger coils if you have the time.</li>
            <li> It provides absolutely no definition that you would expect from \\&quot;gel\\&quot; for me, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> So the 3 stars is just for my texture hair, if your hair is a little softer im sure you will have some luck</li>
            <li> I am completely sold!!..</li>
            <li> With the use of these/this products my hair has been moisturized and curly for days with cute little curls.</li>
            <li> It smells really great and the jar lasts a long time, a little bit of this goes a long way if you use too much you may end up with really greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that it made my natural hair really curly and defined as I applied it to each section.</li>
            <li> I believe people who have commented about it being too sticky may have been using far too much.</li>
            <li> This advice was given by Felicia Leatherwood, a natural hair stylist, and it really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I re-knotted my hair every few days or so for almost two weeks without needing to add more product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed and towel dried my hair and used a lil bit of captivating curls as a leave in under this gel.  </li>
            <li> I tried to pineapple my hair like normal to keep the curls longer</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because Sally’s was out of the product I normally use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel the rawness that I normally would...</li>
            <li> I am a true natural with mixed type 3b and 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li> Thick with product, kind of tacky.</li>
            <li> It keeps them very moist and when it is time to undo the twists, they come out smoothly without the typical, tangled, nightmare.</li>
            <li> The next day I just allow a lil water from the shower in my hair, if needed add a lil more soufflé, shake and blow dry.</li>
            <li> and I easily achieve 2nd, 3rd and 4th day hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel that had EVER been able to hold my hair this long with no need to style in the morning!!</li>
            <li> It also provides a good hold for my hair without it being stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> I have been transferring away from the non-organic non-natural sulfate and alcohol loaded products and am always trying new organic ones.</li>
            <li> I divided a section in two, dipped JUST my index finger into the Curling Souffle, then applied the Souffle to one of the newly divided sections.</li>
            <li> I moved on to a new section repeating these steps until all of my hair was in twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> raw shea butter version works better)</li>
            <li> use this and shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie mixed together in the palm of my hand, rub it all over my slightly wet (but not driping) hair in the mornings then let it air dry, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Its a nice subtle coconut smell.</li>
            <li> Once it does, my hair doesn&#x27;t look like it has product in it and becomes very soft yet holds</li>
            <li> Which I would usually not do based on the feedback I got from YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the kinky curly but only use it sometimes due to the cost.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I may have used to much based on the other reviews, but the product is so watery it’s hard to determine how much to use to be effective.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that although its the same texture.. it was made much better than Kinky Curly and costs MUCH less...</li>
            <li> I was able to actually comb thru my hair with little to no damage.</li>
            <li> If you use more it makes hair sticky and too hard.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it has good things for my hair, agave, coconut oil, flax seed, a little bit of glycerin, shea butter and vitamin E just to name a few.</li>
            <li> Also, it did not have my hair hard and brittle, instead it left it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and this keeps them soft.  </li>
            <li> But its natural with agave so its bound to happen.</li>
            <li> If you use this product frequently, you may have to up your wash routine for control of product build up.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a leave in conditioner, onyx natural curl conditioner.</li>
            <li> , I applied firts the same brand Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Milk  ad then a gentle amount of the curling souffle.  </li>
            <li> Hair was soft to the touch but no sheen.</li>
            <li> however it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing for my hair especially since I used it all the time with out a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pro low maintence</li>
            <li> I have 4a hair and after wearing weave as a protective style, I take the weave out and rock the natural for a bit.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff leaves my hair sticky and undefined.</li>
            <li> It has a goopy consistency and will sit tacky on the hair, especially if you&#x27;ve used too much.</li>
            <li> My twist-out afterwards feels soft and moisturized for days while still being softly defined.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have been transitioning to natural for 7 months now and still learning what products work for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> the curls came out soft, shiny, and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product to enhance her natural curl pattern for the &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> Overall I have not had the chance to really get a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; use from it.</li>
            <li> ..looked at the ingredients which were yummy looking and natural..</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is very sticky and can leave my hair sticky as well.</li>
            <li> I saw this product at Target and it smell heavenly, the ingredients were literally all natural things you find in a flower shop, or in nature and so...</li>
            <li> Do not worry about the negative reviews, try it for yourself and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Or at least I didn&#x27;t :)    </li>
            <li> Leaves my two-strand twist outs soft, shiny, and elongated.  </li>
            <li> I have natural 4b/4c hair.</li>
            <li> Irritated that I paid $9 for this product that is going directly in the trash.</li>
            <li> The smell is lush and lingers on the hair for days, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> My twists/curls were defined and had a soft hold.</li>
            <li> After making the decision to go natural</li>
            <li> I had decided to read up on the products after I had bought them and was surprised to learn I had the results that some of the individuals represented here had--</li>
            <li> But it defines my curls very well like regular gel.</li>
            <li> curl definition came slowly but surely after my hair took on and accepted the moisture</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid environment, so it takes a couple hours for it to dry</li>
            <li> The natural part of my hair was stretched and shiny and if u don&#x27;t put to much the ends of your permed hair will be soft and curly.  </li>
            <li> (a tad bit of pure organic coconut is much better).I almost gave up because the moist shiny curl would only last during day 1..and about 6 hours later.. after my hair has touched my sweaters..chair..coat..</li>
            <li> next time)it was a 90+ degree day with high humidity.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why it is being sold for such a high price on this site when it is $9.99 at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> keep the product in the shower and apply generously to my just rinsed hair and then \\&quot;plop\\&quot; (on top of head, not twisted in the material) in a long sleeved t-shirt or similar material and wrap my head up in it for at least 30 minutes to get the excess moisture out.</li>
            <li> When applying to the hair, you really need much less than you think, if it starts to feel sticky on your fingers, you&#x27;ve got too much.</li>
            <li> I came across these products at Walgreens and after much deliberation and following through on the decision to only use natural products on my hair</li>
            <li> Normally I need to apply lots of gel one day and next day</li>
            <li> So calm down, Amazon is not trying to steal your money.  </li>
            <li> Every little bit helps especially when they are running a buy one get one free sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from Eco Styler Gel to Kinky Curly and everything worked pretty much the same with slight differences.</li>
            <li> She was very surprised because that day before, my hair was looking like a hot mess.</li>
            <li> Just an update giving my conclusion: If you use too much of this your hair simply won&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> Like others who have posted reviews about this product, I:&lt;br /&gt;1. Am glad that I didn&#x27;t read the negative reviews prior to making my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and I quickly discovered that I didn&#x27;t have to apply the souffle as heavy as the smoothie on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I think most naturals use too much of the wrong products on their hair.  </li>
            <li> and I was left with soft, moisturized, lightweight hair that was shiny!</li>
            <li> Like others, I am so glad I didn&#x27;t let the negative comments stop me from purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> My curls are very tight and springy, but they are also full of movement and shine.  </li>
            <li> Also, it may be pricey, but even though I have a lot of hair and use a decent amount, a jar of this lasts me a realllllly long time.</li>
            <li> After reading some suggestions from other reviewers, I applied the Shea Moisture Extra Moisture Transitioning Milk on top of the souffle to cut down on the stickiness.</li>
            <li> I also use a little bit to slick down the edges of my hair which works great btw.</li>
            <li> This is BARELY a gel.</li>
            <li> Now my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair is manageable and I can wear it out in different styles without fear of it getting wild.  </li>
            <li> I recently went natural and needed a styler for my twa.</li>
            <li> NOT wet</li>
            <li> a tiny bit of PURE coconut oil..and a dime sized dollop of SM Curling Souffle for each section..twisted each section ..let air dry for 20 minutes..</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product due to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> and i looked a hot sticky frizzy homeless mess.</li>
            <li> The Souffle smells like heaven and my hair was SUPER SOFT while it was wet, but once it dried, it was crunchy and tangly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Native/African American mixed woman, at the end of my transition from chemically relaxed to natural hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and shiny and I get 2nd and 3rd day hair!</li>
            <li> it is not dry but not oily either which I like.</li>
            <li> and those so called \\&quot;oils\\&quot; like argan and macadamia are actually filled with silicones and only lend a temporary shine to thick, curly somewhat pourous hair...</li>
            <li> I have tried twist outs in the past that didn&#x27;t last more than a day due to frizzing.  </li>
            <li> Finally I will scrunch about a little more than a quarter-size amount of the pink ecostyler gel into my hair and let air dry.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I towel dried my hair and applied it to damp hair.</li>
            <li> I would not dare put too much on my ends because I don&#x27;t want anything to weigh me down.</li>
            <li> I never seen my hair lay down and shine so much.</li>
            <li> The back of my hair that was untwisted was very shiny, fluffy and soft but with just enough hold</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really set throughout the day, and the feel of both the product itself and the product in your hair feels like a LOT of oil and honey, and less gel-like.</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the first time I used it, it left my hair sticky and tacky after it dried, which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> works well for my children&#x27;s hair who are mixed along with the Shea moisture leave in hair care, I might by it again but not sure if it is worth the $</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> i usually have very curly hair and my sets---curlformers, twist-outs---come out fine and last for at least a week or two.</li>
            <li> I go through this in 2 months, but my hair is very dense and tightly curled.</li>
            <li> but I do think that it&#x27;s good, less expensive than kinky curly product and will go further because you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> why not just use a little shea instead of THAT much coconut oil?</li>
            <li> so if there&#x27;s too much product after detangling then I rinse a little.</li>
            <li> Then I add a little of Jane carter condition and sculpt all over and gently pull and even my kinky curls with my fingers then shake shake shake my hair again.</li>
            <li> It can be a little sticky and will make curls crunchy if too much is used</li>
            <li> The first time I applied too much and it left my hair feeling stiff, crunchy and dry, dry, dry.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from psoriasis for years now, and nothing short of using a medicated oil (suspended steroids, which will thin your hair with prolonged use) has ever given me sustained relief... my scalp always sheds huge brown flakes</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, my hair felt a little sticky and I thought I over did it, but when I allowed my hair to dry that feeling went away</li>
            <li> I went on YouTube like I normally do before I try a new product and saw nothing but negative reviews... but still I went to Walgreens and purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> I let it air dry, first day the hair was a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Smh and my twist outs are shiny but flat and only last 2 days with this when they normally last a week.</li>
            <li> but by the next morning the curls were flat sticky squiggles that seemed to be trying to revert while I slept on my satin pillow case.</li>
            <li> Normally my twist-outs and curl former sets come out very well and last at least 3-4 days with humidity and about 1-2 weeks in less humid drier weather.</li>
            <li> My hair looked moisturized and felt soft until I washed it a week and a half later.</li>
            <li> If you go overboard, it will not work very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much longer it will hold</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t use regular sulfate shampoo.</li>
            <li> It can be a little oily, so be careful not to apply too much.</li>
            <li> Will definitely repurchase it (as long as the formula isn&#x27;t changed)!</li>
            <li> but my hair looked dry the next day.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my hair still wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> (it actually never feels like it&#x27;s dry because hours after using this stuff your hair still feels sticky to the touch)  </li>
            <li> Which is a big plus, or dry my hair out, another plus.</li>
            <li> Unlike other commercial gels, this actually nourishes my hair and holds it using things like fruit pectin and sugar.  </li>
            <li> , I cowashed my hair with conditioner and olive oil, then I used the shea moisture coconut and hibiscus styling milk as a leave in and then LIGHTLY applied the curling souffle to parted sections of my hair as I flat twisted.</li>
            <li> This product is a total joke, it make my hair extremely sticky and it didnt help my hair curl at all, it actually made it frizzier.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to enhance the curl, and actually made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> , I have been looking for a gel that really enhances my curls and leaves shine, without being so hard.</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning and took off my scarf, I was surprised to see how slick my hair was.</li>
            <li> A little of this natural product with organic ingredients goes a long way because of the quality!</li>
            <li> It is about 3-4 inches long.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I have a lot of hair and its not unusual</li>
            <li> I did find that the souffle did indeed keep my curls stretched.</li>
            <li> It has a jell-o type appearance and consistency which is also strange.</li>
            <li> My hair is moist and my curls pop all day long.</li>
            <li> I love Shea Moisture products and was wanting to try this because I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Kinky Curly Curling Custard.  </li>
            <li> I went from co-washing every other day to co-washing only twice a week.</li>
            <li> Also i only use about a the size of my inner palm, a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> i gave up on it, and went back to my other products.</li>
            <li> Like other posters have mentioned, it&#x27;s cheaper in your local drugstores.  </li>
            <li> and it left my hair extremely shrunken, dry, and crunchy.</li>
            <li> it took a very long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> The reason the price is high on Amazon is because there are places in the U.S. where the product is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has a tex will know how incredibly dry</li>
            <li> so I was concerned that it would take forever to dry</li>
            <li> I applied it on damp and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> raked leave-in throughout my hair and let it air dry a bit.</li>
            <li> Cream based products in the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> Then I lightly dry my ends with a cotton shirt</li>
            <li> I use they Styling Milk on damp hair and rake the Souffle through my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I heard a few naturals saying they didnt like it, but I finally saw one youtuber who has similar hair texture to mine</li>
            <li> This stuff is a lifesaver, one tub will last you a LONG time - a little goes a long, long way...</li>
            <li> I also had limited frizz.</li>
            <li> and I have not even had to refresh a single curl.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t completely dry when I took it down so for this reason I won&#x27;t use as much next time.  </li>
            <li> but my hair dried much faster than I thought it would have, which is a major plus for me because my hair is very thick.  </li>
            <li> I brushed my hair back and applied a small amount of curling souffle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mixed chick, black and filipino.</li>
            <li> so I offer this advice - start out with less (one dip per twist or a dime sized amount for large sections of hair) then slowly increase as needed.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE do not use too much of this product--a little goes a long way and also be careful about what you layer with it--this may explain some of the \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling some have complained about.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I wet my hands and run them through my dry, stretched hair until slightly damp.</li>
            <li> the real argan oil is so expensive for a tiny bit..</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s because my hair was way too wet to begin with.</li>
            <li> but I felt like if I wasn&#x27;t careful, Winnie the Pooh would be after my honey with all that sticky agave-nectar-goodness</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not available in your neighborhood, then definitely order.</li>
            <li> I use it by doing medium twists on wet hair.</li>
            <li> While my hair is still wet</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re not dripping wet.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and if I apply it to dry hair it gives it a wet look like a pommade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on wet hair, slightly damp hair, and dry hair.</li>
            <li> after washing with SM Raw Shea Butter Shampoo( which I mentioned earlier) ..and separating my hair into four sections..</li>
            <li> The curling smoothie will last 2 months on 4 heads of thick, curly and long hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> For the Shea Moisture line a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Immediately realized that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I tried it with a heavy hand, I tried very little, I tried large sections, I tried small sections, I tried it with other products, I tried it alone and NONE OF IT WORKED.</li>
            <li> I use the deep moisturizer for about 30 min with a cap by Shea moisture and then wash out leaving very little.</li>
            <li> I think the next time I do twists I will use even less of the product to see if that will help with the  and layer it with some Ecostyler Green.</li>
            <li> just a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Depending on the occasion, sometimes I wear twists and other times</li>
            <li> Some come in jelly form and other</li>
            <li> Not sure if they still offer this promotion butI have seen coupons occasionally in my Sunday paper.  </li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t left hard and I didn&#x27;t form any flakes when I did it this method.</li>
            <li> One jar of this on 4 heads of very thick, curly and long hair will last 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> I use this Shea Moisture curling souffle and the Shea Moisture curling smoothie and my hair will last as a wash and go for at least 2 weeks and as twists for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Its not worth the money.</li>
            <li> With this product, I don&#x27;t have to worry about wetting my hair down all the time.</li>
            <li> When the supply catches up the price will go down.  </li>
            <li> Another benefit I noticed is that my shrinkage is about 50% less.   </li>
            <li> when I use the souffle for my chunky twist outs, I slightly dip my fingers in and thats it.</li>
            <li> I find that wetting my hair with my hands in the mornings, makes me use much less product</li>
            <li> I feel that this might work for someone with a looser and less porous hair than mine.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try again but this time without towel drying and using less.</li>
            <li> I got mine at a Walgreen&#x27;s for way less.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying some of their newer product lines, Tahitian Monoi and Jamaican Black Castor Oil as well.  </li>
            <li> Giving it two stars because some of my disappointing results could be due to using too much.</li>
            <li> Heres how you can mess up using this product:</li>
            <li> It held my tight curls and added shine.</li>
            <li> I have 4b 4c tight coily curly hair.  </li>
            <li> With other products, my hair usually starts to puff up and out after about 6 hrs.  </li>
            <li> fix it a little bit</li>
            <li> One container of this lasted me a little over a year.</li>
            <li> I want a product that I can just put on my hair and go, without worrying if I put too much or to little, or that I have to mix it with something else to work.</li>
            <li> while it was still (a little) damp, i raked the Shea Souffle through my hair, and sealed it with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t spend the money here, go get it at Target, CVS Drugstore.com for less then half the price!</li>
            <li> hoping that it would control frizz and give my dreads a little curl.  </li>
            <li> You must start out with a little and gradually increase according to THE NEEDS OF YOUR HAIR TYPE...</li>
            <li> I have super thick, tight curls - think Bernadette Peters, Rosanna Dana, Dee Snider (twisted sister), just a lot of bulk and thickness and medium to thick coarseness of strand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I co-washed as usual, put on my leave-in conditioner and aloe vera gel and then used the SM souffle very minimally.</li>
            <li> You can get it as well as the other shea moisture products for $9.99 at these stores!!</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m out very late, I carry a tiny spray bottle of water and just a few squirts activates my curls again.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Firm curls, but not too firm.  </li>
            <li> Fluffy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m heavy handed</li>
            <li> wthhhh ugh waste of 5 hours of setting</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t define your hair at all but makes it limp.</li>
            <li> My hair is 3b/c, about waist length, I am heavy handed and use a TON of product and still don&#x27;t get sticky, oily hair.</li>
            <li> ALL shea moisture products are $9.99 all walgreens and target and a few CVS stores have them</li>
            <li> I tend to be heavy handed with hair products and applied quite a bit especially since the consistency was thin.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Shea Moisture Curling Souffle because I wanted a product that would slick my hair down.</li>
            <li> I separate my 5-7inch length hair into quadrants, and each quadrant gets no more than a US size tablespoon, usually less.</li>
            <li> I never used a gel-like product before due to the awful ingredients in most of them, but this product has lots of natural/good ingredients that I like using on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have avoided this product for a while due to the negative reviews but on a whim, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> For me, that something is just plain water.</li>
            <li> The gel pieces are a mess everywhere!</li>
            <li> so it made my hair feel like a sticky gummy mess!</li>
            <li> I stuck two fingers in the jar, let the product coat them and used that on a small section of my hair.</li>
            <li> I like to use alot of eco-styler and it usually leaves my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> They usually go for 9.99-10.99</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair one day on and one day off.  </li>
            <li> I combine a small amount of both in my hands and apply, comb through, then rake and scrunch.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER one day, I ran out of my usual stuff, and gave it a try again.</li>
            <li> I wear small curls, either way</li>
            <li> I use small rods on my ends after twisting.  </li>
            <li> You can usually find it for around $10-$11.</li>
            <li> It has a sticky consistency (thicker than curl activator gel) and is very messy if you tend to touch your hair.</li>
            <li> product loses one star because of how sticky it can be and because if I get too much near my scalp it starts to itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> , I have a ton of densely packed tight, pen-spring sized coils and curls that are thin and fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard to explain</li>
            <li> Every time I tried this, I had hard, unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> The gel was not greasy in my hair and didn&#x27;t give that hard feel or stink up my hair all day.</li>
            <li> with so little frizz !!  </li>
            <li> and I am in that awkward phase of letting my hair grow back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how curly my hair actually is with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 3c/4a with thick</li>
            <li> I have really thick type 4 hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly..</li>
            <li> I have terrible shrinkage and was excited to try the product since I use the smoothie and shea butter.</li>
            <li> I used a Denman brush to detangle (and immediately saw definition that I hadn&#x27;t with other products) and then twisted the hair.  </li>
            <li> I hated this product at first.</li>
            <li> Just about every review I read was negative!</li>
            <li> first of all the texture felt awful and when i put it on my hair it was soooo gloopy and sticky</li>
            <li> i get tired of the curls but dont want to perm, you know?)</li>
            <li> If I want to make a style out of the twists, I apply a thin coating of Ecostyler w/ Olive Oil gel to each twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, because of the watery consistency it was difficult to get the product out of the jar and onto your hair.</li>
            <li> They all failed me.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed, but it made my hair feel weird... not greasy or tacky...</li>
            <li> Boy oh boy was i wrong.</li>
            <li> because I did and I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> And the odor has not gotten stale on my hair, which some hair products do.</li>
            <li> Weird side note</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be skeptical, just experiment with it</li>
            <li> i curlformed my freshly-washed hair using this product and the results have been disappointing time after time.</li>
            <li> For those who can not find it anywhere and are desperate, this is an option for them.    </li>
            <li> under the impression that the residue and tacky feelings are jus a hazard of using these types of gel curling agents, though, so I didn&#x27;t want to rate it badly.</li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews</li>
            <li> I was elated to find a use for it because I hate wasting product.  </li>
            <li> this bad boy tames them all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooooo greasy and the consistency is like unset Jello, and the feel in the hair is just a nasty feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful on my 4b hair!</li>
            <li> absolutely horrible and sticky and frizzy.</li>
            <li> well, yeah, you really HATE it!</li>
            <li> my hair hated it!!</li>
            <li> I hate it!!</li>

            <li> HELP!!  I went to put this in my hair and it has pieces of gel that won&#x27;t dissolve!  I tried warming it in my hands... Nothing.  When I put it on my hair, my bathroom floor became covered in bits of gel that flew off like ice!  I combed it thru and I think I got them all out.  I risked it and left the house. I can&#x27;t tell if there are any noticeable gel pieces or not.  My hair feels exactly like I want it to.... Firm curls, but not too firm.  I like the product results but I can&#x27;t use it.  The gel pieces are a mess everywhere!</li>
            <li> Excellent products.  I&#x27;ve used these products for about a year now.  My hair is much stronger. it is not dry but not oily either which I like.</li>
            <li> I have very dense 4c hair. It is about 3-4 inches long. I recently used this product on a bantu knot out and it turned out fabulous! I washed with As I Am cleansing pudding, and deep conditioned with Carols Daughter Khoret Amen detangling hair smoothie. After rinsing the dc with cool water I detangled with kimmaytube leave in and used this Shea Moisture Souffle to bantu knot my hair. It took forever to dry(left them in for two days)but I think that&#x27;s because my hair was way too wet to begin with. Next time I&#x27;ll start with damp hair. But when I finally took my hair down it was gorgeous. This product did make my hair feel tacky but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me because its a twa and its not hanging on my face. I re-knotted my hair every few days or so for almost two weeks without needing to add more product. My hair looked moisturized and felt soft until I washed it a week and a half later. I did put shea butter on my ends about mid week and I was sure to wear a satin bonnet whenever I laid down because my hair was so juicy. This product is a staple for my bantu knot outs and twist outs because I love the hold, shine, and moisture is gives my fro. But I might need to use something else as my hair gets longer because it coats the hair rather than absorbing into it, and I&#x27;d be worried about breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I have 3a curls and this keeps them soft.  It smells really great and the jar lasts a long time, a little bit of this goes a long way if you use too much you may end up with really greasy hair.  I bought this at Walgreen&#x27;s for 10 dollars so idk why its almost 30 on here.</li>
            <li> This is BARELY a gel. It&#x27;s sooooo greasy and the consistency is like unset Jello, and the feel in the hair is just a nasty feeling. It doesn&#x27;t really set throughout the day, and the feel of both the product itself and the product in your hair feels like a LOT of oil and honey, and less gel-like. I was going to give it one star, but gave it two because of the organic ingredients. If I remember the ingredients correctly there&#x27;s NO shea...why not just use a little shea instead of THAT much coconut oil? They need to tweak this because it did NOT make my hair feel great, and the curl definition was just okay. Might be good for looser curls, but not so great for tightly coiled hair (I have \\&quot;4b hair\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> Before I begin, let me say that I have a range of hair textures from 3c to 4c in my hair.     I bought this product @ a walgreens and when I got home, I checked out the reviews for it. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t look at the reviews BEFORE I bought it, cause I wouldn&#x27;t have touched it! Just about every review I read was negative! Being that I&#x27;d already made the purchase, I was determined to find a way to use it. It has really great ingredients and of course, I&#x27;d already spent the money. Anyway, the first time I used it, it left my hair sticky and tacky after it dried, which I didn&#x27;t like. This was consistent with the reviews I&#x27;d read, but I thought, why not use it as a moisturizer instead of a gel. So, I co-washed as usual, put on my leave-in conditioner and aloe vera gel and then used the SM souffle very minimally. I stuck two fingers in the jar, let the product coat them and used that on a small section of my hair. After coating my hair from root to tip, I added my eco-styler gel. I like to use alot of eco-styler and it usually leaves my hair crunchy. This time, however, because I had the SM curling souffle underneath it, my hair, after it dried, was soft without being sticky or tacky, but had really great hold. I went from co-washing every other day to co-washing only twice a week. My curls look just as good on the third and fourth day as they did on the first. Another benefit I noticed is that my shrinkage is about 50% less.   In conclusion, I am very pleased with Shea Moisture&#x27;s curling souffle. I believe anyone can use it, you just have to figure out how it works best for you.</li>
            <li> So the 3 stars is just for my texture hair, if your hair is a little softer im sure you will have some luck but i have coarse 4C hair and it doesnt curl at all. I still use it because it smells great and can be a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> Yes initially the product does seem sticky. A little goes a long way. The product was amazing on my hair! My curls are so defined! I receive so mamy compliments!</li>
            <li> Love my Shea Moisture products! Firstly, I am a mixed chick who really never had control over my naturally curly hair until I discovered shea moisture.  Now my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair is manageable and I can wear it out in different styles without fear of it getting wild.  Secondly, I have a lot of hair and its not unusual (in fact its probably necessary) for me to go through lots of a hair product at one time. Not so with SM...just a little goes a long way! And if that wasnt enough---its NOT greasy and actually softens and conditions your hair. The last time I went to my hairdresser for a blow out (every once in awhile i get tired of the curls but dont want to perm, you know?) she commented on how healthy my hair was. I cant say enough about SM---its great</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I heard a few naturals saying they didnt like it, but I finally saw one youtuber who has similar hair texture to mine say that she loved it! I tried it and felt the same way.  This product has a nice smell and will definitely last for awhile.  Heres how you can mess up using this product: Using way too much. You only need a small amount. when I use the souffle for my chunky twist outs, I slightly dip my fingers in and thats it. Trust me that just enough.  One thing some might not like: It does have a tacky/sticky feeling that will be left on your fingers. But its natural with agave so its bound to happen. If you use this product frequently, you may have to up your wash routine for control of product build up.  I adore this stuff and dont have any problems with it, only stating facts that Im sure will come up or already have &#x3D;]  P.S. Definitely check your local target and walgreens to get the products cheaper unless they dont sell them close to you. They usually go for 9.99-10.99</li>
            <li> I bought this at CVS.  Very oily but I used on ends after I get out of the shower.  My husband likes the scent.  I would not dare put too much on my ends because I don&#x27;t want anything to weigh me down.</li>
            <li> I really like this gel, I have been looking for a gel that really enhances my curls and leaves shine, without being so hard. This is a great gel and its available in duane reade, also its only 11.99 there. I use it with a leave in conditioner, onyx natural curl conditioner. Also i only use about a the size of my inner palm, a little goes along way. If you use more it makes hair sticky and too hard. Goes great with a hood dryer too! Nice tight defined curls. I have combo hair 3b-4a hair. All my hair is defined! Love it!</li>
            <li> The Shea Moisture curl &amp; style milk and curl enhancing smoothie did wonders for my hair, so I was hoping the souffle would be just as outstanding...it wasn&#x27;t. The first time I applied too much and it left my hair feeling stiff, crunchy and dry, dry, dry. It&#x27;s really sticky and goopy, so now I just rub my fingers on the surface of the gel rather than scooping it up. It does define my curls, but only if I can apply it in very small sections--this would be great for finger coils if you have the time. I use it to set my twists  but make sure apply a butter over it to keep my hair soft. Also, there&#x27;s a lot of glycerin in this so do NOT use in the winter months! The ingredients are very high quality, but this product is clearly better suited to those with type 3 curls.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product. It has a sticky consistency (thicker than curl activator gel) and is very messy if you tend to touch your hair. I did find that the souffle did indeed keep my curls stretched. It has a jell-o type appearance and consistency which is also strange. I have terrible shrinkage and was excited to try the product since I use the smoothie and shea butter. Thank goodness for Target&#x27;s return policy. For now I will keep looking for the best product to stretch curls but not be sticky and unappealing to the touch.</li>
            <li> Came here to purchase this line of products but everything is over  priced!! I thought maybe it was a pack of three or some thing but no! 33 dollars for a 10 dollar product? I see why none of the reviewers are \\&quot;verified purchasers\\&quot; I will not be purchasing on that alone! Be ware that target and walgreens sells these products for 9.99!</li>
            <li> I have 4b-4c texturized hair. Anyone who has a tex will know how incredibly dry your hair can get.&lt;br /&gt;I use this and shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie mixed together in the palm of my hand, rub it all over my slightly wet (but not driping) hair in the mornings then let it air dry, and I&#x27;m good to go. I find that wetting my hair with my hands in the mornings, makes me use much less product and it also gives it the best curl definition and moisture boost (I only wash weekly)&lt;br /&gt;You could try using just one of the products instead of two, but for my hair they work very well together. My hair is moist and my curls pop all day long. If I&#x27;m out very late, I carry a tiny spray bottle of water and just a few squirts activates my curls again.&lt;br /&gt;At night i use just a little of the smoothie on its own to keep my hair soft overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this line is 100% natural and organic. All my chemical laden activator gels and sprays are going in the garbage. I&#x27;m so pleased I&#x27;ve finally found natural products that work, and as a bonus they smell heavenly too.</li>
            <li> This is one of shea moistures dissapointments to me like a joke in a jar..first of all the texture felt awful and when i put it on my hair it was soooo gloopy and sticky i was nervous that the bees were gonna come after me because of the nectar in it which i dont understand why thats in there??? but i do not recommend make your own flax gel recipe it is way better  moisturizing and also is cheaper!</li>
            <li> I went on YouTube like I normally do before I try a new product and saw nothing but negative reviews... but still I went to Walgreens and purchase this product.  Which I would usually not do based on the feedback I got from YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review:  I am usually very hesitate to give a product 5 stars but I love this product and it will be a staple for my curly fro&#x27;s now and in the future (or at least until something else great comes along).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed and towel dried my hair and used a lil bit of captivating curls as a leave in under this gel.  I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling that a lot of the ladies were complaining about.  The consistency is similar to Kinky Curly so I was concerned that it would take forever to dry but my hair dried much faster than I thought it would have, which is a major plus for me because my hair is very thick.  This product managed to maintain the \\&quot;hang\\&quot; of my hair more than 12 hours after applying.  With other products, my hair usually starts to puff up and out after about 6 hrs.  And as I type, this is the 4th day and I still like the results.  I think I will try to wear my curly fro again tomorrow and wash tomorrow night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a wonder product and hope people give it a try.  I&#x27;m sure a lot of you curly ladies know that products get discontinued at a rapid pace but I hope this one sticks around for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Shea Moisture products but this Curling Souffle is just not where it&#x27;s at. I&#x27;ve used this product on wet hair, slightly damp hair, and dry hair. Pros: smells wonderful, gives awesome shine, a little goes a long way.  Cons: consistency is gritty/oily/runny, very sticky on hands and after hair has been set with it. I&#x27;ve tried to use it in conjunction with the Curl Enhancing Smoothie and my hair just felt weighted and sticky still. Normally my twist-outs and curl former sets come out very well and last at least 3-4 days with humidity and about 1-2 weeks in less humid drier weather. But when I used this product with my curl former set, (weather was about 70-75 very low humidity and mostly sunny) my curls looked great and shiny and bouncy that morning but by the end of the day they shrunk and was starting to revert to my curl pattern. I tried to pineapple my hair like normal to keep the curls longer but by the next morning the curls were flat sticky squiggles that seemed to be trying to revert while I slept on my satin pillow case. Smh and my twist outs are shiny but flat and only last 2 days with this when they normally last a week.</li>
            <li> I had this product for about six months.  When I first used it, I was expecting it to be like a gel of some sort.  Kind of like Kinky Curly Curling Custard (KCCC).  It did not work like it at all.  For starters, it is much more oily and a bit looser than KCCC.  It is hard to explain but I had KCCC and while it was slimy, it didn&#x27;t leave oil trails.  With this product, it was harder to gather in your hands and much more slippery.  I applied it on damp and dry hair.  It didn&#x27;t define curls as I hoped so I put it away in my closet, planning to give it away to a cousin of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While doing a yearly closet purge, I forgotten that I had this in my possession.  I decided to use it again.  After I did a conditioner washed, I applied a fairly generous amount combed my hair back into a ponytail and tied a scarf around my hair.  My hair was defined but frizzy at the same time.  So what I did was use some Eco Styler gel (that I am trying to use up) and applied it over my hair and tied my scarf around. It worked for me that way. My hair wasn&#x27;t left hard and I didn&#x27;t form any flakes when I did it this method. I was elated to find a use for it because I hate wasting product.  I will use it up but I will doubt I will purchase again.  There are too many products out there for me to try.  I feel that this might work for someone with a looser and less porous hair than mine.  I hope this helps someone.  And please remember that your mileage may vary with any hair product.</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price. This product sells for around $10 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target ( stores and online) and a variety of drugstores. This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products. They make a fine product at a reasonable price. This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> I try all kind of products for natural curly hair all the time and I don´t really make reviews often, but I really needed to talk about this.  I have used this product once now, but I can already say I am in love with this.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a very humid place and my hair tends to get very frizzy.  I usually wash my hair one day on and one day off.  Normally I need to apply lots of gel one day and next day I spray my hair with water and conditioner and then apply some more gel or mousse, well with this, I applied firts the same brand Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Milk  ad then a gentle amount of the curling souffle.  I let it air dry, first day the hair was a bit heavy but it was ok since it makes me look well styled at work but second and third day, my hair was awsome, I just needed to spray water in the morning fix it a little bit and I was good to go.  My hair still look great but I just can´t say 4 days with out washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I should mention my hair is a mid length (just passed my neck and got to the shoulders)mix of 3b and 3c.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review could help you to decide if this product will be right for you.  By the way, I got it for 10.99 at walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful on my 4b hair! It did nothing to enhance the curl, and actually made my hair very dry. When I read the ingredients I figured out why - GLYCERIN! If your hair doesn&#x27;t do well with glycerin (mine HATES glycerin) then do not, I repeat, DO NOT purchase this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of combinations of products on my 3B/C hair, and nothing works better than than the combination of this gel souffle and the SM Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie. I combine a small amount of both in my hands and apply, comb through, then rake and scrunch. I get soft curls, no frizz, and a good amount of non-crunchy hold if I scrunch again after it&#x27;s dry. On top of that, I have pretty decent second and even third day hair. It&#x27;s a winning combination, and I hope these two products will always be available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for one year, and I finally feel I can offer a review on it!&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have a ton of densely packed tight, pen-spring sized coils and curls that are thin and fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product I was WAY too heavy-handed! I applied it as if I were applying a leave-in conditioner creme or hair grease. A BIG BIG...BIG...no-no. My hair was STICKY. It was highly moisturized, glossy and defined...but I felt like if I wasn&#x27;t careful, Winnie the Pooh would be after my honey with all that sticky agave-nectar-goodness I had going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then did a 70% SheaMoisture Curling Smoothie/30% Gel Soufflé mix and that was pretty good for the cooler Autumn/Winter months where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The agave nectar really attracted the moisture in the air, the flaxseed gave me a bit of shine and hold, and the shea butter really conditioned and moisturized my hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that it&#x27;s summer, I have again had to rethink how I use this product. Cremes, oddly enough, do not completely absorb into my hair in these hot months and seem to just sit on top of and coat my hair. So I revised this gel by applying it to damp strands SPARINGLY (for every square inch of hair, I am applying about 1/4 dime-sized amounts). I separate my 5-7inch length hair into quadrants, and each quadrant gets no more than a US size tablespoon, usually less. If I want to make a style out of the twists, I apply a thin coating of Ecostyler w/ Olive Oil gel to each twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get amazing and well-moisturized afro results now that I know how light-handed I must be with this product. It provides absolutely no definition that you would expect from \\&quot;gel\\&quot; for me, and that&#x27;s fine. It is the only moisturizer in my kit that makes my hair 1. Plush 2. Shiny 3. Glossy 4. Juicy 5. Fluffy. When the definition goes away from my hair (in 60-80% humidity, this happens w/in 1-2 hours), I have about 20 large cute chunky S and Z shapes all over, so no matter what happens to the hair throughout the summer, it always looks like I \\&quot;meant to do that,\\&quot; which is great!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product loses one star because of how sticky it can be and because if I get too much near my scalp it starts to itch like crazy. If you have a sensitive scalp that&#x27;s easily irritated, you&#x27;ll have to find something to keep it happy. For me, that something is just plain water.</li>
            <li> No it did not meet my expectations, the seller shows one picture on display and sends s different product, i wanted the curling souffle, as shown on the picture above, not the (gel) written out of view</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Target with  the intention of buying the Shea Moisture Kit (sold out).  I use this product on two strand twist outs.  Users suggest going lightly on the product because it goes a long way.  I used lightly but my hair looked dry the next day. Hair was soft to the touch but no sheen. Based on reviews it seems you get moisture based on the amount used.  I will use it until finished. Perhaps portion is key.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been natural since birth, so no doubt I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products. My hair is prob between a 3 and 4 all over. I&#x27;ve tried KCCC and I really liked it however it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing for my hair especially since I used it all the time with out a moisturizer.  I&#x27;m very pro low maintence and I have the wash and go style all the time. This works the best for me. I wash my hair with come clean. I use the deep moisturizer for about 30 min with a cap by Shea moisture and then wash out leaving very little. I use the curling smoothie by Shea moisture to detangle. I&#x27;m heavy handed so if there&#x27;s too much product after detangling then I rinse a little. Finally I really just separate my hair with my fingers and apply soufflé all over then shake. You really don&#x27;t have to use too much. Then I add a little of Jane carter condition and sculpt all over and gently pull and even my kinky curls with my fingers then shake shake shake my hair again. Then I use the blow dryer if I&#x27;m in a rush to get the excess water out. The next day I just allow a lil water from the shower in my hair, if needed add a lil more soufflé, shake and blow dry. This method keeps my hair MOISTURIZEd and when I&#x27;m lazy I can get 2 weeks out of it and it still looks great, but by that time it&#x27;s time for a wash. Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> Adds more shine than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, but leaves the hair feeling sticky and straw-like.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product. I have 4a hair and after wearing weave as a protective style, I take the weave out and rock the natural for a bit. After reading lots of various reviews and watching YouTube reviews, I decided to use this as a gel instead of the Ecostyler. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I am a fan of Shea Moisture products and this is not an exception. It held my tight curls and added shine. I love it! Also, it did not have my hair hard and brittle, instead it left it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff leaves my hair sticky and undefined. i usually have very curly hair and my sets---curlformers, twist-outs---come out fine and last for at least a week or two. not with this product!! i curlformed my freshly-washed hair using this product and the results have been disappointing time after time. absolutely horrible and sticky and frizzy. wthhhh ugh waste of 5 hours of setting</li>
            <li> There was definitely a learning curve using this product on my fine, kinky hair. It has a goopy consistency and will sit tacky on the hair, especially if you&#x27;ve used too much. I was baffled for weeks as to how to use this gel until I finally figured out what works for me. I wet my hands and run them through my dry, stretched hair until slightly damp. I dip my fingers into the gel, only enough to coat them. Then I apply the product from root to tip of my hair as I section and twist. This method leaves my twists shiny and gives them great hang. My twist-out afterwards feels soft and moisturized for days while still being softly defined. This gel works great in conjunction with steaming your hair in the shower for ultimate moisture as well. One container of this lasted me a little over a year.</li>
            <li> I have medium fine hair dry hair.  I was a little skeptical at first, but I LOVE this stuff.  Unlike other commercial gels, this actually nourishes my hair and holds it using things like fruit pectin and sugar.  A little goes a long way, and if I apply it to dry hair it gives it a wet look like a pommade.  I live in a very humid environment, so it takes a couple hours for it to dry and my hair to soak it up.  Once it does, my hair doesn&#x27;t look like it has product in it and becomes very soft yet holds curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had known about this sooner, before using so much crappy hairspray.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Shea Moisture Curling Souffle because I wanted a product that would slick my hair down. I have been going to the gym five days a week and my hair has been so puffy from the sweat.I have short 4-B hair and I am in that awkward phase of letting my hair grow back. My last relaxer was a month ago. When I first tried the product, I washed, conditioned, and towel-dried my hair. I brushed my hair back and applied a small amount of curling souffle. After reading some suggestions from other reviewers, I applied the Shea Moisture Extra Moisture Transitioning Milk on top of the souffle to cut down on the stickiness. I wrapped my hair up in a silk scarf, ran the hand dryer over it for five minutes, and went to bed. When I woke up the next morning and took off my scarf, I was surprised to see how slick my hair was. I never seen my hair lay down and shine so much. When I got to work, one of my co-workers asked me if I got a relaxer. I told her no that I just washed it. She was very surprised because that day before, my hair was looking like a hot mess. Both products made my hair smell very good. YOU CANNOT USE THIS PRODUCT BY ITSELF OR THERE WILL BE A HIGH LEVEL OF STICKINESS!</li>
            <li> I love Shea Moisture products and was wanting to try this because I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Kinky Curly Curling Custard.  This is the product I have been looking for! It does what KC does but much cheaper. I have 4a/4b hair and this does just fine for my twists and twistouts.  PLEASE do not use too much of this product--a little goes a long way and also be careful about what you layer with it--this may explain some of the \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling some have complained about.  Since starting to use this, I have not had to put any extra gels, oils or serums in my hair. It provides great stretch, great curl definition, and my hair looks good day to day --just refresh in the morning with a spritz from my spray bottle and off I go!</li>
            <li> This is basically honey in a jar. That&#x27;s the best way I can describe it. I put this on freshly washed hair, and then sat under the hood dryer. The next morning, my hair still wasn&#x27;t dry. It left my hair a sticky mess. So I had to wash it out immediately. I am so happy I tried this product on a weekend rather than a day I had to go to work, because then I would have been SOL.  People say that you should only put a tiny bit your hair, or that you should mix it with the smoothie, or the hair milk, but that&#x27;s too troublesome to me. I want a product that I can just put on my hair and go, without worrying if I put too much or to little, or that I have to mix it with something else to work. Especially with the price. I have cheaper products that moisturize and style my hair on their own. I don&#x27;t want to be a hair chemist to make my hair look nice. I want something that is quick and easy, and this is not it. This was just a huge pain for me.  On the bright side. It&#x27;s smell really nice as all Shea Moisture products do.  EDIT: I finally found a good use for this. I tried using it for kinky twist, and it worked really well for that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because Sally’s was out of the product I normally use. The cashier actually tried to discourage me from buying it stating many naturals did not like it. But I purchased it anyway thinking I would give it a try. I applied it after my leave-in and oil as a styler and it left my hair extremely shrunken, dry, and crunchy. Admittedly I may have used to much based on the other reviews, but the product is so watery it’s hard to determine how much to use to be effective. Also, because of the watery consistency it was difficult to get the product out of the jar and onto your hair. The one positive I can think of it is it has a really nice smell. Overall I did not like this product at all and will not be using it again. Giving it two stars because some of my disappointing results could be due to using too much.</li>
            <li> First let me say, this product is no where near $31 at Target or Walgreens. You can get it as well as the other shea moisture products for $9.99 at these stores!! Anyway, I have been transitioning to natural for 7 months now and still learning what products work for my hair. I must say that I have really fallen in love with the Shea Moisture line. I used the curling smoothie and like it, but stumbled across the souffle&#x27; and wanted to see what the difference was. My first time using the souffle I used way too much so it made my hair feel like a sticky gummy mess! It has a bit of an oily, gel like consistency, unlike the smoothie which is like a creamy moisturizer. My hair needs oil so I was cool with that and I quickly discovered that I didn&#x27;t have to apply the souffle as heavy as the smoothie on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;In my second attempt to use the curling souffle, I cowashed my hair with conditioner and olive oil, then I used the shea moisture coconut and hibiscus styling milk as a leave in and then LIGHTLY applied the curling souffle to parted sections of my hair as I flat twisted. My hair comes to about the middle of my neck and I have 4a/4b hair type and I only needed to use about a finger dab or two of this product for each twist. I also noticed that it made my natural hair really curly and defined as I applied it to each section. I sat under the hair dryer for about 45 minutes, tied my hair with a satin scarf and untwisted it the next day. I wore flat twists in the front and used the curling souffle like a gel to make sure my twists stayed smooth and shiny. The back of my hair that was untwisted was very shiny, fluffy and soft but with just enough hold and it really minimized my frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I love this product and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> (FYI: I&#x27;m a 3c/4a with thick hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Finally! Since I became natural, I can&#x27;t tell you how many products I&#x27;ve tried. They all failed me. Now, I&#x27;m sooo excited about this product. Thank you, Shea Moisture people! Never--I repeat--never, have I had second day curls. With this product, I don&#x27;t have to worry about wetting my hair down all the time. It keeps my hair curly and moisturized, and the shine is great. I love the texture of the product. I believe people who have commented about it being too sticky may have been using far too much. A little of this natural product with organic ingredients goes a long way because of the quality! If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it--DO IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago at Target on a whim. I used it as directed, but it made my hair feel weird... not greasy or tacky... but there was a residue whenever I touched my hair... I started keeping my hair in braids then and stopped using it. One day I was braiding my hair and thought why not use it as a moisturizer and it worked very well... my hair didn&#x27;t shrink as rapidly and my hair felt healthier and fuller, smoother.. the last time I braided my hair I decided to try it on my scalp, and that was the best idea ever. I have been suffering from psoriasis for years now, and nothing short of using a medicated oil (suspended steroids, which will thin your hair with prolonged use) has ever given me sustained relief... my scalp always sheds huge brown flakes - so embarrassing.. this stuff actually coats my scalp and soothes it, the flakes just lift off and I don&#x27;t feel the rawness that I normally would... my scalp feels great! Not at all itchy! This stuff is a lifesaver, one tub will last you a LONG time - a little goes a long, long way... I really think SheaMoisture needs to start marketing this product as a moisturizer and not a styling gel...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner, this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried on my hair. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I am a true natural with mixed type 3b and 4a/4b hair. I use this Shea Moisture curling souffle and the Shea Moisture curling smoothie and my hair will last as a wash and go for at least 2 weeks and as twists for 3 weeks.  I think most naturals use too much of the wrong products on their hair.  My curls are very tight and springy, but they are also full of movement and shine.  If you are not getting results from this product, there is a problem with your hair care technique.  I use for myself and 3 daughters.  We range from wavy/straight to kinky/kinky and the results are always long lasting and superb. The trick is the right mix and right amount of product.  For the Shea Moisture line a little goes a long way.  If you go overboard, it will not work very well. One jar of this on 4 heads of very thick, curly and long hair will last 2-3 months.  The curling smoothie will last 2 months on 4 heads of thick, curly and long hair.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my curls. I&#x27;m a Native/African American mixed woman, at the end of my transition from chemically relaxed to natural hair. I&#x27;ve had curls before, but using this product I&#x27;ve gotten the best definition I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s crazy how curly my hair actually is with this stuff. I&#x27;ve only used it on wet hair so far, since that seems to work for me. I cant go on about it enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason i only gave it four stars...I use this gel in the morning after a shower, and it holds all day, which is great...but at night, my hair feels....fairly gross. Thick with product, kind of tacky. The gel will leave residue on your hands if you touch your hair during the day. I&#x27;m willing to deal with these things for the sake of the great results, but if you&#x27;re looking for a light product that won&#x27;t weigh your hair down, this might not be it. I have really thick type 4 hair so I don&#x27;t notice the product in it until I&#x27;m trying to get ready for bed, but it will make itself known during the day if you touch your hair a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m under the impression that the residue and tacky feelings are jus a hazard of using these types of gel curling agents, though, so I didn&#x27;t want to rate it badly. It does exactly what it says it will, and when I wash it out in the morning, my hair feels soft and is still super curly.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I towel dried my hair and applied it to damp hair. I tend to be heavy handed with hair products and applied quite a bit especially since the consistency was thin. My hair was so sticky! I really wanted to like this product due to the ingredients. I decided to try again but this time without towel drying and using less. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE RESULTS! It&#x27;s soft and shiny and I get 2nd and 3rd day hair! I can now do wash n go&#x27;s and it looks better than when I took time to twist it! HUGE FAN! Just ordered 2 more jars just in case. Great product if you find how it works best for your hair type.</li>
            <li> I love this product and very happy that I was able to replace the only thing that worked which had cones in it.  I have super thick, tight curls - think Bernadette Peters, Rosanna Dana, Dee Snider (twisted sister), just a lot of bulk and thickness and medium to thick coarseness of strand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the product in the shower and apply generously to my just rinsed hair and then \\&quot;plop\\&quot; (on top of head, not twisted in the material) in a long sleeved t-shirt or similar material and wrap my head up in it for at least 30 minutes to get the excess moisture out. I no longer use terry and avoid microfiber even, because my hair is very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have mostly 4b/c hair with 4a in the back and this product gives me a defined moisturized twist out all the time.  First I apply the Shea Coconut Hibiscus Styling Milk and then a very light application of the souffle.  I repeat a very LIGHT application of the souffle so that your hair won&#x27;t be a sticky mess.  I hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so by reading the reviews here and talking to friends in person, this is a product that if you love it (and more importantly, if your HAIR loves it), you really LOVE it, but if you hate it...well, yeah, you really HATE it! I really love it, and my hair hates almost everything. I have elbow-length, ultra-dry, 4C hair, zero visible curl pattern, tangles extraordinarily easily, must be kept in protective styles to be manageable. If there was a 4z, I am sure THAT would be my hair, LOL. I use these to put my hair in 2-strand twists and to seal my ends. It keeps them very moist and when it is time to undo the twists, they come out smoothly without the typical, tangled, nightmare. I have been using for a couple of years now and I still continue to have good results. I use it pretty liberally (package recommends using sparingly) when I twist. I part off a section, make sure my hair is thoroughly wet, apply a good amount of the souffle, comb it through with my wide-tooth comb, and then twist into small sections. My hair not only can take this without any resulting stickiness or residue, but it loves it. Also, it may be pricey, but even though I have a lot of hair and use a decent amount, a jar of this lasts me a realllllly long time. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I love all Shae Moisture products. My aunt introduced them to me and I have been hooked. I have 4a/b hair with a \\&quot;S\\&quot; cork screw curl pattern. I took this to my salon to use it for two strand twists. This was hairstylist and my first time using this product. The twists held well and then on day four I took the twists out for a twist out and let&#x27;s just say this helped me fall deeper in love with my natural hair. The product is a quite sticky even after sitting under the dryer. But as the week progressed my hair just kept getting better and the stickiness wore off  for the most part. My hair is shiny and soft to the touch. I think the next time I do twists I will use even less of the product to see if that will help with the  and layer it with some Ecostyler Green. It really helped with stretch and gave my &#x27;fro more definition and character. So I will probably buy it again especially if my next effort is more successful.  I also had limited frizz.</li>
            <li> It feels very oily and it the consistency is  like jello. I wouldn&#x27;t get this if you have 4 type hair. It doesn&#x27;t define your hair at all but makes it limp. Its not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this product 5 stars but unfortunatly I can&#x27;t First  of all like most reviewers say this product is way too slimy,  greasy &amp; leaves a sticky film on your hands when it dries  (it actually never feels like it&#x27;s dry because hours after using this stuff your hair still feels sticky to the touch)  I must admit this product gave me some of the shiniest waves &amp; curls  I could ever imagine........... however i wound up going back to Walgreens for a refund because of the sticky gummy feel it leaves on your hair.  I hope the MFG of this product reads these reviews because if they improved on this product it could rate 5 stars*****</li>
            <li> I hated this product at first. it left my hair curly, but sticky. i gave up on it, and went back to my other products. HOWEVER one day, I ran out of my usual stuff, and gave it a try again. This time, I washed, and detangled my hair. raked leave-in throughout my hair and let it air dry a bit. while it was still (a little) damp, i raked the Shea Souffle through my hair, and sealed it with coconut oil. the curls came out soft, shiny, and frizz-free. It&#x27;s now my product of choice, and yes, i&#x27;ve had the same results each time. As for that price! I got mine at a Walgreen&#x27;s for way less. If it&#x27;s not available in your neighborhood, then definitely order. I go through this in 2 months, but my hair is very dense and tightly curled.</li>
            <li> I have 2b-3a fine dense high porosity hair, I use this a sealer before mousse and gel, it works great for clumping and curl retention and gives incredible shine. A little goes a long way. Just don&#x27;t spend the money here, go get it at Target, CVS Drugstore.com for less then half the price!</li>
            <li> My hair is very short. Depending on the occasion, sometimes I wear twists and other times I wear small curls, either way this is the perfect styling gel to use for either look. It can be a little oily, so be careful not to apply too much.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product to enhance her natural curl pattern for the &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; look.  I have dreadlocks and tried some of hers hoping that it would control frizz and give my dreads a little curl.  It didn&#x27;t really give the desired effect and I thought that it might cause buildup in my dreads, so I decided to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light-handed with all of my products and don&#x27;t like anything heavy in my hair at all, so this is a great product for me. It&#x27;s very light. I place a finger in it and the product is so light it almost feels like no product is on my hand, but it is. I apply it to each section of my hair then gently comb it through. It helps with detangling, as my hair tends to re-tangle as I style it. The product also helped to keep my hair elongated in twists, and did not have an offensive odor to it. I never used a gel-like product before due to the awful ingredients in most of them, but this product has lots of natural/good ingredients that I like using on my hair. It also provides a good hold for my hair without it being stiff and dry. Also, this product is only about 10 bucks in stores.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this product. However, I do not like the consistency of the product. Some come in jelly form and other I hear come in liquid form. I would love to try the liquid form and see how that varies. It leaves a sticky residue on anything in touches which I&#x27;m not too thrilled about. Overall I have not had the chance to really get a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; use from it. Hopefully the liquid form is much better</li>
            <li> I have 4b 4c tight coily curly hair.  I have tried twist outs in the past that didn&#x27;t last more than a day due to frizzing.  Last time I tried was 7 months into transition.  Now I am 10 months in and have learned more about my hair.  I am using this on top of my homemade Shea butter mixture that I found on YouTube.  Hoping that together these two will define my twists properly and it will last longer.  Will come back with full results and review.  One thing I noticed was that this does elongate and stretch curls very nicely and helps keep hair detangled.  My hair tangles very quickly once I let go of it after comb out.  More later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok....I slathered a lot of this product on so it took a very long time to dry.  Wasn&#x27;t completely dry when I took it down so for this reason I won&#x27;t use as much next time.  This defines very very well.  The natural part of my hair was stretched and shiny and if u don&#x27;t put to much the ends of your permed hair will be soft and curly.  I use small rods on my ends after twisting.  I&#x27;m also going to try this without using Shea butter cream before product.  The result is a beautifully defined twist out if your hair is completely dry.  My hair is thick and curly..this cuts frizz dramatically.  Giving product a 5.  Retwisting tonight with a bit more gel so I will see how it looks on second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/09/12- Just an update giving my conclusion: If you use too much of this your hair simply won&#x27;t dry and therefore you may have frizz.  I will use this sparingly next time but I do think that it&#x27;s good, less expensive than kinky curly product and will go further because you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> Hello Curly Girls..:)...I have tried literally every product on the market for curly hair in trying to achieve the \\&quot;moist..\\&quot;defined\\&quot; ..\\&quot;shiny\\&quot; curls that I so desire...my hair is a combination of 3a and 3b and reaches 2-3 inches below the middle of my back...Gels like eco-gel were drying and have way too many chemicals that strip color..Deva curl and Ouidad are GREAT for washing ..co-washing and conditioning but I needed lasting shine and definition.....and those so called \\&quot;oils\\&quot; like argan and macadamia are actually filled with silicones and only lend a temporary shine to thick, curly somewhat pourous hair...the real argan oil is so expensive for a tiny bit..(a tad bit of pure organic coconut is much better).I almost gave up because the moist shiny curl would only last during day 1..and about 6 hours later.. after my hair has touched my sweaters..chair..coat..couch or whatever..here comes the frizzy BS..uggghhh!...I had used the Shea Moisture SHAMPOO for curly hair and it worked nicely..(the raw shea butter version works better)..but its a shampoo and it didn&#x27;t work for the style...so I came across SM Curling Gel Souffle ..looked at the ingredients which were yummy looking and natural..no sulfates..and REAL oils..I also noticed that although its the same texture.. it was made much better than Kinky Curly and costs MUCH less...so I took it home and tried it............WOW...after washing with SM Raw Shea Butter Shampoo( which I mentioned earlier) ..and separating my hair into four sections.. I coated my hair sections with Deva Care One Condition..a tiny bit of PURE coconut oil..and a dime sized dollop of SM Curling Souffle for each section..twisted each section ..let air dry for 20 minutes..then used the diffuser as i untwisted gently...FINALLY..the curls came out smooth and defined...they lasted for for 5 days!!!!..with so little frizz !!  and my \\&quot;hang time\\&quot;..stayed the duration...I am completely sold!!..You must start out with a little and gradually increase according to THE NEEDS OF YOUR HAIR TYPE...this product is fantastic...and Im very happy i found it...</li>
            <li> I would give this product 10 stars...If there was any. It&#x27;s amazing. It does wonders to my hair. (3b/3c) hair texture. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it as a moisturizer. I like it better than the smoothie, too. I wash my hair with sheamoisture (skip the restorative conditioner I used to use, made my hair dry) and then add this on top. It stays moisturized for days. To keep it fresh, I add a chunk of it to a spray bottle, with water, and I used this on my twists. Deep conditioning totally not necessary - this product does all the work.</li>
            <li> I tried this product different ways to try to make it work. I tried it with a heavy hand, I tried very little, I tried large sections, I tried small sections, I tried it with other products, I tried it alone and NONE OF IT WORKED. I give up. I will give the rest of this away. Every time I tried this, I had hard, unmanageable hair. The Souffle smells like heaven and my hair was SUPER SOFT while it was wet, but once it dried, it was crunchy and tangly. Will NEVER buy this product again.</li>
            <li> works well for my children&#x27;s hair who are mixed along with the Shea moisture leave in hair care, I might by it again but not sure if it is worth the $ or if I should just continue to use the echo styling gel.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my hair shiny and brings out my curl pattern. The only downside is that it is very sticky and can leave my hair sticky as well. I spray my hair with water to remove some of the stickiness. I am still playing with the product to find a solution to this. But, it is still a stable in my hair products regime.</li>
            <li> I have brown super curly corkscrew hair. I have been transferring away from the non-organic non-natural sulfate and alcohol loaded products and am always trying new organic ones. I saw this product at Target and it smell heavenly, the ingredients were literally all natural things you find in a flower shop, or in nature and so... I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I was turned off by the texture initially but after I got it into my hands and rubbed them together, I scrunched my hair upside-down and flipped back up, and TA DA! It was amazing. My hair kept the curls all day without much frizz (I will put more towards the roots next time)it was a 90+ degree day with high humidity. The gel was not greasy in my hair and didn&#x27;t give that hard feel or stink up my hair all day. Buy this product if you deal with curly hair issues on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;I am officially a HUGE fan!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. It is one of my 3 staples for my 4z hair. I use it by doing medium twists on wet hair. I then leave the twists in for about a week and voila! I have curls that I never knew I had. I love that this product has good ingredients and I only needed a second jar after about 3 months of use. Do not worry about the negative reviews, try it for yourself and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Why?  I use gel based products in the humid summer months.  Cream based products in the dry winter months.  This advice was given by Felicia Leatherwood, a natural hair stylist, and it really does make a difference.  I would apply this product for wash &#x27;n&#x27; go&#x27;s and braid outs and it worked really well.  I noticed that the Shea Moisture line of products can not be mixed with non-organic hair products.  For instance, if you are using a shampoo or conditioner with &#x27;cones or sulfates, you will not get the best results.  Or at least I didn&#x27;t :)    Like other posters have mentioned, it&#x27;s cheaper in your local drugstores.  However, I would encourage posters not to downgrade the product review based on third party sellers.  The product review should focus on the product and how it works.  Not to give a one star rating because of the price.    The reason the price is high on Amazon is because there are places in the U.S. where the product is hard to find.  My friends on the west coast can not find it in their local stores.  So the product is being sold at a price people will pay.  When the supply catches up the price will go down.  Economics 101.  So calm down, Amazon is not trying to steal your money.  If you can find it somewhere cheaper, that is where you should buy it.  For those who can not find it anywhere and are desperate, this is an option for them.    UPDATED 10/13/14:  I liked the pink label Shea Moisture Products.  However, I switched to Shea Moisture&#x27;s Gold Label Shampoo and Deep Conditioner because my hair needed the extra moisture.  I am looking forward to trying some of their newer product lines, Tahitian Monoi and Jamaican Black Castor Oil as well.  I find their products work so much better together.  They are staples for my hair care.      Also, I liked Shea Moisture&#x27;s page on Facebook (sometime last year) and I was able to get coupons!  I am still using them because they have no expiration date.  Not sure if they still offer this promotion butI have seen coupons occasionally in my Sunday paper.  Every little bit helps especially when they are running a buy one get one free sale.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  Yes, leaves a residue on my hands after I use it but I simply wash my hands and the residue disappears.  Leaves my two-strand twist outs soft, shiny, and elongated.  I haven&#x27;t yet tried it on a wash-n-go and probably won&#x27;t as it will probably not have any effect on my particularly porous hair texture.  Will definitely repurchase it (as long as the formula isn&#x27;t changed)!</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b/4c hair. I use this product on every twist out and it gives my hair hold and moisture! Its also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m a mixed chick, black and filipino. I have 3b and 3c curls.The thing my hair craves most is moisture and the curling souffle provides the perfect amount for me. It makes my hair shiny, silky and elongates my curls. The key to maximizing this product is in the application. A lot off people complain about the stickiness or crunchiness and its probably because they applied too much product. What&#x27;s so great about the souffle is that less is more. Which means more bang for your buck. You just have to know how to apply it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start off by cowashing and apply a leave-in and coconut oil. I then part my hair into 6 sections. While my hair is still wet I apply a nickel size amount of the souffle to each section. I brush thru with a denman brush to get the best distribution throughout my hair. Then I lightly dry my ends with a cotton shirt so they&#x27;re not dripping wet. Finally I will scrunch about a little more than a quarter-size amount of the pink ecostyler gel into my hair and let air dry. My curls a shiny, frizz free, soft and moisturized and I easily achieve 2nd, 3rd and 4th day hair. If any frizz shows up just spritz with water and finger coil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this helps answer some questions. This product is absolutely amazing. I definitely recommend. But try looking for it at your local walmart or target. You can usually find it for around $10-$11.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Here is a checklist to get te best results. 1) use it on clean hair 2) use a light leave in conditioner 3) use very sparingly... Do not use too much!</li>
            <li> On a positive note, this stuff smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;But my hair hated it!! I have 3c/4a hair.  I washed and conditioned my hair, applied the Knot Today as a leave-in, then used this product on my two strand twists. As i was applying it I had the feeling I was making a huge mistake lol. It felt sticky and tacky, and it just kind of sat on my hair. I thought since I was doing a twistout, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt too much. Boy oh boy was i wrong. I took out my twists the next morning, which took forever because my hair was stuck together -_- and i looked a hot sticky frizzy homeless mess. Not the business. So I washed it out immediately...I never leave reviews, but i had to for this one. This product isnt for everyone, so buyer beware. I bought mine for $11 at Target. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I recently went natural and needed a styler for my twa. I purchased this at Walmart, with the intention of making my curls more defined. This product is a total joke, it make my hair extremely sticky and it didnt help my hair curl at all, it actually made it frizzier. Irritated that I paid $9 for this product that is going directly in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have avoided this product for a while due to the negative reviews but on a whim, I decided to try it. I am so glad I did. I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve tried the Smoothie and the Styling Milk previously and they were just okay.  The Souffle gives me defined, moisturized, elongated curls. This is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever used that combated shrinkage and have gotten 2nd day hair out of. Most gels leave my hair dry as straw but this is perfect. If your hair is coming out sticky I suspect you are using way too much. My hair is 3b/c, about waist length, I am heavy handed and use a TON of product and still don&#x27;t get sticky, oily hair. I use they Styling Milk on damp hair and rake the Souffle through my hair and let it air dry. The results are wonderful.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair feel sticky and gross! I hate it!!</li>
            <li> ...because I did and I&#x27;m sad I never gave this a chance until now. It works so much better than the eco-styler I&#x27;ve been using. The smell is lush and lingers on the hair for days, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. Its a nice subtle coconut smell. When applying to the hair, you really need much less than you think, if it starts to feel sticky on your fingers, you&#x27;ve got too much. I just dip two of my fingers in and begin to twist my hair, one dip per twist is plenty. I also use a little bit to slick down the edges of my hair which works great btw. The first time I used this, my hair felt a little sticky and I thought I over did it, but when I allowed my hair to dry that feeling went away and I was left with soft, moisturized, lightweight hair that was shiny! My twists/curls were defined and had a soft hold. I have been able to get 4-5 day hair from this with the occasional frizzies but this blows eco-styler out of the water. Not to mention it has good things for my hair, agave, coconut oil, flax seed, a little bit of glycerin, shea butter and vitamin E just to name a few. Whenever I happen to run out, which might take a while, I plan on getting this again.</li>
            <li> I came across these products at Walgreens and after much deliberation and following through on the decision to only use natural products on my hair I first bought the SM Curl Souffle then the Curl Smoothie. After making the decision to go natural I was concerned about how rebellious my hair was. More recently I discovered that I was a 4C curl type. I had decided to read up on the products after I had bought them and was surprised to learn I had the results that some of the individuals represented here had--curl definition came slowly but surely after my hair took on and accepted the moisture (my hair will not tolerate straight grease-it just sits on my scalp and hair and doesn&#x27;t moisturize.) I was able to actually comb thru my hair with little to no damage. My hair retains a lot of water but not moisture so when air hits it it instantly dries out. With the use of these/this products my hair has been moisturized and curly for days with cute little curls. As a matter of fact, it looks like a may have gotten a curl!:) I have decided to use this product as more of a finishing gel to refresh and for shine, which it does very well. And its true--a little does go a long way, which is excellent for the price. And the odor has not gotten stale on my hair, which some hair products do. It also rinses off your hands very nicely, which means I can look forward to little or no product being left in my hair. And with seborrhic dermatitis in and on my scalp the benefits of these and this product are nice. I am looking forward to what is to come with these products, as I have just recently purchased the Deep Treatment Masque [with the gold label.] I recommend to give the souffle a try!!</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks man. I have a mixture of 3c/3b curls in my hair and this works wonderful. As long as I don&#x27;t use regular sulfate shampoo. Then my hair goes on a rampage. anyhow, this works way better than eco styler. It&#x27;s lighter but it does the job just as well as eco, and you can actually eat this lol. I tried it. It&#x27;s actually pretty yummy. lol. Weird side note Ik. But it defines my curls very well like regular gel. And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like eco. Which is a big plus, or dry my hair out, another plus. So don&#x27;t be skeptical, just experiment with it and you&#x27;ll love it. Also, this stuff is a bit messy lol.</li>
            <li> I love all of shea moisture products, so I was eager to try this one.  As others have said it is similar to the Kinky Curly Curling Custard but I like this product better! It adds beautiful shine and hold to the 3c/4a/4b types of hair in my family, and defines our curls much better than KCCC.  It can be a little sticky and will make curls crunchy if too much is used so I offer this advice - start out with less (one dip per twist or a dime sized amount for large sections of hair) then slowly increase as needed.  Also applying to wet hair seems to work best for my family.  We use after washing/conditioning and after lightly spritzing with water for morning touch ups to our styles.  This product truly lasts - we can go 3-4 months before replacing.  We love this product and 100% recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Like others who have posted reviews about this product, I:&lt;br /&gt;1. Am glad that I didn&#x27;t read the negative reviews prior to making my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;2. Immediately realized that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t understand why it is being sold for such a high price on this site when it is $9.99 at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 4 b/c hair and had just about given up on having a successful twistout. On a whim, I decided to try Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie and Curling Souffle. What a winning combination!! First, I made four large sections in my hair, lightly misted with water so my hair was just damp NOT wet then worked about a fingerful of Curl Enhancing Smoothie into each section so they were moisturized. Then I began to work through each section. I divided a section in two, dipped JUST my index finger into the Curling Souffle, then applied the Souffle to one of the newly divided sections. I used a Denman brush to detangle (and immediately saw definition that I hadn&#x27;t with other products) and then twisted the hair.  I moved on to a new section repeating these steps until all of my hair was in twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have commented that the Souffle feels \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t think so. When it is in the jar, it does have the consistency of Jello that hasn&#x27;t quite set but when I applied this product, my hair felt really moisturized. The outcome was fantastic!! I had a really defined twist out that stayed moisturized all day. I repeated the process the next night and got the same great results the next day. I&#x27;m planning to stick with these products!</li>
            <li> Loving this! First &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; that leaves my hair still feeling like hair; great curl and hold for my finger coils and flat twists; i have used both wet and dry/misted; i have several textures ranging from very kinky to fine. this bad boy tames them all!</li>
            <li> People dont be fooled by seller! ALL shea moisture products are $9.99 all walgreens and target and a few CVS stores have them but they are 9.99 at all these stores! Do not buy this from this seller. I wonder if we can report this to Amazon? Anyway these products are supreme. 3a/b curls loves these products! This gel is equal to kinky curly curling custard. I love the kinky curly but only use it sometimes due to the cost. I hope they never change the formula on their products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from Eco Styler Gel to Kinky Curly and everything worked pretty much the same with slight differences. UNTIL I tried this stuff!! I saw the bad reviews but I love this line so much, I decided to try it anyway when they had the buy one get one 50% off deal. I&#x27;m super glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair on Sunday, Styled it on Monday morning....it is now Thursday and I have not even had to refresh a single curl. This is the only gel that had EVER been able to hold my hair this long with no need to style in the morning!! AND my hair looks like it did on day 1. I&#x27;m not sure how much longer it will hold but I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I use this with Tresseme Naturals Volume Conditioner (I use it as a leave in with my Denman brush), a quarter size of the curl enhancing smoothie and them this stuff. I style and form curls as necessary and Voila!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is a bit sticky but once it dries, it gives great hold with shine.  I co-wash, use leave-in and use a coat (not too much) of Curling Gel Souffle.  My results are awesome.  Like others, I am so glad I didn&#x27;t let the negative comments stop me from purchasing this product!</li>
