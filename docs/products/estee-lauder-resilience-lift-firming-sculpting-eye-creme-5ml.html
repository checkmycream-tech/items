            <li> This is a free product that you can get from Estee Lauder counters.  I know because I work for Estee Lauder. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS!!!</li>
            <li> seems to be  good product</li>

            <li> Good product great price</li>
            <li> I bought this because  a friend recommended to me but they made my face itchy... so I returned it.</li>
            <li> It is great and I like it. I feel comfortable and some different after applying it. I will recommend it to my girl friends.</li>
            <li> great result tried 5 days already I can see the effect</li>
            <li> my wife is ok and she like soo much</li>
            <li> This product is a sample they give away at the malls and I was charged for something that is a giveaway!  I will never purchase something like this again online.</li>
            <li> Very good service and super fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Product is great, very happy customer,</li>
            <li> the description and the picture show this item is a gift set, but what i got is only one small bottle of eye creme.</li>
            <li> I forgot to notice the quantity.  That was disappointing after thinking that I was getting a really great deal on an Estee Lauder product.  Oh well, life is a lesson.  It is too soon to judge the product and decide whether I will get it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every day and have for years. My skin loves it.  Pleasant smell. Pleasant feel. People tell me I look good. I love the small jars--great for travel.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this but I did. It has to be old. Mascara is dried out or very little in it. The words are faded off the jars.&lt;br /&gt;Service was great. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great price for such a good cream.</li>
            <li> This helps with soothing my eyes after wearing eyeliner &amp; mascara. I love the pink &amp; gold of the container. I stocked up on 2. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Its really a great eye cream. The eyes looks marvelous after a week applying it. Use every morning and before sleep</li>
            <li> just received my Eye cream was very disappointment what&#x27;s the size the advertisement was very misleading but you get what you pay for</li>
