            <li>So awesome!!  </li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great advice and all, but that still means I have to go out to a beauty store and buy a gigantic developer</li>
            <li>But for those who do have brows, it makes them even more beautiful!</li>
            <li>and everything is handy to use!</li>
            <li>Result is good.</li>
            <li>This product is good reason for the 4 stars is for the price ..</li>
            <li>I love not having to fill in my eyebrows every morning!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Again, this is all based on my own experience.</li>
            <li>Also, BEWARE that this item can NOT be returned because it is considered hazardous material.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not stay more then one week.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Overall the product is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>And, even the salon treatments haven&#x27;t lasted me more than 1 1/2 - 2 weeks</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>There is so much I can say about this product and not all of it is good.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it was easy to mix.</li>
            <li>This is my second Godefroy  purchase and I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered light brown</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to mix and use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I mix two tints (light and medium brown) to get the most natural color.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>If you had thick light brows, it would be a great product.</li>
            <li>AND the price is right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products but none were as easy to apply or lasted as well as this.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but good product</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just the color of my eyebrows (blonde), but the color always turns out more gray than brown.</li>
            <li>The seller did contact me, and told me that it&#x27;s most likely the developer cream, and that I could use any 10% developer instead.</li>
            <li>first time it did not take going to retry and see what happens.</li>
            <li>My number one tip would have to be to avoid tinting your brows right before a big event or if you&#x27;ll be attending something special.</li>
            <li>At first i thought they were okay, but if you touch them with slightly wet hands, thats it, the whole thing is ruined.</li>
            <li>I have very think eyebrows</li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference because they are not noticeable.</li>
            <li>This kit makes it so much easier just to do it at home.</li>
            <li>by next week they&#x27;ve already faded a significant amount.</li>
            <li>This amazing product will color your brows for 3-4 weeks per application, and I really think it makes me look a little younger.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who aren&#x27;t used to having normal eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and only takes a few minutes from start to finish.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the kit in Dark Brown because i prefer bolder, thicker, brows, while my friend purchased the kit in Light Brown.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product I left it on for 2 min.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The whole process takes perhaps ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>too so now my eyes are completely done from the moment I wake up.  </li>
            <li>I received this item in the mail and it looks like it is 30 years old.</li>
            <li>maybe a little bit TOO bold.</li>
            <li>First off, the color doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the packaging says.</li>
            <li>Godefroy tint is like no other tint I have used before.</li>
            <li>And the fees at the salons are ridiculous for something so easy to do for something that can be done at home for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I follow instructions exactly, but it still turns green.</li>
            <li>So in the end i did get my wish of having bold, thick, brows.</li>
            <li>It was not long enough to cover the gray.  </li>
            <li>Apply to one brow at a time (they suggest using the wooden stick, but I use small dental brushes and apply it like mascara, but more heavily).  </li>
            <li>; I wished they sent a small free sample of the other colors too, so that custumers get a chance to try others, rather than having to buy 20 capsules for choosing a color.</li>

            <li> Ill tint my eyebrows on a monday and</li>
            <li> I have, for years, paid a crazy amount for eyebrow tinting every six week.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My brows and lashes lighten because of extensive swimming. I use this product about once a month, or as needed. It works very well and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to dye my black eyebrows, hoping it would turn medium brown, or at least dark brown. I followed the instructions and left it in for 5-7 minutes. I didn&#x27;t show any difference, so I tried again and same happened. I have sensitive skin so it irritated. On the plus side, it was easy to mix. It would probably work for blond eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I got this product good.but it&#x27;s not stay more then one week. Result is good.</li>
            <li> This is my second Godefroy  purchase and I am happy with it.  using&lt;br /&gt;it once a month works for me. Unfortunately you need a delicate touch&lt;br /&gt;which I don&#x27;t have  or you can look pretty scary. I&#x27;m working on that.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the color of my eyebrows (blonde), but the color always turns out more gray than brown.</li>
            <li> Godefroy tint is like no other tint I have used before. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who aren&#x27;t used to having normal eyebrows. They won&#x27;t be used to it. But for those who do have brows, it makes them even more beautiful!</li>
            <li> I like that this new kit includes a brush and small mixing pot (my previous kits did not include that). But I still have the same problem as with previous kits: the color keeps turning green. No matter what I do. I follow instructions exactly, but it still turns green. The seller did contact me, and told me that it&#x27;s most likely the developer cream, and that I could use any 10% developer instead. That&#x27;s great advice and all, but that still means I have to go out to a beauty store and buy a gigantic developer (my local beauty stores don&#x27;t offer smaller sizes) just so I can actually use this product. Then why am I paying for the developer that is included in this kit? I would rate five stars if they&#x27;d only fix this problem.</li>
            <li> We use this product in my salon all the time. It&#x27;s super easy to mix and use. A little pricey but good product so there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> it gets my gray hairs out. which that&#x27;s what I wanted it to do for me. its been 2 weeks till lasting! if you have tried to use your hair die it does NOT do the job this stuff does. love it</li>
            <li> Did not like it. Poor quality and only last a few days</li>
            <li> I have very think eyebrows so I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference because they are not noticeable. I will stick with my brow pencil. If you had thick light brows, it would be a great product.</li>
            <li> The product is great! Eyebrows last long and everything is handy to use! Loved it! But the only difficult thing is when choosing the color you want. I chose medium brown but it turned out to be fairly dark; I wished they sent a small free sample of the other colors too, so that custumers get a chance to try others, rather than having to buy 20 capsules for choosing a color. Overall the product is awesome!!! Definetely recommend.</li>
            <li> There is so much I can say about this product and not all of it is good. This review is solely based on MY personal experience so keep in mind what happened to me, might not happen to you. First off, the color doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the packaging says. Ill tint my eyebrows on a monday and by next week they&#x27;ve already faded a significant amount. The packaging says it can last up to 6 weeks. The capsules are really messy and inconvenient. At first i thought they were okay, but if you touch them with slightly wet hands, thats it, the whole thing is ruined. And finally, the color itself is really bad. I purchased the kit in Dark Brown because i prefer bolder, thicker, brows, while my friend purchased the kit in Light Brown. They both turned out nearly black. It doesn&#x27;t matter how long or short we kept the tint on it always came out the same in the end; way too dark. So in the end i did get my wish of having bold, thick, brows. maybe a little bit TOO bold. My number one tip would have to be to avoid tinting your brows right before a big event or if you&#x27;ll be attending something special. The tint does temporarily dye the skin. Again, this is all based on my own experience. If you&#x27;re on the fence about getting it, GET IT! Try it out for yourself. After all, they&#x27;re only eyebrows. They grow out before you know it. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Product defective caused eyebrows to fall out. Contacted seller and after numerous emails, &amp;#34;Ray&amp;#34; finally responded saying a refund will be issued when I return the unused product! Think about that statement.....&lt;br /&gt;! Seriously...!!! Lol!</li>
            <li> I have, for years, paid a crazy amount for eyebrow tinting every six week. This kit makes it so much easier just to do it at home. It&#x27;s quick and easy. AND the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products but none were as easy to apply or lasted as well as this. And the fees at the salons are ridiculous for something so easy to do for something that can be done at home for a fraction of the cost. And, even the salon treatments haven&#x27;t lasted me more than 1 1/2 - 2 weeks and Godefroy lasts me a month.</li>
            <li> This product is good reason for the 4 stars is for the price ..</li>
            <li> I love not having to fill in my eyebrows every morning!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I left it on for 2 min. as the instructions stated.  It was not long enough to cover the gray.  The next time I left it on for 5 min. which covered the gray but left my eyebrows too dark.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some women are blessed with dark, shapely eyebrows and the rest of us aren&#x27;t.  At least we can finally do something about the fading of brow color that comes with age.  This amazing product will color your brows for 3-4 weeks per application, and I really think it makes me look a little younger.  I mix two tints (light and medium brown) to get the most natural color.  The whole process takes perhaps ten minutes.  1.  Shake a small amount of the tinting powder into a small dish.  2.  Add a few drops of the activator liquid.  3.  Mix well with the stirring stick.  4. Apply to one brow at a time (they suggest using the wooden stick, but I use small dental brushes and apply it like mascara, but more heavily).  5.  Wipe off any extra mixture from non-brow areas you don&#x27;t want to color (now is the time to create that arch you want).  6.  Wait 2 to 3 minutes (you&#x27;ll have to experiment with the timing to find what works best for you).  7.  Wipe off with a wet cloth -- the water will deactivate the process.  8.  Repeat with other brow.</li>
            <li> been a staple in my cabinet for 10+ years.</li>
            <li> I THINK THE PRODUCT IS GRAET,WILL ORDERED AGAIN AFTER iUSED ALL OFIT</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Super easy to use and only takes a few minutes from start to finish.  Lasts approx 2-3 weeks before another application is needed.  Lots of value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note - I recently got eyelash extentions too so now my eyes are completely done from the moment I wake up.  So awesome!!  :)</li>
            <li> first time it did not take going to retry and see what happens. Think it was user error</li>
            <li> I received this item in the mail and it looks like it is 30 years old. The packaging is disgusting! The entire inside of the box is browned and yellowed and the bottle of product is covered in dust. I will NOT use this and feel the purchase was a total waste of money...I&#x27;m very disappointed!! Also, BEWARE that this item can NOT be returned because it is considered hazardous material. I didn&#x27;t realize that and if I had known I would have never bought it online.</li>
            <li> This product is messy and doesn&#x27;t work well. I ordered light brown but it&#x27;s dark black to light black depending on timing. Will not reorder.</li>
