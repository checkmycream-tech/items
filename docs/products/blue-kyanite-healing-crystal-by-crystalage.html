            <li>This is such a beautiful crystal.</li>
            <li>I can see from others&#x27; reviews they are not exaggerating about chinsy sizes or quality, but I just wanted to say my experience was great, and I think a much better deal than many other kyanite sources.</li>

            <li>I am so glad I purchase the Blue Kyanite.</li>
            <li>The second time I was confused, because the first time my kyanite pieces were awesomely gigantic!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>am very desapointed</li>

            <li> true that on product page is written that size will vary, but that its usually BETWEEN 5 to 7 cm!!</li>
            <li> It was less blue than I expected but the size made up for it</li>
            <li> nothing like what i expected.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the size is not as long as the picture shows but that&#x27;s irrelevant for me.</li>
            <li> Please remember these blades are small at these prices and VERY delicate.</li>
            <li> this stones are very expensive this stones were too small ( not described on the expecifications )&lt;</li>
            <li> im sorry that i dont have cm ruller now with me.</li>

            <li> Very nice. Fast shipping. It was less blue than I expected but the size made up for it and I was 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I can see from others&#x27; reviews they are not exaggerating about chinsy sizes or quality, but I just wanted to say my experience was great, and I think a much better deal than many other kyanite sources. I ordered them on two ocassions, I think two each time. The second time I was confused, because the first time my kyanite pieces were awesomely gigantic! The second they were not, but when I realized how gorgeous and transparent the second smaller set was I was elated and grateful to not get big (but still beautiful) ones again &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Just what I expected, a great addition to my crystal collection.</li>

            <li> nothing like what i expected.  Over priced.  this piece is half an inch long at best.  Considering returning it. shipping took forever too.</li>
            <li> Obviously each piece is unique. Mine does not look like the one in the picture, but this is a powerful crystal and I could feel that the moment I held it.</li>
