            <li>These are great scrunchies and are light weight.</li>
            <li>Nice hair bands.</li>
            <li>can never find this size in stores so was thrilled to order them here.</li>
            <li>My purchase came fast and I am so very happy with them</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m kind of a fashion and beauty diva.</li>
            <li>Kind of a satiny fabric and durable.</li>
            <li>These are good for fine to medium hair....</li>
            <li>They are good about being light and not damaging the hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair but lots of it and use these practically every day.</li>
            <li>These are the smallest I could find, for my very very very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Holds nicely (even fine hair) without causing breakage.</li>
            <li>Love these because they aren&#x27;t too bulky, and they don&#x27;t yank my hair out.</li>
            <li>I like to tie my curly hair on top of my head at night</li>
            <li>Now I like these even better.</li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about scunci&#x27;s is that there is no metal so it doesn&#x27;t break my hair.</li>
            <li>Not for when you need your hair to stay up for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>These have changed and not for the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost most of mine</li>
            <li>so every now and then have to purchase more.</li>
            <li>love wearing these in my hair at night instead of a rubberband</li>
            <li>Ok on fabric and hasnt snagged my hair.</li>
            <li>i love it they are helpful</li>
            <li>Buy them, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>Can never have too many of these....</li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>These scrunchies are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>i got a thicker pair that i like a bit better, but these work well too.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for normal to fine hair.</li>
            <li>Super soft and perfect size.</li>
            <li>Nothing else really to say :p</li>
            <li>It gives me more control and volume and is an easy thing for the bobby pins to grab on to.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair tie doesn&#x27;t pull hair doesn&#x27;t fall apart easy.</li>
            <li>I needed to add something cheap to get better shipping.  </li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t more companies make satin and silk scrunchies available?</li>
            <li>Good quality scruncy for a decent price.</li>
            <li>They do not break my hair and stay put, look fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and they hold without pulling.</li>
            <li>so they work fine for me.</li>
            <li>These hold my fine hair in a pony tail when doubled, and if I want a tighter hold</li>
            <li>Perfect to wear around the house or to bed at night without causing breakage from a too tight pony.</li>
            <li>I have fine, smooth hair (but a ton of it)</li>
            <li>They are also insanely comfortable-</li>
            <li>They hold hair securely without pulling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great scrunchies, not too big and doesn&#x27;t catch hair.</li>
            <li>But I still gave it a 4 star because in general it is a good product and seems to be made of descent quality.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for these as the no metal no snarl bands rip my hair out.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while all of them go out for a coffee klatch or something, and they all disappear for a while, and then are willing to be found once more.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also smaller in diameter, which is good for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair so at best</li>
            <li>Maybe, my hair isn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it was, because these are perfect.</li>
            <li>Just like the title says they are mini-twisters and really only are good to cover a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>But still hold it so not bad over all.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for thin or fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The elastic stretches quickly, after one use, and the fabric is thinner/cheaper.</li>
            <li>and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>In any case, they&#x27;re comfortable, stretchy, and hold my hair very well!</li>
            <li>Perfect size...not too big, or small...last super long...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that Scunci came up with a modern twist on an old classic.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted although a different material then anticipated still pleased they are super easy on my hair.</li>
            <li>The quality seems very good and they are lasting well with daily use.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind looking like you&#x27;re straight out of the 90s, these scrunchies are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I liked them enough to reorder the same kind.</li>
            <li>I really love how soft and silky they are as well.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be smaller and have a more secure hold.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I threw them out right away.</li>
            <li>Priced right.  </li>
            <li>They are the right diameter and thickness</li>
            <li>Great for even thick hair on the weekends.</li>
            <li>but I have to say that these smaller ones stay in place much better.  </li>
            <li>For some reason many stores stopped carrying these specific hair ties &amp; I dont know why!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t too big and goofy and they don&#x27;t pull your hair at all.</li>
            <li>because I feel like it&#x27;s better than a regular hair tie</li>
            <li>I will totally buy more.</li>
            <li>The brand has always been consistent.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find them locally</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just too hot.  </li>
            <li>but i just wanted to see their quality first and sure enough.</li>
            <li>So I came to Amazon, and at first, I didn&#x27;t think these were them because of the word \\&quot;slinky\\&quot;- I assumed that meant they were made from some sort of silky/shiny material.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ethnic Chinese with naturally super smooth, silky hair.</li>
            <li>These are amazing - they have all the benefits of scrunchies without being giant early 90s style puff balls.</li>
            <li>They hold my long hair back quite nicely!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these for a long time and I find them to be great for finishing off a bun, or holding my hair in a loose ponytail.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my baby fine hair, and stylish enough that people don&#x27;t notice that it&#x27;s a scrunchi and not a hair elastic.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair and these work wonderfully to keep it tied back :) I definitely recommend these for girls with natural hair!</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking that they would be super soft and elastic.</li>
            <li>These are great, slim &amp;#34;scrunchies&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t give you the major fluffy effect but are gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li>These hold my hair well, and they aren&#x27;t too large.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than the traditional but still perfect.</li>
            <li>I got these and they work great for thin hair.</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>The elastic band inside the fabric isn&#x27;t very stretchy nor strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>GENTLE ON MY CURLY HAIR</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are mini version of the scrunchy, just with not as much fabric/bulk.</li>
            <li>This is my second order because hair ties just seem to disappear over time for me, kind of like the second sock in the dryer,</li>
            <li>So far they don&#x27;t pull out any hairs (other than ones that have already fallen off on their own).</li>
            <li>I feel I must warn the unsuspecting customer about these scrunchies, they are very well made, but I have lost more hair wearing these scrunchies, than any other brand I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Just good ole simple black scrunchies.</li>
            <li>This brand is decent for my hair needs.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the classic skinny pony tail variety, but found these instead.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t love it enough to venture out in public with it though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it won&#x27;t hold a decent pony tail.</li>
            <li>- just stretchy enough to hold my hair in place all day long but still be the right size to fit around my wrist without constricting my circulation.  </li>
            <li>The fabric is very strong, but it&#x27;s rough enough to grab at your hair.</li>
            <li>I keep at least a dozen on hand all around the house for when it gets too warm.</li>
            <li>I knew I should have bought a few more cause</li>
            <li>They are nice, but they do tend to slowly slip out.</li>
            <li>Other than their size they are fine.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m usually only able to wrap it once when my hair is in wet curls.</li>
            <li>I love using them after I blow dry my hair knowing that there wont be any creases as long as I also dont leave it in all day or go to sleep with it in my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK if you want a small hair tie.</li>
            <li>The small size makes them more discreet.</li>
            <li>Either way, they seem to be holding up well after 2 months and are still in about the same shape as when I first got them.</li>
            <li>They work fine but do not hold quite as tight.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so this size can wrap around all of my hair 3 times for a tight fit.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The regular ties can be uncomfortable, they tend to pull, but these are great.</li>
            <li>I really like these smaller scuncis.  </li>
            <li>Soft and work well.  </li>
            <li>Soft, durable...</li>
            <li>As a Naturalnista Chic rocking my natural curls when I use the &amp;#34; pineappling&amp;#34; method to put my hair up 🙆 at night</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great price, soft and does not snag in the hair.</li>
            <li>But I ordered them anyway, and was ecstatic when I opened the box and found out they were my old</li>
            <li>I miss the old fashioned scrunchies.  </li>
            <li>The only things that hold my hair in place, Love the black, Please bring them back to the store level.</li>
            <li>I only wish the elastic in them lasted a little longer, but for the price they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t as big &amp; cumbersome as normal scrunchies, which can look dated.</li>
            <li>They are the small size that&#x27;s perfect for my long thin hair.</li>
            <li>Anyone could come along behind me and easily pull the Scunci off my pony tail and leave my hair blowing in the wind, because the triple wrap is not that tight or secure.</li>
            <li>Useful basic black hair accessory.</li>
            <li>They do not pull my hair and are not too tight, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>All the gentle effects of scrunchies on hair, but a very minimal size, so you don&#x27;t look dated.</li>
            <li>Getting harder to find in stores, and now with the add on, on amazon, will keep them on wish list when I am a few dollars short for the free shipping.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I really wrap them tight they will stay in</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine (thin) hair.</li>
            <li>They one good thing it that they don&#x27;t pinch the hair or leave those bad bumps in the hair after you take them out.</li>

            <li> My favorite hair tie doesn&#x27;t pull hair doesn&#x27;t fall apart easy.</li>
            <li> I needed to add something cheap to get better shipping.  </li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t more companies make satin and silk scrunchies available?</li>
            <li> Good quality scruncy for a decent price.</li>
            <li> They do not break my hair and stay put, look fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and they hold without pulling.</li>
            <li> so they work fine for me.</li>
            <li> These hold my fine hair in a pony tail when doubled, and if I want a tighter hold</li>
            <li> Perfect to wear around the house or to bed at night without causing breakage from a too tight pony.</li>
            <li> I have fine, smooth hair (but a ton of it)</li>
            <li> They are also insanely comfortable-</li>
            <li> They hold hair securely without pulling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great scrunchies, not too big and doesn&#x27;t catch hair.</li>
            <li> But I still gave it a 4 star because in general it is a good product and seems to be made of descent quality.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for these as the no metal no snarl bands rip my hair out.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while all of them go out for a coffee klatch or something, and they all disappear for a while, and then are willing to be found once more.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also smaller in diameter, which is good for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so at best</li>
            <li> Maybe, my hair isn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it was, because these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Just like the title says they are mini-twisters and really only are good to cover a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> But still hold it so not bad over all.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for thin or fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The elastic stretches quickly, after one use, and the fabric is thinner/cheaper.</li>
            <li> and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> In any case, they&#x27;re comfortable, stretchy, and hold my hair very well!</li>
            <li> Perfect size...not too big, or small...last super long...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that Scunci came up with a modern twist on an old classic.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted although a different material then anticipated still pleased they are super easy on my hair.</li>
            <li> The quality seems very good and they are lasting well with daily use.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind looking like you&#x27;re straight out of the 90s, these scrunchies are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I liked them enough to reorder the same kind.</li>
            <li> I really love how soft and silky they are as well.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be smaller and have a more secure hold.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I threw them out right away.</li>
            <li> Priced right.  </li>
            <li> They are the right diameter and thickness</li>
            <li> Great for even thick hair on the weekends.</li>
            <li> but I have to say that these smaller ones stay in place much better.  </li>
            <li> For some reason many stores stopped carrying these specific hair ties &amp; I dont know why!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too big and goofy and they don&#x27;t pull your hair at all.</li>
            <li> because I feel like it&#x27;s better than a regular hair tie</li>
            <li> I will totally buy more.</li>
            <li> The brand has always been consistent.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find them locally</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too hot.  </li>
            <li> but i just wanted to see their quality first and sure enough.</li>
            <li> So I came to Amazon, and at first, I didn&#x27;t think these were them because of the word \\&quot;slinky\\&quot;- I assumed that meant they were made from some sort of silky/shiny material.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ethnic Chinese with naturally super smooth, silky hair.</li>
            <li> These are amazing - they have all the benefits of scrunchies without being giant early 90s style puff balls.</li>
            <li> They hold my long hair back quite nicely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for a long time and I find them to be great for finishing off a bun, or holding my hair in a loose ponytail.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my baby fine hair, and stylish enough that people don&#x27;t notice that it&#x27;s a scrunchi and not a hair elastic.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and these work wonderfully to keep it tied back :) I definitely recommend these for girls with natural hair!</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that they would be super soft and elastic.</li>
            <li> These are great, slim &amp;#34;scrunchies&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t give you the major fluffy effect but are gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li> These hold my hair well, and they aren&#x27;t too large.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than the traditional but still perfect.</li>
            <li> I got these and they work great for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> The elastic band inside the fabric isn&#x27;t very stretchy nor strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> GENTLE ON MY CURLY HAIR</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are mini version of the scrunchy, just with not as much fabric/bulk.</li>
            <li> This is my second order because hair ties just seem to disappear over time for me, kind of like the second sock in the dryer,</li>
            <li> So far they don&#x27;t pull out any hairs (other than ones that have already fallen off on their own).</li>
            <li> I feel I must warn the unsuspecting customer about these scrunchies, they are very well made, but I have lost more hair wearing these scrunchies, than any other brand I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Just good ole simple black scrunchies.</li>
            <li> This brand is decent for my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the classic skinny pony tail variety, but found these instead.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t love it enough to venture out in public with it though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it won&#x27;t hold a decent pony tail.</li>
            <li> - just stretchy enough to hold my hair in place all day long but still be the right size to fit around my wrist without constricting my circulation.  </li>
            <li> The fabric is very strong, but it&#x27;s rough enough to grab at your hair.</li>
            <li> I keep at least a dozen on hand all around the house for when it gets too warm.</li>
            <li> I knew I should have bought a few more cause</li>
            <li> They are nice, but they do tend to slowly slip out.</li>
            <li> Other than their size they are fine.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m usually only able to wrap it once when my hair is in wet curls.</li>
            <li> I love using them after I blow dry my hair knowing that there wont be any creases as long as I also dont leave it in all day or go to sleep with it in my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK if you want a small hair tie.</li>
            <li> The small size makes them more discreet.</li>
            <li> Either way, they seem to be holding up well after 2 months and are still in about the same shape as when I first got them.</li>
            <li> They work fine but do not hold quite as tight.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so this size can wrap around all of my hair 3 times for a tight fit.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The regular ties can be uncomfortable, they tend to pull, but these are great.</li>
            <li> I really like these smaller scuncis.  </li>
            <li> Soft and work well.  </li>
            <li> Soft, durable...</li>
            <li> As a Naturalnista Chic rocking my natural curls when I use the &amp;#34; pineappling&amp;#34; method to put my hair up 🙆 at night</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great price, soft and does not snag in the hair.</li>
            <li> But I ordered them anyway, and was ecstatic when I opened the box and found out they were my old</li>
            <li> I miss the old fashioned scrunchies.  </li>
            <li> The only things that hold my hair in place, Love the black, Please bring them back to the store level.</li>
            <li> I only wish the elastic in them lasted a little longer, but for the price they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t as big &amp; cumbersome as normal scrunchies, which can look dated.</li>
            <li> They are the small size that&#x27;s perfect for my long thin hair.</li>
            <li> Anyone could come along behind me and easily pull the Scunci off my pony tail and leave my hair blowing in the wind, because the triple wrap is not that tight or secure.</li>
            <li> Useful basic black hair accessory.</li>
            <li> They do not pull my hair and are not too tight, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> All the gentle effects of scrunchies on hair, but a very minimal size, so you don&#x27;t look dated.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find in stores, and now with the add on, on amazon, will keep them on wish list when I am a few dollars short for the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I really wrap them tight they will stay in</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine (thin) hair.</li>
            <li> They one good thing it that they don&#x27;t pinch the hair or leave those bad bumps in the hair after you take them out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them long enough to rate the durability of the elastic, but my general experience with scrunchies is that they tend to last for a long time compared to non-covered elastics, so</li>
            <li> You must have very thin hair in order to be able to use them.</li>
            <li> Yay my hair is long enough to pull back again!</li>
            <li> They appear to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> The material is a little rougher than I expected and the hairband itself doesn&#x27;t stretch very well.</li>
            <li> No tangles, soft, and doesn&#x27;t leave that point tail crease in my hair when only worn for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have super-fine wavyish, somewhat thin, hair that is super prone to breaking.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t slide right out like the thin hairbands and it isn&#x27;t tacky like a big scrunchy.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull your hair, don&#x27;t stretch out too much, and are hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even fairly comfortable to lean back in a chair, against the pony tail, without feeling a hard hard lump.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something like that for a long time, but had never seen them in stores.</li>
            <li> They go around my long pony tail three times, and don&#x27;t catch or break the hair.</li>
            <li> These scrunchies are pretty tiny, but I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I emailed them but no new products in the pipeline yet.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to point out that they are a lot smaller in diameter than an average twister.  </li>
            <li> These hold my hair loosely.</li>
            <li> My hair becomes loose with in minutes.</li>
            <li> basic black goes with everything.  </li>
            <li> Less obvious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the larger hair scrunchies, these are about half the size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black and simple, holds your hair period!</li>
            <li> no more, no less.</li>
            <li> suggested that I use scrunchies to hold my hair up, especially while it is wet, because they are a lot less damaging than elastics.  </li>
            <li> These are gentle enough not to break my hair and small enough hold my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> They are like a regular elastic hair band with a little fabric to cover it.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say on the matter.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking a velcro strap with hooks or teeth on one end to prevent it from slipping.  </li>
            <li> Cut my hair short in 2009 and had no use for them until a few months ago.</li>
            <li> The fabric is slightly rough.</li>
            <li> As long as you dont put it on your hair really tight</li>
            <li> I usually use the larger ones</li>
            <li> These scunci&#x27;s are smaller than the usual which I like.</li>
            <li> Because these \\&quot;scrunchies\\&quot; aren&#x27;t tacky, like the \\&quot;evolution\\&quot; elastics and other products, I doubted they would hold hair in place, but they work just as well as other elastics, and the fabric exterior doesn&#x27;t tear hair the way elastics do.</li>
            <li> These were too small and not stretchy enough.</li>
            <li> Not too tight, not too loose.  </li>
            <li> So your hair will become loose within a few mins.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> but if you have medium to thick hair there is not enough spring in the band.</li>
            <li> I Bought these for my 6 year old daughter because I was tired of getting a handful of hair when I pulled out her ponyties or rubberbands or whatever they are called.  </li>
            <li> These hair ties are extremely too tight for my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have thick hair these would work alright, but for my thin hair they are too large.  </li>
            <li> Less fabric.</li>
            <li> Black matches everything.  </li>
            <li> Its little loose and small for my hair.</li>
            <li> The hold snug with no slipping..yet aren&#x27;t so tight they cause tension breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but then my hair feels like its too tight on the scalp.</li>
            <li> They do not leave marks in your hair if you do not put them too tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, but these were just too large for my very very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I still get a few pieces of hair when undoing the ponytail.  </li>
            <li> (approx 15) and nothing else would hold my thin hair back and away with out being to bulky and loosening.</li>
            <li> Still had a few of my reliable scunnies from before I chopped my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and these work with only to times around my pony.  </li>
            <li> and these twisters will either hold all of it or just a few strands, depending on what I&#x27;m in the mood for.</li>
            <li> I use them for school, exercise, and messy buns when I go anywhere from the house.</li>
            <li> (I have lots of hair, so messy buns cover the scrunchie(s) quite well).</li>
            <li> they are not huge like some scrunchies ...</li>
            <li> --they look a little nicer than plain elastics and they never pull out my hair.</li>
            <li> Once I realized I could not fine them at Target anymore, I searched online.</li>
            <li> No, they&#x27;re not exactly cute to wear in public, but I like to put my wet hair in a twisted bun when I go to sleep to wake up with curls.  </li>
            <li> Maybe add a small bobby pin to keep it tight against the head.  </li>
            <li> They are small enough to work well on thin hair.  </li>
            <li> As someone with thick curly hair, I was looking for hair bands a little looser and ones that wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> But are a bit small for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> They are small, not able to tie my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair you will probably find these too small.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding these in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> However, to my utter disappointment they have changed.</li>
            <li> And since I have thick hair, it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  </li>
            <li> but if u have thick hair may not work for you .</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying this.</li>
            <li> I was unsure whether to get these for my hair, because reviews did not recommend them for thick hair.</li>
            <li> not too bulky for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and these are really small.  </li>
            <li> They are very, very small.</li>
            <li> I used to have very thick hair, no longer my hair is thick  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was smaller than I</li>
            <li> Too weak to hold anything.</li>
            <li> it will not crease your hair at least not mine!</li>
            <li> and i have thin hair .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always use scrunchies, and these are thin</li>
            <li> They are made way too thin.</li>
            <li> They are sadly neither.</li>
            <li> would* look sort of silly to have a puff of material on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> Wore out faster than the ones I got a couple of years ago :(</li>
            <li> I use them as the base of my pony when I&#x27;m putting it up in a bun.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d look like an idiot with bangs, so scrunchies have been my friend since I was a kid in the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Horrible product do not purchase.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great item at a great price.  Not much else to say on the matter.  Works well, and no complaints. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice hair bands. But are a bit small for thicker hair. So your hair will become loose within a few mins. But still hold it so not bad over all.</li>
            <li> As someone with thick curly hair, I was looking for hair bands a little looser and ones that wouldn&#x27;t break. I like these a lot.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was smaller than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s OK if you want a small hair tie.</li>
            <li> These are great, slim &amp;#34;scrunchies&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t give you the major fluffy effect but are gentle on your hair. I use them as the base of my pony when I&#x27;m putting it up in a bun. It gives me more control and volume and is an easy thing for the bobby pins to grab on to.</li>
            <li> Good quality scruncy for a decent price. I think I will buy from here again for my future hair accessory needs. The mall over-prices them anyways. This brand is decent for my hair needs. I have lots of fine (thin) hair.</li>
            <li> Too weak to hold anything.</li>
            <li> Great for even thick hair on the weekends.</li>
            <li> These are good for fine to medium hair.... but if you have medium to thick hair there is not enough spring in the band.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair but lots of it and use these practically every day. They do not pull my hair and are not too tight, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really like these smaller scuncis.  I usually use the larger ones but I have to say that these smaller ones stay in place much better.  I think I will be sticking to the smaller ones in the future.</li>
            <li> Love these because they aren&#x27;t too bulky, and they don&#x27;t yank my hair out. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Perfect to wear around the house or to bed at night without causing breakage from a too tight pony.</li>
            <li> For some reason many stores stopped carrying these specific hair ties &amp; I dont know why! These are great scrunchies and are light weight. As long as you dont put it on your hair really tight it will not crease your hair at least not mine! I love using them after I blow dry my hair knowing that there wont be any creases as long as I also dont leave it in all day or go to sleep with it in my hair. Good product.</li>
            <li> I am having issues with my hair falling out after an illness. I got these and they work great for thin hair. They are good about being light and not damaging the hair. If you have thick hair you will probably find these too small.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to point out that they are a lot smaller in diameter than an average twister.  And since I have thick hair, it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  But I still gave it a 4 star because in general it is a good product and seems to be made of descent quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to sleep in, to avoid my hair tangling and pulling out at night.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recently (discreetly, with an aside that it should not be out of the house) suggested that I use scrunchies to hold my hair up, especially while it is wet, because they are a lot less damaging than elastics.  These are amazing - they have all the benefits of scrunchies without being giant early 90s style puff balls.</li>
            <li> Love these! I have super-fine wavyish, somewhat thin, hair that is super prone to breaking.  These are gentle enough not to break my hair and small enough hold my thin hair.  I have dark brown hair so they don&#x27;t scream \\&quot;scrunchie\\&quot;!  This is my second order because hair ties just seem to disappear over time for me, kind of like the second sock in the dryer, LOL.  I liked them enough to reorder the same kind.</li>
            <li> Perfect size...not too big, or small...last super long...basic black goes with everything.  Getting harder to find in stores, and now with the add on, on amazon, will keep them on wish list when I am a few dollars short for the free shipping.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind looking like you&#x27;re straight out of the 90s, these scrunchies are fantastic. They aren&#x27;t too big and goofy and they don&#x27;t pull your hair at all.</li>
            <li> I like to tie my curly hair on top of my head at night so I can take advantage of &amp;#34;second day hair&amp;#34;. The regular ties can be uncomfortable, they tend to pull, but these are great. They stay in place all night and don&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the classic skinny pony tail variety, but found these instead. Now I like these even better. They do not break my hair and stay put, look fine. The quality seems very good and they are lasting well with daily use.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  No, they&#x27;re not exactly cute to wear in public, but I like to put my wet hair in a twisted bun when I go to sleep to wake up with curls.  These allow me to do that without damaging my hair or leaving a big crease.  I&#x27;ve started using it to pull my hair up in the day, as well because I feel like it&#x27;s better than a regular hair tie... I still don&#x27;t love it enough to venture out in public with it though.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have thick hair these would work alright, but for my thin hair they are too large.  Other than their size they are fine.</li>
            <li> Maybe men aren&#x27;t designed to put in Ponyties.  I Bought these for my 6 year old daughter because I was tired of getting a handful of hair when I pulled out her ponyties or rubberbands or whatever they are called.  I thought the fabric covered elastic would be easier to get out.  They work fine but do not hold quite as tight.  I still get a few pieces of hair when undoing the ponytail.  I wish Scunci would invent a type of wrap that will hold the pony tail but not break the hair when removing.  I emailed them but no new products in the pipeline yet. I was thinking a velcro strap with hooks or teeth on one end to prevent it from slipping.  Maybe add a small bobby pin to keep it tight against the head.  All I can say is the rubber bands suck.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair tie doesn&#x27;t pull hair doesn&#x27;t fall apart easy. And stays in my hair ☺</li>
            <li> I really like these--they look a little nicer than plain elastics and they never pull out my hair.</li>
            <li> These hold my hair loosely. The elastic band inside the fabric isn&#x27;t very stretchy nor strong.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good for keeping hair out of your face while lounging at home. Won&#x27;t damage any hair.&lt;br /&gt;However, it won&#x27;t hold a decent pony tail.</li>
            <li> I like these ...they are not huge like some scrunchies ...but if u have thick hair may not work for you . I can wrap them 2 times for a pony tail and i have thin hair . But great price and free shipping !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, but these were just too large for my very very thin hair.  I returned them</li>
            <li> Wore out faster than the ones I got a couple of years ago :(</li>
            <li> ...after I wore mine out! These are not as bulky as the big scrunchies, and they are easier to work with because of the smoothness of the material.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for my daughters hair.  I really love how soft and silky they are as well.</li>
            <li> these are perfect.  they are very tiny, so they&#x27;re inconspicuous, and they don&#x27;t rip my hear out like traditional hair ties. I will totally buy more.</li>
            <li> Useful basic black hair accessory. Good deal for the pack of 6. They are the small size that&#x27;s perfect for my long thin hair. I wrap one 3x around my hair at back of neck, and it stay&#x27;s put all day.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for normal to fine hair. I am satisfied with this product. Just what I was looking for. Great product.</li>
            <li> We used these in our camper (travel trailer) to make hour-glasses of the curtains when we want them open.  The size and elasticity are great, and they look nice.  Would buy these again.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be smaller and have a more secure hold. There aren&#x27;t as big &amp; cumbersome as normal scrunchies, which can look dated. They one good thing it that they don&#x27;t pinch the hair or leave those bad bumps in the hair after you take them out.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than the traditional but still perfect. No tangles, soft, and doesn&#x27;t leave that point tail crease in my hair when only worn for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I love these. Just the right size for thin, fine hair. I can wrap them around a bun, use for a ponytail, and then launder when needed. Very good buy!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for thin or fine hair.  The hold snug with no slipping..yet aren&#x27;t so tight they cause tension breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I can never find this size in stores so was thrilled to order them here.</li>
            <li> These scunci&#x27;s are smaller than the usual which I like. They are small enough to work well on thin hair.  The small size makes them more discreet. They are size of a standard hair band (with a cloth covering).  My favorite thing about scunci&#x27;s is that there is no metal so it doesn&#x27;t break my hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for these as the no metal no snarl bands rip my hair out. They are nice, but they do tend to slowly slip out. I&#x27;m redoing my hair often. Not for when you need your hair to stay up for more than an hour. Maybe if I really wrap them tight they will stay in but then my hair feels like its too tight on the scalp. Worth the price. They are not like the ones from the 80s/90s. Less fabric. Less obvious.</li>
            <li> Its little loose and small for my hair. I need something holds well.</li>
            <li> Soft and work well.  They do not leave marks in your hair if you do not put them too tight. Do the job.</li>
            <li> These have changed and not for the better. I have used these for years (approx 15) and nothing else would hold my thin hair back and away with out being to bulky and loosening. Cut my hair short in 2009 and had no use for them until a few months ago. Yay my hair is long enough to pull back again! Still had a few of my reliable scunnies from before I chopped my hair. Of course they worked like a charm. Once I realized I could not fine them at Target anymore, I searched online. I was so stoked to have found them. However, to my utter disappointment they have changed. The elastic stretches quickly, after one use, and the fabric is thinner/cheaper. My hair becomes loose with in minutes. Horrible product do not purchase.</li>
            <li> Soft, durable... I&#x27;ve lost most of mine so every now and then have to purchase more. Amazon had a good price.</li>
            <li> inconspicuous and doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair. i only use these. if you have a lot of hair that knots up easily, this is great. it doesn&#x27;t slide right out like the thin hairbands and it isn&#x27;t tacky like a big scrunchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ethnic Chinese with naturally super smooth, silky hair. The texture on these scrunchies is perfect for gripping and staying on all day but also being easy on my hair when taking them off. So far they don&#x27;t pull out any hairs (other than ones that have already fallen off on their own). They do leave a bend in my hair when it is tied up all day in a ponytail, though, as any ties would. I also don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so this size can wrap around all of my hair 3 times for a tight fit. I haven&#x27;t used them long enough to rate the durability of the elastic, but my general experience with scrunchies is that they tend to last for a long time compared to non-covered elastics, so I hope these will too. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always use scrunchies, and these are thin so it doesn&#x27;t scream 80s, but I wish they were smoother. The fabric is slightly rough. They&#x27;re also smaller in diameter, which is good for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> PERFECT... NOT TOO BIG AND POOFIE... GENTLE ON MY CURLY HAIR</li>
            <li> These hair ties are extremely too tight for my hair. I have thick hair so at best i can get it around my hair twice. However, I&#x27;m usually only able to wrap it once when my hair is in wet curls. If you have thick hair, I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying this.</li>
            <li> Great! Use these almost daily to keep hair off my face when sleeping.</li>
            <li> Because these \\&quot;scrunchies\\&quot; aren&#x27;t tacky, like the \\&quot;evolution\\&quot; elastics and other products, I doubted they would hold hair in place, but they work just as well as other elastics, and the fabric exterior doesn&#x27;t tear hair the way elastics do.</li>
            <li> love wearing these in my hair at night instead of a rubberband</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that they would be super soft and elastic. They are sadly neither. The material is a little rougher than I expected and the hairband itself doesn&#x27;t stretch very well. Either way, they seem to be holding up well after 2 months and are still in about the same shape as when I first got them.</li>
            <li> They are small, not able to tie my hair.</li>
            <li> These wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair.  I will never purchase again.  They are made way too thin. I threw them out right away.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted although a different material then anticipated still pleased they are super easy on my hair. Would buy again , wish they had colors though.also</li>
            <li> My wife says they hold her hair and keep their shape well. They appear to be long lasting. We will probably buy them again.</li>
            <li> What can I say about these. The brand has always been consistent. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do I guess...</li>
            <li> These hold my hair well, and they aren&#x27;t too large. Good price and they arrived quickly. I look forward to ordering these in different colors.</li>
            <li> As a Naturalnista Chic rocking my natural curls when I use the &amp;#34; pineappling&amp;#34; method to put my hair up 🙆 at night I noticed that the dollar store options would always snag my hair and cause breakage. Not one hair has wrapped around or been snagged by these. I haven&#x27;t been able to find them locally so I would definitely buy these again!</li>
            <li> I like these.  My hair is fine and they hold without pulling.</li>
            <li> They have all the advantages of scrunchies without the bulk. They don&#x27;t pull your hair, don&#x27;t stretch out too much, and are hardly noticeable. They are like a regular elastic hair band with a little fabric to cover it. I had been looking for something like that for a long time, but had never seen them in stores.</li>
            <li> I was unsure whether to get these for my hair, because reviews did not recommend them for thick hair. Maybe, my hair isn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it was, because these are perfect. They wrap twice around my hair and if I want a looser ponytail, then I only wrap it once.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time. It holds my hair together when I have those days I want wear it in a ponytail ,so it serves it purpose.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and these are really small.  Just like the title says they are mini-twisters and really only are good to cover a pony tail.  Wont hold a top-knot for me.  Ok on fabric and hasnt snagged my hair.</li>
            <li> I use these every night to keep my hair up off my neck.  I can&#x27;t sleep with a fur necklace it&#x27;s just too hot.  I have thin hair and these work with only to times around my pony.  Not too tight, not too loose.  I keep at least a dozen on hand all around the house for when it gets too warm.</li>
            <li> They tie up your hair when you need it! They&#x27;re great and do what they&#x27;re for. Nothing else really to say :p</li>
            <li> i love it they are helpful and i keep them on my door, and its so convienent and the best of all it doesnt pull my hair and break it off</li>
            <li> My purchase came fast and I am so very happy with them I ordered 2 packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, soft and does not snag in the hair. What more can be said about these wonderful scruncy.</li>
            <li> They are very, very small. I used to have very thick hair, no longer my hair is thick  but I can&#x27;t use this scunci. You must have very thin hair in order to be able to use them. For me,  they do not work, a waist of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the larger hair scrunchies, these are about half the size and they work great. I only wish the elastic in them lasted a little longer, but for the price they&#x27;re fine. I&#x27;ve been buying these for a long time and I find them to be great for finishing off a bun, or holding my hair in a loose ponytail. Great if you&#x27;re looking for a hair elastic that won&#x27;t pull on or damage your hair.</li>
            <li> They are scruncies, they hold up my bun.  Priced right.  Buy them, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> These work great for me. I knew I should have bought a few more cause I lose them so often, but i just wanted to see their quality first and sure enough. I&#x27;ll be buying more. Thank you</li>
            <li> Basic scrunchis - but my favorites.  I needed to add something cheap to get better shipping.  Can never have too many of these....</li>
            <li> I love these things.  I only wear  them around the house though, I&#x27;ll admit.  In any case, they&#x27;re comfortable, stretchy, and hold my hair very well!</li>
            <li> All the gentle effects of scrunchies on hair, but a very minimal size, so you don&#x27;t look dated. Gentle enough for my baby fine hair, and stylish enough that people don&#x27;t notice that it&#x27;s a scrunchi and not a hair elastic.</li>
            <li> I cannot STAND having hair in my face but I&#x27;d look like an idiot with bangs, so scrunchies have been my friend since I was a kid in the 1980&#x27;s. However, they seem to have gone the way of the dinosaur, and I must admit it *would* look sort of silly to have a puff of material on the crown of my head. But elastics and headbands are too fussy for me, so I have been searching for an alternate to the scrunchy for years and *finally* found these \\&quot;Mini Twisters\\&quot; several years back. They are essentially tiny scrunchies that don&#x27;t have that scrunchy-bunch, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through the package (took about six years for them all to wear down/stretch out with daily use) and couldn&#x27;t find them in local stores. So I came to Amazon, and at first, I didn&#x27;t think these were them because of the word \\&quot;slinky\\&quot;- I assumed that meant they were made from some sort of silky/shiny material. But I ordered them anyway, and was ecstatic when I opened the box and found out they were my old favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are mini version of the scrunchy, just with not as much fabric/bulk. They are made from a matte material that holds hair wonderfully. I have fine, smooth hair (but a ton of it) and these twisters will either hold all of it or just a few strands, depending on what I&#x27;m in the mood for. They are also insanely comfortable- even if I kinda crash on the sofa or am at the movies, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have them smash against the back of a seat. They hold hair securely without pulling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that Scunci came up with a modern twist on an old classic. Even if the big fat scrunchies come back in style, I would never switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 and I&#x27;m kind of a fashion and beauty diva. Scrunchies are sooooo last century. BUT, they&#x27;re great for around the house when you need just your hair up and &amp;#34;outa yo bidness&amp;#34;. I use them for school, exercise, and messy buns when I go anywhere from the house. (I have lots of hair, so messy buns cover the scrunchie(s) quite well).</li>
            <li> These are the smallest I could find, for my very very very fine hair. They go around my long pony tail three times, and don&#x27;t catch or break the hair. It&#x27;s even fairly comfortable to lean back in a chair, against the pony tail, without feeling a hard hard lump. Every once in a while all of them go out for a coffee klatch or something, and they all disappear for a while, and then are willing to be found once more. I would give five stars for an even smaller, shorter Scunci for pony tails. Anyone could come along behind me and easily pull the Scunci off my pony tail and leave my hair blowing in the wind, because the triple wrap is not that tight or secure.</li>
            <li> Great scrunchies, not too big and doesn&#x27;t catch hair.</li>
            <li> not too bulky for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> A tie is a tie... no more, no less. It&#x27;s black and simple, holds your hair period! Nothing fancy and it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Love these. Easy on the hair and works great</li>
            <li> Love this. Super soft and perfect size.</li>
            <li> What can I say about these scruncis?!  They hold my long hair back quite nicely!</li>
            <li> These scrunchies are pretty tiny, but I have thin hair so they work fine for me. Kind of a satiny fabric and durable.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. &amp;#34;Mini Slinky&amp;#34; gave me the impression that they would be smaller and slinkier then they were. Just good ole simple black scrunchies.</li>
            <li> I miss the old fashioned scrunchies.  These were too small and not stretchy enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. These hold my fine hair in a pony tail when doubled, and if I want a tighter hold I can even triple the loop. Best thing is they don&#x27;t look bulky!</li>
            <li> Bring these back to the store.  The only things that hold my hair in place, Love the black, Please bring them back to the store level.</li>
            <li> These scrunchies are my favorite.  They are the right diameter and thickness - just stretchy enough to hold my hair in place all day long but still be the right size to fit around my wrist without constricting my circulation.  Black matches everything.  I have a hard time finding these in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I feel I must warn the unsuspecting customer about these scrunchies, they are very well made, but I have lost more hair wearing these scrunchies, than any other brand I have ever used.  I wear my hair in a twist at the back of my head, and If i keep using these scrunchies, i won&#x27;t have any hair to twist.  The fabric is very strong, but it&#x27;s rough enough to grab at your hair. I have been using them for about a month, but I simply cannot continue. Why can&#x27;t more companies make satin and silk scrunchies available?</li>
            <li> i wear them to sleep as to not pull on my hair. i got a thicker pair that i like a bit better, but these work well too.</li>
            <li> Holds nicely (even fine hair) without causing breakage.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t found these for a while, and I love them!</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and these work wonderfully to keep it tied back :) I definitely recommend these for girls with natural hair!</li>
