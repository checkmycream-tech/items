    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m always in search for the PERFECT polish that will stay on-</li>
            <li>and now, I&#x27;m not kidding you, they look as nice as the salon!!!</li>
            <li>IT WORKED WONDERFULLY!  </li>
            <li>Best nail polish I ever used at home!!</li>
            <li>This nail polish has been the best I ever used.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Best decision ever!</li>
            <li>Revlon has done a GREAT job of providing a rainbow of colors!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strengthen the nail or keep it from chipping or look as beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The color selections are beautiful and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just used the Revlon Colorstay  Gel Envy and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great topcoat</li>
            <li>this was going to be the GREAT alternative to salon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep on hunting for that GREAT one ;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update when I do that, but even if it doesn&#x27;t work, for the price, this stuff is really great.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful not some bright teenager colors.</li>
            <li>top coat is good, but it works best in combination with Gel Envy color polishes.</li>
            <li>Buff the nail with a good buffer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good results with this.</li>
            <li>However, I use acetone as a remover which is turning out NOT to be good.</li>
            <li>Loved it with the Revlon Colorstay Gel colored polish.  </li>
            <li>received in good condition.  </li>
            <li>loved the price at WalMart - it was under $5 a bottle.</li>
            <li>very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>OK, I admit it, I&#x27;m a polish freak!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>no chips..still glossy and they look like the first day I painted them :D</li>
            <li>it protects and leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Just two coats of color and one coat of top coat, and the colors are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>But I am still impressed that I can paint my nails at home and have a manicure that looks professional for days.</li>
            <li>but supposedly its easy to remove..we will see!</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>it made my nail more prone to splitting.  </li>
            <li>I happened to see the top coat in CVS and picked it up.</li>
            <li>I put this top coat over the mani on Thursday.</li>
            <li>This is now a 2-week-old mani with two applications of this top coat, one week apart.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love it</li>
            <li>then the top coat goes on.  </li>
            <li>The sand and water will make most come off but not this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li>I gave up my salon because this is way better than any product they had.</li>
            <li>I fell in LOVE with the color she has on-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now as a top coat, and I like that</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments on my nails all the time and no one believes I did them myself.</li>
            <li>To top it off, after ordering saw this at Walmart for 1/2 the price I paid from this seller (see my review for seller).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve finally found one that I&#x27;m impressed by.  </li>
            <li>I used the Diamond Top Coat a week ago and my nails are still shiny and chip-less.  </li>
            <li>Without a top coat it lasted 24 hours before it chipped</li>
            <li>I waited 4 weeks to write this review to be sure</li>
            <li>Probably more</li>
            <li>This review is for all colors not just the top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use two coats color two coats top coat</li>
            <li>I love getting the gel polish at the salon.</li>
            <li>Even the salon gels last at best just under 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I took the bottles with me just to be safe.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with most of the colors available for this line yet</li>
            <li>(the Sally Hansen line does appear to have better colors).  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>application times, 2 coats of color (the orange one) and 2 coats of the Diamond Top Coat were applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not had the peeling problem I have read about with my nails however in addition to the color and top coat</li>
            <li>UV gels.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a manacurist for many years</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to be going over what has already been applied as top coats set up</li>
            <li>gel polish and top coat looked lovely at 14 days and didn&#x27;t start to look chipped until 16 days.  </li>
            <li>do know that compared to a &amp;#34;Stickey&amp;#34; basecoat, 2 coats of OPI polish and a Sache-vite top coat this lasted almost a week</li>
            <li>I am honestly just trying to get a full week out of my polish without anything more than a touch up.</li>
            <li>the brushes are pretty good-</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and lasts through most anything.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and used no base coat, two coats of color + top coat</li>
            <li>I love this range of nail polish and this topcoat is excellent and dries more quickly than I expected.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product when used as a top coat over regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy and</li>
            <li>It dries faster than any polish and comes off easy when you want to change color.</li>
            <li>the polish comes off easily with polish remover and cotton balls.</li>
            <li>and I can easily purchase it with our family prime account.</li>
            <li>I gave it the benefit of a doubt and attributed the chipping to using strong dish detergent when washing dishes that night.</li>
            <li>Hands down best nail product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Went on easy and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>it is super!</li>
            <li>No UV light required.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap,</li>
            <li>My nails still look great a week later.  </li>
            <li>Nothing so far on the market is as good as a gel manicure itself.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to go more than 3 days before getting any nail polish to chip - except real gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>I ran right out and bought 2 more colors.</li>
            <li>Two light coats and this stuff has a great brush and very smooth coverage, not like cheaper watered down polish.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s SUPER easy to use-</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re using, it may seem quick and easy now, but it will begin to stunt nail growth. ...</li>
            <li>The gel color goes on incredibly smooth and one coat looks thick and perfect.</li>
            <li>(I had one peel off clean in 2 days once).  </li>
            <li>And I am super happy with how the color went on, no streaks like other brands of a similar shade, and the shine is amazing!</li>
            <li>polish is so far amazing.  </li>
            <li>BRIGHT BLUE-</li>
            <li>: ok....lately this stuff is barely lasting 4 days- which is still good for me-</li>
            <li>The trick is to cover the edges as well as the top to really seal it in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a full time mom of an infant</li>
            <li>With this nail polish, it goes on so evenly without having to fix anything with nail polish remover - and dries so fast that I am actually able to paint my nails every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, Target sells the polish for $5 a bottle.</li>
            <li>When this polish chips (and it chips quickly)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased and I may ordered more later.  </li>
            <li>I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY AS QUICKLY</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done dishes, bathed a child, took apart and scrubbed a high chair with a magic eraser, and I just finished washing my car.</li>
            <li>I do love how shiny they look and it smooths the polish great, just doesn&#x27;t have any long lasting effects compared to others that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This top coat, combined with the Colorstay Gel nail colors, is stronger than regular polish, but not as strong as a gel mani from a salon.</li>
            <li>Can tell it will be a little tougher than W &amp;W and the shine is great.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Honest to God, my mani lasted ten days without chipping.</li>
            <li>I normally French tip my own nails</li>
            <li>so I painted my nails with my favorite Sally Hanson Complete Salon Manicure polish, and then used the clear Gel Envy as a top coat.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty good for an OTC product and not a professional polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is not at all worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li>Two weeks later, my toes are still flawless (that&#x27;s pretty standard for me; toes last longer than fingers), although I think another coat of top coat would make them shinier.  </li>
            <li>I generally go to Amazon for most purchases.</li>
            <li>It would not dry after applying the top coat.</li>
            <li>Take cleaner and clean the nail and let dry 5 minutes without touching.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping; product as described.</li>
            <li>The second day more nails were chipped.</li>
            <li>I gave this two stars only because the polish lasted 3 days before it chipped, the most of any of the gel polishes I used.</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with the color polish last week, hoping for a bit of a more durable polish.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t even done on my first stroke.  </li>
            <li>Chipped after the first day I wore it.</li>
            <li>so you will be able to actually use your hands</li>
            <li>I do find the top coat kind of thick, but I was pretty much expecting that if it&#x27;s meant to minic the look of salon gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been told you can use the top coat over regular polish, too</li>
            <li>Another morning later, 2 more nails chipped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought the blue color and this top coat</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 6 days into my first application..</li>
            <li>Defiantly going back to the store to purchase more</li>
            <li>I love the blue color and hope it lasts a week as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even make it through the first day and my polish was already chipping.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have been able to wear polish for a week with just one minor chip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though the colors are beautiful, the fact that it lasts not even 24 hours on my nails makes me give it a big thumbs down.</li>
            <li>It also removes pretty easily with regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend buying this top coat and some of their colors.</li>
            <li>And easy to remove with regular polish remover</li>
            <li>Is easy to remove as they say, using regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re strong enough to grow out a bit.</li>
            <li>I put on the 2 coats and top coat at around 3:00 this morning, by 3:30 or so, completely dry!</li>
            <li>If you are reading the reviews, you&#x27;ll learn that Amazon has a pretty high price for this polish.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries fast</li>
            <li>I really like going to the salon and having gels put on</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I was very displeased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Gel Envy really lasts.</li>
            <li>very bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just never have the time (or the free cash) to spend getting it done regularly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at a store, not amazon, but I have to highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Have one in very color.</li>
            <li>Get real amazon and stop price gouging.</li>
            <li>Gel Envy has a dual brush used to make one brush which is not as good as W &amp;W because theirs is a solid wide brush.</li>
            <li>I only use one thick coat and honestly, I haven&#x27;t used a top coat.</li>
            <li>I bought the Revlon Gel Envy Kit (red gel polish and clear top coat gel polish) at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>This was the first bottle of the new Gel Envy products.  </li>
            <li>on more evenly than other nail polishes - because of the brush and texture of the polish.&lt;br /&gt;Dries really fast&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it with the other 30+</li>
            <li>The Gel Envy top coat might also work over other brands of nail polish, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe my nails weren&#x27;t clean enough when I applied it</li>
            <li>went on in a nice thick even coat which is exactly what you want for a top-coat.&lt;br /&gt;Removing</li>
            <li>Diamond Top Coat is thick like Sach-Vite and has to be applied quickly and in one stroke.  </li>
            <li>(I did get almost a full month out of the pedicure, wearing mostly open toed shoes).  </li>
            <li>You have to be a little more careful with Gel Envy to get a smooth coverage stroke first time.</li>
            <li>Love it mine typically lasts 12 days and I have 3 kids all under the age of 5</li>
            <li>But with an acetone nail polish remover, it came off with only slightly more effort than regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this combination.  </li>
            <li>Also, it stained my natural nails when I took it off with nail polish remover!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than no topcoat at all, but really it&#x27;s just one more disappointing product that doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.</li>
            <li>but this top coast provides zero shine and long lasting wear.</li>
            <li>I almost stopped painting them entirely because it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>After that, the tips would start to wear (which is normal</li>
            <li>The top coat stays shiny for quite a few days, and I bet if I&#x27;d bothered to put another coat on, it might&#x27;ve lasted another day or two.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of the nail colors, because I love that when this polish dried, it was truly dry and didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>One thing many women do not do, and this is critical: give polish a chance to dry all the way before adding another coat or topcoat.</li>
            <li>Removed the polish and started new.</li>
            <li>and I cover them with a light pink, a quick dry clear coat,</li>
            <li>I have been growing my own nails for the last few years and polish sometimes 2 times a day because of chips.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen &amp; L&#x27;Oreal quick dry nail</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a pale pink that doesn&#x27;t go on streaky or require 3-4 coats to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>back to Revlon, it&#x27;s better than a lot of other polishes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I applied, 1 nail chipped the next day.</li>
            <li>Makes my polish look like a professionally done Shellac manicure!</li>
            <li>When I applied it, I let the color coat set until it was no longer glossy, then applied a single top coat layer and waited for about twenty minutes for it to dry.</li>
            <li>I tried to pry it away near the nail beds and edges</li>
            <li>Underneath, polish is still soft for quite a while.</li>
            <li>but it gets old-</li>
            <li>(that never re-chipped once I fixed it).  </li>
            <li>It makes your nails shiny and keeps them from chipping but the negative is trying to remove the top coat and the nail polish.  </li>
            <li>After seeing the ad in an old magazine, I rushed to Target to purchase.</li>
            <li>Back to the salon for real gel polish.</li>
            <li>I made the decision to leave the nails off after having them removed and seeing the state my natural nails are in</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how my nails responded.</li>
            <li>Normally the gels are hard to take off but this stuff is easy-</li>
            <li>begins to dry it with streaks very fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically buy drug store brand nail polish, but at my second to last manicure, the nail tech pulled out this Gel Envy top coat and used it over my Essie.</li>
            <li>This stuff might last longer if you sit in a chair for 2 weeks but not if you even do normal household chores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this same routine with other brands of color, but none of them last as long as the Gel Envy color with GE top</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick had all 10 nails &amp; toes done in a half hour!</li>
            <li>I saw the comercials, had a coupon and thought why not no other polish lasts even a day with the condition my nails were in.  </li>
            <li>My manicures are lasting 5 days with no chips or edge wear -- which is saying a lot because I&#x27;m a professional gardener, out there all day, pruning, weeding, dragging hoses, picking up debris, etc.</li>
            <li>far as the look itself, I didn&#x27;t get the same super-thick look as salon gels, but I wasn&#x27;t quite expecing it either.  </li>
            <li>Had applied in the evening and early the next morning, 1 nail had chipped, but this time, there was no dishwashing involved the night before.</li>
            <li>I have about 4 different colors of this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I work a lot with my hands and my normal nail polish will only last 1-2 days without chipping.</li>
            <li>I used two thin coats on each, plus the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I am not a slow artist in painting, but the product was beginning to dry</li>
            <li>Vinylux top coat dries way faster, I have used with  Colorstay base and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Not a single smudge on my nail polish.</li>
            <li>The whole process took me an hour, including drying time, which is somewhat time consuming, but the same amount of time I would have spent at a salon, and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>Applied properly on top of two thin Revlon Colorstay color coats and 4 hours later was still getting dinged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it chipped off of a few nails after the first day.</li>
            <li>I have thin nails that split easily.  </li>
            <li>Not long lasting - started to chip after just 1.5 days.</li>
            <li>What I hadn&#x27;t counted on was how fast this starts to dry, or cure as other members have mentioned.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in search for the PERFECT polish that will stay on-</li>
            <li> and now, I&#x27;m not kidding you, they look as nice as the salon!!!</li>
            <li> IT WORKED WONDERFULLY!  </li>
            <li> Best nail polish I ever used at home!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish has been the best I ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Best decision ever!</li>
            <li> Revlon has done a GREAT job of providing a rainbow of colors!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strengthen the nail or keep it from chipping or look as beautiful.  </li>
            <li> The color selections are beautiful and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just used the Revlon Colorstay  Gel Envy and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great topcoat</li>
            <li> this was going to be the GREAT alternative to salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep on hunting for that GREAT one ;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update when I do that, but even if it doesn&#x27;t work, for the price, this stuff is really great.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful not some bright teenager colors.</li>
            <li> top coat is good, but it works best in combination with Gel Envy color polishes.</li>
            <li> Buff the nail with a good buffer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good results with this.</li>
            <li> However, I use acetone as a remover which is turning out NOT to be good.</li>
            <li> Loved it with the Revlon Colorstay Gel colored polish.  </li>
            <li> received in good condition.  </li>
            <li> loved the price at WalMart - it was under $5 a bottle.</li>
            <li> very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> OK, I admit it, I&#x27;m a polish freak!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> no chips..still glossy and they look like the first day I painted them :D</li>
            <li> it protects and leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Just two coats of color and one coat of top coat, and the colors are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> But I am still impressed that I can paint my nails at home and have a manicure that looks professional for days.</li>
            <li> but supposedly its easy to remove..we will see!</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> it made my nail more prone to splitting.  </li>
            <li> I happened to see the top coat in CVS and picked it up.</li>
            <li> I put this top coat over the mani on Thursday.</li>
            <li> This is now a 2-week-old mani with two applications of this top coat, one week apart.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it</li>
            <li> then the top coat goes on.  </li>
            <li> The sand and water will make most come off but not this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I gave up my salon because this is way better than any product they had.</li>
            <li> I fell in LOVE with the color she has on-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now as a top coat, and I like that</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments on my nails all the time and no one believes I did them myself.</li>
            <li> To top it off, after ordering saw this at Walmart for 1/2 the price I paid from this seller (see my review for seller).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve finally found one that I&#x27;m impressed by.  </li>
            <li> I used the Diamond Top Coat a week ago and my nails are still shiny and chip-less.  </li>
            <li> Without a top coat it lasted 24 hours before it chipped</li>
            <li> I waited 4 weeks to write this review to be sure</li>
            <li> Probably more</li>
            <li> This review is for all colors not just the top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use two coats color two coats top coat</li>
            <li> I love getting the gel polish at the salon.</li>
            <li> Even the salon gels last at best just under 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I took the bottles with me just to be safe.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with most of the colors available for this line yet</li>
            <li> (the Sally Hansen line does appear to have better colors).  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> application times, 2 coats of color (the orange one) and 2 coats of the Diamond Top Coat were applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not had the peeling problem I have read about with my nails however in addition to the color and top coat</li>
            <li> UV gels.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a manacurist for many years</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to be going over what has already been applied as top coats set up</li>
            <li> gel polish and top coat looked lovely at 14 days and didn&#x27;t start to look chipped until 16 days.  </li>
            <li> do know that compared to a &amp;#34;Stickey&amp;#34; basecoat, 2 coats of OPI polish and a Sache-vite top coat this lasted almost a week</li>
            <li> I am honestly just trying to get a full week out of my polish without anything more than a touch up.</li>
            <li> the brushes are pretty good-</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and lasts through most anything.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and used no base coat, two coats of color + top coat</li>
            <li> I love this range of nail polish and this topcoat is excellent and dries more quickly than I expected.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product when used as a top coat over regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy and</li>
            <li> It dries faster than any polish and comes off easy when you want to change color.</li>
            <li> the polish comes off easily with polish remover and cotton balls.</li>
            <li> and I can easily purchase it with our family prime account.</li>
            <li> I gave it the benefit of a doubt and attributed the chipping to using strong dish detergent when washing dishes that night.</li>
            <li> Hands down best nail product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Went on easy and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> it is super!</li>
            <li> No UV light required.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap,</li>
            <li> My nails still look great a week later.  </li>
            <li> Nothing so far on the market is as good as a gel manicure itself.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to go more than 3 days before getting any nail polish to chip - except real gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> I ran right out and bought 2 more colors.</li>
            <li> Two light coats and this stuff has a great brush and very smooth coverage, not like cheaper watered down polish.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s SUPER easy to use-</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re using, it may seem quick and easy now, but it will begin to stunt nail growth. ...</li>
            <li> The gel color goes on incredibly smooth and one coat looks thick and perfect.</li>
            <li> (I had one peel off clean in 2 days once).  </li>
            <li> And I am super happy with how the color went on, no streaks like other brands of a similar shade, and the shine is amazing!</li>
            <li> polish is so far amazing.  </li>
            <li> BRIGHT BLUE-</li>
            <li> : ok....lately this stuff is barely lasting 4 days- which is still good for me-</li>
            <li> The trick is to cover the edges as well as the top to really seal it in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a full time mom of an infant</li>
            <li> With this nail polish, it goes on so evenly without having to fix anything with nail polish remover - and dries so fast that I am actually able to paint my nails every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, Target sells the polish for $5 a bottle.</li>
            <li> When this polish chips (and it chips quickly)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased and I may ordered more later.  </li>
            <li> I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY AS QUICKLY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done dishes, bathed a child, took apart and scrubbed a high chair with a magic eraser, and I just finished washing my car.</li>
            <li> I do love how shiny they look and it smooths the polish great, just doesn&#x27;t have any long lasting effects compared to others that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This top coat, combined with the Colorstay Gel nail colors, is stronger than regular polish, but not as strong as a gel mani from a salon.</li>
            <li> Can tell it will be a little tougher than W &amp;W and the shine is great.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Honest to God, my mani lasted ten days without chipping.</li>
            <li> I normally French tip my own nails</li>
            <li> so I painted my nails with my favorite Sally Hanson Complete Salon Manicure polish, and then used the clear Gel Envy as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty good for an OTC product and not a professional polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not at all worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later, my toes are still flawless (that&#x27;s pretty standard for me; toes last longer than fingers), although I think another coat of top coat would make them shinier.  </li>
            <li> I generally go to Amazon for most purchases.</li>
            <li> It would not dry after applying the top coat.</li>
            <li> Take cleaner and clean the nail and let dry 5 minutes without touching.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping; product as described.</li>
            <li> The second day more nails were chipped.</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars only because the polish lasted 3 days before it chipped, the most of any of the gel polishes I used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the color polish last week, hoping for a bit of a more durable polish.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t even done on my first stroke.  </li>
            <li> Chipped after the first day I wore it.</li>
            <li> so you will be able to actually use your hands</li>
            <li> I do find the top coat kind of thick, but I was pretty much expecting that if it&#x27;s meant to minic the look of salon gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told you can use the top coat over regular polish, too</li>
            <li> Another morning later, 2 more nails chipped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought the blue color and this top coat</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 6 days into my first application..</li>
            <li> Defiantly going back to the store to purchase more</li>
            <li> I love the blue color and hope it lasts a week as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even make it through the first day and my polish was already chipping.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have been able to wear polish for a week with just one minor chip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though the colors are beautiful, the fact that it lasts not even 24 hours on my nails makes me give it a big thumbs down.</li>
            <li> It also removes pretty easily with regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend buying this top coat and some of their colors.</li>
            <li> And easy to remove with regular polish remover</li>
            <li> Is easy to remove as they say, using regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re strong enough to grow out a bit.</li>
            <li> I put on the 2 coats and top coat at around 3:00 this morning, by 3:30 or so, completely dry!</li>
            <li> If you are reading the reviews, you&#x27;ll learn that Amazon has a pretty high price for this polish.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries fast</li>
            <li> I really like going to the salon and having gels put on</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I was very displeased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Gel Envy really lasts.</li>
            <li> very bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just never have the time (or the free cash) to spend getting it done regularly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at a store, not amazon, but I have to highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Have one in very color.</li>
            <li> Get real amazon and stop price gouging.</li>
            <li> Gel Envy has a dual brush used to make one brush which is not as good as W &amp;W because theirs is a solid wide brush.</li>
            <li> I only use one thick coat and honestly, I haven&#x27;t used a top coat.</li>
            <li> I bought the Revlon Gel Envy Kit (red gel polish and clear top coat gel polish) at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> This was the first bottle of the new Gel Envy products.  </li>
            <li> on more evenly than other nail polishes - because of the brush and texture of the polish.&lt;br /&gt;Dries really fast&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it with the other 30+</li>
            <li> The Gel Envy top coat might also work over other brands of nail polish, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe my nails weren&#x27;t clean enough when I applied it</li>
            <li> went on in a nice thick even coat which is exactly what you want for a top-coat.&lt;br /&gt;Removing</li>
            <li> Diamond Top Coat is thick like Sach-Vite and has to be applied quickly and in one stroke.  </li>
            <li> (I did get almost a full month out of the pedicure, wearing mostly open toed shoes).  </li>
            <li> You have to be a little more careful with Gel Envy to get a smooth coverage stroke first time.</li>
            <li> Love it mine typically lasts 12 days and I have 3 kids all under the age of 5</li>
            <li> But with an acetone nail polish remover, it came off with only slightly more effort than regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this combination.  </li>
            <li> Also, it stained my natural nails when I took it off with nail polish remover!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than no topcoat at all, but really it&#x27;s just one more disappointing product that doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.</li>
            <li> but this top coast provides zero shine and long lasting wear.</li>
            <li> I almost stopped painting them entirely because it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> After that, the tips would start to wear (which is normal</li>
            <li> The top coat stays shiny for quite a few days, and I bet if I&#x27;d bothered to put another coat on, it might&#x27;ve lasted another day or two.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of the nail colors, because I love that when this polish dried, it was truly dry and didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> One thing many women do not do, and this is critical: give polish a chance to dry all the way before adding another coat or topcoat.</li>
            <li> Removed the polish and started new.</li>
            <li> and I cover them with a light pink, a quick dry clear coat,</li>
            <li> I have been growing my own nails for the last few years and polish sometimes 2 times a day because of chips.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen &amp; L&#x27;Oreal quick dry nail</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a pale pink that doesn&#x27;t go on streaky or require 3-4 coats to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> back to Revlon, it&#x27;s better than a lot of other polishes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I applied, 1 nail chipped the next day.</li>
            <li> Makes my polish look like a professionally done Shellac manicure!</li>
            <li> When I applied it, I let the color coat set until it was no longer glossy, then applied a single top coat layer and waited for about twenty minutes for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I tried to pry it away near the nail beds and edges</li>
            <li> Underneath, polish is still soft for quite a while.</li>
            <li> but it gets old-</li>
            <li> (that never re-chipped once I fixed it).  </li>
            <li> It makes your nails shiny and keeps them from chipping but the negative is trying to remove the top coat and the nail polish.  </li>
            <li> After seeing the ad in an old magazine, I rushed to Target to purchase.</li>
            <li> Back to the salon for real gel polish.</li>
            <li> I made the decision to leave the nails off after having them removed and seeing the state my natural nails are in</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how my nails responded.</li>
            <li> Normally the gels are hard to take off but this stuff is easy-</li>
            <li> begins to dry it with streaks very fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically buy drug store brand nail polish, but at my second to last manicure, the nail tech pulled out this Gel Envy top coat and used it over my Essie.</li>
            <li> This stuff might last longer if you sit in a chair for 2 weeks but not if you even do normal household chores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this same routine with other brands of color, but none of them last as long as the Gel Envy color with GE top</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quick had all 10 nails &amp; toes done in a half hour!</li>
            <li> I saw the comercials, had a coupon and thought why not no other polish lasts even a day with the condition my nails were in.  </li>
            <li> My manicures are lasting 5 days with no chips or edge wear -- which is saying a lot because I&#x27;m a professional gardener, out there all day, pruning, weeding, dragging hoses, picking up debris, etc.</li>
            <li> far as the look itself, I didn&#x27;t get the same super-thick look as salon gels, but I wasn&#x27;t quite expecing it either.  </li>
            <li> Had applied in the evening and early the next morning, 1 nail had chipped, but this time, there was no dishwashing involved the night before.</li>
            <li> I have about 4 different colors of this product so far.  </li>
            <li> I work a lot with my hands and my normal nail polish will only last 1-2 days without chipping.</li>
            <li> I used two thin coats on each, plus the top coat.  </li>
            <li> I am not a slow artist in painting, but the product was beginning to dry</li>
            <li> Vinylux top coat dries way faster, I have used with  Colorstay base and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Not a single smudge on my nail polish.</li>
            <li> The whole process took me an hour, including drying time, which is somewhat time consuming, but the same amount of time I would have spent at a salon, and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Applied properly on top of two thin Revlon Colorstay color coats and 4 hours later was still getting dinged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it chipped off of a few nails after the first day.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails that split easily.  </li>
            <li> Not long lasting - started to chip after just 1.5 days.</li>
            <li> What I hadn&#x27;t counted on was how fast this starts to dry, or cure as other members have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> One coat of clear Wet &amp; Wild Megalast, tipped nails and painted santa, let dry 30 min, applied  coat of Wet&amp;Wild again and let dry, then applied Revlon Colorstay Gel Envy.</li>
            <li> Although I find that chipping after 1 day is a bit extreme as this has never happened while using my years old stash of</li>
            <li> I first noticed it is thick with a bigger, thicker brush.  </li>
            <li> I actually came around looking for the new Sally Hansen one, but this one was a few bucks cheaper</li>
            <li> I started using it 3 years ago regularly, and it has weakened my nails and they don&#x27;t grow as long.</li>
            <li> IT IS NO MIRACLE OR EVEN LONG LASTING</li>
            <li> My fingers lasted about 5-6 days with only one minor chip</li>
            <li> After a few days of normal polish, as soon as I see any lifting</li>
            <li> As several other mentioned the polish is thick and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth like other polishes.  </li>
            <li> and I stopped painting my nails because I don&#x27;t have enough time to fully dry my nails before having to handle my baby.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would have a gel like quality and really make your nails hard and last a long time like salon gels you have to set under the lights, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be.</li>
            <li> Apparently, according to other reviews, you are suppose to keep it out of the sunlight and also indoor lighting or it will begin to cure.  </li>
            <li> When it did have the one minor chip, it just chipped at the tip of my nail, it didn&#x27;t peel.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and put one coat of color and one coat of topcoat and spent the next two weeks at the beach.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn tips, have had them done in salons, and for the last few years, I&#x27;ve simply kept them clipped short.</li>
            <li> This took so long to dry</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found if I forget one of the other coats, it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The procedure I use is I first trim the nail, less length less bend less chipping.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be grabbing some other colors to try out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a longer lasting manicure and it has the stay power as any of my other topcoats.</li>
            <li> My friends that know me always know my polish to chip and have a different color every other day.</li>
            <li> Also, it takes awhile to apply and dry all 3 coats.</li>
            <li> It definitely can last for a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second try a few weeks later, 1 nail chipped again the next day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy with Prime and usually less expensive.</li>
            <li> Same thing happened in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I think I have told every single girl I know about this product!  </li>
            <li> Three strokes, one down the middle and on each side, can be done with one dip if you only remove very little from tip of brush.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what there are so many bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> That usually results in marks and dents because the polish generally doesn&#x27;t set before I pass out.</li>
            <li> BONUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the pink color on my nails a week before changing it out.</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle of this topcoat in Wal-Mart hoping it would get me at least an extra couple of days between removing and reapplying polish, but the results were no different from any other topcoat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I expect to not redo  these other than a touch up until after Xmas, 21 days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for any other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> In fact, I use it over other polishes.</li>
            <li> and I can be rough!</li>
            <li> then every other day add a layer of topcoat has lasted six days that way</li>
            <li> MUST BE CAREFULLY PACKAGED!  </li>
            <li> One other benefit:</li>
            <li> I put the darker color, a dark slate gray, on my toes, and the lighter, sandy nude color on my fingers for an out of town wedding.  </li>
            <li> though I average 7-10 days with it</li>
            <li> and once that starts to happen it can lead to a big thick mess.  </li>
            <li> Purchased at Walmart for less than $5.</li>
            <li> An hour and a half after polishing my nails, I moved storage boxes, packed things in my living room, and took apart some furniture.</li>
            <li> I like dark colors, especially in cooler seasons, so chipping is no good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;LID WAS NOT ON TIGHT.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a single chip for at least 6+ days, sports and all, which is an all-time record for me.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear very dark color on my fingernails</li>
            <li> I bought a few came home and went to work on my finger nails and toe</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much trouble taking it off either.</li>
            <li> The color stays so long that I usually get tired of the color and WANT to change it before it chips</li>
            <li> I usually get 10 to 14 days using W &amp; W with just one touch up.</li>
            <li> I ever wasted money on!</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> NO, I WAS NOT SATISFIED.  </li>
            <li> I was regularly going to the salon and having gel nails applied with a no chip color over which can be expensive.  </li>
            <li> and since I usually change my polish color every Sunday this works for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst top coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> you would need at least 2-3 layers to get a desired look.</li>
            <li> But, there are times when they are not handy.</li>
            <li> This product is thick in my opinion to begin with and with any type of lighting (indoor lighting for me)  </li>
            <li> just a little disappointed, I thought for a second there</li>
            <li> I find the gel nails routine to be inconvenient and expensive but the polish I apply at home tends to start wearing off on the ends after a day or two of normal activity.</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Revlon claims the color coats have a built in base coat, but I like to start with a coat of Bridge the Ridge base, then apply two layers of Gel Envy color, followed by Gel Envy top coat.</li>
            <li> not great-</li>
            <li> : My nails are thin.</li>
            <li> silly me.</li>
            <li> Also expensive.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a bit weird about getting all giddy over some nail polish (I can see my husband rolling his eyes)</li>
            <li> My hands take a lot of grubby, dirty</li>
            <li> I keep polish on my nails to prevent my bad habit of chewing the corners</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a base coat under either color; I find they make my polish chip easier.  </li>
            <li> I use a base coat of Sally Hansen Nail Recovery that moisturizes and adds vitamins</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> It stays longer than regular nail polish but it does chip and does not last 2 weeks. Nothing so far on the market is as good as a gel manicure itself.</li>
            <li> Just used the Revlon Colorstay  Gel Envy and it works great. Purchased at Walmart for less than $5. One coat of clear Wet &amp; Wild Megalast, tipped nails and painted santa, let dry 30 min, applied  coat of Wet&amp;Wild again and let dry, then applied Revlon Colorstay Gel Envy. Can tell it will be a little tougher than W &amp;W and the shine is great. Gel Envy has a dual brush used to make one brush which is not as good as W &amp;W because theirs is a solid wide brush. You have to be a little more careful with Gel Envy to get a smooth coverage stroke first time. I put enough polish on the brush to allow the nail to be coated without letting the brush touch the paint already on the nail. Doesn&#x27;t  streak this way. Three strokes, one down the middle and on each side, can be done with one dip if you only remove very little from tip of brush. See pic. Nails are shiny enough to pic up reflections! I usually get 10 to 14 days using W &amp; W with just one touch up. I expect to not redo  these other than a touch up until after Xmas, 21 days.</li>
            <li> This top coat, combined with the Colorstay Gel nail colors, is stronger than regular polish, but not as strong as a gel mani from a salon. I will definitely be buying more of the nail colors, because I love that when this polish dried, it was truly dry and didn&#x27;t smudge. An hour and a half after polishing my nails, I moved storage boxes, packed things in my living room, and took apart some furniture. Not a single smudge on my nail polish. The reason for the four stars is I had a tiny chip in one nail. That wouldn&#x27;t have happened with a gel mani from a salon. But I am still impressed that I can paint my nails at home and have a manicure that looks professional for days. The gel color goes on incredibly smooth and one coat looks thick and perfect. When I applied it, I let the color coat set until it was no longer glossy, then applied a single top coat layer and waited for about twenty minutes for it to dry. I waited until it didn&#x27;t feel tacky at all. No UV light required. The whole process took me an hour, including drying time, which is somewhat time consuming, but the same amount of time I would have spent at a salon, and a lot cheaper. Overall, I highly recommend buying this top coat and some of their colors. This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails that split easily.  When this polish chips (and it chips quickly) it made my nail more prone to splitting.  I didn&#x27;t purchase my polish on amazon.  I bought it at a local drug store.  Will be returning it today.</li>
            <li> it chipped off of a few nails after the first day. The second day more nails were chipped. Removed the polish and started new. Same thing happened in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Worst polish I ever wasted money on! It would not dry after applying the top coat. It was peeling off within hours. I thought maybe my nails weren&#x27;t clean enough when I applied it so I took it all off with acetone remover and cleaned my nails twice with the remover before reapplying and still had the same problem. I&#x27;m looking elsewhere for gel polish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically buy drug store brand nail polish, but at my second to last manicure, the nail tech pulled out this Gel Envy top coat and used it over my Essie. Honest to God, my mani lasted ten days without chipping. It was unbelievable. I happened to see the top coat in CVS and picked it up. I already had another mani with OPI that was flaking on a couple of the edges. I put this top coat over the mani on Thursday. Today is Sunday and I haven&#x27;t had another chip. I was at the beach all day yesterday, a recipe for chipped nails, and not a one. This is a great product when used as a top coat over regular nail polish. I can&#x27;t say for any other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried again with an Essie manicure. I&#x27;m attaching a photo. This is now a 2-week-old mani with two applications of this top coat, one week apart. I&#x27;ve done dishes, bathed a child, took apart and scrubbed a high chair with a magic eraser, and I just finished washing my car.</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars only because the polish lasted 3 days before it chipped, the most of any of the gel polishes I used.</li>
            <li> I find the gel nails routine to be inconvenient and expensive but the polish I apply at home tends to start wearing off on the ends after a day or two of normal activity. I picked up a bottle of this topcoat in Wal-Mart hoping it would get me at least an extra couple of days between removing and reapplying polish, but the results were no different from any other topcoat I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s better than no topcoat at all, but really it&#x27;s just one more disappointing product that doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I purchased this along with the color polish last week, hoping for a bit of a more durable polish.  I keep polish on my nails to prevent my bad habit of chewing the corners (I know gross).  After a few days of normal polish, as soon as I see any lifting I feel compulsory to chip it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish is so far amazing.  I followed the directions and used no base coat, two coats of color + top coat and this polish feels sealed to my nails.  I tried to pry it away near the nail beds and edges and it is not moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will report back once I need to repaint.  I am honestly just trying to get a full week out of my polish without anything more than a touch up.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it but this top coast provides zero shine and long lasting wear.</li>
            <li> Not long lasting - started to chip after just 1.5 days. I was looking forward to an upgrade from my cheaper nail polish, but I think my $2 bottle from the drugstore lasts longer! Also, it takes awhile to apply and dry all 3 coats.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping; product as described.</li>
            <li> This took so long to dry I abandoned ship and will not be using again.  Applied properly on top of two thin Revlon Colorstay color coats and 4 hours later was still getting dinged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CND Vinylux top coat dries way faster, I have used with  Colorstay base and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to nail polish ever since it came out. My store has a two-fer or buy-one-get-one-half-off sale so I have 7 colors. I apply two coats and then the GE topcoat. You must use the same topcoat...it is super! In fact, I use it over other polishes. One thing many women do not do, and this is critical: give polish a chance to dry all the way before adding another coat or topcoat. This stuff dries fast BUT that is only on the surface. Underneath, polish is still soft for quite a while. Trust me on this: take your time between coats and your home mani will last longer, you&#x27;ll be happier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a pale pink that doesn&#x27;t go on streaky or require 3-4 coats to get good coverage. I have a habit of painting my nails in the middle of the night when I can&#x27;t sleep.... That usually results in marks and dents because the polish generally doesn&#x27;t set before I pass out. I put on the 2 coats and top coat at around 3:00 this morning, by 3:30 or so, completely dry! And I am super happy with how the color went on, no streaks like other brands of a similar shade, and the shine is amazing! I will definitely be grabbing some other colors to try out.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what there are so many bad reviews.  This stuff last and lasts.  I get two weeks with no chipping and no nicks.  It is the only brand I will wear anymore.  The procedure I use is I first trim the nail, less length less bend less chipping.  Buff the nail with a good buffer. Take cleaner and clean the nail and let dry 5 minutes without touching. That way there are no oils on the nail.  Two light coats and this stuff has a great brush and very smooth coverage, not like cheaper watered down polish. It dries easily on several minutes. Wait two hours then the top coat goes on.  I have my toes painted like this and have been to the beach and no wear at all. The sand and water will make most come off but not this stuff.  I also do not wear sandals all of the time, basically I abuse the polish and it lasts.  The colors are beautiful not some bright teenager colors.</li>
            <li> I love this range of nail polish and this topcoat is excellent and dries more quickly than I expected.  I&#x27;m really pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Hands down best nail product I have ever used. I gave up my salon because this is way better than any product they had.</li>
            <li> This is a great topcoat but I think it was over hyped for me. I bought this thinking I&#x27;d get a longer lasting manicure and it has the stay power as any of my other topcoats. I do love how shiny they look and it smooths the polish great, just doesn&#x27;t have any long lasting effects compared to others that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> OK, I admit it, I&#x27;m a polish freak! I&#x27;m always in search for the PERFECT polish that will stay on- my go to is always Sally Hansen in the end but I never stop trying others out- I really like going to the salon and having gels put on but it gets old- who has time to sit for an hour or two taking them off and putting them back on every 1.5 to 2 weeks, uhhhhg- I saw a commercial about this stuff, that one they having running now with Olivia Wilde- I fell in LOVE with the color she has on- BRIGHT BLUE- I had to try this, of&#x27;course I come to Amazon to read reviews- I couldn&#x27;t believe it, ALL the reviewers gave 5 stars! How did everyone but ME know about this stuff??!!! I grabbed my bag and rushed out to Target, it&#x27;s only $5 a bottle there! I bought a few came home and went to work on my finger nails and toe nails- it&#x27;s SUPER easy to use- the brushes are pretty good- and now, I&#x27;m not kidding you, they look as nice as the salon!!! Normally the gels are hard to take off but this stuff is easy- ALSO, I have horses and work in my backyard daily taking care of them, this stuff lasts too! It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s easy and it&#x27;s quick had all 10 nails &amp; toes done in a half hour! If you came here to read review, you have to try it for the price! You&#x27;ll be amazed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: ok....lately this stuff is barely lasting 4 days- which is still good for me- just a little disappointed, I thought for a second there this was going to be the GREAT alternative to salon gels- it&#x27;s good but not great- I&#x27;ll keep on hunting for that GREAT one ;o)</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good but it&#x27;s much cheaper elsewhere. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now as a top coat, and I like that it protects and leaves a nice shine. I normally French tip my own nails and I cover them with a light pink, a quick dry clear coat, and then I finish with this stuff. The trick is to cover the edges as well as the top to really seal it in. My manicures will usually last about 2 weeks with this combination (and I do a lot with my hands), but I&#x27;ve found if I forget one of the other coats, it doesn&#x27;t last as long. I receive so many compliments on my nails all the time and no one believes I did them myself. It also removes pretty easily with regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I was very displeased with this product.  This was the first bottle of the new Gel Envy products.  I first noticed it is thick with a bigger, thicker brush.  What I hadn&#x27;t counted on was how fast this starts to dry, or cure as other members have mentioned.  I am not a slow artist in painting, but the product was beginning to dry and I wasn&#x27;t even done on my first stroke.  Apparently, according to other reviews, you are suppose to keep it out of the sunlight and also indoor lighting or it will begin to cure.  They aren&#x27;t kidding.  This product is thick in my opinion to begin with and with any type of lighting (indoor lighting for me)  begins to dry it with streaks very fast and once that starts to happen it can lead to a big thick mess.  I also think the word -gel- in the name is misleading.  This is not a gel manicure you can do at home.  It doesn&#x27;t strengthen the nail or keep it from chipping or look as beautiful.  One day chipping on my end.  I won&#x27;t buy this again. To top it off, after ordering saw this at Walmart for 1/2 the price I paid from this seller (see my review for seller).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!  I play sports almost every night of the week, and my nails would chip immediately.  I almost stopped painting them entirely because it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Then I saw commercials for Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Gel Envy and I decided to give it a try.  I bought it at Target in a combo pack with the color Roulette Rush for only $9.  IT WORKED WONDERFULLY!  I didn&#x27;t have a single chip for at least 6+ days, sports and all, which is an all-time record for me.  After that, the tips would start to wear (which is normal I feel like for having it on for almost a week).  I did notice that once it chipped, it wouldn&#x27;t stop chipping on that same nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if it would work as well with non-Revlon Colorstay colors, and I have to say I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in wear time.  I love that I can use it with the other 30+ nail polish colors I have at home!  I think I have told every single girl I know about this product!  It has changed the way I look at painting my nails.  Instead of being a chore, I look forward to it.  My nails are the longest they have ever been because I keep them painted.  The color stays so long that I usually get tired of the color and WANT to change it before it chips and I HAVE to change it.  If you paint your nails at home, you NEED THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;m pleased and I may ordered more later.  Maybe!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of polishes over the years and I&#x27;ve finally found one that I&#x27;m impressed by.  Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Gel Envy really lasts. I used the Diamond Top Coat a week ago and my nails are still shiny and chip-less.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Revlon has a winner with the Gel Envy series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my testimony:  My manicures are lasting 5 days with no chips or edge wear -- which is saying a lot because I&#x27;m a professional gardener, out there all day, pruning, weeding, dragging hoses, picking up debris, etc. My hands take a lot of grubby, dirty punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revlon claims the color coats have a built in base coat, but I like to start with a coat of Bridge the Ridge base, then apply two layers of Gel Envy color, followed by Gel Envy top coat. My final coat is Seche Vite, which dries the layers and forms another layer of toughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this same routine with other brands of color, but none of them last as long as the Gel Envy color with GE top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gel Envy top coat is good, but it works best in combination with Gel Envy color polishes.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly.  It stays on well, protects my nails; with polish or without it&#x27;s great.  And easy to remove with regular polish remover</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good results with this. It definitely can last for a few days. I only use one thick coat and honestly, I haven&#x27;t used a top coat. Without a top coat it lasted 24 hours before it chipped and I can be rough! That works for me. I didn&#x27;t have much trouble taking it off either. However, I use acetone as a remover which is turning out NOT to be good. I started using it 3 years ago regularly, and it has weakened my nails and they don&#x27;t grow as long. So, if you&#x27;re using, it may seem quick and easy now, but it will begin to stunt nail growth. ... back to Revlon, it&#x27;s better than a lot of other polishes. So if you need a 3 day fix, go for this.</li>
            <li> WORKS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS NO MIRACLE OR EVEN LONG LASTING</li>
            <li> Best nail polish I ever used at home!! Im a nail polish addict and have used every brand known! I have gotten gel manicures and even acrylic tips for years. I have been growing my own nails for the last few years and polish sometimes 2 times a day because of chips. This nail polish has been the best I ever used. I waited 4 weeks to write this review to be sure and I love it! My friends that know me always know my polish to chip and have a different color every other day. This polish lasts me a week solid! Probably more but I change color often. It dries faster than any polish and comes off easy when you want to change color. I will definately be adding all colors to my polish collection.</li>
            <li> This review is for all colors not just the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not last any longer than regular nail polish. About 3 days before chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Goes on more evenly than other nail polishes - because of the brush and texture of the polish.&lt;br /&gt;Dries really fast&lt;br /&gt;Love the colors- very bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a full time mom of an infant and I stopped painting my nails because I don&#x27;t have enough time to fully dry my nails before having to handle my baby. With this nail polish, it goes on so evenly without having to fix anything with nail polish remover - and dries so fast that I am actually able to paint my nails every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only lasts about 3 days before chipping - like regular nail polish. I know some women can make it last longer but not me. I&#x27;ve never been able to go more than 3 days before getting any nail polish to chip - except real gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> Chipped after the first day I wore it. Not opaque enough- you would need at least 2-3 layers to get a desired look. Also, it stained my natural nails when I took it off with nail polish remover!! One of the worst nail polishes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use two coats color two coats top coat then every other day add a layer of topcoat has lasted six days that way I use my hands alot cleaning cooking etc so you will be able to actually use your hands</li>
            <li> Love it mine typically lasts 12 days and I have 3 kids all under the age of 5</li>
            <li> Loved it with the Revlon Colorstay Gel colored polish.  Did try it out using a regular Revlon polish, ended up quite bubbly.  Is easy to remove as they say, using regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ARIZONA!!  THE PRODUCT WAS LEAKING AND HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY!  IT LOOKED LIKE THE&lt;br /&gt;LID WAS NOT ON TIGHT.  ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN AZ MUST BE CAREFULLY PACKAGED!  ESPECIALLY IN SUMMER.&lt;br /&gt;SO, NO, I WAS NOT SATISFIED.  I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY AS QUICKLY AS I COULD.......IT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.</li>
            <li> I love getting the gel polish at the salon. I just never have the time (or the free cash) to spend getting it done regularly.  I&#x27;m one of those types that nail polish just doesn&#x27;t work for me; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the oils on my nails or something I do or what, but with regular polish, whether at the salon or at home, it lasts, maybe, 2 days before it starts chipping. I like dark colors, especially in cooler seasons, so chipping is no good. Even the salon gels last at best just under 2 weeks (I had one peel off clean in 2 days once).  I actually came around looking for the new Sally Hansen one, but this one was a few bucks cheaper and I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work anyway so why spend the money on the more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well silly me. I was dead wrong.  This stuff worked.  I bought 2 colors and the topcoat (they&#x27;re $5 at regular stores, ps).  I put the darker color, a dark slate gray, on my toes, and the lighter, sandy nude color on my fingers for an out of town wedding.  I took the bottles with me just to be safe. I didn&#x27;t use a base coat under either color; I find they make my polish chip easier.  Two weeks later, my toes are still flawless (that&#x27;s pretty standard for me; toes last longer than fingers), although I think another coat of top coat would make them shinier.  My fingers lasted about 5-6 days with only one minor chip (that never re-chipped once I fixed it).  I used two thin coats on each, plus the top coat.  I do find the top coat kind of thick, but I was pretty much expecting that if it&#x27;s meant to minic the look of salon gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the look itself, I didn&#x27;t get the same super-thick look as salon gels, but I wasn&#x27;t quite expecing it either.  It did look thicker than regular polish on me.  The top coat stays shiny for quite a few days, and I bet if I&#x27;d bothered to put another coat on, it might&#x27;ve lasted another day or two.  When it did have the one minor chip, it just chipped at the tip of my nail, it didn&#x27;t peel.  In fact, I couldn&#x27;t peel this stuff off at all.  But with an acetone nail polish remover, it came off with only slightly more effort than regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told you can use the top coat over regular polish, too; I have quite the collection of Essie polishes and will try that soon, just because I&#x27;d rather not replace my entire polish collection and I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with most of the colors available for this line yet (the Sally Hansen line does appear to have better colors).  I&#x27;ll update when I do that, but even if it doesn&#x27;t work, for the price, this stuff is really great.</li>
            <li> I am floored by reviews that this stuff doesn&#x27;t last.  I bought this and put one coat of color and one coat of topcoat and spent the next two weeks at the beach.  I was in the ocean and/or the pool every day for two weeks, and not only did the color last without chipping all that time, it lasted an additional week after that.  The only reason I removed it is that it was growing out along with my nail.  I will buy this brand forever.  Love it.  Goes on easy and lasts through most anything.</li>
            <li> received in good condition.  very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  It makes your nails shiny and keeps them from chipping but the negative is trying to remove the top coat and the nail polish.  I only used it once and I hope I did not harm my nails from trying to remove all of it.  Also expensive.</li>
            <li> After seeing the ad in an old magazine, I rushed to Target to purchase. I wanted to try this because I don&#x27;t have time to go to the nail salon anymore now that school &amp; after school activities are in session. The color selections are beautiful and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied, 1 nail chipped the next day. I gave it the benefit of a doubt and attributed the chipping to using strong dish detergent when washing dishes that night. Although I find that chipping after 1 day is a bit extreme as this has never happened while using my years old stash of Sally Hansen &amp; L&#x27;Oreal quick dry nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second try a few weeks later, 1 nail chipped again the next day! Had applied in the evening and early the next morning, 1 nail had chipped, but this time, there was no dishwashing involved the night before. Another morning later, 2 more nails chipped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both application times, 2 coats of color (the orange one) and 2 coats of the Diamond Top Coat were applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the colors are beautiful, the fact that it lasts not even 24 hours on my nails makes me give it a big thumbs down. Very disappointed. Back to the salon for real gel polish.</li>
            <li> I have about 4 different colors of this product so far.  I was regularly going to the salon and having gel nails applied with a no chip color over which can be expensive.  I made the decision to leave the nails off after having them removed and seeing the state my natural nails are in but I prefer to wear polish as a buffer so to speak.  I saw the comercials, had a coupon and thought why not no other polish lasts even a day with the condition my nails were in.  I have not gotten 14 days wear out of it I though I average 7-10 days with it and since I usually change my polish color every Sunday this works for me.  (I did get almost a full month out of the pedicure, wearing mostly open toed shoes).  I have not had the peeling problem I have read about with my nails however in addition to the color and top coat I use a base coat of Sally Hansen Nail Recovery that moisturizes and adds vitamins so maybe that is why.  I did purchase this at Walmart for only $5 instead of the prices shown on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a store, not amazon, but I have to highly recommend this! This is the first time I have been able to wear polish for a week with just one minor chip. I ran right out and bought 2 more colors. Just two coats of color and one coat of top coat, and the colors are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought the Revlon Gel Envy Kit (red gel polish and clear top coat gel polish) at Walgreens.  But when I tried them together, my nails chipped within three days.  I hated to throw everything away... so I painted my nails with my favorite Sally Hanson Complete Salon Manicure polish, and then used the clear Gel Envy as a top coat.  My nails still look great a week later.  No bubbling, no peeling, no chipping.  Highly recommend this combination.  The Gel Envy top coat might also work over other brands of nail polish, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> Love this! But way OVERPRICED! Target has it for $5. Have one in very color. Get real amazon and stop price gouging.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this product as I don&#x27;t do well with the &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; UV gels.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a manacurist for many years so I&#x27;ve learned a lot from her about how to apply poish.&lt;br /&gt;The Diamond Top Coat is thick like Sach-Vite and has to be applied quickly and in one stroke.  You don&#x27;t want to be going over what has already been applied as top coats set up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It went on in a nice thick even coat which is exactly what you want for a top-coat.&lt;br /&gt;Removing it was a chore - you have to give it about 5 minutes per mail to soften - I was in a hurry so it took a lot of concerted rubbing with several acetone soaked cotton balls to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;My gel polish and top coat looked lovely at 14 days and didn&#x27;t start to look chipped until 16 days.  That&#x27;s pretty good for an OTC product and not a professional polish.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear very dark color on my fingernails so perhaps that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t look raggedy before 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I do know that compared to a &amp;#34;Stickey&amp;#34; basecoat, 2 coats of OPI polish and a Sache-vite top coat this lasted almost a week longer.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the price at WalMart - it was under $5 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! I work a lot with my hands and my normal nail polish will only last 1-2 days without chipping. Saw this nail polish on a tv commercial and decided to buy it. Best decision ever! Bought the blue color and this top coat and I&#x27;m 6 days into my first application..no chips..still glossy and they look like the first day I painted them :D Defiantly going back to the store to purchase more colors!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried taking the polish off yet..but supposedly its easy to remove..we will see!</li>
            <li> Why am I just finding out about this nail polish? In one word...FABULOUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: My nails are thin. I&#x27;ve worn tips, have had them done in salons, and for the last few years, I&#x27;ve simply kept them clipped short. About five months ago, I started taking a &amp;#34;Hair, Nails &amp; Skin&amp;#34; vitamin that I picked up at Costco. I was surprised at how my nails responded. They&#x27;re strong enough to grow out a bit. So, I wanted to put some color on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere I found out about this polish and decided to try it. I generally go to Amazon for most purchases. It&#x27;s easy with Prime and usually less expensive. If you are reading the reviews, you&#x27;ll learn that Amazon has a pretty high price for this polish. It&#x27;s true, Target sells the polish for $5 a bottle. I bought two at Target last week and with my receipt, I was given a $2 off my next Revlon Colorstay Gel polish. BONUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the pink color on my nails a week before changing it out. I love the blue color and hope it lasts a week as well. Revlon has done a GREAT job of providing a rainbow of colors! One other benefit: the polish comes off easily with polish remover and cotton balls. (I hated wearing gel nails because of the removal process.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a writer. So, I type all the time. I garden and my nails are in the dirt. I have five kids--so I do A LOT of dishes. I wear gloves when I can. But, there are times when they are not handy. I know it&#x27;s a bit weird about getting all giddy over some nail polish (I can see my husband rolling his eyes) but this stuff is the bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Amazon lowers the price and I can easily purchase it with our family prime account.</li>
            <li> Went on easy and smoothly.  Makes my polish look like a professionally done Shellac manicure!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would have a gel like quality and really make your nails hard and last a long time like salon gels you have to set under the lights, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be. Boo. In fact, I can&#x27;t tell it lasts any longer or does anything different than regular nail polish. Misleading name for it. I guess it means this stuff wishes it were a gel, but it is not even close.</li>
            <li> This is the worst top coat I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t stay on my nails 14 hours let alone 14 days. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Both times I used this the color was worn off the ends of my nails within 2 days.  This stuff might last longer if you sit in a chair for 2 weeks but not if you even do normal household chores.  As several other mentioned the polish is thick and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth like other polishes.  It is not at all worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li> Was not a fan of this product. I was expecting it to really last on my nails like the commercial implies. I didn&#x27;t even make it through the first day and my polish was already chipping.</li>
