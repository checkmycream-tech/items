            <li>and it goes on beautifully, even for someone who isn&#x27;t very good at painting her nails;)</li>
            <li>it has to be one of my favorite polishes!</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing for all of you who are searching for a stamping polish in gold.</li>
            <li>Great polish----goes on smoothly and covers well.</li>
            <li>but anyway it is nice.</li>
            <li>This fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and gives a beautiful metallic shine that attracts eyes without being too in your face.</li>
            <li>Very bright and vibrant...</li>
            <li>The color are beatiful, solid and it´s perfect for stamping nail art like konad.</li>
            <li>It is more like a faded gold</li>
            <li>I love using this for nail art.</li>
            <li>You might say I love this color..... :)</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>Not quite the gold I wanted, looks more light brown with my skin.</li>
            <li>Its quite good for stamping though, it really is.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s great as a stand alone color, but I&#x27;m intending on keeping it for the sole purpose of stamping :)</li>
            <li>I think this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very opaque, shiny, chromey (not a real word I know) and great for nail stamping!  </li>
            <li>It really shows up when you stamp, especially on top of dark colors.</li>
            <li>When I saw this China Glaze color I immediately bought it hoping it could replace it since I only have good experiences from China</li>
            <li>I bought this polish for Konad stamping because I have not been able to find a good solid gold that will stamp clearly and opaquely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cool golden color that goes with a lot of other polishes.</li>
            <li>It has a gorgeous color but never dries fast, and even if it does dry, it keeps denting for over a day or so.</li>
            <li>The color was exactly like shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>I wear it as the color for Pediatric Cancer awareness, a cause very dear to my heart.</li>
            <li>Great quality thicker than average lacquer perfect for both base and stamping polish!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a highly pigmented gold, and if applied correctly you can get away with one coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty gold and doesn&#x27;t chip!</li>
            <li>The only issue is that the color in not as golden as I tougth,</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was eye-catching and had a wow factor...</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>As far as staying power...</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re all about the same unless you have acrylics, upon which the color lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially for nail art.</li>

            <li> Product arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Its not a bold gold, if thats what you are looking for.</li>

            <li> Am too old to wear weird colors and screaming reds or bubble gum colors.</li>
            <li> It does tend to get a little streaky, just shake it like crazy before use.</li>

            <li> Fell in love with this Bright metalic Gold polish! Great quality thicker than average lacquer perfect for both base and stamping polish! Product arrived quicker than expected. Gotten a lot of compliments definitely a recommended polish treasure!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly. Excellent for the people who like stamping their nails. That&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love it, it´s an excellent product. The color are beatiful, solid and it´s perfect for stamping nail art like konad.</li>

            <li> I bought this polish for Konad stamping because I have not been able to find a good solid gold that will stamp clearly and opaquely. This one does! It is amazing and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out with all of my plates!</li>
            <li> The color was exactly like shown in the picture. Its not a bold gold, if thats what you are looking for. It is more like a faded gold but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Probably the most impressive nail polish I own. WOW. Quick-drying, and only needed one coat. GORGEOUS color. I think this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing for all of you who are searching for a stamping polish in gold. This one is perfect for this use. Also it&#x27;s great as a stand alone color, but I&#x27;m intending on keeping it for the sole purpose of stamping :)</li>
            <li> I like this nail polish. The only issue is that the color in not as golden as I tougth, but anyway it is nice.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade of metallic gold and it goes on beautifully, even for someone who isn&#x27;t very good at painting her nails;)</li>
            <li> I love using this for nail art. It&#x27;s such a pretty gold and doesn&#x27;t chip! So happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the brightest or shiniest gold. It&#x27;s very subtle and classy looking. It does tend to get a little streaky, just shake it like crazy before use.</li>
            <li> I already have a gold in my stash of polishes, but its a cheaper brand. It has a gorgeous color but never dries fast, and even if it does dry, it keeps denting for over a day or so. When I saw this China Glaze color I immediately bought it hoping it could replace it since I only have good experiences from China Glaze - and boy am I happy! It dries quickly and gives a beautiful metallic shine that attracts eyes without being too in your face. I&#x27;ve only gotten compliments off it. I adore it - it has to be one of my favorite polishes!</li>
            <li> This gold is perfect, metallic but not glittery.  I wear it as the color for Pediatric Cancer awareness, a cause very dear to my heart.</li>
            <li> Not quite the gold I wanted, looks more light brown with my skin. Its quite good for stamping though, it really is.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a champagne gold color forever. Actually ever since I saw Dallas Prince, jewelry designer, showing her stuff. Didn&#x27;t care for it, but her nails were a gorgeous color and I think this is it. Am too old to wear weird colors and screaming reds or bubble gum colors. This fits the bill nicely. As far as staying power...they&#x27;re all about the same unless you have acrylics, upon which the color lasts much longer. I just put on a topcoat or 2 or Sally Hansen and that takes care of it. This is a very heavily pigmented color meaning it goes on very champagne gold and you could get away with 1 coat. If you are into stamping, this is an ideal background.</li>
            <li> Perfect for konad nail stamping. It&#x27;s a nice cool golden color that goes with a lot of other polishes. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Great polish----goes on smoothly and covers well. It is also the best gold I&#x27;ve found for stamping.  I highly recommend it, especially for nail art.</li>
            <li> PERFECT NAIL COLOR WITH THE PERFECT CONSISTENCY WITH THE PERFECT PRICE AND THE PERFECT BRUSH. You might say I love this color..... :)</li>
            <li> I love this color.  It&#x27;s very opaque, shiny, chromey (not a real word I know) and great for nail stamping!  It really shows up when you stamp, especially on top of dark colors.</li>
