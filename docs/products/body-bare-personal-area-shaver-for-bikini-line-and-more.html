            <li>I even gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it at several different hair lengths to see what worked best and wasn&#x27;t happy with any of the results.</li>
            <li>it IS a great product...meaning it is well made, it is quiet, and it provides a very smooth result without ANY discomfort.   </li>

            <li>But I got used to being smooth</li>
            <li>But, it is important to understand that this is not intended to cut hair of length.</li>
            <li>This product does not leave you smooth at all, and it is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Charger works too, but the shaver doesn&#x27;t fit it well.  </li>
            <li>and you want a free product.</li>

            <li>I will not risk any health issues with applying powder to my lady parts though so it may work better if you are willing to do so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to charge, and comes packaged well, but I would not recommend this product to anyone looking to trim very course hair.</li>

            <li>the old fashioned way works better</li>
            <li>so well it is EASY to stay bare and comfortable....</li>
            <li>where it did trim is very smooth and wonderful, and where it didn&#x27;t trim looks ugly and feels scratchy.   </li>
            <li>IT VERY MUCH.</li>

            <li>If you are contemplating going \\&quot;bare\\&quot; (and we would HIGHLY RECOMMEND...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is small and lightweight and charges very easily (I keep it plugged in at all times).</li>
            <li>this thing just does not work waste of money better off just doing it</li>
            <li>so I keep buying new ones when they start to bite me.</li>
            <li>Rather it is intended to remove stubble or newly growing hair.  </li>
            <li>Not real impressed by this to be honest.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I got nicked in several places and started to bleed (despite the product advertising</li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY like that, but with smaller holes.</li>
            <li>After my wife did an initial shave, she is able to use this once or twice a week to stay hairless without having to use a conventional shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use &amp; I have never had trouble with the battery holding a charge.  </li>
            <li>The product only trimmed in certain places, leaving a patchy appearance...</li>
            <li>My soon to be wife uses this to completely eliminate her pubic hair.  </li>
            <li>Huge waste of money, it barely even cuts any hair at all.</li>
            <li>I had to shave with my usual razor afterwards to make it as smooth as I like, so</li>
            <li>I still need to shave, and this works really well as long as you don&#x27;t allow the hair to grow beyond stubble.  </li>
            <li>She adjusted the blades repeatedly, scoured the instructions and the internet for advice but was never able to get the shaver to leave a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Body Bare Personal Shaver actually does what it says it will do ... shaves you close without rashes or nicks as long as you use baby powder first.  </li>
            <li>We have tried a variety of products (battery, electric, and hand razors) and NONE do what the Body Bare does...  </li>
            <li>If you have not tried going bare than I would suggest you give it try...</li>
            <li>When I decided to go &#x27;bare&#x27;</li>
            <li>Maybe I am being picky, but it doesn&#x27;t leave me bare.</li>
            <li>The square shape creates corners which can seize any skin wrinkles and will actually tear sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have had my pubic area laser treated, but that only reduced hair, it didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>I do like this, but had to use it a few times before I found the right angle and speed to use it at.</li>
            <li>I had never done dry shaving with baby powder so that was new to me.  </li>
            <li>My &#x27;Body Bare Personal Area Shaver&#x27; arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>This little shaver is to be used in intimate areas.  </li>
            <li>For those who prefer a less barren look, the small size and shape makes it easy to create or maintain any current design.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my wife because she has been wanting an easier method than blades or waxing.  She spent half a day determined to get the thing to work properly.  She adjusted the blades repeatedly, scoured the instructions and the internet for advice but was never able to get the shaver to leave a clean shave.  The shaver is particularly useless on coarser hair.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday with this and I do like it., The heads wear out too soon and will start to scrap skin to point of bleeding; very annoying. But I got used to being smooth so I keep buying new ones when they start to bite me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with skepticism...  The first time I used it, I got nicked in several places and started to bleed (despite the product advertising it&#x27;s cut-free abilities)  The product only trimmed in certain places, leaving a patchy appearance...where it did trim is very smooth and wonderful, and where it didn&#x27;t trim looks ugly and feels scratchy.   It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to charge, and comes packaged well, but I would not recommend this product to anyone looking to trim very course hair. The trimmer worked wonders on thinner hair, however on thicker hair the trimmer really disappointed me.  The trimmer makes a light buzzing noise, and is fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> Body Bare Personal Shaver actually does what it says it will do ... shaves you close without rashes or nicks as long as you use baby powder first.  It is small and lightweight and charges very easily (I keep it plugged in at all times). Try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!![[ASIN:B000F0WAZ8 Body Bare Personal Area Shaver for Bikini line and more]]</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product available for those of you that want to truly enjoy one another.  My wife and I use this shaver every day...it IS a great product...meaning it is well made, it is quiet, and it provides a very smooth result without ANY discomfort.   It does NOT pull on hair, it does not cut skin (even the most sensitive) and it does not create any discomfort.  It DOES deliver a result that is as close to perfection as we have found.   We have tried a variety of products (battery, electric, and hand razors) and NONE do what the Body Bare does...  If you are contemplating going \\&quot;bare\\&quot; (and we would HIGHLY RECOMMEND...if you want to truly enjoy one another orally) this IS THE ONLY PRODUCT for you.   As soon as this product arrived I knew it was something special...just the weight and feel of the product tells me it is well made.   The rechargeable battery life (the charge lasts for about 2 to 3 weeks) is exceptional and the product is EASY to use in nooks and crannies associated with the most sensitve female and male parts.  If you have not tried going bare than I would suggest you give it try...we were astonished at how it has changed our love life...   Now that we have a product that works so well it is EASY to stay bare and comfortable....this is the ONLY product we would recommend (and we have tried a bunch of the others).</li>
            <li> PAINLESS hair removal. It does take a little readjusting with the screw in the middle to get a close shave.  For very course hair, I have not gotten perfect results yet, but better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My soon to be wife uses this to completely eliminate her pubic hair.  It works great. There is no sign that hair ever grew there. Plus, it has never grabbed, pinched her skin or caused irritation.  But, it is important to understand that this is not intended to cut hair of length. Rather it is intended to remove stubble or newly growing hair.  After my wife did an initial shave, she is able to use this once or twice a week to stay hairless without having to use a conventional shaver.  For those who prefer a less barren look, the small size and shape makes it easy to create or maintain any current design.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave you smooth at all, and it is cheaply made.  The foil barrier between your skin and blades will crack exposing the blades.  I only got a little cut up when this happened to me.  I gave this product one star, because you can&#x27;t give it zero stars.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shave as close as it claimed, even though I used it on \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;.  I had to shave with my usual razor afterwards to make it as smooth as I like, so I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Remember back in the 80s there were these sweater shavers that could make your sweaters new again by shaving off all the little laundry fuzzballs after you pulled them out of the washer or dryer? This is EXACTLY like that, but with smaller holes. The holes are so dang small I couldn&#x27;t get any hair shaved. This didn&#x27;t even work for shaving the peach fuzz on my face. I don&#x27;t care what the other reviewer said about &#x27;delicate areas&#x27; because he obviously was too dumb to realize nothing got shaved.  This was a total rip off. I wish I had time to return it, but life got in the way and it was too late to return it when I had the time.</li>
            <li> If I want a close shave, I reach for the razor in the shower.  If I don&#x27;t have time for a shower, this product is fine.  I have received a couple of nicks though.  It&#x27;s really easy to use &amp; I have never had trouble with the battery holding a charge.  I&#x27;m not dissatisfied enough to return it though.</li>
            <li> When I decided to go &#x27;bare&#x27; my husband about flipped his lid! I used a razor in the shower for the first week and wound up with horrible bumps. I did a little research and found this shaver. I was skeptical but bought it anyway. I really like it. I use it every 2-3 days at least. Very smooth, no bumps. I have used it with and without the baby powder; I have to say it works better with. The one I bought requires C batteries so I&#x27;m going to get one of these rechargeable ones.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me AT ALL. Huge waste of money, it barely even cuts any hair at all.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Charger works too, but the shaver doesn&#x27;t fit it well.  kind of crappy.  Hoping to get some years out of it.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I do like this, but had to use it a few times before I found the right angle and speed to use it at. Does a nice job and use the talc that it comes with. The charge lasts a long time! Overall pretty satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This item arrived very quick. The instructions for use were very helpful. Smoothest shave. Minor problem was immediately resolved by customer service. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> First unit came and did not even turn on....second one worked but keeps stoping as you put pressure on it.</li>
            <li> if you are tired of razor bumps on your chest and back, and other areas, this shaver gets the job done. there is no binding or pulling of hair,just a close clean shave and easy to clean. great travel product</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  I read all of the instructions &amp; followed them step by step.  The product didn&#x27;t perform as advertised.  The shaver left spotty patches &amp; the areas that it did shave were not as close as I like it.  I had to use a razor to finish the job. I returned the product but still had to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> Great for stubble on any part of the body.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T and didn&#x27;t have good results. The shave wasn&#x27;t close. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it at several different hair lengths to see what worked best and wasn&#x27;t happy with any of the results. This is not a good substitute for a razor.</li>
            <li> I wrote to the merchant saying that the product is defective.. The merchants response was &amp;#34;You are a liar and you want a free product.</li>
            <li> screens kept breaking...do &#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I made sure to read reviews and to follow the directions not only from reviews, but the ones that came with the shaver. After all that research, this product didn&#x27;t work well for me. Trying to see if I can return it.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT! NO SCRATCHES,BURN,OR SKIN IRRITATION. MY! LADY LIKES IT VERY MUCH. USES IT 2 TIMES A WEEK. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Not real impressed by this to be honest. Maybe I am being picky, but it doesn&#x27;t leave me bare. I still have prickles.</li>
            <li> My &#x27;Body Bare Personal Area Shaver&#x27; arrived on time.  I simply ordered this in a season that I still have not used it.  I hope to do so soon.  Really a nice looking product.</li>
            <li> After trying this shaver for several times,  i threw it away.  It does not work very well.  One had to run it over and over and over the same spot to have any effect.  .</li>
            <li> this thing just does not work waste of money better off just doing it the old fashioned way works better</li>
            <li> This little shaver is to be used in intimate areas.  The way to use it is to make circular motions with the shaving screen applied to the skin.  The openings in the screen that seize the hair to be cut are square.  The square shape creates corners which can seize any skin wrinkles and will actually tear sensitive skin.  The shaver works great on flat areas down to a &amp;#34;two-day&amp;#34; stubble length.  Both men and women must be cautious when shaving skin areas that have wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t make it without this razor.I hope some day I can own a No No until them this is my go to razor.</li>
            <li> It works ok but only if the stubble is sticking up.  I will not risk any health issues with applying powder to my lady parts though so it may work better if you are willing to do so.</li>
            <li> Love it. Wife love&#x27;s it  The shaver does a great job and everything is so smooth. Great product to have</li>
            <li> This product is very deceiving. Ive tried it multiple times with lots of baby powder and it still didn&#x27;t take any hair. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> The charger thing is a little wonky, but it does work.  The shaver works VERY well.  I had never done dry shaving with baby powder so that was new to me.  This method works very well.  I have had my pubic area laser treated, but that only reduced hair, it didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it.  I still need to shave, and this works really well as long as you don&#x27;t allow the hair to grow beyond stubble.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you are patient and use ALOT of baby powder, this shaver works as advertised. I&#x27;ve found that I still need to follow up with another, larger shaver though.</li>
            <li> does not work very well, stick with a razor</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t perform like it was advertised. Doesn&#x27;t get stubble or a really close and smooth shave. I am disappointed. Would not recommend.</li>
