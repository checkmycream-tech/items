            <li>The varieties of the chapstick have good taste and effect.</li>

            <li>love the flavors!</li>
            <li>And they just feel amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grapefruit: AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I switched to Burts Bees because their baby products are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It feels amazing on my lips.</li>
            <li>OMG the scents are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Both were amazing.</li>
            <li>and they all smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I love the grapefruit and pomegranate flavors, but the acai berry and mango butter are really good, too.</li>
            <li>Stick with their beeswax kind.  </li>
            <li>so lipsticks wear really nice over this.</li>
            <li>Nice neutral colors, well moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and this was a great variety pack to share with my wife when we needed more.  </li>
            <li>The flavors are nice.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, and this new collection is one of their best.</li>
            <li>Love the whole Burt&#x27;s Bees product line, and these were a great deal!</li>
            <li>I love chap stick, but this chap stick is really, really nice and</li>
            <li>They are tasty, the perfect texture, all natural, I keep them everywhere.</li>
            <li>Smell is good; keeps lips smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the popular brands (even the ones in the cute spherical containers).  </li>
            <li>The flavours are lovely and it is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t cake at all.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick.</li>
            <li>my gf love this product&lt;</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;hehe &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love having a choice of flavors and, sometimes, I use one or more as part of a gift to someone else.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s bees Chapstick is my favorite and I will continue to buy this over and over again for myself and as a gift</li>
            <li>I love these lip balms.</li>
            <li>It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips.</li>
            <li>I love it way more than the EOS lip balm.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite flavors of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.</li>
            <li>They each serve a different purpose, but each leave my lips feeling wonderful after every use.</li>
            <li>I really love these lip balms.</li>
            <li>Very happy though, and will definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li>Their quality is the best and each of these four serve a specific purpose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to something in most lip balm, but this is one of two brands that I can wear.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>I love this balm.</li>
            <li>Fantastic lip balms!  </li>

            <li>The lip balm is fantastic!</li>
            <li>My favorite is the pomegranate and the acai.</li>
            <li>Got these on sale, and buying a multi-pack on sale is the best option for giving them as useful, appreciated gifts.  </li>
            <li>; things. :)</li>

            <li>All natural, good taste and smell!</li>
            <li>I live in the northeast and lip balm is a necessity in the winter - these work great; goes on nice and smooth, not waxy, stays on for hours.  </li>

            <li>One of the best gifts sharing with friends in a dry winter.</li>
            <li>As my title states, I enjoy Burts Bee&#x27;s replenishing lip gloss the most in this Value Pack.</li>
            <li>favorite is the mango butter, a light citrus flavor that brightens and softens my lips.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms smell great, have yummy flavors and make your lips kissably soft.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite is the pomegranate, but I really do enjoy them all.</li>
            <li>with any chapstick, it&#x27;ll come off into your drinks depending on how you drink it and give your whole drinking vessel a hint of the flavor, which isn&#x27;t really a good thing.</li>
            <li>I love love love chap-stick and like trying new ones these have nice textures  and flavors.</li>
            <li>Really, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>

            <li>Goes on easy and protects well against wind, sun, and chapped lips.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal and I love the different flavors!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy a child can use it.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are amazing, they are good and not tested on animals, I have several balms, and like all of them.</li>
            <li>Make more types - maybe 12 , a dozen one for each month of flavor and make it a more economical packet.</li>
            <li>They come in delicious scents, and they work really well to keep your lips super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>scent of each unique lip balm is very mild and pleasing.</li>

            <li>smooth lips fo the lady</li>
            <li>No one would say no for a free lip balm..</li>
            <li>Great buy, would definitely order them again.</li>
            <li>They are natural and smell so good it makes you want to eat them.</li>
            <li>This pack is very useful.</li>
            <li>I was attracted to this because I&#x27;ve been a Burt&#x27;s Bees girl for years; always stuck with original.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a lip balm freak and like to have one easily accessible everywhere</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, as usual from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>None of these are the original Burt&#x27;s bees flavor.</li>
            <li>I have such sensitive skin, but this lip balm is the best.  </li>
            <li>I like the formula, not as big of a fan of the taste, but it&#x27;s moderately pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little gift, and I enjoy stocking up on these lip balms and having enough to give to family and friends with my great recommendation.</li>
            <li>These smell and work great, Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms have changed my very very dry lips</li>
            <li>I loved the products so much, but they are not sold in Michigan and the shipping cost was just too high.  </li>
            <li>absolute favorite lip-gloss.  </li>
            <li>The Rejuvenating Balm is addictive because it smells so good.</li>
            <li>The different variations in flavor all smell good.</li>
            <li>If you like any one of these, this is a great way to sample the other &#x27;flavors&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tremendous.</li>
            <li>This pack is a super value.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super cereal.</li>
            <li>love hurts and any organic products or natural solutions!</li>
            <li>I even got her their belly butter while she&#x27;s pregnant right now.  </li>
            <li>The formula is a little softer and easier to apply than the others, and keeps my lips hydrated and happy.  </li>
            <li>not afraid to give these to moisturize my children rather than chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love the pink grapefruit the most.  </li>
            <li>but I only liked 3 of the flavors.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved the original Beeswax Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for several years, but recently developed a sensitivity to the peppermint oil in the formula.  </li>
            <li>I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly find that my lips had any lasting good effect from these after a couple of days of wearing them.</li>
            <li>I started out using Burt&#x27;s moisturizing mask and have been delighted to explore other products.</li>
            <li>Not to greasy/ with the right amount of moisturizer</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish is that the fruit ones would leave you with the same tingly/minty feeling that the original kind does!</li>
            <li>Purchasing one lip balm where I live costs me about 4 dollars a piece, so I do love saving as much as I do, purchasing from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Bought assorted flavors as previous usage experience was good.</li>
            <li>After borrowing my friend&#x27;s lip balm and not giving it back because I liked the pomegranate one so much, I decided to buy this 4 pack.</li>
            <li>These leave your lips feeling baby soft and super moisturized!</li>
            <li>I am such a HUGE fan!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the pomegranate ever since i first tried it years ago.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
            <li>Will keep this as a backup for when I inevitably lose all my lip balms at once. :)</li>
            <li>This actually made our lips chap more.</li>
            <li>They make my lips feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Glad that it&#x27;s 4 in a pack and will last longer till I lose then again.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to beeswax lip balm at Savannah Bee Company while on vacation.  </li>
            <li>The orange and red top can be found almost anywhere.</li>
            <li>Its not to harsh and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the smell and the fact that it applies smoothly, however; it wears off way too quickly and I have to re-apply too often.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to clear up his issues significantly</li>
            <li>These are a good bit more expensive in person.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t moisturize my lips like the original does, and the only benefits are temporary relief of dry lips, and they smell nice.</li>
            <li>Met my expectations exactly and really helps with the chapped lip situation.</li>
            <li>Moisturizers, last long and smells good.</li>
            <li>The balm goes on super smoothly, unlike any other lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used, and delivers long-lasting moisture.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use them daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also just bought the whole set to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re all used to and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>i LOVE this product i use the pink one</li>
            <li>They were very well received.</li>
            <li>so lets just say this works for me very well.</li>
            <li>The pink grapefruit is my favorite, along with the mango and acai.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these lip balms!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing.</li>
            <li>He loves Burt Bee&#x27;s as much as I do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pomegranate: I liked the flavor on this alright, but for some reason, disliked how it felt when applied.  </li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are natural, and that the second ingredient listed is coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Back to the original for me though..</li>
            <li>These come in many gift baskets with other BB products.  </li>
            <li>If i use any lip balm other than this brand, love it.  </li>
            <li>: Decent.  </li>
            <li>A decent balm</li>
            <li>I particularly like the mango butter.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last very long, come off easily, and the color is pretty much negligible.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better than that first slick of a new chap stick.</li>
            <li>I personally love this brand but was surprised to see only two lip balms present in place of 4 when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>so I return to looking like a normal man again.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly.</li>
            <li>GF loves these new flavors and this brand worth the purchase especially in this value pack to try something new.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t live through the winter without it.</li>
            <li>I already have the Nourishing Balm, and while I like it, I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>But I had never tried the pink or white top.</li>
            <li>Protect your lips with this natural product!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It still has the same consistency as the original, and while I miss the minty tingle, it moisturizes my lips just the same.  </li>
            <li>I tried several other products to heal my chapped winter lips without much success, so I picked up my first tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Great quality product that can be a bit expensive when purchasing elsewhere - will be watching it here for future re-purchase.</li>
            <li>lips are important.&lt;br /&gt;Choose natural ingredients that you can identify.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>This seems to heal well, last longer and compete really well with Chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of them contain naturally conditioning beeswax.</li>
            <li>The lip balm contains 100% natural fruit</li>
            <li>Now the pomegranate one is my least favorite of the bunch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and helps my lips moist.</li>
            <li>This keeps lips soft.</li>
            <li>I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm in the last year and am absolutely hooked.  </li>
            <li>It is natural, no/minimum chemicals.</li>
            <li>Protects her lips and makes them soft</li>
            <li>Also a plus they they are made with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I would just say if you are sensitive, too, don&#x27;t buy the peppermint variety, which is not in this set anyway.</li>
            <li>Although this might be one of the more expensive brands of chapstick, it is definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li>the price was right for all 4 balms (they were more expensive in stores).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying a pack of four so that you can stash them in multiple places (purse, car, home, bedside table, etc.).</li>
            <li>I purchase this in the four packs since we go through so much of it all year long.</li>
            <li>the only reason im giving this four stars instead of five is because i was looking for that minty, tingly feeling you normally get when useing burts bees on your lips.</li>
            <li>This product is of superior quality the only downside is that little bit pricey but it will last for so long that it will automatically make you think that price is not very high.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use, I loved this so much that I bought 2 more tubes: [[ASIN:B0071CRK12 Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, Pink Grapefruit, 0.15 oz, 2 pack]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My general impressions of each flavor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; on the grapefruit flavor but not so much I won&#x27;t use it, and I like the other 3</li>
            <li>I had never tried each one individually and there is not a single one that I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Happy with the purchase-good product.</li>
            <li> They smell great, but if you are looking for lip balm with fruit flavors, that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re going to get.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved citrus flavors &amp; scents, and this is no departure.  </li>
            <li> The varieties of the chapstick have good taste and effect.</li>

            <li> I like the smell, it smells good,</li>

            <li> love the flavors!</li>
            <li> And they just feel amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grapefruit: AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I switched to Burts Bees because their baby products are amazing.  </li>
            <li> It feels amazing on my lips.</li>
            <li> OMG the scents are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Both were amazing.</li>
            <li> and they all smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I love the grapefruit and pomegranate flavors, but the acai berry and mango butter are really good, too.</li>
            <li> Stick with their beeswax kind.  </li>
            <li> so lipsticks wear really nice over this.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral colors, well moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and this was a great variety pack to share with my wife when we needed more.  </li>
            <li> The flavors are nice.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, and this new collection is one of their best.</li>
            <li> Love the whole Burt&#x27;s Bees product line, and these were a great deal!</li>
            <li> I love chap stick, but this chap stick is really, really nice and</li>
            <li> They are tasty, the perfect texture, all natural, I keep them everywhere.</li>
            <li> Smell is good; keeps lips smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the popular brands (even the ones in the cute spherical containers).  </li>
            <li> The flavours are lovely and it is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t cake at all.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick.</li>

            <li> I love having a choice of flavors and, sometimes, I use one or more as part of a gift to someone else.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees Chapstick is my favorite and I will continue to buy this over and over again for myself and as a gift</li>
            <li> I love these lip balms.</li>
            <li> It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips.</li>
            <li> I love it way more than the EOS lip balm.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite flavors of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.</li>
            <li> They each serve a different purpose, but each leave my lips feeling wonderful after every use.</li>
            <li> I really love these lip balms.</li>
            <li> Very happy though, and will definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li> Their quality is the best and each of these four serve a specific purpose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to something in most lip balm, but this is one of two brands that I can wear.</li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> I love this balm.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lip balms!  </li>

            <li> I am glad I thought to look on amazon for them.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm is fantastic!</li>
            <li> My favorite is the pomegranate and the acai.</li>
            <li> Got these on sale, and buying a multi-pack on sale is the best option for giving them as useful, appreciated gifts.  </li>
            <li> ; things. :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like most of the smells....</li>

            <li> All natural, good taste and smell!</li>
            <li> I live in the northeast and lip balm is a necessity in the winter - these work great; goes on nice and smooth, not waxy, stays on for hours.  </li>
            <li> I like it really good, i like it very much.</li>
            <li> One of the best gifts sharing with friends in a dry winter.</li>
            <li> As my title states, I enjoy Burts Bee&#x27;s replenishing lip gloss the most in this Value Pack.</li>
            <li> favorite is the mango butter, a light citrus flavor that brightens and softens my lips.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms smell great, have yummy flavors and make your lips kissably soft.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite is the pomegranate, but I really do enjoy them all.</li>
            <li> with any chapstick, it&#x27;ll come off into your drinks depending on how you drink it and give your whole drinking vessel a hint of the flavor, which isn&#x27;t really a good thing.</li>
            <li> I love love love chap-stick and like trying new ones these have nice textures  and flavors.</li>
            <li> Really, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>

            <li> This is a great deal and I love the different flavors!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy a child can use it.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are amazing, they are good and not tested on animals, I have several balms, and like all of them.</li>
            <li> Make more types - maybe 12 , a dozen one for each month of flavor and make it a more economical packet.</li>
            <li> They come in delicious scents, and they work really well to keep your lips super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> scent of each unique lip balm is very mild and pleasing.</li>
            <li> Nice to have so many options in a natural brand.</li>

            <li> This four pack is a great value, especially when purchased as a subscribe and save item.</li>
            <li> My wife and friends also enjoy a lot.</li>
            <li> smooth lips fo the lady</li>
            <li> No one would say no for a free lip balm..</li>
            <li> Great buy, would definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> They are natural and smell so good it makes you want to eat them.</li>
            <li> This pack is very useful.</li>
            <li> I was attracted to this because I&#x27;ve been a Burt&#x27;s Bees girl for years; always stuck with original.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a lip balm freak and like to have one easily accessible everywhere</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, as usual from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li> None of these are the original Burt&#x27;s bees flavor.</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin, but this lip balm is the best.  </li>
            <li> I like the formula, not as big of a fan of the taste, but it&#x27;s moderately pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little gift, and I enjoy stocking up on these lip balms and having enough to give to family and friends with my great recommendation.</li>
            <li> These smell and work great, Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms have changed my very very dry lips</li>
            <li> I loved the products so much, but they are not sold in Michigan and the shipping cost was just too high.  </li>
            <li> absolute favorite lip-gloss.  </li>
            <li> The Rejuvenating Balm is addictive because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> The different variations in flavor all smell good.</li>
            <li> If you like any one of these, this is a great way to sample the other &#x27;flavors&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tremendous.</li>
            <li> This pack is a super value.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super cereal.</li>
            <li> love hurts and any organic products or natural solutions!</li>
            <li> I even got her their belly butter while she&#x27;s pregnant right now.  </li>
            <li> The formula is a little softer and easier to apply than the others, and keeps my lips hydrated and happy.  </li>
            <li> not afraid to give these to moisturize my children rather than chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love the pink grapefruit the most.  </li>
            <li> but I only liked 3 of the flavors.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the original Beeswax Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for several years, but recently developed a sensitivity to the peppermint oil in the formula.  </li>
            <li> I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly find that my lips had any lasting good effect from these after a couple of days of wearing them.</li>
            <li> I started out using Burt&#x27;s moisturizing mask and have been delighted to explore other products.</li>
            <li> Not to greasy/ with the right amount of moisturizer</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that the fruit ones would leave you with the same tingly/minty feeling that the original kind does!</li>
            <li> Purchasing one lip balm where I live costs me about 4 dollars a piece, so I do love saving as much as I do, purchasing from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought assorted flavors as previous usage experience was good.</li>
            <li> After borrowing my friend&#x27;s lip balm and not giving it back because I liked the pomegranate one so much, I decided to buy this 4 pack.</li>
            <li> These leave your lips feeling baby soft and super moisturized!</li>
            <li> I am such a HUGE fan!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pomegranate ever since i first tried it years ago.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
            <li> Will keep this as a backup for when I inevitably lose all my lip balms at once. :)</li>
            <li> This actually made our lips chap more.</li>
            <li> They make my lips feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Glad that it&#x27;s 4 in a pack and will last longer till I lose then again.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to beeswax lip balm at Savannah Bee Company while on vacation.  </li>
            <li> The orange and red top can be found almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> Its not to harsh and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the smell and the fact that it applies smoothly, however; it wears off way too quickly and I have to re-apply too often.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to clear up his issues significantly</li>
            <li> These are a good bit more expensive in person.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t moisturize my lips like the original does, and the only benefits are temporary relief of dry lips, and they smell nice.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations exactly and really helps with the chapped lip situation.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers, last long and smells good.</li>
            <li> The balm goes on super smoothly, unlike any other lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used, and delivers long-lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use them daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also just bought the whole set to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re all used to and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> i LOVE this product i use the pink one</li>
            <li> They were very well received.</li>
            <li> so lets just say this works for me very well.</li>
            <li> The pink grapefruit is my favorite, along with the mango and acai.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these lip balms!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks for providing.</li>
            <li> He loves Burt Bee&#x27;s as much as I do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pomegranate: I liked the flavor on this alright, but for some reason, disliked how it felt when applied.  </li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are natural, and that the second ingredient listed is coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Back to the original for me though..</li>
            <li> These come in many gift baskets with other BB products.  </li>
            <li> If i use any lip balm other than this brand, love it.  </li>
            <li> : Decent.  </li>
            <li> A decent balm</li>
            <li> I particularly like the mango butter.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long, come off easily, and the color is pretty much negligible.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than that first slick of a new chap stick.</li>
            <li> I personally love this brand but was surprised to see only two lip balms present in place of 4 when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> so I return to looking like a normal man again.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly.</li>
            <li> GF loves these new flavors and this brand worth the purchase especially in this value pack to try something new.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t live through the winter without it.</li>
            <li> I already have the Nourishing Balm, and while I like it, I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> But I had never tried the pink or white top.</li>
            <li> Protect your lips with this natural product!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> It still has the same consistency as the original, and while I miss the minty tingle, it moisturizes my lips just the same.  </li>
            <li> I tried several other products to heal my chapped winter lips without much success, so I picked up my first tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Great quality product that can be a bit expensive when purchasing elsewhere - will be watching it here for future re-purchase.</li>
            <li> lips are important.&lt;br /&gt;Choose natural ingredients that you can identify.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> This seems to heal well, last longer and compete really well with Chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of them contain naturally conditioning beeswax.</li>
            <li> The lip balm contains 100% natural fruit</li>
            <li> Now the pomegranate one is my least favorite of the bunch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and helps my lips moist.</li>
            <li> This keeps lips soft.</li>
            <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm in the last year and am absolutely hooked.  </li>
            <li> It is natural, no/minimum chemicals.</li>
            <li> Protects her lips and makes them soft</li>
            <li> Also a plus they they are made with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I would just say if you are sensitive, too, don&#x27;t buy the peppermint variety, which is not in this set anyway.</li>
            <li> Although this might be one of the more expensive brands of chapstick, it is definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li> the price was right for all 4 balms (they were more expensive in stores).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying a pack of four so that you can stash them in multiple places (purse, car, home, bedside table, etc.).</li>
            <li> I purchase this in the four packs since we go through so much of it all year long.</li>
            <li> the only reason im giving this four stars instead of five is because i was looking for that minty, tingly feeling you normally get when useing burts bees on your lips.</li>
            <li> This product is of superior quality the only downside is that little bit pricey but it will last for so long that it will automatically make you think that price is not very high.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I loved this so much that I bought 2 more tubes: [[ASIN:B0071CRK12 Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, Pink Grapefruit, 0.15 oz, 2 pack]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My general impressions of each flavor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; on the grapefruit flavor but not so much I won&#x27;t use it, and I like the other 3</li>
            <li> I had never tried each one individually and there is not a single one that I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I prefer Desert Essence&#x27;s lip balms which last about 3-4x as long and last through eating and drinking.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different natural lip balms and found that Burt&#x27;s Bees is the closest to the standard chap stick</li>
            <li> The tubes last a long time without drying out or losing their flavor.</li>
            <li> They last for hours and keep my dry lips hydrated</li>
            <li> The pomegranate does have a little color to it, but the others are clear.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I will use all year long, not just in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> They completely healed my dry, cracked lips in just a few days.</li>
            <li> , when the air gets dry indoors sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This beeswax contain beneficial nutrients which helps to soften dry lips.</li>
            <li> My lips don&#x27;t dry out when it wears off.</li>
            <li> Differently than any other on the lips sticky because bareuni it!</li>
            <li> This is a four pack of assorted balm flavors which includes pomegranate, acai berry, mango butter and pink grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> But I got two Pomegranate Oil, one Acai Berry and one Mango Butter, didn&#x27;t get the pink fruit</li>
            <li> If you have a family reunion coming up or something similar, you may stock a few boxed of it..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only brand that doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive lips worse.</li>
            <li> Other products don&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t go mushy in the heat like other brands.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to try other BB products.</li>
            <li> The only complaint (and I&#x27;m not really that upset about it...)</li>
            <li> It is hard to find all the different flavors sometimes, and they do not disappoint.</li>
            <li> only complaint is has no color but smells and taste delicous 2 thumbs up</li>
            <li> Not super greasy like some lip balms.</li>
            <li> A little costlier than others though.</li>
            <li> Little pricey for 4 tubes, but couldn&#x27;t find this variety anywhere else.</li>
            <li> just took a little while to get here.</li>
            <li> The others are a little off putting for lip balm.  </li>
            <li> If you are using this with little ones, I would suggest not giving them this tube to use.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I can forget I have it on after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> , I use these at night to bed and under lipsticks, the formula is not too slick</li>
            <li> i did not get that. :-/</li>
            <li> The lemonade, for instance, is a weird sour taste.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sick of paying close to $4.00 for one of these babies at your local pharm, just do yourself the favor and get the 4 pack.</li>
            <li> I HARDLY REAPPLY!  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;re addicted to this stuff</li>
            <li> I am really annoyed.</li>
            <li> However, I was actually disappointed with the other varieties.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend is obsessed with this stuff, so when the price dropped, I had to pick it up.</li>
            <li> Usually I break out on my lips (very uncomfortable and unattractive!)</li>
            <li> This winter, do not be afraid to teuneun lips.</li>
            <li> No chapped lips, even in this extremely cold winter.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a product that smells (and tastes!)</li>
            <li> I was shocked to learn that Chapstick has parabens in it</li>
            <li> My lips are really painful now</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> My wife has never been disappointed by anything I&#x27;ve given her with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s on it.</li>
            <li> and I have never been disappointed in the quality and performance of these products.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the kinds that come in order :(</li>
            <li> It made my lips so chapped, that my lips cracked and it was painful!  </li>
            <li> I lost my lip balm and was at Trader Joe&#x27;s and purchased their brand lip balm that came with 4 in a package - it was awful!  </li>
            <li> It works terribly.  </li>
            <li> Worst practical chapstick we have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Chapped lips are the worst.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pomegranate ever since i first tried it years ago. If you like any one of these, this is a great way to sample the other &#x27;flavors&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any chapstick, it&#x27;ll come off into your drinks depending on how you drink it and give your whole drinking vessel a hint of the flavor, which isn&#x27;t really a good thing.</li>
            <li> Differently than any other on the lips sticky because bareuni it! This winter, do not be afraid to teuneun lips.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick. Especially the ones with the menthol in them. It&#x27;s the only brand that doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive lips worse. I will buy nothing else.</li>
            <li> my gf love this product&lt;br /&gt;smells and taste delicous.&lt;br /&gt;love kissing my gf lip&lt;br /&gt;hehe &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;5 starS for THIS</li>
            <li> Not your regular chap stick!  I love chap stick, but this chap stick is really, really nice and even looks like you have lip gloss on!  An added plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm for years and love it!  This is a good value pack and gives a nice variety.  I live in the northeast and lip balm is a necessity in the winter - these work great; goes on nice and smooth, not waxy, stays on for hours.  I&#x27;ve never had chapped lips using Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm!</li>
            <li> I tried several other products to heal my chapped winter lips without much success, so I picked up my first tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm at the grocery store.  When I got home and tried it, the fragrance was heavenly!  I was skeptical that a product that smells (and tastes!) so wonderful could heal my sore, cracked lips, but I immediately felt relief and after just a few days, my lips were healed.  This 4 pack is a great way to try some of the different flavors and stock up on the product.  Personally, I love the grapefruit and pomegranate flavors, but the acai berry and mango butter are really good, too. This is a product that I will use all year long, not just in the winter months.  Also would be a wonderful, inexpensive gift to give your friends, co-workers, and family members.  Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm is it!  I&#x27;ll never buy Chapstick or Carmex again.</li>
            <li> Good product and great as gift. Bought assorted flavors as previous usage experience was good. Product was well sealed too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these several times.  I love having a choice of flavors and, sometimes, I use one or more as part of a gift to someone else.  I&#x27;ve also just bought the whole set to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural, not sticky or tasting like chemicals, makes your lips feel smooth and rehydrated.  Especially great in the winter, when the air gets dry indoors sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My absolute favorite lip-gloss.  I always have some on hand.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees Chapstick is my favorite and I will continue to buy this over and over again for myself and as a gift</li>
            <li> I lost my lip balm and was at Trader Joe&#x27;s and purchased their brand lip balm that came with 4 in a package - it was awful!  It made my lips so chapped, that my lips cracked and it was painful!  I had to constantly reapply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy anything else BUT Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I am such a HUGE fan!  They keep my lips moist and it never dries my lips out.  I HARDLY REAPPLY!  I am not only a fan of their lip balm, but of ALL their products!</li>
            <li> I love these lip balms. The flavours are lovely and it is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t cake at all. Very happy with this purchase. :-)</li>
            <li> My last one was melt in the drier. I just can&#x27;t live through the winter without it. Also, it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to learn that Chapstick has parabens in it and I was putting it on my MOUTH and probably ingesting it at times.  I tried a few different natural lip balms and found that Burt&#x27;s Bees is the closest to the standard chap stick we&#x27;re all used to and at a reasonable price.  I highly recommend buying a pack of four so that you can stash them in multiple places (purse, car, home, bedside table, etc.).</li>
            <li> I will admit this is a great chap stick. It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly. It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips. I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items. It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
            <li> The purple one smells like the Flinstone&#x27;s vitamins i used to have as a kid...but as always burts bees is one of the best chap-sticks around.  Its not to harsh and it smells good.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this product i use the pink one only complaint is has no color but smells and taste delicous 2 thumbs up (:</li>
            <li> Be smart.&lt;br /&gt;Your lips are important.&lt;br /&gt;Choose natural ingredients that you can identify.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from artificial ingredients and colors.&lt;br /&gt;These flavors are nice as well. Although, I could do without the Pomegranate.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! I love it way more than the EOS lip balm. These smell soooooo good! And they just feel amazing. I bought this 4 pack so that I could keep one in my bedroom, one in my purse, one at my job, and one in my dressing room. I absolutely love them!! I get very chapped lips, and these are just amazing.</li>
            <li> I was attracted to this because I&#x27;ve been a Burt&#x27;s Bees girl for years; always stuck with original.  But these flavors sounded too good to pass up so I decided to give it a try.  I am a big fan of the smell and the fact that it applies smoothly, however; it wears off way too quickly and I have to re-apply too often.  Disappointed but I will still keep these because they smell great.  Back to the original for me though..</li>
            <li> I used them as party favors. They were very well received. All the girls loved them. Really a great item.</li>
            <li> Love the whole Burt&#x27;s Bees product line, and these were a great deal! I stocked up for the winter, no chance of running out.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite flavors of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. They are tasty, the perfect texture, all natural, I keep them everywhere. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Tremendous. My wife has never been disappointed by anything I&#x27;ve given her with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s on it. Quality stuff that&#x27;s good for one!</li>
            <li> i gave these to my boyfriend in his stocking for christmas and he loved it! we&#x27;re addicted to this stuff</li>
            <li> GF loves these new flavors and this brand worth the purchase especially in this value pack to try something new.</li>
            <li> I personally love this brand but was surprised to see only two lip balms present in place of 4 when I opened the package. I am really annoyed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it through all the last winter and this set is bought for the coming autumn ha ha.</li>
            <li> I already have the Nourishing Balm, and while I like it, I wanted to try something new. The Rejuvenating Balm is addictive because it smells so good. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are always quite nice!</li>
            <li> love hurts and any organic products or natural solutions! not afraid to give these to moisturize my children rather than chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the original Beeswax Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for several years, but recently developed a sensitivity to the peppermint oil in the formula.  So I went on a quest to find the perfect replacement.  This sampler pack was a great way to do that, as I am delighted to have discovered the Grapefruit lip balm.  For this, I am giving the product 4 stars.  However, I was actually disappointed with the other varieties.  My general impressions of each flavor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit: AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve always loved citrus flavors &amp; scents, and this is no departure.  The formula is a little softer and easier to apply than the others, and keeps my lips hydrated and happy.  After a few weeks of use, I loved this so much that I bought 2 more tubes: [[ASIN:B0071CRK12 Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, Pink Grapefruit, 0.15 oz, 2 pack]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acai: Decent.  I like the formula, not as big of a fan of the taste, but it&#x27;s moderately pleasant.  Will keep this as a backup for when I inevitably lose all my lip balms at once. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate: I liked the flavor on this alright, but for some reason, disliked how it felt when applied.  I gave this one to my husband, won&#x27;t be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mango: I didn&#x27;t like the taste at all. I gave this one to my husband, won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm! Great flavors. Goes on easy and protects well against wind, sun, and chapped lips. I&#x27;m still looking for the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; out there, but this is very good.</li>
            <li> I get cracked lips in the winter this helps out the best of all the lip balms. The flavors help keep variety so lets just say this works for me very well.</li>
            <li> My wife and I switched to Burts Bees because their baby products are amazing.  These come in many gift baskets with other BB products.  This seems to heal well, last longer and compete really well with Chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons to mention.</li>
            <li> As my title states, I enjoy Burts Bee&#x27;s replenishing lip gloss the most in this Value Pack. They each serve a different purpose, but each leave my lips feeling wonderful after every use. Purchasing one lip balm where I live costs me about 4 dollars a piece, so I do love saving as much as I do, purchasing from Amazon. This is a great little gift, and I enjoy stocking up on these lip balms and having enough to give to family and friends with my great recommendation.</li>
            <li> This product is of superior quality the only downside is that little bit pricey but it will last for so long that it will automatically make you think that price is not very high.</li>
            <li> It tastes GREAT.  It works terribly.  Worst practical chapstick we have ever used.  Stick with their beeswax kind.  That they make properly.This actually made our lips chap more.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, and this new collection is one of their best. This is a four pack of assorted balm flavors which includes pomegranate, acai berry, mango butter and pink grapefruit.  All of them contain naturally conditioning beeswax. This beeswax contain beneficial nutrients which helps to soften dry lips. The lip balm contains 100% natural fruit flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the mango butter, a light citrus flavor that brightens and softens my lips. This does not color my lips, but the pomegranate and acai berry leave a sight red color.  I replenish the lip balm during the day, and am very happy with god results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-29-14</li>
            <li> Although this might be one of the more expensive brands of chapstick, it is definitely worth buying.  The varieties of the chapstick have good taste and effect.</li>
            <li> I really love these lip balms. I put them on at night, and when I wake up it&#x27;s still on my lips. They completely healed my dry, cracked lips in just a few days. The only complaint (and I&#x27;m not really that upset about it...) is that the colored caps make it seem like the balm would be tinted. The pomegranate does have a little color to it, but the others are clear. Very happy though, and will definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li> I get my wife Burt&#x27;s Bees products each Christmas as a gift.  She lives by this stuff and can&#x27;t leave without their products.  I even got her their belly butter while she&#x27;s pregnant right now.  Their quality is the best and each of these four serve a specific purpose.  Great item!</li>
            <li> After borrowing my friend&#x27;s lip balm and not giving it back because I liked the pomegranate one so much, I decided to buy this 4 pack. Great lip balms that you would expect from Burt&#x27;s Bees. The pink grapefruit is my favorite, along with the mango and acai. Now the pomegranate one is my least favorite of the bunch.</li>
            <li> These smell and work great, Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms have changed my very very dry lips, I use these at night to bed and under lipsticks, the formula is not too slick so lipsticks wear really nice over this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to something in most lip balm, but this is one of two brands that I can wear. It leaves my lips feeling smooth and mositurized.</li>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s bees lip balm ! It&#x27;s natural and helps my lips moist. I will buy this lip balm again.</li>
            <li> I like it really good, i like it very much. And I believe  Tissot is a good brand. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I love this brand. This pack is very useful. I love this balm. It feels amazing on my lips. It is so necessary for the summer and winter. Protect your lips with this natural product!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and I love the different flavors!  Also makes a great gift for people who like chapstick.</li>
            <li> This keeps lips soft. Other products don&#x27;t seem to work for me. I had to constantly re-apply them. When I use this, the lip cracking and dryness goes away.</li>
            <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm in the last year and am absolutely hooked.  Mind you, I&#x27;m a lip balm freak and like to have one easily accessible everywhere I&#x27;ll need it (in my purse, on my nightstand, with my makeup, in my office desk).  This pack is a super value.  I&#x27;m &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; on the grapefruit flavor but not so much I won&#x27;t use it, and I like the other 3 so I&amp;#34;ll be buying this pack again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lip balms!  These are absolutely my favorite and go to balms.  I use lots of lip products, but these are always in my life!  I use one every day and I have never been disappointed in the quality and performance of these products.  All of these&amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; are great so you will be sure to find your favorite or like me, I love them all.</li>
            <li> Love these balms! All natural, good taste and smell! Also, they don&#x27;t go mushy in the heat like other brands.</li>
            <li> price is good, the lip balm favors are great.</li>
            <li> A decent balm but it doesn&#x27;t last very long, come off easily, and the color is pretty much negligible. I didn&#x27;t particularly find that my lips had any lasting good effect from these after a couple of days of wearing them. I prefer Desert Essence&#x27;s lip balms which last about 3-4x as long and last through eating and drinking.</li>
            <li> It is natural, no/minimum chemicals. Smell is good; keeps lips smooth and moisturized. A little costlier than others though. My wife likes it...</li>
            <li> I love all of these lip balms! They make my lips feel soft and smooth. My favorite is the mango butter!</li>
            <li> very good for me and my girl~~</li>
            <li> Pros: Helps heal your lips and prevents cracking.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Makes a man&#x27;s lips look way too feminine. Sometimes I purposefully disregard the lip balm and just lick my lips until it starts cracking so I return to looking like a normal man again.</li>
            <li> very good. suggested. and it is really a good deal.</li>
            <li> I always lose my lip balm tubes. I think I lost them all before getting to the end. Why this happens is beyond me. I love these ones. Nice neutral colors, well moisturizing. Glad that it&#x27;s 4 in a pack and will last longer till I lose then again.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations exactly and really helps with the chapped lip situation. It&#x27;s a great stocking stuffer idea and it gives people a chance to try all the scents.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to beeswax lip balm at Savannah Bee Company while on vacation.  I loved the products so much, but they are not sold in Michigan and the shipping cost was just too high.  I remembered seeing the Burts Bees brand at Walgreens and Ulta, so I decided to give it a try.  Wow!  I love this pack of lip balms.  they do their job moisturizing and softening my lips.  But most of all....the scent.  OMG the scents are amazing.  I love the pink grapefruit the most.  I am so glad I got these from Amazon. the price was right for all 4 balms (they were more expensive in stores).  I cannot wait to try other BB products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as waxy and melts if you put it in your pant pocket.  It&#x27;s Ok though.  The sent / taste isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> Taste good, the effect is very good</li>
            <li> bees are always good.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms smell great, have yummy flavors and make your lips kissably soft. I highly recommend these lip balms!</li>
            <li> He travels allot for work and he said he especially likes the grapefruit. I like the pomegranate .. Not to greasy/ with the right amount of moisturizer</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes Burt&#x27;s Bees and this was a nice set for the price.  Happy with the purchase-good product.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it smells good, But I got two Pomegranate Oil, one Acai Berry and one Mango Butter, didn&#x27;t get the pink fruit one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/1&lt;br /&gt;I found out that I&#x27;m allergic to this. My lips are really painful now</li>
            <li> This four pack is a great value, especially when purchased as a subscribe and save item.</li>
            <li> These are a good bit more expensive in person.  I am glad I thought to look on amazon for them.  I used to not consider amazon.com for personal items or even FOOD, but they are repeatedly high-quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, as usual from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  It should be noted, however, that these are not flavored (which I knew before I ordered them).  They smell great, but if you are looking for lip balm with fruit flavors, that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re going to get.  But the lip balm is terrific!</li>
            <li> Burts bees was always a good product line. the only reason im giving this four stars instead of five is because i was looking for that minty, tingly feeling you normally get when useing burts bees on your lips. i did not get that. :-/</li>
            <li> I am speechless at this product. Purchased again and again. My wife and friends also enjoy a lot. One of the best gifts sharing with friends in a dry winter.</li>
            <li> The orange and red top can be found almost anywhere. But I had never tried the pink or white top. Both were amazing. Little pricey for 4 tubes, but couldn&#x27;t find this variety anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Love! Works great, flavors are awesome.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use them daily. I started out using Burt&#x27;s moisturizing mask and have been delighted to explore other products. The lip balm is fantastic! I&#x27;m super cereal. Really, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! I love that the ingredients are natural, and that the second ingredient listed is coconut oil. I sometimes use coconut oil as a moisturizer and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of each unique lip balm is very mild and pleasing. I think my favorite is the pomegranate, but I really do enjoy them all. They are all bangin&#x27; fo &#x27;sho. The balm goes on super smoothly, unlike any other lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used, and delivers long-lasting moisture. Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sick of paying close to $4.00 for one of these babies at your local pharm, just do yourself the favor and get the 4 pack. My favorite is the pomegranate and the acai. The mango is a charm for summer as well. There is nothing better than that first slick of a new chap stick.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the kinds that come in order :( in fact the one in the order isn&#x27;t a good kind at all it&#x27;s island fruit and it has a white tiny</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin, but this lip balm is the best.  Usually I break out on my lips (very uncomfortable and unattractive!) If i use any lip balm other than this brand, love it.  Has a nice scent and keeps lips moist!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is obsessed with this stuff, so when the price dropped, I had to pick it up. The different variations in flavor all smell good. Great quality product that can be a bit expensive when purchasing elsewhere - will be watching it here for future re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Got these on sale, and buying a multi-pack on sale is the best option for giving them as useful, appreciated gifts.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> We only buy Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  The original was my favorite until I tried the Replenishing with acai berry.  It still has the same consistency as the original, and while I miss the minty tingle, it moisturizes my lips just the same.  I cant recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees products enough.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but I only liked 3 of the flavors.</li>
            <li> This is one of those &amp;#34;if I were on a desert island and could only bring one thing, what would it be&amp;#34; things. :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like most of the smells.... personal preference I suppose.  I&#x27;ll stick with the regular scent of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> The balms are awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;It´s just took a little while to get here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees! Of course it is great!</li>
            <li> Got these for my son as he was complaining of chapped lips.  Seemed to clear up his issues significantly and it&#x27;s so easy a child can use it.  I also kept one for myself.  Not super greasy like some lip balms.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and I like to mix up the flavors! I look forward to feeling the peppermint on my lips. A nice cooling effect! Great for kissing too!</li>
            <li> love love love these lip balm. They are natural and smell so good it makes you want to eat them. will buy again!</li>
            <li> I gave these to my wife as a stocking stuffer.  Protects her lips and makes them soft and oh so delicious.</li>
            <li> These are the best. They come in delicious scents, and they work really well to keep your lips super smooth and soft. The only thing I wish is that the fruit ones would leave you with the same tingly/minty feeling that the original kind does!</li>
            <li> The berry is great. The others are a little off putting for lip balm.  The lemonade, for instance, is a weird sour taste.</li>
            <li> i use nothing but burts bee. smooth lips fo the lady</li>
            <li> These are some of the best lip balms I have used.  They last for hours and keep my dry lips hydrated and they all smell amazing.  Also a plus they they are made with natural ingredients.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy these!</li>
            <li> Chapped lips are the worst. From people living in Minnesota, to meth addicts, everyone will agree with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bees is the only chapstick i&#x27;ve tried that has actually worked over time without causing any sort of addiction to the drugs put into the chapstick. it&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and this flavor pack is just great. it adds flavor to the life of a chapped lipped person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only recommend it, and say anything else is sub-par</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are amazing, they are good and not tested on animals, I have several balms, and like all of them.</li>
            <li> Burts bees is great stuff. I like the acai berry the most, followed by pomegranate, then grapefruit, then the regular. They all work great on chapped lips but the more fruitier ones smell and taste better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought these as stocking stuffers during the holidays. Everyone loves them, and this pack is a great value! I also love that it has a variety of flavors.&lt;br /&gt;bcauthor.com</li>
            <li> During the winter, I use this product on and off all day. I don&#x27;t quite get which does what, but they all smell great. I particularly like the mango butter.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Moisturizers, last long and smells good. Thanks for providing. I will buy from you again. Your price are great!</li>
            <li> Is good. Make more types - maybe 12 , a dozen one for each month of flavor and make it a more economical packet.</li>
            <li> Really great variety pack for an excellent price! I had never tried each one individually and there is not a single one that I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Love these!</li>
            <li> If you have a family reunion coming up or something similar, you may stock a few boxed of it..No one would say no for a free lip balm..</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and this was a great variety pack to share with my wife when we needed more.  It is hard to find all the different flavors sometimes, and they do not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Great deal for 4 lip balms. I love the variety of flavours. Nice to have so many options in a natural brand.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t use the popular brands (even the ones in the cute spherical containers).  Burt&#x27;s Bees is the most moisturizing I have found and the gentlest.  No chapped lips, even in this extremely cold winter.  I would just say if you are sensitive, too, don&#x27;t buy the peppermint variety, which is not in this set anyway.</li>
            <li> I purchase this in the four packs since we go through so much of it all year long. I love all of them but I will warn that the red cap (replenishing) can stain clothing. If you are using this with little ones, I would suggest not giving them this tube to use.</li>
            <li> Some are colored, some are not, all are delicious smelling, kissable, and moisturizing! Great buy, would definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> I have to use lip balm in the spring or my lips will split. I have tried others and they are greasy and cause your lips to become &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; to balm. This is not greasy. I can forget I have it on after a few minutes. My lips don&#x27;t dry out when it wears off. Perfect for occasional use for seasonal dryness.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I gave it to some of my friends and they all like it.</li>
            <li> I always love Burts Bees.</li>
            <li> These are very nice lip balms. The flavors are nice. The tubes last a long time without drying out or losing their flavor.</li>
            <li> I received the lip balm, all melted. how is it?</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. This is the only lip balm I will use.</li>
            <li> I love love love chap-stick and like trying new ones these have nice textures  and flavors. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very very nice, the smells are great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Burt Bee&#x27;s lip balms and immediately purchased this set once I found it. My favorite scent is the grapefruit but since I already have one of those, I gave it to my boyfriend. He loves Burt Bee&#x27;s as much as I do. These leave your lips feeling baby soft and super moisturized! Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Work great! love the flavors! Good price. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is the bees knees!</li>
            <li> None of these are the original Burt&#x27;s bees flavor. They don&#x27;t moisturize my lips like the original does, and the only benefits are temporary relief of dry lips, and they smell nice.</li>
            <li> gave these to my grandkids and they love &#x27;em.</li>
