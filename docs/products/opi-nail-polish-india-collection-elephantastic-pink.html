            <li> Barbie color ! Yes it is ! A wonderful pink with a result brillant, not shimmer but it&#x27;s like mirror. A plastic doll.  For girlies !!!</li>
            <li> Love this color. Such a beautiful spring / summer addition to my collection!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.. Great quality polish!!!</li>
            <li> I love the color. Very pretty carnation pink. However, it takes FOUR coats to achieve full opacity. Still streaky ever after 3 coats. 3 is the max I have patience for so this is somewhat unacceptable. Going to gift this item to a less finicky friend instead of keeping it.</li>
            <li> I love this color. I&#x27;m looking to buy it again after I used up the first one. It&#x27;s an awesome summer color for my toes, bright happy pink. I am quite fair-skinned so 2 coats are enough. I start with a base coat (currently Anchor by Zoya is my fav) and top it with a fast drying clear top coat and it lasts for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Received the OPI Nail Polish - Elephantastic Pink - it is a gift for my sister - she is a breast cancer survivor and collects elephants - how could I pass it up?

            <li> The coral-pink color is lovely, but the formula is thin.  I applied three coats and it&#x27;s still a little streaky.  Not what I&#x27;m used to with OPI.</li>

            <li> Bright summery pink! This has been a summer favorite polish for several years!! OPI lasts for a week or longer without chipping.</li>
            <li> Love the bright colors OPI came out with!</li>

            <li> Perfect color , it was exactly the color that I was looking for, . It matches my sorority color in pink ,</li>
            <li> Love this color !! Two coats on your nails and it&#x27;s exactly the color it appears to be in the bottle. Very quick shipping and overall great experience!</li>
            <li> I really like this pink. I&#x27;d recommend checking out some online swatches (search the name of the polish and the word &amp;#34;swatch&amp;#34; on Google Images or Bing Images, or something images) before purchasing any nail polish, just so you could see what it actually looks like. Many bloggers specify how many layers they&#x27;ve had to apply, etc. You could also see what it looks like on different skin tones and figure out what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I did all that, purchased this baby, and am loving it. It&#x27;s very opaque and smooth, and very cute looking.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great color and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Actually I am really into pink color series and thinking of collecting more color like this.&lt;br /&gt;This one is brighter and lighter than the &amp;#34; I eat all lobster&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li> I love this pink. Great summer color.  I will use it after Labor Day.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE OPI color!!!</li>

            <li> Depending on your monitor, the color may vary. It was not as bright as what I was expecting. It&#x27;s more of a true medium pink and doesn&#x27;t have this bright, coral-pinkish tone I was hoping for. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it had I saw it in person first.</li>
            <li> This is just a fun pretty color. This is a perfect color for Pedi&#x27;s in the summer. Love it, color goes on well, stays well. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s a perfect pink coral that is nice and light. Great for hands and feet! With a good top coat, it will last for days!</li>
            <li> Chipped off within hours after applying :(</li>
