            <li>I don&#x27;t know if gobbing it on makes a faster or more noticable result, but the cream also serves as an excellent hydration cream.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Nice cream for damaged spots.  </li>
            <li>Kind of.  </li>
            <li>But if you can&#x27;t get to a dermatologist, it&#x27;s as effective as any OTC cream and priced at a lower price point than all of its competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>IT IS BETTER THAT</li>
            <li>too many chemicals</li>
            <li>Years ago I used the extra strength of this product and it was very good.  </li>
            <li>Too soon to notice any lightening of spots, but I am happy with it so far, so 4 stars for now.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh cream.</li>
            <li>So far, so good, my face is slowing becoming more uniform.</li>
            <li>I use it in the day time too and its fine.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Was shipped really quick!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Esoterica is a light cream with the maximum allowable OTC hydroqinone concentration allowable.</li>
            <li>Works awesome fades super fast and shipping was here long before expecting.</li>
            <li>WORKS QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also easily found at nearly all drug stores and grocery stores.</li>
            <li>It works on dark scars better than light scars.</li>
            <li>but I need more time to see actual results but it seems promising.</li>
            <li>So far, this is lightening my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>This cream really works.</li>
            <li>You really smell like your grandma after putting it on.  </li>
            <li>4% cream is only available through a dermatologist and 2% is the maximum allowable for over the counter</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>And when I stop using it, the thing comes right back.</li>
            <li>so I figured it was time for a new jar.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (to both breakouts and to allergic reactions) and this stuff can be gobbed on without any consequences.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, my Grandma has used it since she was very young as well.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works for others, but so far nada for me.</li>
            <li>I simply would never want to live without my Esoterica!</li>
            <li>and whenever I am diligent and use this every night, it fades to barely noticeable.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Bad experience with this cream.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for others, but so far nada for me.</li>
            <li> Good product and it performs as advertised.  Fast shipping.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great products.  Fades dark skin to match rest of your bodies natural skin color.  Product does not cause irritation.  Used on and around buttocks with great results.</li>
            <li> make your skin feel so good</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to give a proper evaluation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 3 months, and I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this fade cream since 2006 and I am completely satisfied with it. I use this for black spots from bug bites and even stubborn black spots. This needs long patience. Black marks starts to fade after 4 months but you need to continue applying it until black marks totally clears up. This cream really works. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT NIGHT CREAN--IT IS BETTER THAT THE LAST. WORKS QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I see a little difference but I need more time to see actual results but it seems promising. I&#x27;ll keep everyone updated</li>
            <li> Great product.  This is my third bottle and it has faded my freckles and dark spots and my skin is so clear.  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores or anything.  Price is great also!  Will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> Good buy and the product seems to be working.</li>
            <li> freckle spots and spots over a period of time seems to fade. Nice fresh cream. It cleans the skin periodically if used. Nice cream for damaged spots.  Excellent but don&#x27;t use daily periodically. use daily if you want to lighten.  good cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice.</li>
            <li> I have not found it working after a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> Beyond pissed. My package was opened and it has been expired since 2013 . I have used this in the past and this a true disappointment</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!! Oh my GOD, my skin never looked so good. The only issue I have with this creme is that it smells like CHEMICALs. Except for that, it does what its supposed to. I use it in the day time too and its fine.</li>
            <li> So far, this is lightening my skin pretty quickly. I had been using the other brand (forget the name) but it turned brown so I figured it was time for a new jar. This is scented, not badly, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that and was a little skeptical of what it might do (break out? rash?), but surprisingly, nothing happened. So far, so good, my face is slowing becoming more uniform.</li>
            <li> It does work.  Kind of.  But man, is it smelly.  You really smell like your grandma after putting it on.  But the stuff does work.  I have a longstanding age spot across my forehead and whenever I am diligent and use this every night, it fades to barely noticeable.  And when I stop using it, the thing comes right back.</li>
            <li> When looking for a fade cream, hydroquinone is the active ingredient to look for. 4% cream is only available through a dermatologist and 2% is the maximum allowable for over the counter creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esoterica is a light cream with the maximum allowable OTC hydroqinone concentration allowable. I have very sensitive skin (to both breakouts and to allergic reactions) and this stuff can be gobbed on without any consequences. I don&#x27;t know if gobbing it on makes a faster or more noticable result, but the cream also serves as an excellent hydration cream. I put it on my arms, legs, decolletage, and face. It works on dark scars better than light scars. It has no effect on raised scars. But if you can&#x27;t get to a dermatologist, it&#x27;s as effective as any OTC cream and priced at a lower price point than all of its competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also easily found at nearly all drug stores and grocery stores.</li>
            <li> Good product for skin problems.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is slow. Years ago I used the extra strength of this product and it was very good.  With time this product seemed to be watered down.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream to lighten a brown spot on my nose.  The spot is still there with little change.</li>
            <li> too many chemicals it has a poison warning why should I put it on my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;using lemons</li>
            <li> I was so worried when the store I usually buy this from had stopped carrying it. It&#x27;s so hard to locate, but I&#x27;m so thankful I can buy it online! Please don&#x27;t ever stop carrying it!! I&#x27;ve used this product for years, my Grandma has used it since she was very young as well. I know when ever I&#x27;ve used this, my skin is always flawless. It clears up breakouts an even prevents them, and gets rid of old acne blemishes and pregnancy dark spots. I simply would never want to live without my Esoterica!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it contains an ingredient - hydroquinone - recommended by my dermatologist.  Age spots have really decreased in the three weeks I have been using Esoterica.  I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Works awesome fades super fast and shipping was here long before expecting.</li>
            <li> Works great on my Moms age spots!!!  She won&#x27;t go without it and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  Was shipped really quick!</li>
            <li> One reviewer said it smells like a grandmother.  I wish my grandmother smelled so good.  If this scent were in a body lotion, I would buy gallons of it.  Too soon to notice any lightening of spots, but I am happy with it so far, so 4 stars for now.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.  My complexion has improved.  Would buy again!</li>
