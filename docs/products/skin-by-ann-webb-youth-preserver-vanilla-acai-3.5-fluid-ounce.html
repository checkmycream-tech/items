            <li>It also keep my skin perfectly balanced -- doesn&#x27;t make it oily or clogged, just soft.</li>

            <li>but I&#x27;m definitely glad that I did.</li>

            <li>The texture is runny, like a lotion - not dense or greasy like most night creams.</li>

            <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love her products but not a fan of this one.</li>
            <li>I found for me it sits on top of my skin and doesn&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li>I am a vegan and have been tried most of vegan products.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and my face has never looked better.</li>

            <li>Overall great moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend any of the products available.!!!</li>
            <li>I normally can&#x27;t use products that are scented, but this is very mild, has a very nice vanilla smell doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>her formulas are great for my sensitive skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I would purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Not oily and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 with relatively good skin, so I cannot say much about that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not its fine.</li>
            <li>High quality, mild pleasant aroma, no greasy after feel.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, smells nice, no breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I love it, thanks!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>it does not get absorbed easily.</li>
            <li>I originally found it at Whole Foods when I was looking for a healthy skin moisturizer for my face.  </li>
            <li>Fragrances are often a migraine trigger for me, except for sweet food aromas like vanilla and almond.</li>
            <li>The light texture makes it easy to gently massage into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid thirties with a house full of kids, and rarely am able to purchase anything that costs more than $5.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly and easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Its so runny that you have to be quick when dispensing it.</li>
            <li>This is really worth it.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased at a neighborhood &amp;#34;health foods&amp;#34; market but their pricing is very high.  </li>
            <li>My skin just absorbs the lotion right away.</li>
            <li>It has a silky texture and glides right on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial lotion and causes no irritation or greasiness.</li>
            <li>So far I like that one better for mature skin.</li>
            <li>All I know is people always think I&#x27;m about 10 years younger than I really am, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need that much either.</li>
            <li>This lotion really does help moisturize and soften my skin.</li>
            <li>Makeup applies really well over it.</li>
            <li>It is very runny.</li>
            <li>but I gave it three stars because it is VERY runny.</li>
            <li>is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Is there really a way to tell if it works?</li>
            <li>Like others have said, it isn&#x27;t a thick cream, but it doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>I am in my 20s, so I&#x27;m not yet old enough to speak about how this affects the look of aged skin, but I feel like I&#x27;m taking good preventative care of my skin when I use this product.</li>
            <li>a part of my nightly ritual.. cant live without it!</li>
            <li>This creme is no exception and is my main face creme.  </li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is surprisingly strong but fades fairly quickly and is a naturalistic vanilla, not overly sweet or sickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company rethink the container its in.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this product and the fact that it&#x27;s not too heavy of an overnight moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39 with good skin, a little on the dry side.</li>
            <li>but I am always looking for a new anti aging product.  </li>
            <li>They are all natural, well priced, and your skin will show changes in 2-3 days!</li>
            <li>and I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I washed with the Mellow melon cleanser and then used the Vanilla Acai, and my face was nearly back to normal.</li>
            <li>I will update my review with what happens - whether they replace it with a new, unexpired tube, or if they give me my money back.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and since my skin is so dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super hydrating without being heavy.</li>
            <li>Buy this whether you have sensitive, dry, oily, or normal skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old guy who didn&#x27;t take care of my skin when I was younger and now I&#x27;m paying for it.</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s lightweight in texture, this moisturizer keeps my normally dry skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry, sensitive, and acne prone.</li>

            <li> though it&#x27;s lightweight in texture, this moisturizer keeps my normally dry skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, sensitive, and acne prone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how many different types of facial moisturizers I have tried, due to my complicated, combination, acne prone with ezcema suffering skin.</li>
            <li> By comparing ingredients to other much more expensive products I find the value of Skin By Ann Webb to match and/or exceed those other brands of skin care.</li>
            <li> I would like it to be a little thicker, however that may be a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> So, be careful and check the product when it arrives.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no adverse reaction to this</li>
            <li> Usually, it retails at about $25 from Amazon and third party sellers.</li>
            <li> , the product is a little runny, but you learn to just be careful how you dispense it.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery trying out this product</li>
            <li> There has been little to no breakouts since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I have another lotion that makes my skin burn a little.</li>
            <li> I found this brand a few years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s anti-aging properties are mostly wasted on me.</li>
            <li> I use it year round</li>
            <li> For travel, I would put some in a small, unbreakable, tightly-sealed jar or bottle.</li>
            <li> All of those characteristics makes skincare shopping really, REALLY hard.</li>
            <li> The container makes it impossible to get the same amount every time.</li>
            <li> any moisturizer that is not extremely good for my face always causes my face to break out.</li>
            <li> i have always had troubled skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very complicated skin as it is</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! Thank you for the great product!!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have sensitive, acne-prone skin. I was a little leery trying out this product but I&#x27;m definitely glad that I did. It&#x27;s wonderful! It seems to be the perfect balance of lightweight yet effective for me. You really don&#x27;t need that much either. I&#x27;ve been on the same tube for over two months.</li>
            <li> a part of my nightly ritual.. cant live without it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for two months now and my skin looks amazing!  I don&#x27;t have very complicated skin as it is but I am always looking for a new anti aging product.  I love it and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I originally found it at Whole Foods when I was looking for a healthy skin moisturizer for my face.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years and it works great.  It does not cause my face to break out and any moisturizer that is not extremely good for my face always causes my face to break out.</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is surprisingly strong but fades fairly quickly and is a naturalistic vanilla, not overly sweet or sickly. More importantly, this is a great moisturizer, and it&#x27;s a great value, especially from Amazon. I&#x27;m on my second tube now! The texture is runny, like a lotion - not dense or greasy like most night creams. The light texture makes it easy to gently massage into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s lightweight in texture, this moisturizer keeps my normally dry skin soft and supple. It does not affect my clog-prone pores. I get compliments on my skin often since I started using Vanilla Acai Youth Preserver. I am in my 20s, so I&#x27;m not yet old enough to speak about how this affects the look of aged skin, but I feel like I&#x27;m taking good preventative care of my skin when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years - it&#x27;s the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out. It also keep my skin perfectly balanced -- doesn&#x27;t make it oily or clogged, just soft. I love it, thanks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;m in my mid thirties with a house full of kids, and rarely am able to purchase anything that costs more than $5.  This is really worth it.  It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly and easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I recently had an allergic reaction that left my face itchy and puffy with bumps.  I washed with the Mellow melon cleanser and then used the Vanilla Acai, and my face was nearly back to normal. I recommend it regularly!</li>
            <li> Ann webb austin products rock i have always had troubled skin her formulas are great for my sensitive skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how many different types of facial moisturizers I have tried, due to my complicated, combination, acne prone with ezcema suffering skin. I couldn&#x27;t decide between this and another brand~ultimately, I chose this. Boy, am I glad. I use this Vanilla Acai with the Wakame Coq10 for my nightime ritual, and it has made all the difference! They are all natural, well priced, and your skin will show changes in 2-3 days! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go to another brand again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old guy who didn&#x27;t take care of my skin when I was younger and now I&#x27;m paying for it. This lotion really does help moisturize and soften my skin. I normally can&#x27;t use products that are scented, but this is very mild, has a very nice vanilla smell doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Like others have said, it isn&#x27;t a thick cream, but it doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer ever! It makes my skin smooth and hydrated.  Plus it smells amazing. Makeup applies really well over it.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, sensitive, and acne prone. All of those characteristics makes skincare shopping really, REALLY hard. I found this brand a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The good: The moisturizer is so good, I can&#x27;t find anything else. It&#x27;s super hydrating without being heavy. Nothing in it causes my skin to flare up. There has been little to no breakouts since I started using this. It also lasts a while. One bottle kept my skin glowing for three months.&lt;br /&gt;The neutral: The product&#x27;s anti-aging properties are mostly wasted on me. I&#x27;m 22 with relatively good skin, so I cannot say much about that.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: I agree with another reviewer. It is very runny. I wish this was a cream instead of a lotion. The container makes it impossible to get the same amount every time. I recommend a pump dispenser for this.&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict: Buy this whether you have sensitive, dry, oily, or normal skin. The price ($16 from Amazon at the time of this review) is the best price I have seen since I found it. Usually, it retails at about $25 from Amazon and third party sellers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50-something, and have combination skin. This product works great at moisturizing without making me break out. Fragrances are often a migraine trigger for me, except for sweet food aromas like vanilla and almond. This smells like vanilla and I love it! I use it on my face and neck, morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the product is a little runny, but you learn to just be careful how you dispense it. For travel, I would put some in a small, unbreakable, tightly-sealed jar or bottle.</li>
            <li> I just received a tube that expired 7/13. So, be careful and check the product when it arrives. I have submitted a request to return it, but am waiting to hear back from amazon. I will update my review with what happens - whether they replace it with a new, unexpired tube, or if they give me my money back.</li>
            <li> This product leaks all over the place. it does not get absorbed easily. The smell is gross as well. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Gentle, smells nice, no breakouts.  This is my favorite facial lotion and causes no irritation or greasiness.</li>
            <li> I do like this product but I gave it three stars because it is VERY runny. Its so runny that you have to be quick when dispensing it. I lost allot on my counter each night until I bought a 1.00 container to transfer it into. Not its fine. I highly recommend this company rethink the container its in.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  Really good day and night moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Cost is reasonable. I would purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Not oily and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this or years. Is there really a way to tell if it works? All I know is people always think I&#x27;m about 10 years younger than I really am, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  After using it for just a few weeks, I really began to see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Best price on the web for this product.  High quality, mild pleasant aroma, no greasy after feel.  I use as a night cream along with a retinol serum, and wake with dewy glowing skin.  I have oily skin, and this has never caused me any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Love her products but not a fan of this one. I&#x27;m 39 with good skin, a little on the dry side. I was looking for a daily night time moisturizer. I found for me it sits on top of my skin and doesn&#x27;t blend well. I&#x27;m trying the coffee cherry moisturizer as recommended by my esthetician. So far I like that one better for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I am a vegan and have been tried most of vegan products. I just bought this lotion after I read all reviews and I am so happy that I made a good choice! This lotion is truly moisturizing and smells very nice. My skin just absorbs the lotion right away. Good food for your skin!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have another lotion that makes my skin burn a little. Skin By Ann gentle, smells great, and a great moisturizer... and it&#x27;s vegan.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I use it year round and my face has never looked better. Not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. Although it is not the only night cream I use, I have purchased it several times and will likely continue to do so. It has a silky texture and glides right on your skin. I would like it to be a little thicker, however that may be a personal preference. If I want extra moisture I often put shea butter on top of this. Overall great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased at a neighborhood &amp;#34;health foods&amp;#34; market but their pricing is very high.  I love the product and was very happy to find it online for a better price and I received the product in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product and the fact that it&#x27;s not too heavy of an overnight moisturizer.  I had absolutely no adverse reaction to this and I have extremely sensitive skin.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Ann Webb makes great products.  This creme is no exception and is my main face creme.  Absorbs fast and since my skin is so dry I often have to apply 2-3 times.  However, it smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t promote breakouts as many greasy cremes do.</li>
            <li> The products that Skin by Ann Webb produces are wonderful, great for your skin, and resonably priced. By comparing ingredients to other much more expensive products I find the value of Skin By Ann Webb to match and/or exceed those other brands of skin care. I would HIGHLY recommend any of the products available.!!!</li>
