            <li> first jar lasted a little over a year with weekly use</li>
            <li> When I received it in the package it was slightly damp that the product had spilled very onto the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more ripped up cotton balls, crusty wash cloths,  or halfway removed real polish.</li>
            <li> By the picture shown, I thought I was getting the free smaller bottle as well, but was disappointed when I opened the box only to find the 8 oz size.</li>
            <li> and I still have a little bit of liquid left in it.</li>
            <li> It became harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> well, I expected to receive it within 10 days.</li>
            <li> The picture is extremely misleading.</li>
            <li> Like the price, how well it works and the scent is not over-powering like other removers.</li>
            <li> It also includes a small metal object with a smaller pad on one end to do your toes.</li>
            <li> I will never use another nail paint remover other than this.</li>
            <li> Heck you don&#x27;t even have to use the wand half the time.</li>
            <li> I have seen the combo package with the little travel size jar in the stores on occasion, so had no reason to think that I wouldn&#x27;t receive both.  </li>
            <li> Like the little wand that comes inside to get little misses when polishing my nails.</li>
            <li> However, it was beginning to feel a little saturated</li>
            <li> Tough way to have to get something so simple as polish remover.  </li>
            <li> Now is it not available anywhere in South Florida that I could locate.</li>
            <li> the reason I ordered it from Amazon is that it supposedly includes the the small travel size container of polish remover.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be hard to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in the drug stores or grocery stores</li>
            <li> So I was forced to order it on line.</li>
            <li> This is definitely false advertising and misleading.  </li>
            <li> It works, smells bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Has always been my favorite nail polish remover and always will be.</li>
            <li> This nail polish remover works very well but I found it very weird that the picture has a free 2ounce polish remover on top of the big container and it does not even come with that. Looks like false advertisement lol.</li>
            <li> I received the 8 oz. jar as the written description indicated.  I was hoping to get the smaller travel size as pictured - thought maybe it was an oversight in the description, but it was not.  This product does clean nails of polish quickly and does have a &amp;#34;dabber&amp;#34; for removing polish from toes.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I would order it again, except for one thing: the reason I ordered it from Amazon is that it supposedly includes the the small travel size container of polish remover. The picture is extremely misleading. You might as well get something at Walgreen&#x27;s. I contacted the company and they apologized and said they&#x27;d switch out the picture of the product, but they did not offer to send me the travel size.</li>
            <li> so quick and simple! one swipe of the nail and it removes polish even glittery polish you can even do your toes in here if your a bit curious like me :p</li>
            <li> I remembered using this nail polish remover when I was younger, but never could find it in the stores. I fave part is that is has a metal wand with a brush like applicator so you can use it for your toes.. AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> This is the ideal product.  I love the Glitter Girls remover for Cutex and I thought it would be hard to find a replacement.  Well, Girls, I definitely have.  It&#x27;s a winner:)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this exact brand, because I have had great luck with a previous purchase--about 5 years old!!!  I was also happy to see in the picture that I got a mini one too--my daughter is 4 and she is the reason my last one didn&#x27;t last another year.  I was planning to give her the mini and then I would be able to have my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the mini one, as depicted in the picture.  It just came with the 8oz by itself.  I realize that it only says 8oz in the title, but the picture depicts the mini one too.  That is misleading, and the reason I gave it only 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to see that I still get a little dabber in there for my toes.  That has been sooo helpful!</li>
            <li> By the picture shown, I thought I was getting the free smaller bottle as well, but was disappointed when I opened the box only to find the 8 oz size. Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> This item works wonderfully, awesome product! This is easy to use, better than any other nail polish remover. I love it!</li>
            <li> If you think you are buying what you see here you are not.  I received only the larger jar.  I have seen the combo package with the little travel size jar in the stores on occasion, so had no reason to think that I wouldn&#x27;t receive both.  That is the reason I ordered it since I have never seen the travel size sold alone.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> The product picture does not match the item that came in. It is pictured as one large remover along with a mini remover. I only received the large one.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different polish removers - Pretty Nails works the&lt;br /&gt;best of any I have tried!!! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand and kind of nail polish remover.  It is so simple ( a sponge and liquid).  This brand is particularly trustworthy and it came right on time!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many polish removers over the years, and this one is by far the very best!  I love the fact that you don&#x27;t need cotton balls or pads to remove the polish.  It also comes with a handy little stick with a pad on the end to do your toes.  It also smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your cuticles like other brands I&#x27;ve tried do.  Hard to find in the drug stores or grocery stores, so I have to order it here.</li>
            <li> Pretty Nails is, without a doubt, the best nail polish remover on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this remover for at least 20 years.  I previously was able to pick it up at any time in the local drug store. It became harder and harder to find. Now is it not available anywhere in South Florida that I could locate. So I was forced to order it on line. I normally would not object to that, but it cost more for shipping and handling than it did for the product. I also received an email asking how my service from Amazon was, before I received my order....well, I expected to receive it within 10 days. It took 25 days.  Tough way to have to get something so simple as polish remover.  Please folks try this product so we can get it back in our local stores and available.  Product works great and has an adaptor for taking polish off your toes. It is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Omg this thing is amazing! No more ripped up cotton balls, crusty wash cloths,  or halfway removed real polish. With zero effort, or removes all of the Polish!</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully. I will compare it favorable to the instant nail polish remover from Sephora. My only complaint is that the packaging was not that great. When I received it in the package it was slightly damp that the product had spilled very onto the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This needs to be packed better</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, and it works fabulous. Better than any other nail polish remover I have ever used. Very convenient wand with swab. No need for cotton balls. Strong but feels a little like it moisturizes the skin around the nails. Works swiftly. I will purchase again ... eventually. This large jar will last ages.</li>
            <li> Love this polish remover, especially that it comes with the wand and you don&#x27;t have to use a cotton ball or tissue. Heck you don&#x27;t even have to use the wand half the time. Love it love it</li>
            <li> Removes polish fast and easy</li>
            <li> Like the price, how well it works and the scent is not over-powering like other removers. Like the little wand that comes inside to get little misses when polishing my nails.</li>
            <li> This item is as described.  It removes nail polish quickly, easily, and completely.  I highly recommend this instant polish remover.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the product.  I love the product.  However, I ordered what was pictured, which was the regular size, along with the travel size.  It did not come this way.  I only received the regular size.  This is definitely false advertising and misleading.  do not order from this company.  I know I never will again.  Shame!</li>
            <li> The best nail polish remover</li>
            <li> My wife has told me repeatedly that this is the best polish remover she has ever used and I get it thrpugh Amazon for total convenience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nail polish remover. It works, smells bad. But what nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t? lol I&#x27;d get it again. In fact when I&#x27;m out of it I am getting it again. :)</li>
            <li> This really is an awesome product. Its so gentle on my nails/skin yet so effective. Its also super convenient to use. The jar is filled with nail paint remover liquid and a nice wad of thick sponge that covers the entire jar on the inside. The sponge has three holes on top. Just dip your finger in it and rub your nail against the sponge and within a few seconds your nail comes out nice and clean! It also includes a small metal object with a smaller pad on one end to do your toes. I love this concept and the remover liquid is an excellent quality too.&lt;br /&gt;My first jar lasted a little over a year with weekly use and I still have a little bit of liquid left in it. However, it was beginning to feel a little saturated so I have just ordered another one. I will never use another nail paint remover other than this. Love it!</li>
