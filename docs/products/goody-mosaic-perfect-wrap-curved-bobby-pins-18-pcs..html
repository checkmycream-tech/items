            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for wrap sets but . . .</li>
            <li>The Goody curved bobby pins are a great buy.</li>
            <li>Goody products are normally great.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be a great replacement.</li>
            <li>They are great with locs also.</li>
            <li>I saw these and thought it would be great for wrapping my hair at night.</li>
            <li>They are good for wrapping your hair.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Goody has always made good products for the hair.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The shape is great but the coating on it wears off very easily.</li>
            <li>They hold exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>For wrapping hair these pins are amazing.</li>
            <li>These pins are amazing.</li>
            <li>so glad i could order them here.</li>
            <li>These are seriously fantastic for longer hair!  </li>
            <li>With these, I&#x27;m able to wrap a ponytail holder around my hair, pull it through, and then clip the hanging hair up into a bun shape, using just two or three pins.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>Love the curved shape too.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic idea set by Goody!</li>
            <li>These are ideal for people with long hair, they provide much more support, the curve works better for the curve of the head</li>
            <li>They are super comfortable, too, since the rounded shape makes them snug up nicely against your head.  </li>
            <li>Do like the professional models and curl your hair in those great big gigantic rollers for great hair volume.  </li>
            <li>I read something in a beauty magazine about using longer bobby pins like these, and was happy to discover them here on Amazon when I couldn&#x27;t find them in any local stores.  </li>
            <li>Great for my long curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have waist-length straight hair, and love these pins.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine &amp; straight and slides out of most hair clips, but a couple of these and a one small one I was good for the day.</li>
            <li>(I was surprised and pleased to find them here).  </li>
            <li>Amazon has them and although they are pricey, they are worth it.  </li>
            <li>but they are ok overall.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the enamel can wear off fairly easily on some.  </li>
            <li>the ends are smooth, and the color only peels after a year of use, and even then i won&#x27;t throw them away.</li>
            <li>I really like these pins.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually need more than one or two to hold a bun or twist all day, which is GREAT because my hair is thick enough to just push many of the other pins I&#x27;ve tried out of the bun in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>I think the price on here is extremely high for bobby pins</li>
            <li>These pins go on easily and hold extremely well.</li>
            <li>but my hair slips out of them frequently</li>
            <li>Came early in the mail.</li>
            <li>Came early in the mail.</li>
            <li>Came early in the mail.</li>
            <li>after about 2 weeks of wrapping my mini-twists (I have natural hair)</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for these pins!</li>
            <li>I have very thick, long hair and these work really well in keeping it piled  on top of my head .</li>
            <li>These pins are long lasting (dont stretch out from thick hair, even after incessant use), and great for holding up lots of thick hair.</li>
            <li>My hair reaches to my waist, and I&#x27;ve been struggling with keeping it up in messy buns since it&#x27;s so long right now.  </li>

            <li> Small in size and cheap black paint peels off.</li>
            <li> they are long and curve just enough to allow me to use them either to pin up the sides of my hair or when i want to wrap it around my head.</li>
            <li> Lost for a long time unless you lose them.</li>
            <li> they grip well and the long length keep hairs in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve generally paid six to eight dollars for a pack of eighteen - and the pins tend to break in half at the bend with a bit of wear (thus four stars rather than five).</li>
            <li> I have thick curly long hair, this is the only bobby pin that work for me.</li>
            <li> I tried these bobby pins because I had similar ones in the past.</li>
            <li> You use less pins and don&#x27;t have the indentations other pins leave.  </li>
            <li> It has gotten difficult to find the larger bobby pins in local stores.</li>
            <li> and I kept it in for couple days when I took them out the black paint on them peeled of</li>
            <li> I can use 2 of them and it keeps my hair up in place all day, and I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying them at your local drugstore, walmart etc because i paid approximately $2.00 for a pack of 18,</li>
            <li> a waste of time to buy and a waste of shipping.</li>
            <li> They can be hard to find</li>
            <li> They are hard to find so get them when you can find them.</li>
            <li> so difficult to find in the stores...</li>
            <li> Also they&#x27;re a bit expensive -</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s disappointing</li>
            <li> I was unable to find them in beauty supply stores again but thank God for Amazon!</li>
            <li> and they are the worst.</li>

            <li> I tried these bobby pins because I had similar ones in the past. These are much too big &amp; heavy, and therefore won&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> For wrapping hair these pins are amazing. Can&#x27;t wrap my hair with out them. Lost for a long time unless you lose them.</li>
            <li> The Goody curved bobby pins are a great buy. I have very thick, long hair and these work really well in keeping it piled  on top of my head . they grip well and the long length keep hairs in place.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t do without these- they are long and curve just enough to allow me to use them either to pin up the sides of my hair or when i want to wrap it around my head. the ends are smooth, and the color only peels after a year of use, and even then i won&#x27;t throw them away. so difficult to find in the stores... so glad i could order them here.</li>
            <li> I had some of these years ago and lost them. I was unable to find them in beauty supply stores again but thank God for Amazon! I purchased some knock off&#x27;s that I did find in the beauty supply store made by Annie and they are the worst. Small in size and cheap black paint peels off. I think the price on here is extremely high for bobby pins but quality does cost. So overall I would recommend to anyone who continuously wraps there hair at night and needs some hold and comfort form.</li>
            <li> I thought these would hold my hair well but my hair slips out of them frequently and it&#x27;s disappointing but they are ok overall. Goody products are normally great.</li>
            <li> My sister had pins like this before, but she lost them. I thought these would be a great replacement. They are a bit longer than a regular bobby.</li>
            <li> I really like these pins. They are good for wrapping your hair. You use less pins and don&#x27;t have the indentations other pins leave.  They are great with locs also. The only drawback is the enamel can wear off fairly easily on some.  I would suggest buying them at your local drugstore, walmart etc because i paid approximately $2.00 for a pack of 18, no way I would pay 8 bucks for the same package.</li>
            <li> Great for my long curly hair. Just one will hold a bun all day. Curved shape do makes them comfy too.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It has gotten difficult to find the larger bobby pins in local stores.</li>

I recommend them, but with the following caveats:  They can be hard to find (I was surprised and pleased to find them here).  Also they&#x27;re a bit expensive - I&#x27;ve generally paid six to eight dollars for a pack of eighteen - and the pins tend to break in half at the bend with a bit of wear (thus four stars rather than five).</li>
            <li> I only used it once when I wrapped my hair and I kept it in for couple days when I took them out the black paint on them peeled of</li>
            <li> This product is ok. Works well when wrapping the hair. Goody has always made good products for the hair. Like it</li>
            <li> Product Arrived As Promised.&lt;br /&gt;Quality Product</li>
            <li> These pins are long lasting (dont stretch out from thick hair, even after incessant use), and great for holding up lots of thick hair.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for these pins!</li>
            <li> Good product. Came early in the mail. Good product. Came early in the mail. Good product. Came early in the mail.</li>
            <li> please advertise the size of these or else you&#x27;re wasting people&#x27;s time in buying it.  a waste of time to buy and a waste of shipping.</li>
            <li> A must for wrapping my hair.</li>
            <li> Love these! My hair is fine &amp; straight and slides out of most hair clips, but a couple of these and a one small one I was good for the day. Love the curved shape too.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly long hair, this is the only bobby pin that work for me. I can put my hair in a bun and this is bobby pin wil hold it all day till i take it off. Love it!</li>
            <li> These are ideal for people with long hair, they provide much more support, the curve works better for the curve of the head</li>
            <li> I saw these and thought it would be great for wrapping my hair at night. The shape is great but the coating on it wears off very easily.</li>
            <li> Treasure these.  WM use to sell them and they don&#x27;t anymore.  Amazon has them and although they are pricey, they are worth it.  It only takes about 1 of these to hold a curler in your hair.  Do like the professional models and curl your hair in those great big gigantic rollers for great hair volume.  These pins go on easily and hold extremely well.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic idea set by Goody! The size is perfect for wrap sets but . . . after about 2 weeks of wrapping my mini-twists (I have natural hair) the enamel began to flake from the clips and ended up in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently others have not had this problem but I can not use these again.</li>
            <li> These pins are amazing. I can use 2 of them and it keeps my hair up in place all day, and I have long thick hair. They are hard to find so get them when you can find them.</li>
