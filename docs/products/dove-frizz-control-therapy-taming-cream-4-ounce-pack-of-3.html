            <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com!!</li>
            <li>Best product out there for frizzy hair, PERIOD.</li>
            <li>Dove was the perfect complement to Wen.   </li>
            <li>very good product.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and tames my hair.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon still has it, and for an excellent price.</li>
            <li>Great product, good smelling, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the perfect curl product for my fine permed and color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>After im done with the shower, put this product on my hair and im good to go.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>again Dove pulls another good product from their line to \\&quot;replace\\</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff &amp; will buy again!</li>
            <li>But the Dove product goes on smoothly, gets rid of tangles and leaves my hair in great condition with no frizziness.</li>
            <li>Wen made a huge improvement in the breakage, but didn&#x27;t control the frizzy fly aways.   </li>
            <li>The newer cream-serum is NOT specifically designed for curly hair either, but it seemed as close as one might come to the wonderful old stuff in terms of taming frizziness and flyaways.  </li>
            <li>But I still love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It does the same superb job as the previous item and smells just as delicious.</li>
            <li>This has always been my favorite product as it is light and not sticky</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft without weighing it down, works amazingly as a detangler and smells delicious!!!</li>
            <li>I was heartbroken that they stopped selling it in stores, it&#x27;s really one of the best products for keeping your hair frizz-free and smooth, without weighing it down with product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair and the frizz takes on a life of its own in the humidity.</li>
            <li>seriously this is the best leave in product I&#x27;ve used!!!  </li>
            <li>But I do run out of it quickly.</li>
            <li>The Pantene shampoo and conditioner for curls keep my hair in great shape, and this cream was the finishing touch, defining the curls, preventing frizz and flyaways, adding no crunchiness, and lending a soft, natural look.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time my naturally curly hair was a mess&lt;br /&gt;until</li>
            <li>so it is very damaged and super frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly &amp; gets very frizzy, especially in hot, humid weather.  </li>
            <li>Much to my dismay, Dove chose to discontinue it this year.  </li>
            <li>just to much money</li>
            <li>I color my hair since forever and have tried everything to have it soft and silky!!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of years, and it works better than any I have found for my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Most of the products left my hair either oily or flat, with no body</li>
            <li>The hair shaft feels smooth and closed.</li>
            <li>I live by the beach.</li>
            <li>My hair looks excessively styled and as though I used too many products on it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have fine slightly wavy hair - but lots of it.</li>
            <li>once my hair completely dries and i notice some flyaways or frizz</li>
            <li>It looks soft &amp; shiny -</li>
            <li>It really conditions my hair makes it much softer and cuts down on the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Since I can no longer find it in the stores where I shop, I searched high and low online.</li>
            <li>Normally my reviews are pretty matter of fact, but this one shows me getting a little temperamental.  </li>
            <li>as I miss this taming cream, I remember what I paid for it (maybe four fifty each) and will seek out a new replacement product rather than paying the ridiculous current prices for the leftovers still available, or buying the new cream serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; it with an inferior one - in this case, the Frizz Free Shine cream-serum which defines less, adds some crunchiness, and renders a far more artificial finish.  </li>
            <li>Then, I just let it dry naturally</li>
            <li>whether I blow-dry my hair or let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time, and it is the only one I have found that lets my naturally curly/wavy hair stay curly</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for a long time, and it is the only one I have found that lets my naturally curly/wavy hair stay curly</li>
            <li> I used this on semi long hair  daily</li>
            <li> and it is pretty thick and tends to get frizzy.  </li>
            <li> However, I do not see much of a difference when I use it to tame frizz on dry hair.</li>
            <li> and then only brush the ends after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> It worked well when I put a tiny amount through dry hair.</li>
            <li> and then I blow it dry.</li>
            <li> but it took me forever to blow dry</li>
            <li> I wash and dry my hair every day</li>
            <li> I use this product as I dry my hair</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product on the market that I have tried that actually controls the frizz without making my hair greasy or making it go limp.</li>
            <li> I like that this product can be used on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> After I had chemo, my hair came back in a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other stuff.  </li>
            <li> This cream has no alcohol or propellants in it, so there&#x27;s less drying or risk of flammability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a little research, i found this item and ordered 3.</li>
            <li> After shampooing and conditioning, I use the Dove Damage Therapy Conditioner on my damp, towel dried hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been through a few Dove products, gotten to like and know and use them, and then they disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when i went to replace it a few months ago, they had stopped making it.</li>
            <li> - Too bad they discontinued it!</li>

            <li> After im done with the shower, put this product on my hair and im good to go. once my hair completely dries and i notice some flyaways or frizz, im just put the product on it and its taken care of. this product does the job for me, although im not a fan of the baby smelling products but it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use after straightening my hair to help control frizz. Since I can no longer find it in the stores where I shop, I searched high and low online. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time now and can no longer find it locally. Found it on Amazon and will continue to order from there.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  I color treat my hair and have for years so it is very damaged and super frizzy.  After shampooing and conditioning, I use the Dove Damage Therapy Conditioner on my damp, towel dried hair.  My hair is almost to my waist. Then, I just let it dry naturally and then only brush the ends after it&#x27;s dry. No frizz at all!  The hair shaft feels smooth and closed. Thank goodness for this product!!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other stuff.  Some work and some don&#x27;t help at all.  This one does.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and the frizz takes on a life of its own in the humidity. I have tried everything from Aveda and Redkin to Nexxus and Fructis. Most of the products left my hair either oily or flat, with no body what so-ever. I finally tried Dove after reading a product survey in a beauty/fashion magazine. What a difference...I apply a pea-sized amount on my towel-dry hair and then I blow it dry. It tames the frizzies and my hair has a sheen without the slightest bit of oilines.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and tames my hair. this is my second time buying this pack. But I do run out of it quickly. But I still love it.</li>
            <li> Good product but it took me forever to blow dry so I gave it away.  It worked well when I put a tiny amount through dry hair.</li>
            <li> Best product out there for frizzy hair, PERIOD. I was heartbroken that they stopped selling it in stores, it&#x27;s really one of the best products for keeping your hair frizz-free and smooth, without weighing it down with product. So glad Amazon still has it, and for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I color my hair since forever and have tried everything to have it soft and silky!!! Kerastase, redken, revlon, sammy, bedhead EVERYTHING!!! seriously this is the best leave in product I&#x27;ve used!!!  It leaves my hair super soft without weighing it down, works amazingly as a detangler and smells delicious!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years, and it works better than any I have found for my thin, fine hair.  Much to my dismay, Dove chose to discontinue it this year.  I have ordered enough to stock up for a while.</li>
            <li> After I had chemo, my hair came back in a little frizzy. This is the ONLY product on the market that I have tried that actually controls the frizz without making my hair greasy or making it go limp. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time, and it is the only one I have found that lets my naturally curly/wavy hair stay curly/wavy without being being crunchy or looking oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two years and am lost with out it. Stores stopped selling so I had to go on Amazon.com to purchase. Great product, good smelling, and not greasy. I used this on semi long hair  daily and it stops the frizzes. Will continue to use product.</li>
            <li> I live by the beach. Most of the time my naturally curly hair was a mess&lt;br /&gt;until I found this product. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Normally my reviews are pretty matter of fact, but this one shows me getting a little temperamental.

This cream has no alcohol or propellants in it, so there&#x27;s less drying or risk of flammability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet again Dove pulls another good product from their line to \\&quot;replace\\&quot; it with an inferior one - in this case, the Frizz Free Shine cream-serum which defines less, adds some crunchiness, and renders a far more artificial finish.  My hair looks excessively styled and as though I used too many products on it.  The newer cream-serum is NOT specifically designed for curly hair either, but it seemed as close as one might come to the wonderful old stuff in terms of taming frizziness and flyaways.  Dove does make a mousse specifically for curly hair, but it has isobutane as a propellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much as I miss this taming cream, I remember what I paid for it (maybe four fifty each) and will seek out a new replacement product rather than paying the ridiculous current prices for the leftovers still available, or buying the new cream serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Dove?  You need to stabilize your product line and quit screwing with your customers.</li>
            <li> very good product. just to much money</li>
            <li> Last year i bought an after-shower hair conditioner from Dove. However, when i went to replace it a few months ago, they had stopped making it. After a little research, i found this item and ordered 3. I&#x27;m glad i did. It does the same superb job as the previous item and smells just as delicious. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the same thing with a different name. I can&#x27;t use a regular hair conditioner as they all make my hair frizzy for some reason. But the Dove product goes on smoothly, gets rid of tangles and leaves my hair in great condition with no frizziness. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I wash and dry my hair every day and it is pretty thick and tends to get frizzy.  I use this product as I dry my hair, I concentrate it especially on the ends and in the back. It really conditions my hair makes it much softer and cuts down on the frizzies.  I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly &amp; gets very frizzy, especially in hot, humid weather.  I mix this with mousse after towel-drying my hair &amp; it makes my hair frizz-free, but not oily looking and I think mixing it with the mousse, gives it hold.  It looks soft &amp; shiny - whether I blow-dry my hair or let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful I found this product. I&#x27;ve have fine slightly wavy hair - but lots of it. I have been struggling with frizzy hair for 2 years now.   Wen made a huge improvement in the breakage, but didn&#x27;t control the frizzy fly aways.   Dove was the perfect complement to Wen.   Love this stuff &amp; will buy again!</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite product as it is light and not sticky - Too bad they discontinued it!</li>
            <li> I like that this product can be used on wet or dry hair.  However, I do not see much of a difference when I use it to tame frizz on dry hair.</li>
