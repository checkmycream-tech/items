            <li>It is just a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>None of this with the Nivea Sun-Kissed Beautiful Legs!!  </li>
            <li>Best tanner</li>
            <li>Works great and didn&#x27;t turn my legs orange!</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant going on, and stays that way throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for getting a bit of a glow, and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>great look.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>(which takes a good 45 min.).  </li>
            <li>I am not overly impressed, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>The smell of this has been greatly improved and I love the gradual tan it provides.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It also has a really nice smell to it that&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li>Good job Nivea :)</li>
            <li>It helps give my legs a nice tan and allowing me to not have to shave as often.</li>
            <li>This brand has the perfect in between tone and it works fast.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love it to start me off on a nice safe tan for the summer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The hair minimizing I&#x27;m not so sure about</li>
            <li>It works okay and isn&#x27;t too orange-y, but I like the smell of the Jergen&#x27;s self-tanning lotion better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I have used it for over a year.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>So I was incredibly pleased when I smelled this Nivea product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li>It is a more gradual process than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It truly gives you a beautiful, NATURAL, and HEALTHY looking tan.</li>
            <li>, I use it everywhere, and it creates a very nice natural looking color!   </li>
            <li>I have a glowing, natural looking tan that looks great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell like stinky feet (this has a nice fresh lotion scent).</li>
            <li>It goes on easily</li>
            <li>A lot less shaving, best to you when you can wear shorts!</li>
            <li>I wish it was still available in stores.</li>
            <li>It produces a great color after only a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>It is lightly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I can now feel so much more comfortable when I wear dresses, skirts, and knee-lenght shorts knowing that my legs actually look nice.</li>
            <li>More consistently in the warmer months than in the winter.</li>
            <li>product is good, make sure you wash your hands after use because it could turn the creases of your hands orange, but product does not turn legs orange which is what i was looking for :) works well for pale skin tones</li>
            <li>I guess this is okay for people who like self tanners, I thought this was a regular tinted lotion (the shimmer kind)</li>
            <li>It gives you the MOST realistic color on your legs than anything else i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;re fair skinned.</li>
            <li>Nivea certainly gets my vote!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re careful to mix in a bit of lotion with the cream when covering knees and feet, I&#x27;d recommend going for the darker shade, since this one (fair to medium) requires more than one application to get much of a &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This self-tanner is very natural - no dark streaks and has a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Really works and keeps my legs smooth for over a week.  </li>
            <li>It actually gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li>But I was really pleasantly surprised to get a nice, natural looking glow after the first use!!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li>It began to show after the first day of use and after day two I was as tan as I wanted to be.</li>
            <li>My legs are super soft and hair stubble is minimized, after I use it.</li>
            <li>Goes on very evenly.</li>
            <li>It does look ok, but still I have areas that it gathers heavier than other areas.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to be very careful with the application around your ankles, or also put this product on your feet.</li>
            <li>Also the subtle sunless tanner is a welcoming feature for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>This product is the best one yet, simply because it&#x27;s affordable, and more importantly it doesn&#x27;t have that awful chemical odor!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it really makes my leg hair grow more slowly, however it has given my skin a nice golden glow</li>
            <li>I am almost Nicole Kidman white, so I have used many different sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this at WalMart because I didn&#x27;t have time to go to the mall to buy the $35 Sevin Nyne Self Tanner at Sephora -- and I like the Nivea product better because it doesn&#x27;t have the dark brown tint to it that streaks if you happen to dribble water on it before it completely dries</li>
            <li>It has definitely slowed down the hair growith which is amazing in itseld.</li>
            <li>It is very natural looking</li>
            <li>I love this product and was not able to find it in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I have spent my entire life feeling ashamed to wear shorts and skirts due to my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I tried to use sunless tanning prior to this and ended up looking like an oompa loompa, but thanks to this product</li>
            <li>I do have to avoid using it on my knees, however, very much like other sunless tanning products.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin so soft</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Left my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair-skinned and self tanners in the past</li>
            <li> You can smell it all day long</li>
            <li> Even the gradual tanners like Jergens have a strange smell.  </li>
            <li> Many of them work very well and give a natural-looking color, but there is one thing they all have in common: that weird smell!  </li>
            <li> (At least people are no longer blinded by my whiter-than-white legs when I hit the beach early in the season!)  </li>
            <li> I just rub it in well (and do try to apply less on my ankles, knees, elbows) let it dry for about 15 minutes,</li>
            <li> Usually, other products you apply every day end up looking \\&quot;cracked\\&quot; on your skin...but not this.  </li>
            <li> I now just put it on every other day or every two days because so I don&#x27;t become too dark.</li>
            <li> Be careful around the ankle area!!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t get very dark, so you&#x27;ll need to find something else if you are looking for a deeper tan.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work very well since it didn&#x27;t have that nasty sunless tanner smell.</li>
            <li> (I dunno what it is) was very small and it would take a long time to build up color.</li>
            <li> After a few uses</li>
            <li> It was a waste of $9.</li>
            <li> but it arrived with a cracked and defective cap which makes it impossible to close and must be stored in a certain position.</li>
            <li> Every attempt I have made to tan has only been a bad burn followed by white skin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve applied it every day for the past 8 days as my moisturizer after exfoliating in the shower each morning) to my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> Description not good.  </li>
            <li> But it does have a bit of a weird smell :/</li>
            <li> This is even worse and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> It has a horrible odor and within 8 hours I broke out in hives and started itching.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. It truly gives you a beautiful, NATURAL, and HEALTHY looking tan. I noticed results within days. I can now feel so much more comfortable when I wear dresses, skirts, and knee-lenght shorts knowing that my legs actually look nice. It is just a wonderful product! I now just put it on every other day or every two days because so I don&#x27;t become too dark. Make sure to be very careful with the application around your ankles, or also put this product on your feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used self tanners for 20 years because my legs are the color of snow.  This product is the best one yet, simply because it&#x27;s affordable, and more importantly it doesn&#x27;t have that awful chemical odor!  The scent is very pleasant going on, and stays that way throughout the day.  And it&#x27;s not just for legs, I use it everywhere, and it creates a very nice natural looking color!   Spread the word so Nivea doesn&#x27;t discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> I guess this is okay for people who like self tanners, I thought this was a regular tinted lotion (the shimmer kind) but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> it definitely works as for the tanning part. The hair minimizing I&#x27;m not so sure about but I haven&#x27;t been using it constantly either to tell. But it does have a bit of a weird smell :/ but I&#x27;ve noticed that with all tanning lotions though...</li>
            <li> This product is great for getting a bit of a glow, and the price is unbeatable. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it really makes my leg hair grow more slowly, however it has given my skin a nice golden glow and it&#x27;s not at all streaky or orange.  The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t get very dark, so you&#x27;ll need to find something else if you are looking for a deeper tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair-skinned and self tanners in the past have turned my skin an unatural orange-tone color, made me smell like stinky feet, streaked, and turned my knees, front of the legs, and ankles a darker orange.  None of this with the Nivea Sun-Kissed Beautiful Legs!!  It goes on easily (I&#x27;ve applied it every day for the past 8 days as my moisturizer after exfoliating in the shower each morning) to my legs and arms.  I just rub it in well (and do try to apply less on my ankles, knees, elbows) let it dry for about 15 minutes, get dressed and go.  I&#x27;ve had nothing rub off on my white tops or bra straps.  I don&#x27;t smell like stinky feet (this has a nice fresh lotion scent). Usually, other products you apply every day end up looking \\&quot;cracked\\&quot; on your skin...but not this.  And I saved big $$$$...I bought this at WalMart because I didn&#x27;t have time to go to the mall to buy the $35 Sevin Nyne Self Tanner at Sephora -- and I like the Nivea product better because it doesn&#x27;t have the dark brown tint to it that streaks if you happen to dribble water on it before it completely dries (which takes a good 45 min.).  Nivea certainly gets my vote!!</li>
            <li> I have spent my entire life feeling ashamed to wear shorts and skirts due to my fair skin. Every attempt I have made to tan has only been a bad burn followed by white skin. I tried to use sunless tanning prior to this and ended up looking like an oompa loompa, but thanks to this product I have a glowing, natural looking tan that looks great. It began to show after the first day of use and after day two I was as tan as I wanted to be. I remained that way for a week. It also has a really nice smell to it that&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li> It works okay and isn&#x27;t too orange-y, but I like the smell of the Jergen&#x27;s self-tanning lotion better.  (At least people are no longer blinded by my whiter-than-white legs when I hit the beach early in the season!)  If you&#x27;re careful to mix in a bit of lotion with the cream when covering knees and feet, I&#x27;d recommend going for the darker shade, since this one (fair to medium) requires more than one application to get much of a &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work very well since it didn&#x27;t have that nasty sunless tanner smell. I thought maybe the amount of sunless tanner chemical (I dunno what it is) was very small and it would take a long time to build up color. But I was really pleasantly surprised to get a nice, natural looking glow after the first use!! Even on my ghostly white legs. I was using Jergens before for years, and now I&#x27;m definitely switching to this product! Good job Nivea :)</li>
            <li> It gives you the MOST realistic color on your legs than anything else i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> product is good, make sure you wash your hands after use because it could turn the creases of your hands orange, but product does not turn legs orange which is what i was looking for :) works well for pale skin tones</li>
            <li> It actually gives you a nice glow. After a few uses I saw my legs get tan. No streaks. Left my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have used it for over a year. More consistently in the warmer months than in the winter. It helps give my legs a nice tan and allowing me to not have to shave as often. It has definitely slowed down the hair growith which is amazing in itseld. My only regret is that I can no longer find it in the local stores. Nivea please start stocking locally again.</li>
            <li> Turned me from pastey white to orange. great look.</li>
            <li> This lotion works but if you don&#x27;t like a fragance to your lotion, don&#x27;t buy it. I used it once and gave it away to a friend who doesn&#x27;t mind fragrance. You can smell it all day long and it&#x27;s a very strong smell. Buy the body lotion instead which is fragrance-free and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Wish I could still find it in stores. My legs are super soft and hair stubble is minimized, after I use it. Also the subtle sunless tanner is a welcoming feature for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! Best tanner I have ever used-and I have tried plenty of them. It is very natural looking and there are no streaks. Goes on very evenly. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It has a horrible odor and within 8 hours I broke out in hives and started itching. I have been using self tanning products since 1994 for body building and never have had such an experience.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used. I have very pale skin and I don&#x27;t think a tanner should take days of use to show up. This brand has the perfect in between tone and it works fast. I wish it was still available in stores.</li>
            <li> I am almost Nicole Kidman white, so I have used many different sunless tanners.  Many of them work very well and give a natural-looking color, but there is one thing they all have in common: that weird smell!  Even the gradual tanners like Jergens have a strange smell.  So I was incredibly pleased when I smelled this Nivea product.  It actually smells like frosting to me!  It produces a great color after only a couple of uses.  It is lightly moisturizing.  I do have to avoid using it on my knees, however, very much like other sunless tanning products.  This is the only product I&#x27;m using now for sunless tanning.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Especially if you&#x27;re fair skinned.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was not able to find it in the drug stores.  I am glad that Amazon had it.  I love it to start me off on a nice safe tan for the summer.  I recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a cream with tanning color to use daily, almost like a make up.  Instead is it just another orangy cream that is used to gradually add color.  Description not good.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> My Wife loves the product.....</li>
            <li> The smell of this has been greatly improved and I love the gradual tan it provides. Be careful around the ankle area!!</li>
            <li> This self-tanner is very natural - no dark streaks and has a pleasant fragrance.  It is a more gradual process than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Product was expired by 4 months</li>
            <li> It does look ok, but still I have areas that it gathers heavier than other areas.  I am not overly impressed, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Works great and didn&#x27;t turn my legs orange!</li>
            <li> Really works and keeps my legs smooth for over a week.  A lot less shaving, best to you when you can wear shorts!</li>
            <li> Great product but it arrived with a cracked and defective cap which makes it impossible to close and must be stored in a certain position.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the Jergens self tanner. This is even worse and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away. It was a waste of $9. I should have sent it back.</li>
