            <li>Excellent seller &amp; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>Have to use with gel or serum for best results...</li>
            <li>this did not come with very good instructions</li>
            <li>In my opinion this machine is a very good buy I would recommend.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>Mine works great.  </li>
            <li>It has two head attachments of good quality.</li>
            <li>i love this thing!</li>
            <li>I love my durmawand though!</li>
            <li>I have had better results when using that gel than when putting on my own products, so there must be something to it!</li>
            <li>A nice bonus on my lips too.</li>
            <li>Good product; however the directions were challenging.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best at home device I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>After a full week I am more than happy...</li>
            <li>Mostly you concentrate on a series of up motions and then out .</li>
            <li>I love this thing</li>
            <li>Does anyone know more about the machine, and could tell me if my unit is still functioning.</li>
            <li>I love that it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>After using for several months I can say that it is an excellent product to be used as absorbent of moisturizing products treatment, I recommend the product and seller.</li>
            <li>- REALLY glad i bought this:)</li>
            <li>, hope at some point it will keep them down...would Love to have booklet others speak of sent to me....</li>
            <li>great and results are noticeable, very pleased...Would love to be sent a booklet</li>
            <li>for the most part it stings the face/skin even on the lowest setting .05  </li>
            <li>and I feel like my skin is just...attached better.</li>
            <li>It is easily held in my hand without feeling bulky and very easy to maneuver and you can adjust the strength by turning the knob to the number you want.</li>
            <li>Quick &amp; easy to use, visible results!</li>
            <li>and I think that I will see more significant changes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, it was pretty simple to figure out and it works great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to know that something like this exists and is in a price range that the more financially modest ones of us can afford. ...</li>
            <li>It says that when you hold both sides that both lights will light up so that you know it is working.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because the reviews seemed so genuine and</li>
            <li>I use it with my moisturizer and it lightly plumps lines and my skin stays that way too.</li>
            <li>The dial to adjust the level of current works great</li>
            <li>I wash my face with gm collin wash, then i put on some alcohol free toner.</li>
            <li>Acid serum from Swanson Health (probably available on Amazon too)</li>
            <li>Most important is to be consistent in using the device in order to get results.  </li>
            <li>- this little machine is AMAZING !! - believe it or not....</li>
            <li>I am excited to continue using and hopefully see results</li>
            <li>Will have to use it for awhile before writing a full review.  </li>
            <li>and because it is a charge you have full power until it dies.</li>
            <li>I love the attachments and found the prong attachment really works well for lifting.</li>
            <li>Again, re; the Norlanya, I am now reading more to discover more I can do and if I am using it properly.</li>
            <li>When holding the device and rolling, just hold it like you would anything else, but make sure your fingers are touching the metal electrodes on both sides of the white plastic piece to make it work.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got it to see that it came in its own case (nothing too fancy, but definitely practical)</li>
            <li>mine only came with box would be nice to understand more....easy to keep clean after use</li>
            <li>I really like this product A LOT!!</li>
            <li>used a few times and great results....</li>
            <li>But every once in awhile I hit on something making it worth it, this product is one of them.</li>
            <li>but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>You can see tightening results right away...</li>
            <li>My husband pokes fun because of all the pretty beauty products and gadgets that come thru my door.</li>
            <li>Great results of used properly on the proper setting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe later on I can invest in a more powerful machine if I need to.</li>
            <li>Once I figured out how to use the product, I liked it because it is small and the tools glide easily on the skin.  </li>
            <li>No sending back on this though :)</li>
            <li>Will have more later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an esthetician but still love my at home personal use tools</li>
            <li>My face looks younger and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Thanks in advance!</li>
            <li>With Swanson Health prices so reasonable, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>, I need to get better at using it regularly</li>
            <li>And to be honest, it&#x27;s so easy and hard to detect anything going on that you wouldn&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s doing anything..</li>
            <li>Wow... Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>It actually works but mine only lasted three months with good care.  </li>
            <li>and this takes them down nicely</li>
            <li>I loved it at first, but the blue light stopped lighting up when rolling it on the face, and I&#x27;m not sure if it is still working.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>skin looks really nice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it really does what it says.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s doing something for real in there.</li>
            <li>so much, either.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>This is the cheap Asian knockoff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used different product so the attachment glides smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I could really see a difference</li>
            <li>but the fact that it does do something pretty quickly amazed me enough to review now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if I am told they are an authorized dealer, then when/if need repair, I SOL?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out Galvanic has been around for a long time - I like this unit - fits in the hand well - easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this less than a week, but wow what a huge diff it has made on my skin!!!</li>
            <li>have no idea why I choose this particular model.</li>
            <li>Great product, does what the more expensive microcurrent machines do for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li>but in my research I found their were some problems if you had to get warranty work and did not buy directly from Nuface or and &#x27;authorized&#x27; dealer - ummm, $300+ was just too much for me to risk, what</li>
            <li>The blue and red &#x27;on&#x27; lights are still on, it&#x27;s just the blue light in the clear part that used to light up when applied to the skin that no longer functions.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if this is normal..</li>
            <li>The off/on switch that also lets you select positive or negative is very cheaply made</li>
            <li>Just got this product this week after using the New Spa Eye lift machine.</li>
            <li>i actually saw results the first time i used it</li>
            <li>little device is strong &amp; effective.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I put on my gm collin face serum, set dial to 10 and turn on the positive ions.</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I was hopeful, but I actually am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyebrows is much more shallow</li>
            <li>Can really feel current on blue..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also excited to have such a convenient way to take my skin care up a notch for less than the price of one facial.</li>
            <li>especially this early on..</li>
            <li>Have new eye bags due to cataract surgery</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I hope with use that the results will last (I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know).</li>
            <li> Using this product I really initially get the look as though the skin is responding to the negative and positive electrons.</li>
            <li> About once a week, I clean my face as usual, put on my Strivectin and Vita C creams and then roll with the roller for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is long, plus it&#x27;s rechargeable with a cord long enough to continue your treatment while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> The negative is supposed to draw out impurities  while the positive setting preps the skin for treatment or serums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always start with the negative (2 prong attachment) then use the positive attachment (</li>
            <li> This little gadget really works well and without a lot of the hassle or bulk of other models.</li>
            <li> If you hold it in one place too long or use it for too long it will create a burn.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for long</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to get it.</li>
            <li> some other similar products.</li>
            <li> But only after several uses I could see a difference in my jawline and a little sagging beginning just under my neck.</li>
            <li> Turn dial down to a low number to start, turn up as you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I used this for less than two weeks without telling hubby I&#x27;d gotten it and out of the blue he looks at me and says &amp;#34;Your</li>
            <li> The touch panel control had some damage, so I can only think that the previous person was struggling to make the defective product turn on.</li>
            <li> Same as others with less cost...</li>
            <li> Be careful as you can burn yourself with this product.</li>
            <li> Then hit the center square button to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I am not as consistent in using the product as I was when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Next I take my roller and attachment (no balls) and I set it on the negative setting.</li>
            <li> It seems like one of those weird quack devices, but it is really doing something.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any other way to say it; it doesn&#x27;t feel tight like some creams can do</li>
            <li> They say to let the charge go down to zero before charging</li>
            <li> A lot less that</li>
            <li> I get a slight metallic tingle in my teeth</li>
            <li> and it seems to get less each time I use it.  </li>
            <li> Two and half stars.  </li>
            <li> The product had been previously used and would not turn on.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this and it works great. A lot less that some other similar products.</li>
            <li> Got it and using it. I noticed that when I stopped using it I can see the difference on my face. This product actually works. I did a bit of reading on microcurrent use for beauty and this link might help some of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.truthinaging.com/review/the-truth-about-microcurrent</li>
            <li> Be careful as you can burn yourself with this product. It does what it says it will do; lifts the muscle under the skin!  If you hold it in one place too long or use it for too long it will create a burn. Great results of used properly on the proper setting.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it to work.  It says that when you hold both sides that both lights will light up so that you know it is working.  That does not happen.  Not sure what to do.</li>
            <li> Will have to use it for awhile before writing a full review.  I uploaded the photos/manuals to hopefully answer some of those questions.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller &amp; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;This little device is strong &amp; effective.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was going to wait another several weeks to review...and I will try to update later...but the fact that it does do something pretty quickly amazed me enough to review now.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why I choose this particular model. I&#x27;ve been looking at different devices for awhile (that fall within the affordable range) and something just hit me on this one. I think it&#x27;s because the reviews seemed so genuine and not manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;This device has an ease of use that I didn&#x27;t expect. And to be honest, it&#x27;s so easy and hard to detect anything going on that you wouldn&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s doing anything.. But only after several uses I could see a difference in my jawline and a little sagging beginning just under my neck. After a full week I am more than happy...especially this early on..&lt;br /&gt;I took before pictures, which I will review at the beginning of July when I take the after pics...and then I&#x27;ll see to what degree it is working. But it does work.&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted...the instructions are crap. Go to youtube and get some ideas on how to use it. Mostly you concentrate on a series of up motions and then out . Experiment.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe later on I can invest in a more powerful machine if I need to. But if you&#x27;re on a budget it&#x27;s nice to know that something like this exists and is in a price range that the more financially modest ones of us can afford. ...And that it does what it says.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product, does what the more expensive microcurrent machines do for a lot less money.  Easy to use.  Battery life is long, plus it&#x27;s rechargeable with a cord long enough to continue your treatment while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> My husband pokes fun because of all the pretty beauty products and gadgets that come thru my door. What can I say, I&#x27;m an optimist. But every once in awhile I hit on something making it worth it, this product is one of them. Even I was skeptical and assumed I&#x27;d be sending it back. I used this for less than two weeks without telling hubby I&#x27;d gotten it and out of the blue he looks at me and says &amp;#34;Your skin looks really nice&amp;#34; BINGO! That&#x27;s what I want to hear. I don&#x27;t know anything about ions for skin care and just got this on a whim but I&#x27;ll be darned it really does what it says. And ,this is weird, but while I&#x27;m using it it brings a metallic taste to my mouth like my fillings or something and even when doing my throat so it&#x27;s doing something for real in there. I use it with my moisturizer and it lightly plumps lines and my skin stays that way too. A nice bonus on my lips too. They say to let the charge go down to zero before charging but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and it&#x27;s still fully charged. No buying batteries and because it is a charge you have full power until it dies. I love this thing and I&#x27;m the queen of sending stuff back. No sending back on this though :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it&#x27;s definitely working!  I&#x27;ve been using this device for a bout 2 weeks now, and there&#x27;s a noticeable improvement in my skin. Not only does it seem to help with skincare product absorption, it&#x27;s actually tightening and firming the skin on my face and neck. Very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Using this product I really initially get the look as though the skin is responding to the negative and positive electrons. Again, re; the Norlanya, I am now reading more to discover more I can do and if I am using it properly. Will have more later.</li>
            <li> Used few times, and it stopped working</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for long but so far I love it.  My skin feels great.  I read all the reviews and I was hopeful, but I actually am pleasantly surprised.  You can see tightening results right away...I hope with use that the results will last (I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know). Like others I went on youtube to watch a couple of tutorials which also helped.  Like others I get a slight metallic tingle in my teeth but nothing unpleasant and it seems to get less each time I use it.  Definitely recommend this for the price and performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this less than a week, but wow what a huge diff it has made on my skin!!! Its glowing! This is by far the best at home device I&#x27;ve ever bought. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; easy to use, visible results!</li>
            <li> this did not come with very good instructions so I have not used it for that reason. It is still plugged in though.</li>
            <li> Two and half stars.  It actually works but mine only lasted three months with good care.  The off/on switch that also lets you select positive or negative is very cheaply made and I can no longer select the negative side. Just based on this, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The product had been previously used and would not turn on.  The touch panel control had some damage, so I can only think that the previous person was struggling to make the defective product turn on.</li>
            <li> It only works on my hand not on the face.  Didn&#x27;t keep packaging so I&#x27;m out the money I paid for this.</li>
            <li> I have another galvanic spa and I bought this one because it has adjustable setting. I also purchased this spa device because it can be charged rather than using batteries.</li>
            <li> This works fantastic except it&#x27;s shocking my fingers...I haven&#x27;t yet contacted the seller but I will.</li>
            <li> I really like this product A LOT!! It is easily held in my hand without feeling bulky and very easy to maneuver and you can adjust the strength by turning the knob to the number you want. In my opinion this machine is a very good buy I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Just got this product this week after using the New Spa Eye lift machine. Using the aloe vera gel also and this is working for me. I love the attachments and found the prong attachment really works well for lifting. Still figuring out the benefits of the positive/negative settings as there isn&#x27;t alot of information out on the web regarding this device. I basically bought it because it&#x27;s rechargeable. One downside I noticed is I&#x27;m getting current through the body of the device into my fingers.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first, but the blue light stopped lighting up when rolling it on the face, and I&#x27;m not sure if it is still working.  I don&#x27;t feel the tingle anymore so much, either.  Does anyone know more about the machine, and could tell me if my unit is still functioning. The blue and red &#x27;on&#x27; lights are still on, it&#x27;s just the blue light in the clear part that used to light up when applied to the skin that no longer functions.  Is it broken?</li>
            <li> Good product; however the directions were challenging. Once I figured out how to use the product, I liked it because it is small and the tools glide easily on the skin.  The process only takes about 10 minutes.  Most important is to be consistent in using the device in order to get results.  Consistency shows results in smoothing out my wisdom lines.  Honestly, I am not as consistent in using the product as I was when I purchased it.  I use it when I do a facial about once a week.</li>
            <li> Wow... Fast shipping!!! I received this a couple days ago but have not had time to use until today. The instructions are in English but not proper English so you might have to read a time or two.... However, it was pretty simple to figure out and it works great! I was excited when I got it to see that it came in its own case (nothing too fancy, but definitely practical) that provides protection to the unit. It has two head attachments of good quality. The dial to adjust the level of current works great and it is easy to use. This little gadget really works well and without a lot of the hassle or bulk of other models. It has a sleek design... Looks just like the pictures in the post. I love that it is rechargeable. I&#x27;m also excited to have such a convenient way to take my skin care up a notch for less than the price of one facial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician but still love my at home personal use tools and this one does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Mine works great.  About once a week, I clean my face as usual, put on my Strivectin and Vita C creams and then roll with the roller for a few minutes.  It helps the cream to penetrate.  It definitely makes a difference.  I am not sure what to do with the pronged attachment!  PS When you get it, plug it in to charge.  Then hit the center square button to turn it on.  Turn dial down to a low number to start, turn up as you get used to it.  When holding the device and rolling, just hold it like you would anything else, but make sure your fingers are touching the metal electrodes on both sides of the white plastic piece to make it work.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping.  I am excited to continue using and hopefully see results</li>
            <li> After using for several months I can say that it is an excellent product to be used as absorbent of moisturizing products treatment, I recommend the product and seller. Thank you</li>
            <li> received 2 days ahead of delivery date !! - this little machine is AMAZING !! - believe it or not.... i actually saw results the first time i used it - REALLY glad i bought this:)</li>
            <li> i love this thing! Why did I wait so long to get it. My face looks younger and more hydrated. I have been using this four times a week. I wash my face with gm collin wash, then i put on some alcohol free toner. Next I take my roller and attachment (no balls) and I set it on the negative setting. I roll it all over my face in an upwatd motion. Lastly, I put on my gm collin face serum, set dial to 10 and turn on the positive ions. The negative is supposed to draw out impurities  while the positive setting preps the skin for treatment or serums.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I use it every night before bed. It actually is working even after only 2 weeks. It seems like one of those weird quack devices, but it is really doing something. This one comes with a charger and an instruction booklet written in terrible English. My advice is- go to the Nu Face site and follow the directions there. This is the cheap Asian knockoff.</li>
            <li> used a few times and great results....have no complaints....it does add in softening lines....face tone that is yet to be seen but feel it will in time lift the small drops I now see...it all takes time....booklet???  mine only came with box would be nice to understand more....easy to keep clean after use...Love the ease of use with this one. Have to use with gel or serum for best results...it drives products into your skin for deeper absorption. Have new eye bags due to cataract surgery and this takes them down nicely, hope at some point it will keep them down...would Love to have booklet others speak of sent to me....Thanks in advance! Same as others with less cost...great and results are noticeable, very pleased...Would love to be sent a booklet didn&#x27;t get one with my order...bummer...</li>
            <li> This device came with no instructions on how to use it! Unless you already know how to use a device like this I would not recommend it! I&#x27;m left scratching my head. I feel like I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this .. Can really feel current on blue.. Not on red.. Don&#x27;t know if this is normal.. But.. I have to admit.. I&#x27;ve seen a difference!!</li>
            <li> It did not work, but they promptly refunded my money.</li>
            <li> Had a friend that recommended NuFace but in my research I found their were some problems if you had to get warranty work and did not buy directly from Nuface or and &#x27;authorized&#x27; dealer - ummm, $300+ was just too much for me to risk, what if I am told they are an authorized dealer, then when/if need repair, I SOL?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out Galvanic has been around for a long time - I like this unit - fits in the hand well - easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always start with the negative (2 prong attachment) then use the positive attachment (roller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used different product so the attachment glides smoothly.  I have a lot of skin care products.  I did buy some Parker electode gel also when I bought this unit, it works well for the gliding.  I have used Premier Dead Sea skin product with this - I could really see a difference but if you price them, at least in the mall, the products are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently purchased Hydralonic(sp?) Acid serum from Swanson Health (probably available on Amazon too) as I saw my dermatologist was selling it in his medical spa side and his recent newsletter had an article praising it.  With Swanson Health prices so reasonable, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is a tough one...for the most part it stings the face/skin even on the lowest setting .05  It makes it hard to want to use it.  I love my durmawand though!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, and I don&#x27;t know if I am seeing lasting results yet. I haven&#x27;t had anyone remark on anything, but I do know that the day after I use this, the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyebrows is much more shallow and I feel like my skin is just...attached better. I can&#x27;t think of any other way to say it; it doesn&#x27;t feel tight like some creams can do, I need to get better at using it regularly and I think that I will see more significant changes. The gel that is provided works well too. I have no idea what all is in it, but is called a collagen conductor gel. I have had better results when using that gel than when putting on my own products, so there must be something to it!</li>
