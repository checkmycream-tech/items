    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I got this not noticing that it was for those with \\&quot;latter-life\\&quot; dental issues, but found that it&#x27;s great for my needs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health has a noticeably pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning teeth,</li>
            <li>Both are good products and I have no problem recommending Crest Pro-health For Life.</li>
            <li>and we both laughed about a toothpaste created just for AARP members.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product many times.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m 49</li>
            <li>Better than most...</li>
            <li>say give it a try...it can&#x27;t hurt. :-)</li>
            <li>there is sodium lauryl sulfate, SLS, which is a surfactant (soapy - makes the substance more gooey).</li>
            <li>The flavor isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>The flavor was pleasant enough, and it seemed to do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li>It cleaned as well as any other toothpaste, and that&#x27;s about the best thing I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good toothpaste for the price (full disclosure: free to Vine Program Reviewers).</li>
            <li>toothpaste tastes fine.</li>
            <li>I bought Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Flavor Toothpaste for my Mom because the description didn&#x27;t include whitening.</li>
            <li>This tooth paste claims a smooth mint flavor, and I won&#x27;t dispute that.</li>
            <li>Inactive ingredients can be important if you have allergies.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint toothpaste is a product cleans my teeth while reducing the sensitivity I experience.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-health for life &#x27;smooth mint&#x27; toothpaste, for the 50+ somethings, is a solid product from Crest: it, of course, contains flouride and is a good smooth mint flavor, and this toothpaste is engineered to be for people with sensitive teeth, which is excellent: I would definitely recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Stannous fluoride is thought by dental scientists to be more effective than Sodium fluoride, and you will note this toothpaste contains a larger percentage than others.</li>
            <li>but I feel like the toothpaste is doing its job and keeping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>However, I did not note anything special for \\&quot;those over 50\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, as toothpastes go.</li>
            <li>quick</li>
            <li>Crest is a solid brand: I recently visited my dentist, and he said the best thing you can do for your teeth as you go thru life, is give it contact with flouride</li>
            <li>guess--great for the older folks, but also good for those with sensitive teeth whom have issues already.</li>
            <li>enjoying the flavor; it&#x27;s not harsh like some others that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels minty fresh after brushing.  </li>
            <li>The texture is silkier than other toothpastes, so maybe it is good for the enamel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am over 60 and do anything I can to keep my teeth as healthy as possible..when I saw the ad for this &#x27;over 50&#x27; toothpaste I looked for it in our local stores..not on shelves..came to Amazon and success..</li>
            <li>I typically buy Crest toothpaste for the family and we&#x27;ve all had good check-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very gentle.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some mint-flavored toothpastes, this version of Crest doesn&#x27;t knock you back as soon as you start brushing; it&#x27;s a very light mint without any bite.  </li>
            <li>Then out of the blue I got a dental student to clean my teeth for free.</li>
            <li>It provides the same comfort level as Sensodyne but it tastes much better.</li>

            <li>Thanks for the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t want to take the enamel off your teeth this way, a bit every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li>When combined with the oral B tooth brush for older adults I can feel  and see the difference using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and don&#x27;t have any particular teeth problems, but I decided to try this toothpaste marketed to people over 50.  </li>
            <li>I am concerned about the inclusion in this formula, of a high amount of \\&quot;hydrated</li>
            <li>That means there is a high percentage.</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and stay clean-feeling longer that they do with the Sensodyne tooth paste I normally use.</li>
            <li>This is my new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Crest has also started using the new type of stand-up cap that seems to be increasingly used.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste is soft and melts as you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive teeth, I appreciate a product that will mitigate the symptoms of tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a major difference relative to other bonus added toothpaste.</li>

            <li> every single day (in other words, brush your teeth every day with flouride toothpaste).  </li>
            <li> My cat frequently jumps on the counter to knock over the toothpaste, but at least I can try to keep things neat by standing it up.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a slight benefit in how it&#x27;s helped with my gum tenderness, and it seems like my enamel&#x27;s improving, although it&#x27;s difficult to describe that in words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is advertised as helping with tooth sensitivity, weak enamel, inflamed gums, and surface stains.  </li>
            <li> It struck me as slightly medicinal but not in any bad way.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Using this stuff along with the mouthwash and began to get white strings of mucous inside mouth.  I went on line and found huge numbers of people with the same complaints.  Also causes a loss of taste.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is soft and melts as you brush your teeth.  Very gentle.  The mint is not overpowering to the point that it stings.</li>
            <li> When combined with the oral B tooth brush for older adults I can feel  and see the difference using this product. My teeth are whiter and stay clean-feeling longer that they do with the Sensodyne tooth paste I normally use. It provides the same comfort level as Sensodyne but it tastes much better. This is my new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times. As someone with sensitive teeth, I appreciate a product that will mitigate the symptoms of tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is billed as something for the \\&quot;over-50\\&quot; age group. Okay, I&#x27;m 49 so that&#x27;s close enough. Regular use of this product does lessen my sensitivity to hot/cold. It does a good job of cleaning teeth, the mild whitening properties and Crest has always been a high quality product. The taste? Better than most...still yucky in my book as are all toothpastes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I regularly purchase. I would add that Sensodyne Pronamel is an equivalent product and sometimes my buying decision is made based on which I have a coupon for or which is on sale. Both are good products and I have no problem recommending Crest Pro-health For Life. I give it five stars based on my long-term use of the product.</li>
            <li> I am over 60 and do anything I can to keep my teeth as healthy as possible..when I saw the ad for this &#x27;over 50&#x27; toothpaste I looked for it in our local stores..not on shelves..came to Amazon and success..quick delivery!..love it..</li>
            <li> I bought Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Flavor Toothpaste for my Mom because the description didn&#x27;t include whitening. When this product arrived it contained whitener. She is allergic to the whitener.</li>
            <li> I got this not noticing that it was for those with \\&quot;latter-life\\&quot; dental issues, but found that it&#x27;s great for my needs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a slight benefit in how it&#x27;s helped with my gum tenderness, and it seems like my enamel&#x27;s improving, although it&#x27;s difficult to describe that in words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess--great for the older folks, but also good for those with sensitive teeth whom have issues already.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a whole lot different than regular Crest paste. It is a bit \\&quot;smoother\\&quot; than the regular mint as they state. It&#x27;s a little milder and doesn&#x27;t feel as minty as the original stuff. Does the job though. Cleans, protects, and helps keep your teeth white and clean. I guess anyone who wants this type of paste as an option won&#x27;t be let down. I just don&#x27;t see the difference between this stuff and regular Crest.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, as toothpastes go. The flavor was pleasant enough, and it seemed to do a good job cleaning. However, I did not note anything special for \\&quot;those over 50\\&quot;...a group that I fall into...as far as the touted benefits of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say give it a try...it can&#x27;t hurt. :-)</li>
            <li> Unlike some mint-flavored toothpastes, this version of Crest doesn&#x27;t knock you back as soon as you start brushing; it&#x27;s a very light mint without any bite.  It does, however, have a grittiness to it like the polish at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Crest has also started using the new type of stand-up cap that seems to be increasingly used.  My cat frequently jumps on the counter to knock over the toothpaste, but at least I can try to keep things neat by standing it up.  As for whether or not I&#x27;ll see any improvement with the health of my teeth, I&#x27;ll have to report back after my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste worked as well as others but is pricey.  I didn&#x27;t really see a major difference relative to other bonus added toothpaste. It help with temperature sensitivity but I didn&#x27;t notice a major stain prohibition activity.</li>
            <li> Crest is a solid brand: I recently visited my dentist, and he said the best thing you can do for your teeth as you go thru life, is give it contact with flouride every single day (in other words, brush your teeth every day with flouride toothpaste).  Crest Pro-health for life &#x27;smooth mint&#x27; toothpaste, for the 50+ somethings, is a solid product from Crest: it, of course, contains flouride and is a good smooth mint flavor, and this toothpaste is engineered to be for people with sensitive teeth, which is excellent: I would definitely recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Hey, Crest! Thanks for the toothpaste. I haven&#x27;t been to a dentist in like a decade, so my teeth are pretty decayed. Then out of the blue I got a dental student to clean my teeth for free. So, now I will start brushing again. This tooth paste claims a smooth mint flavor, and I won&#x27;t dispute that. It also claims to strengthen enamel and help with sensitivity, like Sensadyne. This is pretty good toothpaste for the price (full disclosure: free to Vine Program Reviewers).</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is NOT as \\&quot;minty\\&quot; as I usually prefer, and it seems to taste of old cans.  It is also quite a bit \\&quot;grittier\\&quot; than I want a toothpaste to be.  There is very little foaming as one brushes.  I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Well!  I saw a commercial for this while at my mom&#x27;s one afternoon and we both laughed about a toothpaste created just for AARP members.  When it popped up on the Vine list, I thought twice before requesting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying the flavor; it&#x27;s not harsh like some others that I&#x27;ve used.  My mouth feels minty fresh after brushing.  I can&#x27;t tell if my enamel is happier yet, though.  The texture is silkier than other toothpastes, so maybe it is good for the enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this tube is all empty, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it myself.  I&#x27;m wondering if the \\&quot;over 50\\&quot; claims are just a marketing ploy.  I typically buy Crest toothpaste for the family and we&#x27;ve all had good check-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re curious, try it out.  I can&#x27;t say that I truly recommend it, except on the basis that the flavor isn&#x27;t harsh and it gives me a minty clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I prefer tubes of toothpaste that stand on end like this one does. But after relatively few uses, the cap simply broke at the hinges without any provocation. I mean I wasn&#x27;t stressing it in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Crest 3D White toothpaste so this is somewhat of a comparison. Taste: Crest Pro-Health has a noticeably pleasant taste. It struck me as slightly medicinal but not in any bad way. As the review title says, I found it to be a bit too gooey, almost slimy. I am concerned about the inclusion in this formula, of a high amount of \\&quot;hydrated silica\\&quot; as while that abrasive substance removes stains, it is said to also remove enamel - a potential disaster over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other aspect to discuss is the active ingredient, which is this is Stannous fluoride 0.454%. (The 3D white has Sodium fluoride 0.243%.) Stannous fluoride is thought by dental scientists to be more effective than Sodium fluoride, and you will note this toothpaste contains a larger percentage than others. What this means to me is that I can get the recommended fluoride from this toothpaste and use a mouthwash that does not contain any but has other desirable attributes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inactive ingredients are not listed on the tube but do appear on the box. Inactive ingredients can be important if you have allergies. The &#x27;inactive&#x27; listing on my box is:&lt;br /&gt;glycerin&lt;br /&gt;hydrated silica&lt;br /&gt;sodium hexametaphosphate&lt;br /&gt;propylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;PEG-6&lt;br /&gt;water&lt;br /&gt;zinc lactate&lt;br /&gt;flavor&lt;br /&gt;trisodium phosphate&lt;br /&gt;sodium lauryl sulfate&lt;br /&gt;sodium gluconate&lt;br /&gt;carrageenan&lt;br /&gt;sodium saccharin&lt;br /&gt;xanthan gum&lt;br /&gt;polyethylene&lt;br /&gt;titanium dioxide&lt;br /&gt;blue 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will note that hydrated silica, which is the abrasive, is the second inactive ingredient. That means there is a high percentage. If you wonder about the danger of this abrasive, check the website of a dentist named Scott Frey. You really don&#x27;t want to take the enamel off your teeth this way, a bit every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also there is sodium lauryl sulfate, SLS, which is a surfactant (soapy - makes the substance more gooey). It is not only unnecessary but causes mouth ulcers in susceptible individuals. It is also said to reduce the bio-availability of the active ingredient, stannous fluoride.ce more gooey). It is not only unnecessary but causes mouth ulcers in susceptible individuals. It is also said to reduce the bio-availability of the active ingredient, stannous fluoride.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint toothpaste is a product cleans my teeth while reducing the sensitivity I experience. I can&#x27;t say whether it has made my teeth whiter or not but I feel like the toothpaste is doing its job and keeping my teeth clean. The flavor isn&#x27;t my favorite but I&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and don&#x27;t have any particular teeth problems, but I decided to try this toothpaste marketed to people over 50.  It cleaned as well as any other toothpaste, and that&#x27;s about the best thing I can say about it.  It&#x27;s an average toothpaste, and the marketing angle is just another gimmick.</li>
            <li> This Crest toothpaste is from their Pro-Health line of products.  It is advertised as helping with tooth sensitivity, weak enamel, inflamed gums, and surface stains.  Though the gel is targeted towards the 50+ demographic, anyone who has these issues can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste tastes fine. The mint is not overwhelming.  The cap is the stand-up cap style that Colgate uses on their Total line.  I like it because I often drop detached caps on my bathroom floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product works well.</li>
            <li> i like how this paste makes my mouth feel - my teeth also seem to feel &#x27;cleaner&#x27; after a brushing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have used many types of dentrifice over the years, starting with toothpaste powder when growing up as a child... there are pastes, gels, and nowadays, a host of other products one can choose to clean the teeth (the least expensive of which is baking soda; NIH did a study on it, concluding that Arm &amp; Hammer was the best brand to use)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i have found that this dentrifice works well for me - it&#x27;s now a staple in the casa</li>
