            <li>Dries fast, two coats gives the best coverage.</li>
            <li>This is the most gorgeous holographic polish I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Though the holographic detail isn&#x27;t the best in poor lighting, in the sunlight and in great lighting, it looks awesome.</li>
            <li>The color when it isn&#x27;t being holographic is still really nice.</li>
            <li>also own OPI DS Signature.</li>
            <li>It is super bright and does the rainbow holographic thing in good lighting.</li>
            <li>Very cool!</li>
            <li>Chipped very easily, even with an undercoat and topcoat.  </li>
            <li>beautiful color, with so much rainbow!</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ve been wearing this polish for 3 days now and they are surprisingly holding strong.</li>
            <li>It is exceeded my expectations :)</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SHINE AND SPARKLE</li>
            <li>Like most polish it stays on forever on toes.</li>
            <li>Would recommend and I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this polish, and have to buy more colors....</li>
            <li>easily my favorite polish.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I got on this color.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This bottle of polish started my ongoing love affair with holo polish.</li>
            <li>I splurged and paid $25 for that polish, and I love it.</li>
            <li>They are both a dream to apply (not so for most holographic polishes).</li>
            <li>Some top coats change the appearance and brightness of the holo, seche vite doesn&#x27;t though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 3 and 6 year daughters also love this nailpolish.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most beautiful silver I&#x27;ve ever seen, a light hint of silver with a sheen but not too much!  </li>
            <li>Polish paints on and dries very easily and smooth.</li>
            <li>wear is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>The holographic effect is stunning and strong.</li>
            <li>The holo effect is very cool.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely dazzling in direct sunlight!</li>
            <li>Amazing and pretty.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful glowing blue</li>
            <li>The fact that the shipping was free was a great enticement to buy several!</li>
            <li>This polish is just as holographic as advertised, and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>They both apply smoothly and take 2-3 coats to reach opacity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These polishes are a fantastic linear holo.</li>
            <li>Super easy, smooth, self-balancing application.</li>
            <li>This color is very nice, definitely looks better in sunlight than it does indoors, but still nice, as with the other holographic nail polishes it does chip very easily.</li>
            <li>The rainbow shows through in the light but isn&#x27;t super &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is such a gorgeous super holo color and after buying it I had to buy every color available.</li>
            <li>I would have loved to give this five stars but it lasted only a couple of days before I have to change it.</li>
            <li>I still love the color but would not have bought two that looked so much alike.</li>
            <li>When in the right light they have a rainbow affect.</li>
            <li>You do want a good chip resistant top coat or this polish will chip within a few days on fingers.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color and</li>
            <li>Not a bad price and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and I just love the variety of colors this brand offers!</li>
            <li>This polish goes on smooth and drys fast.</li>
            <li>This polish is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Coverage is almost full on the first coat.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more, in the other colors. :-)</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and it has tiny silver glitter in it, so it looks fabulously rich.</li>
            <li>am someone who at most wears same polish for 5 days.  </li>
            <li>Stays on pretty well and doesn&#x27;t chip too easily, especially with a top coat.</li>
            <li>They are so pretty that I even bought one for my mom because I couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of her not having one.</li>
            <li>Definitely the most holo polish I have seen.</li>
            <li>HOW PRETTY MY NAILS ARE.</li>
            <li>I was blown away by the color, exactly what the image shows.  </li>
            <li>, it goes on darker, a more saturated blue.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super iridescent but in indirect light it&#x27;s really nice and a soft color with a really subtle rainbow effect.</li>
            <li>It arrived early too which was really exciting because I really could not wait to use it!</li>
            <li>It goes on snooth and drus fast.</li>
            <li>She seemed to really like them and still wears them from time to time.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>VERY shiny and holographic.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>no streaks,drys fast.</li>
            <li>It looks like regular silver indoors but in natural sunlight/flash photo it looks more like a hologram.</li>
            <li>Beyond is more of a black rainbow</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is such a fun color.</li>
            <li>Just one coat is all it took (with under coat of Nutra Nail with Green Tea and top coat Sally Hansen Insta-Dri).</li>
            <li>This much less expensive color club polish is equally impressive at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>definitely holographic but only in light</li>
            <li>In the sun rainbows dance on it, wow!</li>
            <li>Polish was quick to dry and doesn&#x27;t seem to be chipping (I&#x27;m going on day three so far).</li>
            <li>This polish with seche vite top coat lasts me 4-5 days, but I am really hard on my nails.</li>
            <li>I have 3 bottles and they never get old.</li>
            <li>I get compliments nearly every time I wear it outdoors.</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas present for my mother- the color(s) are/is very flattering on her.</li>
            <li>Without direct sunlight it&#x27;s just very pastel bluish silver color, hard to describe, but very pretty.</li>
            <li>It also last a decent amount of time too (also without a base/top coat.)</li>
            <li>My other color club halo chips on the first day, this one has lasted 2 and is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty unimpressive in shade or dark lighting.</li>

            <li> But in the sun... You better put on those sunglasses or you&#x27;ll go blind!</li>
            <li> It stayed on my nails twice as long as other polishes (8 days vs 4 days).  </li>
            <li> In regular lighting you can see the holographic effect a little</li>
            <li> I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t get much for my money, polishes usually need a few coats, but this one does not!</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time and the package was carefully wrapped.</li>
            <li> I hope that it&#x27;s the color pink that I&#x27;d hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> I got this and one other color as a gift for my sister&#x27;s 15th birthday.  </li>
            <li> I did my homework and looked at photo swatches on other websites to see what the color names were and what they look like.</li>
            <li> but it just kept coming out looking like black polish.</li>
            <li> it reminds me a lot of an oil slick.</li>
            <li> It is Emerald Green!</li>
            <li> :/ looks kinda boring but totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It has a sky blue base but rainbow holographic sparkles.</li>
            <li> I randomly chose this one</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stain your nails without a base</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wear is pretty good too.  My other color club halo chips on the first day, this one has lasted 2 and is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am someone who at most wears same polish for 5 days.  This is a beautiful glowing blue</li>
            <li> This polish is just as holographic as advertised, and goes on smooth.  ONLY ONE COAT NEEDED! I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t get much for my money, polishes usually need a few coats, but this one does not! I&#x27;ll be buying it again!</li>
            <li> This my favorite nail polish! It is exceeded my expectations :) It looks amazing in sunlight. Lasts long and no chipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt closer to being a unicorn than when I am wearing this nail polish. It is super bright and does the rainbow holographic thing in good lighting. Stays on pretty well and doesn&#x27;t chip too easily, especially with a top coat. Very pleased over all!</li>
            <li> This line of holos are awesome! I have 3 bottles and they never get old. I literally stare at my nails all day when I wear this polish. They are so pretty that I even bought one for my mom because I couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of her not having one. Definitely the most holo polish I have seen. Gorgeous. Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SHINE AND SPARKLE WHICH IS WHAT I LOOK FOR IN MY NAIL POLISH. I&#x27;VE HAD SERVERL COMMENTS ON HOW PRETTY MY NAILS ARE.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is amazing!. The holo effect is very cool. Easy to apply, staying power not the best, but still love it. Without direct sunlight it&#x27;s just very pastel bluish silver color, hard to describe, but very pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought blue heaven and beyond for my daughter this is a pic of blue heaven. This polish goes on smooth and drys fast. You do need two coats to get the coverage shown in the pics. You do want a good chip resistant top coat or this polish will chip within a few days on fingers. Like most polish it stays on forever on toes.I like the color of blue heaven it is a nice rainbow holo polish. She gets tons of compliments and people asking what is it when she wears it. Beyond is more of a black rainbow it reminds me a lot of an oil slick. It goes on snooth and drus fast. The rainbow effect is best in sunlight for this color. I did try to take pics but it just kept coming out looking like black polish. I give both polishes 4 stars for color and 3 for staying power.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone and she likes it.</li>
            <li> I got the Angel Kiss holo and I love it! Takes about 2-3 coats for an awesome manicure. Looks awesome in sunlight and indoor lighting. Polish was quick to dry and doesn&#x27;t seem to be chipping (I&#x27;m going on day three so far). Would recommend and I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> I was blown away by the color, exactly what the image shows.  Polish paints on and dries very easily and smooth. Not a bad price and worth every penny. Really beautiful.</li>
            <li> This polish is pretty cool. It looks like regular silver indoors but in natural sunlight/flash photo it looks more like a hologram. Very cool!</li>
            <li> I got this and one other color as a gift for my sister&#x27;s 15th birthday.  She seemed to really like them and still wears them from time to time.  The rainbow shows through in the light but isn&#x27;t super &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented. After two coats this nail polish is an amazing holographic</li>
            <li> This nail polish is fabulous!! Delivered in 2 days!! Will be ordering more colors!</li>
            <li> VERY shiny and holographic.  Best results in the sunshine.  It stayed on my nails twice as long as other polishes (8 days vs 4 days).  Happy I bought this color.</li>
            <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this polish, and have to buy more colors....easily my favorite polish. The holographic effect is stunning and strong. The formula is flawless. Dries fast, two coats gives the best coverage. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> after 4 days! still no chip its amazing i love it</li>
            <li> definitely holographic but only in light :/ looks kinda boring but totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the most gorgeous holographic polish I&#x27;ve ever owned. It has a sky blue base but rainbow holographic sparkles. To die for!</li>
            <li> Super easy, smooth, self-balancing application. Coverage is almost full on the first coat. Great bluish-green hue with plenty of holo effects. I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I got on this color. Can&#x27;t wait to find a reason to wear it again!</li>
            <li> Amazing and pretty. You won&#x27;t regret getting it. I think any color would be great. I randomly chose this one and I love it. Great formula, great coverage with one application. and perfect holo!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is amazing. Though the holographic detail isn&#x27;t the best in poor lighting, in the sunlight and in great lighting, it looks awesome. The color when it isn&#x27;t being holographic is still really nice. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely dazzling in direct sunlight! I get compliments nearly every time I wear it outdoors. It&#x27;s super iridescent but in indirect light it&#x27;s really nice and a soft color with a really subtle rainbow effect.</li>
            <li> Chipped very easily, even with an undercoat and topcoat.  I would have loved to give this five stars but it lasted only a couple of days before I have to change it.</li>
            <li> This bottle of polish started my ongoing love affair with holo polish. It is such a gorgeous super holo color and after buying it I had to buy every color available. It does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> This holographic nail polish is some of the prettiest polish I&#x27;ve ever come across. In regular lighting you can see the holographic effect a little and it&#x27;s pretty unimpressive in shade or dark lighting. But in the sun... You better put on those sunglasses or you&#x27;ll go blind! The rainbow holo is even more beautiful and impressive in person than the pictures show. Be prepared to spend a lot of time staring at your nails with this polish on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own OPI DS Signature. I splurged and paid $25 for that polish, and I love it. This much less expensive color club polish is equally impressive at a much lower price. They both apply smoothly and take 2-3 coats to reach opacity. They are both a dream to apply (not so for most holographic polishes). This polish with seche vite top coat lasts me 4-5 days, but I am really hard on my nails. Some top coats change the appearance and brightness of the holo, seche vite doesn&#x27;t though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star for the description on amazon because it is so misleading! The bottles pictured and colors described don&#x27;t seem to match up with the actual product. I did my homework and looked at photo swatches on other websites to see what the color names were and what they look like. The polishes I received based on the product name (ex. Cloud Nine) were correct. So ignore the picture and color they list on here and order based off of the product name at the end of the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These polishes are a fantastic linear holo. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my mother- the color(s) are/is very flattering on her. Doesn&#x27;t stain your nails without a base coat- a big plus. It also last a decent amount of time too (also without a base/top coat.) Giving this 5 stars, unless something happens...</li>
            <li> This is such a fun color. It&#x27;s shiny, but is not so obvious that I feel like a child playing dress-up when I wear it. The polish itself is a great consistency offering one coat coverage.</li>
            <li> I also bought  Color Club Holographic Halo Hues Collection (979 Blue Heaven)  and they are almost identical. The online pictures made them look different. I still love the color but would not have bought two that looked so much alike.</li>
            <li> The colors that flash are so beautiful ...blue-green..and more!very nice formula goes on  nice.and smooth..no streaks,drys fast. I want all the colors !</li>
            <li> beautiful color, with so much rainbow! it&#x27;s the perfect silvery holo with amazing rainbow shimmers in the sunlight. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Shipping was on time and the package was carefully wrapped. I did some nail art with this color and I got so many compliments! I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my nails when I had this color on.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color and the holographic effect is awesome. This photo makes it look a lot lighter than the actual color though, it goes on darker, a more saturated blue.</li>
            <li> Love this polish!!!! It arrived early too which was really exciting because I really could not wait to use it!</li>
            <li> Amazing and beautiful. :) I&#x27;ve been wearing this polish for 3 days now and they are surprisingly holding strong. No chips or scratches, yet. When in the right light they have a rainbow affect. Very pretty!!! My 3 and 6 year daughters also love this nailpolish. Great brand and okay price. You get what you pay for - GREAT nailpolish. I will be buying more, in the other colors. :-)</li>
            <li> It is Emerald Green! I would have never bought it, if I would have known that, but lo and and behold it looks stunning! I am amazed, that stuff is GREAT. It goes on smooth and it has tiny silver glitter in it, so it looks fabulously rich. Just one coat is all it took (with under coat of Nutra Nail with Green Tea and top coat Sally Hansen Insta-Dri). In the sun rainbows dance on it, wow! And the color is cool, so it will perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear and I just love the variety of colors this brand offers! Will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li> My niece was wearing this Angel Kiss shade of  this Halographic Hues series and I HAD to have it!.  I knew my granddaughter would love it!  I bought three shades for her birthday and she was very pleased!  The colors are beautiful!  I&#x27;d encourage you to try the &#x27;Harp On It&#x27;.  It&#x27;s the most beautiful silver I&#x27;ve ever seen, a light hint of silver with a sheen but not too much!  I also ordered the &#x27;Cloud Nine&#x27; but I have not seen it on her.  I hope that it&#x27;s the color pink that I&#x27;d hoped it would be.  The only problem with ordering it online is that there are no images of nails that have the polish on them so you can look at it up close.  The fact that the shipping was free was a great enticement to buy several!</li>
            <li> I am now such a hugh fan of Color Club!!! I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.Will definately be purchasing 2013 halo hues collection.</li>
            <li> This color is very nice, definitely looks better in sunlight than it does indoors, but still nice, as with the other holographic nail polishes it does chip very easily.</li>
