            <li>Peter Thomas Roth has the best cosmetic products in the market.</li>
            <li>I have tried many liners, and none like this one!!!  </li>
            <li>should make good because they ccarry and stock the product</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>It is a very nice liner , you will find it easily to use .</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The price is ok too.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Had to tug &amp; pull on this to get it on, Should have known to stick with a pencil for better coverage</li>
            <li>The more you push, the more liquid you get - like paint pens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Item, Very Recommended,</li>
            <li>I have used this brand before and loved it, but I really got ripped off this time.</li>
            <li>The comb makes application easy and even.</li>
            <li>made it really easy to manage precision lining or designer cat-eye lining for performance make-up</li>
            <li>I made sure my skin was clean and</li>
            <li>I love this applicator because the tip easily gets right in between my lashes.</li>
            <li>I like a light touch</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply, stays on all day, and it does make your lashes grow longer and fuller.  </li>
            <li>excited to try when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this item, and used it immediately upon receipt.  </li>
            <li>I only tried the one vial this morning, but decided although it was a good idea</li>
            <li>First liner I have been able to apply decently.</li>
            <li>I lined one eye and thought it looked really good, but when I attempted to line the other eye</li>
            <li>This one is also great because it&#x27;s a beautifully deep, rich black color, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is my first eye liner.  </li>
            <li>Works good at first but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>There are none of those fibers some mascaras have, which I really dislike.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it didn&#x27;t have the impact on my lashes that I expected, the felt tip and fine point</li>
            <li>Other eyeliners are not as precise as this and it stays on all day</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps the products were old and drying out, but there was no date on either box.  </li>
            <li>What a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li>This one however dried up faster than most other purchases of same one.</li>

            <li> This one however dried up faster than most other purchases of same one.</li>
            <li> : In order to get the right flow of liquid you need to tap the tip against a hard object.</li>
            <li> so the point is flat.&lt;br /&gt;Apply it on/under the lash line, directly at the root/base of the lashes and use your other liner above the lashes.</li>
            <li> shook it several times but the liner was completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I noticed one day that my lashes were sparse and not lush anymore</li>
            <li> The mascara stays on and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes break or dry out or pull out.</li>
            <li> the liner was dry  </li>
            <li> Does take a moment to dry.</li>
            <li> So, I closed the cap  </li>
            <li> get a harder or thicker line, cut the tip</li>
            <li> it was if the container was empty.  </li>
            <li> When I went to line the other eye</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to do that with other eyeliners, especially pencils and brushes.</li>
            <li> but it was dried out.</li>
            <li> I bought this and have used it off and on for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> it was not a good choice</li>
            <li> It can be applied as thin as you want or thicker depending on the tilt of your hand.  </li>
            <li> If you want a heavier line then I could see it may be a bit frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> worst product and expensive</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, but am grateful for Amazon&#x27;s return policy.</li>

            <li> Super easy to apply, stays on all day, and it does make your lashes grow longer and fuller.  I LOVE it.  Just bought my second tube.</li>
            <li> Had to tug &amp; pull on this to get it on, Should have known to stick with a pencil for better coverage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still struggling as to why the product was discontinued&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to find - it&#x27;s no longer supplied by Ulta or Sephora&lt;br /&gt;While it didn&#x27;t have the impact on my lashes that I expected, the felt tip and fine point made it really easy to manage precision lining or designer cat-eye lining for performance make-up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for about a year. The reason I&#x27;m writing this review now is because I stopped using it about a month ago in a makeup style change. I noticed one day that my lashes were sparse and not lush anymore but I couldn&#x27;t figure out why. I thought it was a change in vitamins or something because I never remembered thinking that the liner was working.  The liner works and now that I see my lashes with out it I hope PTH makes it forever.&lt;br /&gt;Tips: In order to get the right flow of liquid you need to tap the tip against a hard object. The more you push, the more liquid you get - like paint pens.&lt;br /&gt;To get a harder or thicker line, cut the tip so the point is flat.&lt;br /&gt;Apply it on/under the lash line, directly at the root/base of the lashes and use your other liner above the lashes.</li>
            <li> This never even worked. I tried everything but it was dried out. What a huge waste of money! I have used this brand before and loved it, but I really got ripped off this time.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this item, and used it immediately upon receipt.  I lined one eye and thought it looked really good, but when I attempted to line the other eye it was if the container was empty.  I lined and lined, but to no avail, just skimpy, missed sections of liner.  I received two liners and tried the second vial, which would not line well either.  I rolled both containers between my palms, and shook them to mix well, but could not get it to line well.  I made sure my skin was clean and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to let the containers settle overnight and tried again this morning, but same skimmpy, skipped results.  I only tried the one vial this morning, but decided although it was a good idea it was not a good choice so am returning the products for a refund.  I thought perhaps the products were old and drying out, but there was no date on either box.  Very disappointed, but am grateful for Amazon&#x27;s return policy.</li>

            <li> Great Item, Very Recommended,</li>
            <li> First liner I have been able to apply decently. Does take a moment to dry. I have reapplied later in the day on occasion. I would order again</li>
            <li> This is my first eye liner.  The consistency of the flow is a plus. Through experimenting I have gained the look that I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this and have used it off and on for a few weeks. It looks like it is running out of eyeliner. I like the way it went on when i fist got it.  Never used up any eyeliner in my lifetime.</li>
