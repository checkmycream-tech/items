            <li>Great make up case!</li>

            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping Amazon&#x27;s great return policy kicks in!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a sturdy case love how it looks and feels!!!</li>
            <li>great for keeping my nail polish and supplies organized.</li>
            <li>Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t 100% happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is very nice.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this case for my comsetics.</li>
            <li>and I think she will LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>While we thought this was a perfect make-up case for my daughter&#x27;s first season of competition dance, it&#x27;s not making it out of the door.  </li>
            <li>I really love this for my makeup! ,..</li>
            <li>I paid almost $50 bucks for this and was expecting something really nice to hold together for years to come.  </li>
            <li>The interior is nicely velvet lined.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my Makeup loving friend, for her 40th birthday.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my 15 year old to tote all her dance make-up to competitions</li>
            <li>I had just organized my makeup, which was very light, into the case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning this because I have no use for it and surely won&#x27;t give this as a gift....</li>
            <li>I think she&#x27;ll mostly use it for jewelry.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY Recommend this case!!!!</li>
            <li>I seriously LOVE this soooo much!</li>
            <li>It holds all my make up &amp; has so much room that now I need to go buy more make up to fill it</li>
            <li>Once I put anything in the case, and it was far from filled, the handle pops off the top.</li>
            <li>The trays pull out with no trouble and the bottom has a great amount of space to store bigger items.</li>
            <li>I never knew I had so much makeup, and still have space for more.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>The only problem is that after 2 months of use, the bottom of the case came apart from the top and there is no way to fix it</li>
            <li>I finally found something big enough for all of my makeup, This is Great!</li>
            <li>It is heavy-duty enough for me to travel with, but I mostly store it under my sink to keep my bathroom organized.</li>
            <li>Verticle edges of the body of the case, below the top portion that opens, are not riveted together or not riveted together properly.</li>
            <li>Decently made and worth the money.</li>
            <li>This has panels that open, making organization easy.</li>
            <li>A fairly large box for cosmetics or jewelry, etc.</li>
            <li>Large &amp; sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really do wish that it was just a little bit bigger, but very satisfied! ,ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>There is so much room</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely would recommend.</li>
            <li>I really like this make-up case.</li>
            <li>So I am here to say that I VERY displeased with the product.</li>
            <li>Looking at the photo, the right front edge and the right back edge &amp;#34;spines&amp;#34; do not hold the box together.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected, thank you!</li>
            <li>They would&#x27;ve been better off to have a couple of the shelves a little longer for these things.</li>
            <li>Holds nearly all of my makeup and makes organization a breeze!</li>
            <li>This thing completely fell apart within a month.  </li>
            <li>Thats the description of this box and on top of that I&#x27;m missing 4 screws or solder to hold the smaller drawer ..</li>
            <li>The individual boxes inside that fold up are too small to accommodate most makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It cannot be fixed without damaging the inner lining.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very roomy and just about what I expected.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing a new case with a different style handle to avoid this problem with my second purchase.</li>
            <li>The case is large and can hold a large amount of makeup however the handle is attached quite poorly.</li>

            <li> This thing completely fell apart within a month.  We have tried to fix it and it just keeps falling a part.  I paid almost $50 bucks for this and was expecting something really nice to hold together for years to come.  It&#x27;s been five months and I&#x27;m so sick of trying to keep it held together that it&#x27;s going in the trash.  I am not happy and I would NEVER, EVER purchase this piece of garbage again. VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS. I&#x27;ve had this case for maybe 3 months and when I went to pull it out of my cabinet the entire bottom portion came off and broke some of my make up cases and powders. Awful quality.</li>
            <li> Flimsy at best Thats the description of this box and on top of that I&#x27;m missing 4 screws or solder to hold the smaller drawer .. The first picture shows that the small drawers are loose The second picture shows the loose solder or screws at the bottom ... I&#x27;m returning this because I have no use for it and surely won&#x27;t give this as a gift....</li>
            <li> Better than expected, thank you!</li>

            <li> Great make up case! I use this case when I travel since I like to keep all my make up organized. Decently made and worth the money. The trays pull out with no trouble and the bottom has a great amount of space to store bigger items.</li>

            <li> I really like this make-up case. It holds my everyday make-up, jewelry, and hair products.

            <li> great for keeping my nail polish and supplies organized.</li>
            <li> Large &amp; sturdy. This has panels that open, making organization easy. Perfect for my 15 year old to tote all her dance make-up to competitions</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected. Plenty of space for makeup storage! Great quality for the price. Same quality as a $50-60 dollar train case from makeup stores!</li>
            <li> I just got done crying about how this case has the most awful craftsmanship. I had just organized my makeup, which was very light, into the case. I was headed out the door for work, and as I picked up the case it literally fell apart at every seam, my very expensive makeup crashing and breaking onto the hard tile floor at my feet. None the less, I&#x27;ve got to figure out how to get reimbursed for not only the Beautify Cosmetics by Designer Habitat Ltd. case, but for my makeup that had broken as well. So I am here to say that I VERY displeased with the product.</li>
            <li> It had some scratches on it and some bumps in the metal..It was a gift, so I didn&#x27;t say anything or point them out to the receiver.  I know it will get bumped and scratched as she uses it anyway...just wasn&#x27;t 100% happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is very nice.  I bought it as a gift for my Makeup loving friend, for her 40th birthday.  She wanted something like this and I think she will LOVE it!  Can&#x27;t wait to see her face when she opens her present!</li>
            <li> The individual boxes inside that fold up are too small to accommodate most makeup brushes. They would&#x27;ve been better off to have a couple of the shelves a little longer for these things.</li>
            <li> While we thought this was a perfect make-up case for my daughter&#x27;s first season of competition dance, it&#x27;s not making it out of the door.  Defective or ill put together!
