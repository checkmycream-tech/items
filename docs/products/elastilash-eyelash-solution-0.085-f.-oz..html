            <li>Highly recommend this product !!!!</li>
            <li>I am so happy that my eyelashes grew back so quickly.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with Obaji from working in a dermatology/facial aesthetics office</li>
            <li>make sure you uset consistently for maximum results.</li>
            <li>Thanks Obagi :)</li>
            <li>Quick review.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t touch it anywhere but clean eye lids and see the great results in a few days!</li>
            <li>i really didn&#x27;t expect huge results in a month&#x27;s time; but i did expect some hope.  </li>
            <li>I only bought it originally because it had more of the ingredient that is suppose to really enhance your eyelashes than Rapidlash had.</li>
            <li>So far not seeing huge change.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still growing ;-)</li>
            <li>And THANKS!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this product to have some of that back.</li>
            <li>At this point they aren&#x27;t any longer but as with the Latisse it took a minimum of 6 weeks of consistent use.  </li>
            <li>I use many different Obagi products.  </li>
            <li>Still it is a great product but you must use it at least 10-14 days consistently before seeing any results.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>Product really works!  </li>
            <li>I used this product consistently for 3 months.</li>
            <li>good alternative to the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>I really cant say much about this as I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to notice any great difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 years and it has helped my eyelashes stay long and healthy.</li>
            <li>Now, for the first time in my life, really.</li>
            <li>I have found it works as good as any other professional, including prescription products that I have also used.</li>
            <li>I get them fast.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for Latise type results, but did not see much -</li>
            <li>Eyelashes were getting very sparse.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>However, this one did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to see some type of grow or improvement with ElastiLash.  </li>
            <li>It works to lengthen lashes but not so much thicken.</li>
            <li>Would really like to find something that DID work.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I buy this product, to be honest I haven´t perceived larger eyelashes or an increase in quantity but what I really can say is that I haven´t seen any eyelash fallen since I´m buying this product which for me is a lot, so I believe that it increases the strength of them.</li>
            <li>and frankly, I really don&#x27;t see my lash&#x27;s getting any thicker.  </li>
            <li>One of the ingredients of the product (probably the real one and this questionably real one) is BORIC ACID.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from aprilbeautyshop (the main seller on this page) and the product made my lashes fall out.</li>
            <li>Product was old!!</li>
            <li>I will add to the post in a few more weeks with an update.  </li>
            <li>No, it din&#x27;t give me super long lashes, but it gave me fuller lashes.  </li>
            <li>Three years old is too old, can&#x27;t really tell if it works or not</li>
            <li>I should have only purchase one not two and tested first.</li>
            <li>This product works better than the more expensive brands I have been using the others for several years.</li>
            <li>I had used a different product---and ElastiLash has a much better applicator brush as it &#x27;s a little thicker so</li>
            <li>I used this for about a week and didn&#x27;t see any results...where the other Rapidlash was noticable fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for about 3-4 months, but I really can&#x27;t tell the different.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and like my mom, her mom, etc......</li>
            <li>Eyelids have been fixed and this product helped me regrow my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for me, would not waste my money again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping and looking forward to seeing some development in the near future.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that this product actually worked.  </li>

            <li> Eyelids have been fixed and this product helped me regrow my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, would not waste my money again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping and looking forward to seeing some development in the near future.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that this product actually worked.  </li>
            <li> The one positive thing I can say is that at least it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red!</li>
            <li> This works just as well as the more expensive one that you can only get in a dr&#x27;s office and doesn&#x27;t make my eye lids pink &amp; dry like the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> I had long lashes, but I was looking for volume, and this product did that for me.  </li>
            <li> I will keep on using it, I think it should be used for a long time to see the results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or make them red like other Rx stuff did.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were short due to eyelids hanging over them.  </li>
            <li> They are not super long, but they are thick and pretty long.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ONLY BEEN USING THIS FOR A FEW DAYS AND CAN ALREADY SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE!!!</li>
            <li> I have used other more and less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Although I have seen some level of eyelash growth over the past 6 weeks, I have used another product that was more expensive (~$80)</li>
            <li> well, its not really a matter of hating the product.  </li>
            <li> I was a Latisse user before but got tired of spending so much money.  </li>
            <li> Takes a few weeks and you must use daily</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected and won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks the broken eyelashes had completely grown back.  </li>
            <li> I love their face kit, but I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve used make your lashes longer</li>
            <li> i can compare it to one other product i used in the past; and this one showed absolutely no improvement.</li>
            <li> according to the doctor, this can be used twice a day since it is not very strong.  </li>
            <li> like that it costs a lot less than Latisse.  </li>
            <li> I have less loss</li>
            <li> and I do wonder about the authenticity of the product at the price, which they claim is \\&quot;half the retail price\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Previously I used Rapidlash.  </li>
            <li> I always had fairly long lashes, but as I&#x27;ve aged, they seemed to thin and shorten, not to mention lose color.  </li>
            <li> This is the second lash serum I have tried, base on positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Got tired of the red itchy eyelids.</li>
            <li> Not cheap</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, it looked as if my eyelashes were thicker.  </li>
            <li> Last year, I used latisse and saw dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really sure that it&#x27;s helped.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the result yet ...</li>
            <li> I have tried Latise in the past.</li>
            <li> Maybe my lashes grew or got thicker, sometimes I think they did, but I am just not sure.</li>
            <li> Usually I like the Obagi products, but this is a failure.</li>
            <li> I could have spent that money on a lifetime supply of fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least two months now</li>
            <li> When i get the boxes i was not sure ...the boxes was not seal!</li>
            <li> I was still not sure !!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t buy some $15 crap at the local store.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elastilash for approximately 4 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> When I apply mascara it almost looks like I have false eyelashes on.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the dramatic results I have seen with Rapidlash which I have been using before ordering this one.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 23 days now &amp; have noticed a very subtle lash growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse, which is expensive, but it didn&#x27;t give me what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I can fake length with mascara, but I can&#x27;t fake volume.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to say which one is making my lashes longer.</li>
            <li> I saw no  improvement in my sparce lashes...not too expensive but won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> But just like to say: I am sorry!</li>

            <li> It seemed to make a difference in lash thickness over time, but I couldn&#x27;t deal with the itchy, red eyes that came with its use.</li>
            <li> well, its not really a matter of hating the product.  it simply did nothing. i really didn&#x27;t expect huge results in a month&#x27;s time; but i did expect some hope.  i can compare it to one other product i used in the past; and this one showed absolutely no improvement. very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 23 days now &amp; have noticed a very subtle lash growth. i will continue to use it for another 2 weeks .</li>
            <li> Gimmic product.  I used this product just like it instructed.  I&#x27;ve been taking vitamins (Biotin)as well to help with growing hair.  I still have the same eight, short eyelashes I started off with.  Obagi is a usually a great product.  That&#x27;s why I went online to find it and I didn&#x27;t buy some $15 crap at the local store. I love their face kit, but I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. There have been no results.  3 months later... nothing.  I could have spent that money on a lifetime supply of fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> i have been using this now for 6 weeks and I see nothing happening. Do not waist your money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse, which is expensive, but it didn&#x27;t give me what I needed.  I had long lashes, but I was looking for volume, and this product did that for me.  I can fake length with mascara, but I can&#x27;t fake volume.  No, it din&#x27;t give me super long lashes, but it gave me fuller lashes.  If only I could find a product that will give me these results for the hair on my head!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it costs a lot less than Latisse.  I can purchase at any time and don&#x27;t need a prescription or to purchase from a doctor.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with Obaji from working in a dermatology/facial aesthetics office so I thought I&#x27;d try the eye lash serum. I have used other more and less expensive brands. This works just as well as the more expensive one that you can only get in a dr&#x27;s office and doesn&#x27;t make my eye lids pink &amp; dry like the cheaper brands. I like this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I liked the results so much I just ordered another tube.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or make them red like other Rx stuff did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ElastiLash for 1 year now.  I am so happy with my eyelashes, they are longer and more plentiful.  I have less loss (I don&#x27;t find eylashes laying on my cheeks). However, unlike women I know who use Latisse, they are not darker, but neither are my eyelids. When I apply mascara it almost looks like I have false eyelashes on.  I&#x27;ve had plenty of comments about my lashes from men and women. PS - I&#x27;m over 60 and they&#x27;re still growing ;-)</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to save money. Who has 125 to use on lashes per month? Not me. What a rip off.  This stuff was 38.00 instead. So far not seeing huge change.</li>
            <li> This is the second lash serum I have tried, base on positive reviews. The one positive thing I can say is that at least it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red! I&#x27;ve been using this for at least two months now and I&#x27;m not really sure that it&#x27;s helped. I am also using a great mascara by L&#x27;Oreal that I just love so it&#x27;s difficult to say which one is making my lashes longer. At any rate, this product is just &amp;#34;OK.&amp;#34; I think I&#x27;ll try a different one now.</li>
            <li> I order 2 of ElastiLash Solution from this seller may 18. I get them fast. When i get the boxes i was not sure ...the boxes was not seal! I contact the seller and ask WHY ? they answer Obagi pack them like this. I was still not sure !! I call different seller and found out ..it is truth. Not sure about the result yet ... But just like to say: I am sorry! And THANKS! Use for 2 years Lattise ..and after VitaLash ...I have the feeling this product is good! The price is great !! Let me use it for a month and i will be sure if my feeling is right! Thank you again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.p&lt;br /&gt;Yes .....it is a Great product!&lt;br /&gt;i use it 10 days and noticed the different! If i can give 5 more stars i will! I recommend the product to everyone ! And i compare with Latisse and VitaLash (great products too)!But for sure i will buy this one again ..the results are fantastic and the price the best . I will buy again from this seller. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Did not improve thickness at all</li>
            <li> I have not seen any change since I started using this a couple of weeks ago.  I will give it some more time and may re-assess.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ONLY BEEN USING THIS FOR A FEW DAYS AND CAN ALREADY SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE!!! IT ARRIVED AT THE TIME THEY SAID!!!</li>
            <li> I really cant say much about this as I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to notice any great difference. Will review later on</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a month and I can say that my lashes did not change! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> My lashes are definitely longer, thicker not so noticeable.  I had used a different product---and ElastiLash has a much better applicator brush as it &#x27;s a little thicker so can see where it&#x27;s going on your eyelid.  I always had fairly long lashes, but as I&#x27;ve aged, they seemed to thin and shorten, not to mention lose color.  I love this product to have some of that back.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference after 4 weeks of using this product, lashes didn&#x27;t get longer nor did they get thicker</li>
            <li> It has only been a couple of weeks since I began using ElastiLash and I have not noticed a change yet. I will continue to use it till it is all gone to see if there is an improvement in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Although I have seen some level of eyelash growth over the past 6 weeks, I have used another product that was more expensive (~$80) but it was more effective than this product (LaLash).</li>
            <li> I have been using Elastilash for approximately 4 weeks now.  I was a Latisse user before but got tired of spending so much money.  I broke off some eyelashes in an eyelash curler so I decided to give this a try.  Within 2 weeks the broken eyelashes had completely grown back.  My eyelashes also appear fuller.  At this point they aren&#x27;t any longer but as with the Latisse it took a minimum of 6 weeks of consistent use.  I will add to the post in a few more weeks with an update.  At this point this is a great alternative to Latisse.  I am so happy that my eyelashes grew back so quickly.</li>
            <li> I like using this as an alternative to the more expensive prescription product. I trade off using this on off days. I know it&#x27;s working because I tried this with another product and my eyelashes started falling out.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Cause a redness around my eyes, can not use. I should have only purchase one not two and tested first.</li>
            <li> I read that this worked great.  It does not work at all. Don&#x27;t spend the money to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it months to work and never did!</li>
            <li> Product was old!! Date on it was 2010 !! Three years old is too old, can&#x27;t really tell if it works or not</li>
            <li> I have tried Latise in the past. I was hoping for Latise type results, but did not see much -</li>
            <li> this was my second order. it works more as a conditioner than enhancer. But its safe &amp; it makes my lashes fuller</li>
            <li> As a licensed Cosmetologist for 22 years and working in Dermatologist office, I have seen alot of products come and go.&lt;br /&gt;I have also witnessed allergic reactions to many of those products. I use this and serveral of our patients use it with no&lt;br /&gt;complications...just great results. Thanks Obagi :)</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were getting very sparse. Did not want to risk spending $40 a month for Latisse so tried this. It really works. Lashes are fuller. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product do over 2 years! Its comparable to latisse but way cheaper! I love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results from using this.  I absolutely love, love, love Obagi products.  I use many different Obagi products.  However, this one did absolutely nothing.  Last year, I used latisse and saw dramatic results.  But latisse is very expensive and not from Obagi.  I really wanted to see some type of grow or improvement with ElastiLash.  I&#x27;m very sad to say, I didn&#x27;t see any type of growth at all.</li>
            <li> Was shipped as intended, and timely.  I&#x27;m hoping and looking forward to seeing some development in the near future.  Although they say to apply only nightly, I occasionally apply it twice a day as another product had suggested.</li>
            <li> Used latisse for 3 years. Got tired of the red itchy eyelids. Switched to this and was concerned I would have an adjustment period with my lashes falling out but now 3+ weeks in and no problems at all. This product seems to make my lashes thicker too whereas latisse seemed to just make them longer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know whether to give this a 3 or a 4...I didn&#x27;t see the dramatic results I have seen with Rapidlash which I have been using before ordering this one.  I used this for about a week and didn&#x27;t see any results...where the other Rapidlash was noticable fairly quickly.  Just being honest here...I probably won&#x27;t buy this one again.  I only bought it originally because it had more of the ingredient that is suppose to really enhance your eyelashes than Rapidlash had.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years and it has helped my eyelashes stay long and healthy.</li>
            <li> Quick review. This product is amazing. It works to lengthen lashes but not so much thicken. Still it is a great product but you must use it at least 10-14 days consistently before seeing any results.</li>
            <li> Nothing compared to Latisse but it feels like it moisturizes my lashes. I didn&#x27;t notice any growth over 6 months of continuous application</li>
            <li> Works!&lt;br /&gt;I swear by it and I tried everything (latisse works great also but the price difference is huge)&lt;br /&gt;Good luck&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Scouts honor</li>
            <li> I love this.  Other products I&#x27;ve used make your lashes longer but this makes them fuller too.  It&#x27;s easy to use but make sure you don&#x27;t contaminate your brush.  Don&#x27;t touch it anywhere but clean eye lids and see the great results in a few days!</li>
            <li> I saw no  improvement in my sparce lashes...not too expensive but won&#x27;t be purchasing again. Would really like to find something that DID work.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy this product, to be honest I haven´t perceived larger eyelashes or an increase in quantity but what I really can say is that I haven´t seen any eyelash fallen since I´m buying this product which for me is a lot, so I believe that it increases the strength of them.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in my lashes after about a month of use. After turning 40 my lashes seemed to be falling out. I tried  this product and have been using it for about six weeks now and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about 3-4 months, but I really can&#x27;t tell the different. Maybe my lashes grew or got thicker, sometimes I think they did, but I am just not sure. No one commented on my lashes either, perhaps they are the same as before. I will keep on using it, I think it should be used for a long time to see the results.</li>
            <li> This product works better than the more expensive brands I have been using the others for several years. This has better results</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this product actually worked.  Since using it, going on 3 weeks, I can see the results  already. My eyelashes are noticeable thicker.</li>
            <li> I am a skeptic at heart, however, after only 2 weeks, I began to wonder if I was seeing fuller/longer lashes.  1 week later, I&#x27;m convinced!  I wish I had taken before photos.  I purchased this as my stash, so that I won&#x27;t ever run out.  When I start using it, I&#x27;ll order another.</li>
            <li> I had terrible eyelashes. I am 51 years old and like my mom, her mom, etc...... Our eyelashes thinned out. They were short and sparse to begin with. Now, for the first time in my life, really. I have eyelashes! They are not super long, but they are thick and pretty long. I love this product and will keep buying it! Be patient though. This is not an overnight thing. It took about 3 months of putting product on twice a day.</li>
            <li> This product works every bit as good as Latisse...without the drying effects. My eyelashes are are longer, fuller and darker than they were a month ago!</li>
            <li> I didnt see any results, But it just may be me. May do the job for others. Not cheap so was disapointed</li>
            <li> according to the doctor, this can be used twice a day since it is not very strong.  It does work though.</li>
            <li> I use to use the prescription product Latisse at a cost of $117.00 and I decided to try this product for both eyelashes and eyebrows and it works well as good as the prescription product</li>
            <li> This really works!  I am hooked for life!!! Give it a couple months &amp; you will see the difference!!! I am totally satisfied! Highly recommend this product !!!! I will buy more as I need them!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product faithfully now for almost 3 months and frankly, I really don&#x27;t see my lash&#x27;s getting any thicker.  Perhaps I&#x27;m not using it correctly?  Use it twice a day.....</li>
            <li> Product really works!  Within a few weeks, it looked as if my eyelashes were thicker.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li> good product that&#x27;s affordable. make sure you uset consistently for maximum results. good alternative to the more expensive brands.  I would suggest buying 2&#x27;@ a time that why u never run out!</li>
            <li> I only was using for a week but i know its really works by comments of friends, and was a great service</li>
            <li> I am using it for almost 3 weeks, but I have not noticed any changes to my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it and hopefully my lashes will improve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last several months and have not noticed a change in my eyelashes what so ever.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than a year and I have very nice eyelashes now.  My eyelashes were short due to eyelids hanging over them.  Eyelids have been fixed and this product helped me regrow my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I used this product consistently for 3 months. I&#x27;d apply at nighttime before bed. I had no growth. I am now going to try Grandelash. Hopefully it works better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month, have seen no difference in my lashes!  Would not recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> does not work like rapid lash</li>
            <li> For the price, it is great. I have found it works as good as any other professional, including prescription products that I have also used. Takes a few weeks and you must use daily but it works!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see a huge difference but I gave up too soon</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, would not waste my money again. Usually I like the Obagi products, but this is a failure.</li>
            <li> I bought this from aprilbeautyshop (the main seller on this page) and the product made my lashes fall out. I was losing about five a day, so I stopped before I lost all of them!!! I wasn&#x27;t having that issue before using this product (this has NEVER happened to me, so it was obviously the product) and I do wonder about the authenticity of the product at the price, which they claim is \\&quot;half the retail price\\&quot;.  They won&#x27;t refund your money if this happens to you, so if you want to keep your lashes and your money, don&#x27;t buy this!  My lashes still aren&#x27;t growing back.  One of the ingredients of the product (probably the real one and this questionably real one) is BORIC ACID.  Why would you put that on your body at all, especially at your lash roots?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks so I can&#x27;t asses it yet.  Previously I used Rapidlash.  It wasn&#x27;t what I expected and won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
