    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best face sunscreen I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Excellent stuff, reapply if you get all sweaty as it&#x27;s not one of those never comes off type of products.</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen I have found.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best not to wear this sunscreen on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All CeraVe products are wonderful.</li>
            <li>The sunblock is one of the best I have ever found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But best of all for me</li>
            <li>and I am SO HAPPY that I did!!!</li>
            <li>and it shows, probably real good for sun protection at beach or outdoor activity.</li>
            <li>Another great Cerave product!</li>
            <li>this works the best  </li>
            <li>It goes perfectly under makeup.</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion and you can see the zinc oxide sitting on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally very fair</li>
            <li>I even use at night sometimes,  as it feels good, heals and seems to improve the look of my skin!</li>
            <li>my wife is happy, and I happy</li>
            <li>Works great and does not break you out.</li>
            <li>found niacinamide does a great job at clearing up post-breakout redness</li>
            <li>/&gt;vanity,enough to want great skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I could cheer and do a jig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will be one of my favorite products for awesome face protection.</li>
            <li>Applies great and feels good.</li>
            <li>He said the best thing to do for your skin is onscreen and this is his favorite.</li>
            <li>so I might not be the best source for those who do burn easily.</li>
            <li>so I thought this sun screen would be good</li>
            <li>good thing is it does not burn when i put it on</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how good sunscreen is if you can&#x27;t use</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>and I know what is good vs</li>
            <li>I use Cerave body lotion and loved it, so I thought I&#x27;d look for a sunscreen for my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly tan, so I doubt this could be remedied without some sort of makeup combination that someone else mentioned here.</li>
            <li>So I was delighted to find this sunscreen that does not contain homosalate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned to begin with (</li>
            <li>The good is that it&#x27;s unscented (hooray)</li>
            <li>Good product and sunscreen, ex</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>The invisible zinc really is amazing.</li>
            <li>Works great for not greasy goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>and I am loving this moisturizer/sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>so I liked that this used titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (i.e., mineral sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gave it a try and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it had zinc and titanium dioxide, so we gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many \\&quot;sport\\&quot; sunscreens and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from it&#x27;s extraordinary protection form the sun, it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out very easily, and always breaks out when I use sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Nice and light!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is good for protecting your skin agains sun damage, specially if you are outdoors a lot, of if you are performing any sports.</li>
            <li>I applied it very lightly</li>
            <li>I use the cerva cleanser, pm moisturizer, and the am moisturizer and love them.</li>
            <li>I love CeraVe.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen for two reasons:  1)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t break out into a rash, but if applied more than once, I am sure that it would cause one.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I do love this show so</li>
            <li>Someone with a darker complexion might have more problems.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the lotion; however, I look like I applied a light-white face paint to my face.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you do not go into the water its ok, if you do, forget it..</li>
            <li>This sunscreen blocks most of the sun.</li>
            <li>Would be better off wallowing in mud for sun protection.</li>
            <li>I play sports in the sun every weekend sometimes for more than five hours at a time.  </li>
            <li>I will update once I have given this more than the rub in update.  </li>
            <li>My son seems to be allergic to many sunscreens when applied to his face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sure that this clogged many of my pores.</li>
            <li>I use this sunblock every day and love it.</li>
            <li>CeraVe SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion, 2 Ounce its ok</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>You will need your packaging and a receipt, but I was able to request a refund by calling 1-800-321-4576.  </li>
            <li>As many have said, it&#x27;s not invisible.</li>
            <li>The CeraVe product has a lotion consistency which I like better.</li>
            <li>i love the moisturizing cream</li>
            <li>Love that it has ceramides and niacinamides.</li>
            <li>However, many of the newer/popular sunscreens that contain Oxybenzone which is a penetration enhancer and has been proven to cause Cancer.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but with this sunscreen I&#x27;ll be much better about protecting my skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li>I am EXTREMELY PLEASED with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon (with free shipping) beats the Walmart price!</li>
            <li>I love CeraVe products and always like to have a zinc sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I feel protected with this, but it takes more effort to get it to absorb and it does not do well under makeup.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen as I thought CeraVe was a reputable</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t smooth at all!</li>
            <li>I use all kinds of their products and love the rest of them...</li>
            <li>It provides great protection from the sun and since I have melasma I need a good physical, and not chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I work in a dermatology practice and we love all Cerave products and recommend them to patients, so I thought this would be another slam dunk product.</li>
            <li>I was bummed but thought perhaps it would still be okay to use on my body just to get rid of the product</li>
            <li>I used this sunscreen directly after the painted eyebrows out more good-looking, beautiful eyebrow color.</li>
            <li>It was great on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on really nice, extremely lightweight and I feel it gives very good protection.  </li>
            <li>and therefore great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I find it more comfortable than the &amp;#34;N&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I bought mine at Right Aid and actually really liked it.</li>
            <li>I love CeraVe skin products, so I was excited when I saw this product at the drug store.</li>
            <li>I was even more excited by the &amp;#34;invisible zinc&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Overall good product if you have acne prone skin like mine!</li>
            <li>The active ingredient list looks excellent.</li>
            <li>Seems to work too, I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn, though I don&#x27;t burn easily</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Good insulation effect, high spf.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it would be fine under makeup</li>
            <li>My face was perfectly fine before I introduced this to it.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen finally does exactly what I need it to perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been fine with it.</li>
            <li>Super coverage!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s both affordable, comes with a decent amount, a high amount of SPF, and contains good ingredients!</li>
            <li>and I had huge breakouts while using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the am facial moisturizing lotion, which works great.</li>
            <li>It is great to find it regularly on Amazon-</li>
            <li>Yes but&lt;br /&gt;this is such great protection</li>
            <li>I have light treatments for a skin condition and needed this during my treatments and when I need to go out.</li>
            <li>+  by neutrogena or oxygen zone free sunscreen  </li>
            <li>Fantastic UVA and UVB protection</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair sensitive skin, and so do my kids.</li>
            <li>I bought this specifically because it was supposed to be good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was excited to buy an SPF lotion that I could carry along in my backpack</li>
            <li>I was SO excited to start using this suncscreen.</li>
            <li>I think most people who reviewed this and found the product to be not as clear as it claims have perhaps not tried many alternatives.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this since I love and enjoy just about every CeraVe product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This stuff is only good for a day at the beach or hanging out at home.</li>
            <li>I like it, its good enough for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually, if you apply a good face moisturizer before the sunscreen, it helps it rub in and minimizes the white cast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good physical sunscreen and Cerave said this one was lightweight and invisible.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and burn very easily.  </li>
            <li>As I waited for it to dry, I started to look pasty and cakey which isn&#x27;t good since my skin tone is light brown.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s nothing a quick swipe with a tissue hasn&#x27;t eliminated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what ingredient is responsible for this, but basically, when you put it on, it produces a sort of powdery white top layer that either sticks to your skin or (even better!) goes EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>We also live in one of the most hot, sunniest places in the U.S. &amp; this sunblock passes the test!</li>
            <li>It ACTUALLY makes my skin look BETTER!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels very light, and the natural skin tone blends so well with my tan</li>
            <li>I really like how light this is.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, I really like it</li>
            <li>Remember not much is needed for good coverage.</li>
            <li>only sunscreen I&#x27;ve really liked</li>
            <li>Yes, you do have to re-apply it every 80 minutes, and by lunch time, wipe off the old and apply more.  </li>
            <li>I love CeraVe because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I always laugh when I see &amp;#34;no</li>
            <li>Maybe I just don&#x27;t look good with blue skin, but I really can&#x27;t recommend this sunscreen to anybody.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely need to re-apply.</li>
            <li>It does not get absorbed by the skin but stays on top&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li>purchased the CeraVe because if it had worked, it was more readily available (in stores) than the Blue Lizard</li>
            <li>/&gt;After this very positive experience with the product that she had purchased from the Walgreens</li>
            <li>The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li>It does leave your face kind of white if you apply too much of it.</li>
            <li>This is the first sunscreen that works and keeps me from getting dermatitis on my skin</li>
            <li>To help spread it on my skin easier, I first moisturize it, and then it goes on with no problems.</li>
            <li>Should have read Amazon&#x27;s comments here first.  </li>
            <li>I love this face sunscreen and use it daily as part of my makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I expected a really nice product from CeraVe, and believed the box that reads &amp;#34;Invisible&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I rubbed it in some more and let it sit for about ten minutes.</li>
            <li>I love Cerave&#x27;s moisturizing lotion, but I cannot say the same for this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The result is a more white complexion almost like mime.</li>
            <li>I wear it religiously and I will continue to trust this brand over many of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t totally mind since I wear makeup over this, but it&#x27;s still something negatively notable from something that claims for the zinc to be invisible.</li>
            <li>Try using another moisturizer first like coconut oil or CereVe moisturizing lotion when you get out of the shower or wash your face and then rub this in.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had looked at amazon reviews first as I would have saved myself some money .</li>
            <li>first time to order this product but delivery was as promised and product works well...</li>
            <li>But it is this exact product.</li>
            <li>This sounded perfect, but sadly it is neither of those things.  </li>
            <li>I bought CeraVe SPF 50 for our most recent beach vacation.  </li>
            <li>Wears really well under my makeup and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews with so many people saying that it&#x27;s not invisible and leaves a white film but tried it anyway.</li>
            <li>Makes you makeup look funny</li>
            <li>California has very consistant cloudless skies, so its easy to compare.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel of this initially but my sensitive skin started feeling hot and burny from it within about 15 minutes of putting it on and I wasn&#x27;t even in the sun yet.  </li>
            <li>CeraVe SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion is a great sunscreen for your face that feels nice on, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and doesn&#x27;t run in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>It left a surprisingly white cast for something termed &amp;#34;InVisibleZinc&amp;#34; and even on my fair skin it was noticeable.</li>
            <li>I should note, if I&#x27;m going to the beach or doing anything that requires what I would consider more intense sunscreen needs, I use a stronger and different sunscreen that also has water/sweatproofing and just deal with the breakout or smell.</li>
            <li>oil free lotion broad spectrum 70</li>
            <li>On a mildly positive note, it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect how my makeup wears.</li>
            <li>Even though I applied a chemical based sunscreen faithfully on my neck, EVERY time my neck was exposed to the sun it felt like someone was holding a hot hair dryer an inch from my skin, and the itching would intensify so much that I&#x27;d wake up with rake lines on my neck where I was scratching as I slept.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super sensitive to fragrances and perfumes and have no problems with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It is not a  lightweight formula and it does not spreads easily, when it dries it does with a white finish.  </li>
            <li>However this sunscreen does have a different strong chemical smell which I did not like at all.</li>
            <li>It certainly can and will if you splat a bunch in your palm and just smear it on.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; has the consistency of something you&#x27;d fill holes in your wall, goes on your skin with residue and crumbly left-overs, and turns your skin pasty white (and I am already rather light skinned).</li>
            <li>Very drying - almost to a powder consistency.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper on here than in the stores.</li>
            <li>The zinc in this sunscreen is really helpful for balancing out my skin&#x27;s pH level and helping regulate breakouts.</li>
            <li>Overall, there was nothing fantastic about this</li>
            <li>No matter the amount or attempts to smooth over my skin, the lotion appears very white.</li>
            <li>I absolutely need to use this all over my face, and I look like I&#x27;ve put baby powder on.</li>
            <li>As an invisible sunscreen--not so much.</li>
            <li>no matter how much you spread and rub.  </li>
            <li>As a person with dermatology problems, I find I&#x27;m being very well protected from harmful cancer causing sun rays.</li>
            <li>We also are very acne prone.</li>
            <li>But it absolutely does not absorb into my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful for a sunscreen I can use, since I have a history of skin cancer.</li>
            <li>What I normally do, however, is mix it with my foundation in the palm of my hand first</li>
            <li>And I really just couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>it looked like I was wearing eye shadow - that&#x27;s how much it lightened the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care so much.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended I get an oil free physical (as opposed to chemical) sunscreen for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>A pea sized amount covers my whole face.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely NO greasy feeling and no nasty smell.</li>
            <li>The thicker glide on sunscreen stick they sell didn&#x27;t (chemical) burn me quite as much</li>
            <li>I was really amped to try this when I saw it at the store.</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s good for entertainment purposes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wonder if the people who say the white color blends away are not really getting a good close look at their face.  </li>
            <li>A slight, white-ish cast is a small price for excellent sun protection.</li>
            <li>It has a slight white layer, but with fair skin ( and rosacea)</li>
            <li>Disappointing product, and nothing like the Cerave AM facial moisturizer so many of  us love and use!!</li>
            <li>This cerave is spf 50, so I should be getting much more protection, but I got way less.  </li>
            <li>A much better product at half the price is Coppertone Oilfree faces 50SPF.</li>
            <li>i love it because my face tends to get red and with this you cant tell my face is red in the heat</li>
            <li>Guess I will continue with traditional sunscreens over my daily moisturizer until I find something better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Clinique&#x27;s Super City Block that has both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (the main ingredients of &#x27;physical&#x27; sunblocks) and it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a ghost face, so I&#x27;d recommend that over this.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is by far better for skin absorption than any other alternative I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and pasty, glops up in hairline and brows, sits heavily on top of the skin, and leaves a strong white cast.  </li>
            <li>effective but goes on a bit while hard toapply make up over</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my sensitive skin, and that&#x27;s what I need.</li>
            <li>Unless your okay with having a paper white face which does eventually fade (not completely) then go ahead &amp; purchase.</li>
            <li>But it works better than the chemical sunblocks (it is titanium and zinc, natural elements which make an actual physical barrier to sun)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it around the entire day, and no matter what I try to apply on top, no matter how long I wait before applying make up, or after applying moisturizer, 5 minutes after moisturizer,</li>
            <li>spend the money on another TERRIFIC product which so far I have only been able to purchase on Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li>I bought this product with high hopes, since all the other Cerave products I have used have been truly fantastic.  </li>
            <li>bought this at WalMart wanting to try out a different sunscreen with zinc oxide without the standard strong smell.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, most of it came off with soap and water, but that&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that sunscreen helps that much, but it certainly has protected my skin from the abuse I can put it thru somedays being outside in the sun all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky that my skin is pretty much white either way, so it only shows near my brows and hairline</li>
            <li>This stuff, however, takes it to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be without Cerave PM moisturizer and Cerave hydrating cleanser, so I was eagerly awaiting their new sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I put some on my face, arms, and legs, and even with giving it a few minutes to dry, it very quickly ended up all over my shorts, shirtsleeves, and in fact the entire top of my shirt from the collarbones up.</li>
            <li>I am very tan and as much as I tried to rub it in I was white as a ghost and my friends told me I looked ashy!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I also have rosacea</li>
            <li>the white wasn&#x27;t as strong but still there &amp; still rolled when rubbed too long.</li>
            <li>or you can look pretty white.</li>
            <li>This goes on my face first before any makeup; I prefer to use this as a primer instead of Urban Decay&#x27;s face primer!</li>
            <li>But the problem, like many other people have said, is that it&#x27;s too white and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t mind it, as it&#x27;s a reasonable tradeoff for ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate my eyes and skin.</li>
            <li>Just one more reviewer letting you know that this product leaves your face a white, white, white that doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this CeraVe sunscreen a try after discovering that the store was out of my usual Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free SPF50.</li>
            <li>It would have been funny if I hadn&#x27;t spent so much money on this</li>
            <li>I could see exactly where it was because of the white residue, but it never rubbed in completely or disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would never be able to go outside again without wrapping a scarf around my neck (NOT fun in summer heat!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely has a light feel, like most zinc based sunscreens it does have a light white film that will make you look a little bit pale but it&#x27;s not as white as the goopier brands.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen then applies easily, evenly, and minus the white mask.</li>
            <li>If you try to rub the lotion in more to get rid of the white the lotion rolls up into little rolls &amp; falls off into your blouse.</li>
            <li>I only wish you got a little more for your $$</li>
            <li>It does tend to leave some white areas when not rubbed in but our main goal is no sunburn and no tears!</li>
            <li>it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>It says it &amp;#34;dries with a clear finish&amp;#34; I beg to differ.  </li>
            <li>Light &amp; not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Covers face very well and doesn&#x27;t appear thick &amp; greasy.  </li>
            <li>That they even call this clear is a joke.</li>
            <li>As far as I know it&#x27;s doing its job.</li>
            <li>CeraVe Moisturizing Facial Lotion AM, SPF 30, is much easier to use.</li>
            <li>My face had a white pasty look no matter how much I tried to rub it in.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old son sat across me at breakfast, giggling that I looked like a clown.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel soft and protects from sunburn.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely blend away.  </li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far I don’t think the rub in situation is a reason not to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you are just looking for a sunscreen you can carry around for whenever and don’t have particularly sensitive skin I can understand why this might not be the product for you.  </li>
            <li>It blends to your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Please do not purchase this product if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>lotion SPF 50  by ology if you have sensitive skin: both caused a burning sensation on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy and goes on smoothly under my makeup.</li>
            <li>I prefer a physical sunblock like zinc-it blocks rays as opposed to absorbing them, hmmm..</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t seem to break me out, and so far I haven&#x27;t burned through it.  </li>
            <li>cream was thick and spread OK on my skin.</li>
            <li>A true physical block will always leave a trace but this one gets close enough for me not to feel self-conscious on my daily commute to work in New York City.  </li>
            <li>After trying the breakout free Neutrogena and still getting acne, I stood in CVS and compared the active ingredients of all the facial sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I got this at a drugstore for &amp;#34;buy one, get one 50% off.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d been looking for a high SPF facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>, it never runs (I sweat heavily), and frankly, because it turns your face white, you can easily see any spots you missed before heading out.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for long days in the sun.  </li>
            <li>The smell is incredibly strong and smells of petrol, which is hard to take so close to the nose.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the sunscreen turned my face bright white.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really soak in well enough and is left on your face like zinc.</li>
            <li>However, my face hasn&#x27;t had a major break out while using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I generally opt for the zinc based ones because they don’t sting my eyes or irritate my skin when I sweat.  </li>
            <li>It never dries clear, but just sits white on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I learned that most sunscreens on the market are actually chemically based and is not good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It did not apply smoothly (even though I used small amounts and targeted one part of my face at a time) and the white film did not disappear with time.  </li>
            <li>After trying 12 different brands from baby screens to sensitive skin items, I stumbled upon this brand and now it is what we use exclusively.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 20 different types of suncreens so far</li>
            <li>I applied the same way, reapplied just as frequently, and used at a beach as well.</li>
            <li>I use it only on my neck, which is the sensitive area, and I don&#x27;t notice any visible whiteness if I rub it in well.</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive to use chemical sunscreens on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>If you only have mildly sensitive skin this may work well for you.  </li>
            <li>But this product simply doesn&#x27;t, and even with vigorous rubbing I found it collecting near my eyes, around my nose, etc.</li>
            <li>Works as sunscreen but definitely does not dry clear.  </li>
            <li>product has allowed me to go outdoors and enjoy the day with NO MORE itchy skin after I go out in the sun!  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical of this product since I didn’t really see how it was possible to have a really good sunscreen that didn’t sting my eyes and didn’t leave me looking like Casper.  </li>
            <li>and despite what other reviewers might say, I REALLY tried to rub this stuff in.</li>
            <li>and then if you want to returned it, you need to mail it with a tracking number, so you are sure they receive it, for the price its not good deal!  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be better than other common sunblock because it has zinc and is pricey, but it promptly will come off in the water and you will get burned.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older I get Photodermatitis from being in the sun, even with spf 50 sunscreen, from other manufactures, slathered on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I found this at Ulta and it was a decent price compared to other brands I&#x27;ve seen online.</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free, another physical sunblock, which is formulated as a suspension with a more watery base.</li>
            <li>may have just had bad luck with this bottle from Amazon, but the product when purchased elsewhere worked well for me ( a fair skinned Irish-American)</li>

            <li> Applies great and feels good.</li>
            <li> He said the best thing to do for your skin is onscreen and this is his favorite.</li>
            <li> so I might not be the best source for those who do burn easily.</li>
            <li> so I thought this sun screen would be good</li>
            <li> good thing is it does not burn when i put it on</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how good sunscreen is if you can&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> and I know what is good vs</li>
            <li> I use Cerave body lotion and loved it, so I thought I&#x27;d look for a sunscreen for my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly tan, so I doubt this could be remedied without some sort of makeup combination that someone else mentioned here.</li>
            <li> So I was delighted to find this sunscreen that does not contain homosalate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned to begin with (</li>
            <li> The good is that it&#x27;s unscented (hooray)</li>
            <li> Good product and sunscreen, ex</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> The invisible zinc really is amazing.</li>
            <li> Works great for not greasy goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> and I am loving this moisturizer/sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> so I liked that this used titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (i.e., mineral sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gave it a try and really liked it.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it had zinc and titanium dioxide, so we gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many, many \\&quot;sport\\&quot; sunscreens and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from it&#x27;s extraordinary protection form the sun, it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out very easily, and always breaks out when I use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Nice and light!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is good for protecting your skin agains sun damage, specially if you are outdoors a lot, of if you are performing any sports.</li>
            <li> I applied it very lightly</li>
            <li> I use the cerva cleanser, pm moisturizer, and the am moisturizer and love them.</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for two reasons:  1)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out into a rash, but if applied more than once, I am sure that it would cause one.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I do love this show so</li>
            <li> Someone with a darker complexion might have more problems.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the lotion; however, I look like I applied a light-white face paint to my face.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you do not go into the water its ok, if you do, forget it..</li>
            <li> This sunscreen blocks most of the sun.</li>
            <li> Would be better off wallowing in mud for sun protection.</li>
            <li> I play sports in the sun every weekend sometimes for more than five hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> I will update once I have given this more than the rub in update.  </li>
            <li> My son seems to be allergic to many sunscreens when applied to his face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure that this clogged many of my pores.</li>
            <li> I use this sunblock every day and love it.</li>
            <li> CeraVe SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion, 2 Ounce its ok</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> You will need your packaging and a receipt, but I was able to request a refund by calling 1-800-321-4576.  </li>
            <li> As many have said, it&#x27;s not invisible.</li>
            <li> The CeraVe product has a lotion consistency which I like better.</li>
            <li> i love the moisturizing cream</li>
            <li> Love that it has ceramides and niacinamides.</li>
            <li> However, many of the newer/popular sunscreens that contain Oxybenzone which is a penetration enhancer and has been proven to cause Cancer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but with this sunscreen I&#x27;ll be much better about protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY PLEASED with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon (with free shipping) beats the Walmart price!</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe products and always like to have a zinc sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I feel protected with this, but it takes more effort to get it to absorb and it does not do well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen as I thought CeraVe was a reputable</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t smooth at all!</li>
            <li> I use all kinds of their products and love the rest of them...</li>
            <li> It provides great protection from the sun and since I have melasma I need a good physical, and not chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I work in a dermatology practice and we love all Cerave products and recommend them to patients, so I thought this would be another slam dunk product.</li>
            <li> I was bummed but thought perhaps it would still be okay to use on my body just to get rid of the product</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen directly after the painted eyebrows out more good-looking, beautiful eyebrow color.</li>
            <li> It was great on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on really nice, extremely lightweight and I feel it gives very good protection.  </li>
            <li> and therefore great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I find it more comfortable than the &amp;#34;N&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Right Aid and actually really liked it.</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe skin products, so I was excited when I saw this product at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I was even more excited by the &amp;#34;invisible zinc&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Overall good product if you have acne prone skin like mine!</li>
            <li> The active ingredient list looks excellent.</li>
            <li> Seems to work too, I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn, though I don&#x27;t burn easily</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good insulation effect, high spf.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it would be fine under makeup</li>
            <li> My face was perfectly fine before I introduced this to it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen finally does exactly what I need it to perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been fine with it.</li>
            <li> Super coverage!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s both affordable, comes with a decent amount, a high amount of SPF, and contains good ingredients!</li>
            <li> and I had huge breakouts while using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the am facial moisturizing lotion, which works great.</li>
            <li> It is great to find it regularly on Amazon-</li>
            <li> Yes but&lt;br /&gt;this is such great protection</li>
            <li> I have light treatments for a skin condition and needed this during my treatments and when I need to go out.</li>
            <li> +  by neutrogena or oxygen zone free sunscreen  </li>
            <li> Fantastic UVA and UVB protection</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair sensitive skin, and so do my kids.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically because it was supposed to be good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was excited to buy an SPF lotion that I could carry along in my backpack</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to start using this suncscreen.</li>
            <li> I think most people who reviewed this and found the product to be not as clear as it claims have perhaps not tried many alternatives.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this since I love and enjoy just about every CeraVe product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is only good for a day at the beach or hanging out at home.</li>
            <li> I like it, its good enough for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually, if you apply a good face moisturizer before the sunscreen, it helps it rub in and minimizes the white cast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good physical sunscreen and Cerave said this one was lightweight and invisible.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and burn very easily.  </li>
            <li> As I waited for it to dry, I started to look pasty and cakey which isn&#x27;t good since my skin tone is light brown.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s nothing a quick swipe with a tissue hasn&#x27;t eliminated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what ingredient is responsible for this, but basically, when you put it on, it produces a sort of powdery white top layer that either sticks to your skin or (even better!) goes EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> We also live in one of the most hot, sunniest places in the U.S. &amp; this sunblock passes the test!</li>
            <li> It ACTUALLY makes my skin look BETTER!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels very light, and the natural skin tone blends so well with my tan</li>
            <li> I really like how light this is.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, I really like it</li>
            <li> Remember not much is needed for good coverage.</li>
            <li> only sunscreen I&#x27;ve really liked</li>
            <li> Yes, you do have to re-apply it every 80 minutes, and by lunch time, wipe off the old and apply more.  </li>
            <li> I love CeraVe because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I always laugh when I see &amp;#34;no</li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t look good with blue skin, but I really can&#x27;t recommend this sunscreen to anybody.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely need to re-apply.</li>
            <li> It does not get absorbed by the skin but stays on top&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li> purchased the CeraVe because if it had worked, it was more readily available (in stores) than the Blue Lizard</li>
            <li> /&gt;After this very positive experience with the product that she had purchased from the Walgreens</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li> It does leave your face kind of white if you apply too much of it.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen that works and keeps me from getting dermatitis on my skin</li>
            <li> To help spread it on my skin easier, I first moisturize it, and then it goes on with no problems.</li>
            <li> Should have read Amazon&#x27;s comments here first.  </li>
            <li> I love this face sunscreen and use it daily as part of my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I expected a really nice product from CeraVe, and believed the box that reads &amp;#34;Invisible&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed it in some more and let it sit for about ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I love Cerave&#x27;s moisturizing lotion, but I cannot say the same for this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The result is a more white complexion almost like mime.</li>
            <li> I wear it religiously and I will continue to trust this brand over many of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t totally mind since I wear makeup over this, but it&#x27;s still something negatively notable from something that claims for the zinc to be invisible.</li>
            <li> Try using another moisturizer first like coconut oil or CereVe moisturizing lotion when you get out of the shower or wash your face and then rub this in.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had looked at amazon reviews first as I would have saved myself some money .</li>
            <li> first time to order this product but delivery was as promised and product works well...</li>
            <li> But it is this exact product.</li>
            <li> This sounded perfect, but sadly it is neither of those things.  </li>
            <li> I bought CeraVe SPF 50 for our most recent beach vacation.  </li>
            <li> Wears really well under my makeup and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews with so many people saying that it&#x27;s not invisible and leaves a white film but tried it anyway.</li>
            <li> Makes you makeup look funny</li>
            <li> California has very consistant cloudless skies, so its easy to compare.  </li>
            <li> I liked the feel of this initially but my sensitive skin started feeling hot and burny from it within about 15 minutes of putting it on and I wasn&#x27;t even in the sun yet.  </li>
            <li> CeraVe SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion is a great sunscreen for your face that feels nice on, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and doesn&#x27;t run in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> It left a surprisingly white cast for something termed &amp;#34;InVisibleZinc&amp;#34; and even on my fair skin it was noticeable.</li>
            <li> I should note, if I&#x27;m going to the beach or doing anything that requires what I would consider more intense sunscreen needs, I use a stronger and different sunscreen that also has water/sweatproofing and just deal with the breakout or smell.</li>
            <li> oil free lotion broad spectrum 70</li>
            <li> On a mildly positive note, it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect how my makeup wears.</li>
            <li> Even though I applied a chemical based sunscreen faithfully on my neck, EVERY time my neck was exposed to the sun it felt like someone was holding a hot hair dryer an inch from my skin, and the itching would intensify so much that I&#x27;d wake up with rake lines on my neck where I was scratching as I slept.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super sensitive to fragrances and perfumes and have no problems with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It is not a  lightweight formula and it does not spreads easily, when it dries it does with a white finish.  </li>
            <li> However this sunscreen does have a different strong chemical smell which I did not like at all.</li>
            <li> It certainly can and will if you splat a bunch in your palm and just smear it on.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; has the consistency of something you&#x27;d fill holes in your wall, goes on your skin with residue and crumbly left-overs, and turns your skin pasty white (and I am already rather light skinned).</li>
            <li> Very drying - almost to a powder consistency.  </li>
            <li> It is much cheaper on here than in the stores.</li>
            <li> The zinc in this sunscreen is really helpful for balancing out my skin&#x27;s pH level and helping regulate breakouts.</li>
            <li> Overall, there was nothing fantastic about this</li>
            <li> No matter the amount or attempts to smooth over my skin, the lotion appears very white.</li>
            <li> I absolutely need to use this all over my face, and I look like I&#x27;ve put baby powder on.</li>
            <li> As an invisible sunscreen--not so much.</li>
            <li> no matter how much you spread and rub.  </li>
            <li> As a person with dermatology problems, I find I&#x27;m being very well protected from harmful cancer causing sun rays.</li>
            <li> We also are very acne prone.</li>
            <li> But it absolutely does not absorb into my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful for a sunscreen I can use, since I have a history of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> What I normally do, however, is mix it with my foundation in the palm of my hand first</li>
            <li> And I really just couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> it looked like I was wearing eye shadow - that&#x27;s how much it lightened the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care so much.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I get an oil free physical (as opposed to chemical) sunscreen for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> A pea sized amount covers my whole face.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO greasy feeling and no nasty smell.</li>
            <li> The thicker glide on sunscreen stick they sell didn&#x27;t (chemical) burn me quite as much</li>
            <li> I was really amped to try this when I saw it at the store.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s good for entertainment purposes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wonder if the people who say the white color blends away are not really getting a good close look at their face.  </li>
            <li> A slight, white-ish cast is a small price for excellent sun protection.</li>
            <li> It has a slight white layer, but with fair skin ( and rosacea)</li>
            <li> Disappointing product, and nothing like the Cerave AM facial moisturizer so many of  us love and use!!</li>
            <li> This cerave is spf 50, so I should be getting much more protection, but I got way less.  </li>
            <li> A much better product at half the price is Coppertone Oilfree faces 50SPF.</li>
            <li> i love it because my face tends to get red and with this you cant tell my face is red in the heat</li>
            <li> Guess I will continue with traditional sunscreens over my daily moisturizer until I find something better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Clinique&#x27;s Super City Block that has both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (the main ingredients of &#x27;physical&#x27; sunblocks) and it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a ghost face, so I&#x27;d recommend that over this.</li>
            <li> so I had high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far better for skin absorption than any other alternative I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and pasty, glops up in hairline and brows, sits heavily on top of the skin, and leaves a strong white cast.  </li>
            <li> effective but goes on a bit while hard toapply make up over</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my sensitive skin, and that&#x27;s what I need.</li>
            <li> Unless your okay with having a paper white face which does eventually fade (not completely) then go ahead &amp; purchase.</li>
            <li> But it works better than the chemical sunblocks (it is titanium and zinc, natural elements which make an actual physical barrier to sun)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it around the entire day, and no matter what I try to apply on top, no matter how long I wait before applying make up, or after applying moisturizer, 5 minutes after moisturizer,</li>
            <li> spend the money on another TERRIFIC product which so far I have only been able to purchase on Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes, since all the other Cerave products I have used have been truly fantastic.  </li>
            <li> bought this at WalMart wanting to try out a different sunscreen with zinc oxide without the standard strong smell.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, most of it came off with soap and water, but that&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that sunscreen helps that much, but it certainly has protected my skin from the abuse I can put it thru somedays being outside in the sun all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky that my skin is pretty much white either way, so it only shows near my brows and hairline</li>
            <li> This stuff, however, takes it to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without Cerave PM moisturizer and Cerave hydrating cleanser, so I was eagerly awaiting their new sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I put some on my face, arms, and legs, and even with giving it a few minutes to dry, it very quickly ended up all over my shorts, shirtsleeves, and in fact the entire top of my shirt from the collarbones up.</li>
            <li> I am very tan and as much as I tried to rub it in I was white as a ghost and my friends told me I looked ashy!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I also have rosacea</li>
            <li> the white wasn&#x27;t as strong but still there &amp; still rolled when rubbed too long.</li>
            <li> or you can look pretty white.</li>
            <li> This goes on my face first before any makeup; I prefer to use this as a primer instead of Urban Decay&#x27;s face primer!</li>
            <li> But the problem, like many other people have said, is that it&#x27;s too white and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t mind it, as it&#x27;s a reasonable tradeoff for ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate my eyes and skin.</li>
            <li> Just one more reviewer letting you know that this product leaves your face a white, white, white that doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this CeraVe sunscreen a try after discovering that the store was out of my usual Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free SPF50.</li>
            <li> It would have been funny if I hadn&#x27;t spent so much money on this</li>
            <li> I could see exactly where it was because of the white residue, but it never rubbed in completely or disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would never be able to go outside again without wrapping a scarf around my neck (NOT fun in summer heat!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely has a light feel, like most zinc based sunscreens it does have a light white film that will make you look a little bit pale but it&#x27;s not as white as the goopier brands.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen then applies easily, evenly, and minus the white mask.</li>
            <li> If you try to rub the lotion in more to get rid of the white the lotion rolls up into little rolls &amp; falls off into your blouse.</li>
            <li> I only wish you got a little more for your $$</li>
            <li> It does tend to leave some white areas when not rubbed in but our main goal is no sunburn and no tears!</li>
            <li> it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li> It says it &amp;#34;dries with a clear finish&amp;#34; I beg to differ.  </li>
            <li> Light &amp; not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Covers face very well and doesn&#x27;t appear thick &amp; greasy.  </li>
            <li> That they even call this clear is a joke.</li>
            <li> As far as I know it&#x27;s doing its job.</li>
            <li> CeraVe Moisturizing Facial Lotion AM, SPF 30, is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> My face had a white pasty look no matter how much I tried to rub it in.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old son sat across me at breakfast, giggling that I looked like a clown.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel soft and protects from sunburn.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely blend away.  </li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far I don’t think the rub in situation is a reason not to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you are just looking for a sunscreen you can carry around for whenever and don’t have particularly sensitive skin I can understand why this might not be the product for you.  </li>
            <li> It blends to your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Please do not purchase this product if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> lotion SPF 50  by ology if you have sensitive skin: both caused a burning sensation on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy and goes on smoothly under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I prefer a physical sunblock like zinc-it blocks rays as opposed to absorbing them, hmmm..</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t seem to break me out, and so far I haven&#x27;t burned through it.  </li>
            <li> cream was thick and spread OK on my skin.</li>
            <li> A true physical block will always leave a trace but this one gets close enough for me not to feel self-conscious on my daily commute to work in New York City.  </li>
            <li> After trying the breakout free Neutrogena and still getting acne, I stood in CVS and compared the active ingredients of all the facial sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I got this at a drugstore for &amp;#34;buy one, get one 50% off.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d been looking for a high SPF facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> , it never runs (I sweat heavily), and frankly, because it turns your face white, you can easily see any spots you missed before heading out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for long days in the sun.  </li>
            <li> The smell is incredibly strong and smells of petrol, which is hard to take so close to the nose.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the sunscreen turned my face bright white.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really soak in well enough and is left on your face like zinc.</li>
            <li> However, my face hasn&#x27;t had a major break out while using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I generally opt for the zinc based ones because they don’t sting my eyes or irritate my skin when I sweat.  </li>
            <li> It never dries clear, but just sits white on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I learned that most sunscreens on the market are actually chemically based and is not good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It did not apply smoothly (even though I used small amounts and targeted one part of my face at a time) and the white film did not disappear with time.  </li>
            <li> After trying 12 different brands from baby screens to sensitive skin items, I stumbled upon this brand and now it is what we use exclusively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 20 different types of suncreens so far</li>
            <li> I applied the same way, reapplied just as frequently, and used at a beach as well.</li>
            <li> I use it only on my neck, which is the sensitive area, and I don&#x27;t notice any visible whiteness if I rub it in well.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive to use chemical sunscreens on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> If you only have mildly sensitive skin this may work well for you.  </li>
            <li> But this product simply doesn&#x27;t, and even with vigorous rubbing I found it collecting near my eyes, around my nose, etc.</li>
            <li> Works as sunscreen but definitely does not dry clear.  </li>
            <li> product has allowed me to go outdoors and enjoy the day with NO MORE itchy skin after I go out in the sun!  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product since I didn’t really see how it was possible to have a really good sunscreen that didn’t sting my eyes and didn’t leave me looking like Casper.  </li>
            <li> and despite what other reviewers might say, I REALLY tried to rub this stuff in.</li>
            <li> and then if you want to returned it, you need to mail it with a tracking number, so you are sure they receive it, for the price its not good deal!  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be better than other common sunblock because it has zinc and is pricey, but it promptly will come off in the water and you will get burned.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older I get Photodermatitis from being in the sun, even with spf 50 sunscreen, from other manufactures, slathered on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I found this at Ulta and it was a decent price compared to other brands I&#x27;ve seen online.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free, another physical sunblock, which is formulated as a suspension with a more watery base.</li>
            <li> may have just had bad luck with this bottle from Amazon, but the product when purchased elsewhere worked well for me ( a fair skinned Irish-American)</li>
            <li> By the same token, however, it IS a fine suspension of white mineral particles, so if you are worried about looking a little paler than usual, buy a chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and horrible eczema, but I looked like a white face clown when will they make something for African American skin that is good for sensitive skin , we need sunblock too!!</li>
            <li> In my case, I could overlook some minor white film if it gets me daily facial sunscreen</li>
            <li> I can easily coat my face and neck with a fairly small amount, and expect the tube to last me at least the rest of the summer.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t wear much make up because of my sensitive skin, so this is not a choice (not to mention a pain in the butt every time) and wearing it thin doesn&#x27;t solve the problem, it leaves the face too</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I limited my use of this lotion for therapy only.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it is like most of the other reviews mention; the \\&quot;InVisibleZinc\\&quot; is not so invisible.</li>
            <li> but I rarely wear makeup and spend at least half my day outside.</li>
            <li> : every other brand of facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve EVER tried has made my skin sting all day and that always deterred me from wanting to wear facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I learned from painful experience that my neck and upper chest react violently (red, sore, itchy) to homosalate, an ingredient in most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I rubbed it in for a long time, but it would not fade.</li>
            <li> while my skin is still wet, 15 minutes after, an hour, then once it&#x27;s on, 15 minutes to let it set, 20 minutes to let it set, an hour, no make up at all, different types of powders, foundations, people will walk up to me and say, &amp;</li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t stand smelling the sunscreen smell all day long.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers that this does leave a white cast on the skin right after application, so at first I was a bit skeptical, but after giving it a few minutes to set It is no longer white and my skin does not feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather disconcerting to look in the mirror at a day&#x27;s end and finding small bits and pieces of this &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; all over my face, especially if you have facial hair, say, eye brows (!)</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of my time being called “ghost face” due to the different sunscreens I have used over the years.  </li>
            <li> reviewers (here and on other sites) indicate that it is gloopy and/or leaves a white film.</li>
            <li> I only use a TINY bit evenly applied over my neck and gently rub it in thoroughly--it is a physical sunblock, so a very thin skim of the zinc is all it takes to protect against the sun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s just no reason for me to use this sunscreen when there are others out there with zinc/titanium as the active ingredients that DON&#x27;T leave such an extreme white cast.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers here that I was at first disappointed with the false advertising about &amp;#34;invisible zinc&amp;#34;; however, this brand is superior for me.  </li>
            <li> It was to dry</li>
            <li> No sunscreen smell, dry to the touch (not greasy)</li>
            <li> It is a physical block (meaning the active ingredients are either titanium dioxide or zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients in this one were different from all the others.</li>
            <li> Also, although it&#x27;s supposed to be a facial sunscreen, but it caused my face, after a few uses, to develop red blotchy areas.  </li>
            <li> It is the same price as Cerave and the WHITE mask disappears after a few minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I almost exclusively use physical blockers as my sunscreen, so I know that with some it takes a few minutes for the white tint to soak in.</li>
            <li> The CeraVe sunscreen  causes my face to burn, has an odor worse than the usual sunscreen odor, is heavy, greasy, and (like many others have said) makes my face white.  </li>
            <li> Of all the physical sun screens I&#x27;ve tried, this one has left my face the least white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite sticky and a bit heavy on my skin, so I generally use a blotting sheet about 20 minutes after application, before applying any makeup.</li>
            <li> it helps keep red down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*A little goes a long way, so the bottle should last for awhile&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Highly not recommended.</li>
            <li> The key is to apply small amounts instead of one big glob, then trying to hurry it around.</li>
            <li> Had to use a little on different areas of my face which is time consuming and makes you use excess product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> Too bad, because as I said I am generally pleased with this brand.</li>
            <li> You do need to be careful about the amount you are applying</li>
            <li> Finally found the sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause trouble on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very tan</li>
            <li> No matter how careful I&#x27;ve tried to be in applying this product, the results are unacceptable to me for my face.  </li>
            <li> Had a few white areas that I had to re-rub in so if you are concerned about it not rubbing in for that &#x27;invisible&#x27; effect, apply and then spot check  yourself</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days and had a red rash all over my face.</li>
            <li> Not really the look I want.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s absolutely not.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t feel it was a total waste, but it&#x27;s been 15 minutes of rubbing</li>
            <li> Immediately after careful application it dried out my cheeks, which are prone to dryness but were moisturized well prior to the sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and a family history of skin cancer, so I was hoping to find a product for daily use.</li>
            <li> bottle says easy to spread, but it is very difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Compared to other CeraVe products I&#x27;ve used, this stuff is not up to par to their other products.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> No avobenzone or other harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I might use it when I&#x27;m cycling just to get use out of it (after all, no one can see how white your face is when you&#x27;re breezing past at 15+ mph).</li>
            <li> as other reviewers said, there&#x27;s nothing invisible about this.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores like 100% of other brands, it&#x27;s unscented and hypoallergenic -- I&#x27;m allergic to 95% of the products on the market, and it seems to help in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to wear sunscreen for decades because of hereditary blotching from the sun/light.  </li>
            <li> No more white noses &amp; lips.</li>
            <li> My sister swears by Cerave&#x27;s other products</li>
            <li> Let me get one thing out of the way: I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned, and I&#x27;m also used to natural zinc sunscreens leaving a faint white cast on my skin.</li>
            <li> That said, like other zinc-containing products, though less so, you can&#x27;t just slather it on and expect it to disappear; you do have to rub it in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to spread, dries out my skin, and makes it very white.  </li>
            <li> but I thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who may have a similar complaint</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> However, using it everyday is not very recommended as it leaves your skin a bit &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the small size of the tube for the price, although it does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> guess it boils down to what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> In the winter, the very slight white-ish cast is not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure this is the real product Cerave, cause all the Cerave products I tried before are really as expected except this one, a friend of mine said that its a fake,  I don&#x27;t recommend buying it, if you are not going to like it</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell was a typical zinc sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> It was nearly half the price of what it cost at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> But having a previous melanoma on my face, I&#x27;m under strict \\&quot;wear sunscreen at all times\\&quot; orders.</li>
            <li> I am very active outdoors</li>
            <li> This one has by far the lesser feel of the weird oiliness!</li>
            <li> I realize zinc sun screens in general tend to leave at least a slight white cast on the skin, but this sunscreen is particularly bad especially for one that claims to be invisible.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s of little consequence.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little viscous, so I mix it with a little water.</li>
            <li> It makes me look a little pale but not noticeably so.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to waste product</li>
            <li> Leaves your face with a thin white coating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It&#x27;s difficult to get this rubbed in completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy to cover with makeup.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a white residue behind</li>
            <li> I do like the mineral SPF aspect, and not wanting it to go to waste, I&#x27;ve resorted to applying it on the backs of my hands to protect them while driving.</li>
            <li> Hydrocortisone would help tame the itch for a short while, but  the dermatologist warned that overuse of hydrocortisone would thin my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pale and I still see it, but I put it on under liquid foundation and the foundation covers up the sunscreen whiteness.</li>
            <li> have pale skin to start with -- maybe it would work on someone with darker skin.</li>
            <li> Even worst, it seems to make itself comfortable in the slightest dry patch I have on my face and accentuate it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as bad as putting zinc oxide paste on your face, but it&#x27;s pretty close.</li>
            <li> I still got one or two very small spots, but nothing in comparison to after using other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this sunscreen was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was wary of it because I was afraid it was makeup, but it goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> The consistency was a little thick, and it did indeed gloop in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I washed it off and went with my usual face sunscreen instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But at least I don&#x27;t feel trapped in a box</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m wearing it alone, I do small areas at the time</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s excessive.  </li>
            <li> Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 is my usual go-to sunscreen</li>
            <li> but it was too weird on a daily basis in the summer.</li>
            <li> is a bit small....</li>
            <li> Yes, it leaves an annoying white cast if you don&#x27;t have recently moisturized skin or if you apply in a hurry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall unless you are just going to stay at home working in your yard or something, or have very pale skin, this isn&#x27;t the product.</li>
            <li> not good for everyday under make up.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t want to have to rub that hard on the skin on my face anyways; it&#x27;s delicate skin that shouldn&#x27;t be manipulated to that degree.</li>
            <li> This product is of somewhat thick consistency, which makes it hard to distribute over the face.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative reviews.</li>
            <li> It clumps and is so thick that it is abrasive when applying.</li>
            <li> Too thick and gooey.  </li>
            <li> but this sun screen is thick.</li>
            <li> The reason this seems to be thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin is because it has zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the consistency too thick, but worst of all, it settles to a noticeably white, chalky finish which is unflattering.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Invisible\\&quot; claim is ridiculous, unless you consider having a zinc-blue glow over your face to be \\&quot;invisible\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I use a less expensive zinc-based sunscreen on my body, but that product made my face break out, whereas the CeraVe product does not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous that they call this &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; zinc.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t match with the description of the product, I hate it, its oily and if using a small amount, still leave the face white.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product, it was very tacky and heavy, had a bad whitecast.</li>
            <li> Another product I tried had a horrible smell and even after washing it off with soap and hot water</li>
            <li> I once stupidly overexposed my neck to strong sun on a beach without using sunscreen (and I was taking a Rx diuretic that specifically warned against sun exposure while using----how stupid can I get????).  </li>
            <li> It was very thick and difficult to get on without rubbing my skin too hard.</li>
            <li> but I ended up looking worse than before.</li>
            <li> or, even worse, a beard.</li>
            <li> Even worse on my husband and his arms.</li>
            <li> The secret is to mix it with a day cream, he uses Skinceuticals Metacell Renewal B3.</li>
            <li> I use a magnifying mirror to look at my face because my eyesight is not great.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale and the white cast was awful and it didn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive for the poor quality ($15 a Walmart).</li>
            <li> and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply so</li>
            <li> I try to add color to it by applying foundation after I put it on, and it even gives my foundation a weird ghostly hue.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible pasty white.</li>
            <li> This was too expensive to discard, so I&#x27;m going to start using it on the backs of my hands until it runs out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the small bottle for 4 people :-(</li>
            <li> It was unlikely that I&#x27;d run into any friends on this vacation</li>
            <li> But as a facial sunscreen this stuff is honestly awful.</li>
            <li> False advertisement!</li>
            <li> I am afraid, this is a terrible product and I am going to dispose of it immediately after trying for several weeks to learn to like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had the patience to write a bad review about a suncreen before, but this one, holy moly, I am NOT happy.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to rub in.</li>
            <li> and I did see a lot of badly burned tourists and did not want to join their ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never bought a bad product of CeraVe until now.</li>
            <li> NOT this one...too bad....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> While this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, wearing it gives me ghost face.  :(</li>
            <li> in fact, WHAT IS that weird &#x27;OILY&#x27; feeling-oh chemistry makers of sunblocks?!!??..</li>
            <li> claim, since the kids hate sunscreen that leaves them</li>
            <li> and I usually hate wearing sunscreen</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am so grateful that it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible odor.</li>
            <li> Sadly, Horrible...  </li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> But this product just looked horrible on me.</li>
            <li> This was terrible sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have been through a lot of sunblocks in my life and this one has the worst staying power of any of them.</li>
            <li> It looked like some sort of hilariously awful deodorant accident</li>
            <li> It caused me to break out in a horrible rash.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Compared to other CeraVe products I&#x27;ve used, this stuff is not up to par to their other products. I was excited to buy an SPF lotion that I could carry along in my backpack but this lotion left my skin white - and despite what other reviewers might say, I REALLY tried to rub this stuff in. I even tried to cover it up with just a touch of makeup but I ended up looking worse than before. If you can, I would definitely use the Cerave AM Lotion with SPF 30 instead of this sunscreen. Not only does it not leave your face white, but it&#x27;s also easier to apply and leaves your skin softer.</li>
            <li> effective but goes on a bit while hard toapply make up over</li>
            <li> I had a Dermatologist recommend Cerva products. I have very sensitive skin, and I also have rosacea so I thought this sun screen would be good, it was not. It was to dry, it could not be rubbed in so I looked pasty, also as the day went on it  settled in my wrinkles. I use the cerva cleanser, pm moisturizer, and the am moisturizer and love them. I thought this sun screen would be the same, but not so, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> The best face sunscreen I have EVER used.</li>
            <li> As far as I know it&#x27;s doing its job. I am so grateful that it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible odor. Another product I tried had a horrible smell and even after washing it off with soap and hot water my skin still smelled. CeraVe doesn&#x27;t seem to have any scent. You do need to be careful about the amount you are applying or you can look pretty white. I just used a lesser amount.</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe. I currently use the CeraVe moisturizer with spf 30. I thought I would try this since I was enrolled in a 5k over the weekend. It definitely works. My problem with this product is that it paints your face white! If you try to rub the lotion in more to get rid of the white the lotion rolls up into little rolls &amp; falls off into your blouse. So it looks like pieces of glue or something. Unless your okay with having a paper white face which does eventually fade (not completely) then go ahead &amp; purchase. I don&#x27;t like to waste product so I attempted to change the formula by mixing my CeraVe moisutirzer spf 30 with this SPF 50...the white wasn&#x27;t as strong but still there &amp; still rolled when rubbed too long.</li>
            <li> good thing is it does not burn when i put it on I have sensitive skin and horrible eczema, but I looked like a white face clown when will they make something for African American skin that is good for sensitive skin , we need sunblock too!!</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply so it goes on clear.  CeraVe Moisturizing Facial Lotion AM, SPF 30, is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Its not greasy i love it because my face tends to get red and with this you cant tell my face is red in the heat</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> waiting for the sunshine will take with me on next trip to southern climes.</li>
            <li> my wife is happy, and I happy</li>
            <li> Nice and light! Works great and does not break you out.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for two reasons:  1) It is a physical block (meaning the active ingredients are either titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. NOTHING ELSE.) and therefore great for people with sensitive skin. I&#x27;m actually allergic to chemical sunscreens so I stick to physical blocks only.  2) Of all the physical sun screens I&#x27;ve tried, this one has left my face the least white. A true physical block will always leave a trace but this one gets close enough for me not to feel self-conscious on my daily commute to work in New York City.  TL;DR, if you&#x27;re looking for a physical block for your face, this is definitely the one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older I get Photodermatitis from being in the sun, even with spf 50 sunscreen, from other manufactures, slathered on my skin.  This is the first sunscreen that works and keeps me from getting dermatitis on my skin and I&#x27;m super sensitive to fragrances and perfumes and have no problems with this sunscreen.  To help spread it on my skin easier, I first moisturize it, and then it goes on with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is not invisible at all. It&#x27;s hard to spread, dries out my skin, and makes it very white.  It never dries clear, but just sits white on my skin.  I try to add color to it by applying foundation after I put it on, and it even gives my foundation a weird ghostly hue.  Even when I use just a pea sized amount it gives me white face.  I realize zinc sun screens in general tend to leave at least a slight white cast on the skin, but this sunscreen is particularly bad especially for one that claims to be invisible.  This stuff is only good for a day at the beach or hanging out at home.</li>
            <li> Normally a big fan of CeraVe products, I gave this sunscreen face lotion a try despite rather mixed reviews. I am afraid, this is a terrible product and I am going to dispose of it immediately after trying for several weeks to learn to like it. This &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; has the consistency of something you&#x27;d fill holes in your wall, goes on your skin with residue and crumbly left-overs, and turns your skin pasty white (and I am already rather light skinned). It&#x27;s rather disconcerting to look in the mirror at a day&#x27;s end and finding small bits and pieces of this &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; all over my face, especially if you have facial hair, say, eye brows (!) or, even worse, a beard. I ended up rubbing and smearing and pressing and wiping this thing on my face - in the end, I stopped using it. And that utterly defeats the purpose of sunscreen. Highly not recommended.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it invisible.  My face had a white pasty look no matter how much I tried to rub it in.  I&#x27;ll stick with the am facial moisturizing lotion, which works great.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Walgreens for 50% off.  Should have read Amazon&#x27;s comments here first.  I&#x27;ll make this simple.  Very drying - almost to a powder consistency.  Will leave your face WHITE.  Had to throw it after one application.  Will not buy this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy unless you are applying to be a circus clown!</li>
            <li> Works great! Just need to rub it in so you don&#x27;t have white all over your face.</li>
            <li> This will be one of my favorite products for awesome face protection. The invisible zinc really is amazing. Remember not much is needed for good coverage.</li>
            <li> I purchased CeraVe Sunscreen SPF50 for Face.  It says it &amp;#34;dries with a clear finish&amp;#34; I beg to differ.  I have a very fair complexion and you can see the zinc oxide sitting on my skin.  I applied it very lightly and I have rubbed it in.  I tried this product 3 times and it is not at all invisible.  I&#x27;m disappointed plus I&#x27;m out $15 on a product I can&#x27;t use and I can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> Not invisible at all. Even worse on my husband and his arms. Leaves him cakey white.</li>
            <li> Works as sunscreen but definitely does not dry clear.  Leaves your face with a thin white coating.</li>
            <li> I am a dedicated CeraVe AM and PM lotion user. My dermatologist recently recommended I switch to a 50SPF daily moisturizer so I was stoked to find CeraVe has a 50SPF. Sadly, it is like most of the other reviews mention; the \\&quot;InVisibleZinc\\&quot; is not so invisible. The white film just sat on my face. My 9 year old son sat across me at breakfast, giggling that I looked like a clown. At least it&#x27;s good for entertainment purposes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it would be fine under makeup but I rarely wear makeup and spend at least half my day outside. Guess I will continue with traditional sunscreens over my daily moisturizer until I find something better.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and within hours it made my face hurt in an allergic reaction. I didn&#x27;t break out into a rash, but if applied more than once, I am sure that it would cause one. This is getting returned.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face sunscreen. It makes your skin feel soft and protects from sunburn. It is much cheaper on here than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff, reapply if you get all sweaty as it&#x27;s not one of those never comes off type of products.</li>
            <li> Works great for not greasy goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> I do like this product. Having rosacea I need one that doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate. It has a slight white layer, but with fair skin ( and rosacea) it helps keep red down. I also like that it is thicker( like lotion) and a little goes a long way!  And it&#x27;s not greasy or slimed either !</li>
            <li> Finally found the sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause trouble on my skin. Not greasy feeling at all. Love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend in well.  Leaves a whitish film.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible pasty white. I am the fairest shade on the Lancome foundation line and this just makes me look like a ghost. It is definitely not invisible zinc!</li>
            <li> I really like how light this is.</li>
            <li> CeraVe is one of my must have skincare lines. I love this face sunscreen and use it daily as part of my makeup routine. This goes on my face first before any makeup; I prefer to use this as a primer instead of Urban Decay&#x27;s face primer! The zinc in this sunscreen is really helpful for balancing out my skin&#x27;s pH level and helping regulate breakouts. Definitely recommend anyone who struggles with acne blemishes to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have found.  No avobenzone or other harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> My son uses this product. I&#x27;ve read many complaints about it being white &amp; difficult to apply. The secret is to mix it with a day cream, he uses Skinceuticals Metacell Renewal B3. The sunscreen then applies easily, evenly, and minus the white mask.</li>
            <li> This is NOT invisible zinc. It doesn&#x27;t matter how good sunscreen is if you can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just applied it to my face, and it makes you look like you are trying to apply white face clown makeup. I can&#x27;t believe no one mention this in any of the reviews. I bought this to wear in public. You can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube​ should last a year or so since I can only use it when doing yard work in the backyard.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and I am loving this moisturizer/sunscreen.  It is great to find it regularly on Amazon- will order again.</li>
            <li> This product is non greasy and does the job. But the problem, like many other people have said, is that it&#x27;s too white and doesn&#x27;t fade. I&#x27;ve read some people mix it with foundation, I don&#x27;t wear much make up because of my sensitive skin, so this is not a choice (not to mention a pain in the butt every time) and wearing it thin doesn&#x27;t solve the problem, it leaves the face too white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall unless you are just going to stay at home working in your yard or something, or have very pale skin, this isn&#x27;t the product. I&#x27;m not very tan and even I look like a ghost. I&#x27;ve tried Clinique&#x27;s Super City Block that has both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (the main ingredients of &#x27;physical&#x27; sunblocks) and it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a ghost face, so I&#x27;d recommend that over this.</li>
            <li> I only used a tiny amount and didn&#x27;t experience a white face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says easy to spread, but it is very difficult to spread. Chalky consistency. Had to use a little on different areas of my face which is time consuming and makes you use excess product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used over my facial moisturizer. My face was perfectly fine before I introduced this to it. Immediately after careful application it dried out my cheeks, which are prone to dryness but were moisturized well prior to the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive for the poor quality ($15 a Walmart). Returning.</li>
            <li> Sadly, Horrible...  I expected a really nice product from CeraVe, and believed the box that reads &amp;#34;Invisible&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s not invisible at all.  It&#x27;s white and it remains white.  It doesn&#x27;t completely blend away.  I kept reducing the amount I was applying, still expecting to see &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;.  No matter how careful I&#x27;ve tried to be in applying this product, the results are unacceptable to me for my face.  I use a magnifying mirror to look at my face because my eyesight is not great.  I wonder if the people who say the white color blends away are not really getting a good close look at their face.  This was too expensive to discard, so I&#x27;m going to start using it on the backs of my hands until it runs out.  I&#x27;ll be looking for another brand of sunscreen for my face.</li>
            <li> I like it, its good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I do love this show so</li>
            <li> I got this at a drugstore for &amp;#34;buy one, get one 50% off.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d been looking for a high SPF facial sunscreen. I have pale skin and a family history of skin cancer, so I was hoping to find a product for daily use. I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to chemical sunscreens so I liked that this used titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (i.e., mineral sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stays on&lt;br /&gt;*Contains moisturizing ingredients&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to spread/apply&lt;br /&gt;*A little goes a long way, so the bottle should last for awhile&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve found niacinamide does a great job at clearing up post-breakout redness&lt;br /&gt;*Has not caused me to break out&lt;br /&gt;*No allergic reactions, either (I have sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s difficult to get this rubbed in completely. You&#x27;ll likely end up with white residue on your skin. This may or may not be a problem, depending on your skin tone. I&#x27;m quite pale and I still see it, but I put it on under liquid foundation and the foundation covers up the sunscreen whiteness. Someone with a darker complexion might have more problems. If this is too white for you, you may want to try a tinted CC cream that includes SPF ingredients instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I like this, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone, but only under foundation.</li>
            <li> Purchased from CVS for $16 and I&#x27;m returning it after 4 uses.  I love the feel of the lotion; however, I look like I applied a light-white face paint to my face.  It&#x27;s noticeably visible on dry/flaky skin &amp; in my eye brows.  It is lightweight - but also feels pasty.  I&#x27;m hoping CVS will let me exchange for a different CeraVe sunscreen.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this product and gave me a sample to try. I absolutely loved it.  I feel like my skin is being protected.  I also make my son use it every morning.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Does your skin look white after you use it? Yes but&lt;br /&gt;this is such great protection it&#x27;s of little consequence.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m outside all day, every day and if you have a touch of&lt;br /&gt;vanity,enough to want great skin then this is for you!</li>
            <li> Let me get one thing out of the way: I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned, and I&#x27;m also used to natural zinc sunscreens leaving a faint white cast on my skin. I generally don&#x27;t mind it, as it&#x27;s a reasonable tradeoff for ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate my eyes and skin. This stuff, however, takes it to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, if you apply a good face moisturizer before the sunscreen, it helps it rub in and minimizes the white cast. Not so with this stuff. I applied my moisturizer, and then this sunscreen, before my run this afternoon. I rubbed it in well. It left a surprisingly white cast for something termed &amp;#34;InVisibleZinc&amp;#34; and even on my fair skin it was noticeable. I rubbed it in some more and let it sit for about ten minutes. It still persisted. I washed it off and went with my usual face sunscreen instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was a typical zinc sunscreen smell. The consistency was a little thick, and it did indeed gloop in my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve used thicker face sunscreens, and I&#x27;ve used thinner face sunscreens. Overall, there was nothing fantastic about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s just no reason for me to use this sunscreen when there are others out there with zinc/titanium as the active ingredients that DON&#x27;T leave such an extreme white cast. I might use it when I&#x27;m cycling just to get use out of it (after all, no one can see how white your face is when you&#x27;re breezing past at 15+ mph). But I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Simply comes off in water.  I surf, so I constantly am covered with sunblock and I know what is good vs not.  I thought this would be better than other common sunblock because it has zinc and is pricey, but it promptly will come off in the water and you will get burned.  spf30 banana boat is way cheaper and will not come off.  This cerave is spf 50, so I should be getting much more protection, but I got way less.  California has very consistant cloudless skies, so its easy to compare.  Maybe if you do not go into the water its ok, if you do, forget it..</li>
            <li> I wish I read these reviews before buying this in stores. I use Cerave body lotion and loved it, so I thought I&#x27;d look for a sunscreen for my face. I have light treatments for a skin condition and needed this during my treatments and when I need to go out. Unfortunately, I limited my use of this lotion for therapy only. No matter the amount or attempts to smooth over my skin, the lotion appears very white. I absolutely need to use this all over my face, and I look like I&#x27;ve put baby powder on. I have tried to moisturize before putting on the sunscreen, but it does not make a difference. My skin is fairly tan, so I doubt this could be remedied without some sort of makeup combination that someone else mentioned here. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, nor do I plan on wearing any just because my sunscreen won&#x27;t match my tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only sunscreen I&#x27;ve really liked (that does have a tint) is Cotz. I was wary of it because I was afraid it was makeup, but it goes on so smoothly. It&#x27;s feels very light, and the natural skin tone blends so well with my tan skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line: I love Cerave&#x27;s moisturizing lotion, but I cannot say the same for this sunscreen. As a sunscreen, it works well. As an invisible sunscreen--not so much.</li>
            <li> Applies great and feels good.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for long days in the sun.  Yes, you do have to re-apply it every 80 minutes, and by lunch time, wipe off the old and apply more.  But it works better than the chemical sunblocks (it is titanium and zinc, natural elements which make an actual physical barrier to sun) and I find it more comfortable than the &amp;#34;N&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li> as other reviewers said, there&#x27;s nothing invisible about this.  It&#x27;s a white paste that stays white no matter how much you spread and rub.  Even worst, it seems to make itself comfortable in the slightest dry patch I have on my face and accentuate it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen blocks most of the sun. I can stay out for hours after putting it on and not notice any redness. It is a little viscous, so I mix it with a little water. The result is a more white complexion almost like mime. But at least I don&#x27;t feel trapped in a box</li>
            <li> I decided to give this CeraVe sunscreen a try after discovering that the store was out of my usual Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free SPF50. I&#x27;m naturally very fair so, if it&#x27;s leaving a white cast, I&#x27;m not seeing it. I do not like the texture however. It&#x27;s quite sticky and a bit heavy on my skin, so I generally use a blotting sheet about 20 minutes after application, before applying any makeup. On a mildly positive note, it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect how my makeup wears.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, I really like it</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers here that I was at first disappointed with the false advertising about &amp;#34;invisible zinc&amp;#34;; however, this brand is superior for me.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores like 100% of other brands, it&#x27;s unscented and hypoallergenic -- I&#x27;m allergic to 95% of the products on the market, and it seems to help in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to wear sunscreen for decades because of hereditary blotching from the sun/light.  I can&#x27;t say that sunscreen helps that much, but it certainly has protected my skin from the abuse I can put it thru somedays being outside in the sun all day.  I wear it religiously and I will continue to trust this brand over many of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best not to wear this sunscreen on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at WalMart wanting to try out a different sunscreen with zinc oxide without the standard strong smell. However this sunscreen does have a different strong chemical smell which I did not like at all. As I put it on, I wanted to pinch my nose shut. It blended well, until it started to form a white, chalky film over my face. As I waited for it to dry, I started to look pasty and cakey which isn&#x27;t good since my skin tone is light brown. I don&#x27;t totally mind since I wear makeup over this, but it&#x27;s still something negatively notable from something that claims for the zinc to be invisible.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible. It clumps and is so thick that it is abrasive when applying. It stays white and does not blend in. Would be better off wallowing in mud for sun protection.</li>
            <li> While this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, wearing it gives me ghost face.  :(</li>
            <li> I play sports in the sun every weekend sometimes for more than five hours at a time.  I spend a lot of my time being called “ghost face” due to the different sunscreens I have used over the years.  I generally opt for the zinc based ones because they don’t sting my eyes or irritate my skin when I sweat.  I have very sensitive skin and burn very easily.  I wear a 15-30 SPF on a daily basis and then often supplement with an additional sunscreen when I will be outdoors for extended periods of time.  I was a little skeptical of this product since I didn’t really see how it was possible to have a really good sunscreen that didn’t sting my eyes and didn’t leave me looking like Casper.  Then I read some of the reviews and saw a lot of people were complaining about the cream not rubbing in.  I like CereVe products and decided to give it a try anyway.  I think most people who reviewed this and found the product to be not as clear as it claims have perhaps not tried many alternatives.  This is by far better for skin absorption than any other alternative I have tried.  Neutrogena for babies, Coppertone for babies, alba organic sunscreen etc.  I haven’t given it the official all day sun test so I can’t comment on that yet, but so far I don’t think the rub in situation is a reason not to purchase this product.  Try using another moisturizer first like coconut oil or CereVe moisturizing lotion when you get out of the shower or wash your face and then rub this in.  Maybe if you are just looking for a sunscreen you can carry around for whenever and don’t have particularly sensitive skin I can understand why this might not be the product for you.  I will update once I have given this more than the rub in update.  If CereVe could get rid of Parabens in its products I would give this a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> As a person with dermatology problems, I find I&#x27;m being very well protected from harmful cancer causing sun rays. No more white noses &amp; lips. It blends to your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love this! It ACTUALLY makes my skin look BETTER! I even use at night sometimes,  as it feels good, heals and seems to improve the look of my skin!</li>
            <li> My son seems to be allergic to many sunscreens when applied to his face. He would almost be in years from the pain- especially mid day when it is reapply time. After trying 12 different brands from baby screens to sensitive skin items, I stumbled upon this brand and now it is what we use exclusively. It does tend to leave some white areas when not rubbed in but our main goal is no sunburn and no tears! Problem solved for us! If sunscreen burns your face this might be your solution too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure that this clogged many of my pores. I never get issues with my forehead and I used this for several days and not it&#x27;s all messed up. Lost respect for this brand despite the hype</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe because I have sensitive skin so I wanted to try the sunscreen. I learned that most sunscreens on the market are actually chemically based and is not good for your skin. The fact that this item has titanium dioxide and zinc oxide I was sold!! Those are the two ingredients your skin needs for sun protection. I am very tan and as much as I tried to rub it in I was white as a ghost and my friends told me I looked ashy!! I do believe this product works. I just wish it didn&#x27;t leave my skin so ghostly like!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the body lotion and facial lotion but will search for another sunscreen with the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product on amazon. Wish I had looked at amazon reviews first as I would have saved myself some money . I have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin. I was hoping this product would replace a $33.00 one and a quarter ounce tube of facial sunscreen I am currently using. The CeraVe sunscreen  causes my face to burn, has an odor worse than the usual sunscreen odor, is heavy, greasy, and (like many others have said) makes my face white.  Please do not purchase this product if you have sensitive skin.  Also, Do not purchase sport face oil free lotion broad spectrum 70+  by neutrogena or oxygen zone free sunscreen  lotion SPF 50  by ology if you have sensitive skin: both caused a burning sensation on me.</li>
            <li> All CeraVe products are wonderful. I use this sunblock every day and love it. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy and goes on smoothly under my makeup.</li>
            <li> CeraVe SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion, 2 Ounce its ok</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe skin products, so I was excited when I saw this product at the drug store. Unfortunately, the sunscreen turned my face bright white.  I rubbed it in for a long time, but it would not fade. It would have been funny if I hadn&#x27;t spent so much money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pale skin to start with -- maybe it would work on someone with darker skin. But this product just looked horrible on me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair sensitive skin, and so do my kids. We also are very acne prone. CeraVe was recommended by the dermatologist for my daughters eczema. I use it also. The sunblock is one of the best I have ever found. The key is to apply small amounts instead of one big glob, then trying to hurry it around. A slight, white-ish cast is a small price for excellent sun protection. I have used probably everything there is. They all (except for the Japanese ones?! How do they do it??? And why can&#x27;t we???!!.,...) feel like OILY goopy gross-ness! I always laugh when I see &amp;#34;no oily feel&amp;#34;-so in fact, WHAT IS that weird &#x27;OILY&#x27; feeling-oh chemistry makers of sunblocks?!!??.. This one has by far the lesser feel of the weird oiliness! I prefer a physical sunblock like zinc-it blocks rays as opposed to absorbing them, hmmm.. I don&#x27;t like the small bottle for 4 people :-( We also live in one of the most hot, sunniest places in the U.S. &amp; this sunblock passes the test! If they can get rid of some of the last of the oily goopiness feeling and make it bigger they will be my heroes!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the lotion so I decided to try it.  Too thick and gooey.  Had to throw it away. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> It was great on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well for me. It is made of finely-ground zinc oxide, so it contains no harmful chemicals. By the same token, however, it IS a fine suspension of white mineral particles, so if you are worried about looking a little paler than usual, buy a chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Right Aid and actually really liked it. It does leave your face kind of white if you apply too much of it. And I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative reviews. A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and my face never got burnt. The active ingredient list looks excellent. That is what should be included in any sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to start using this suncscreen. It&#x27;s both affordable, comes with a decent amount, a high amount of SPF, and contains good ingredients! But it absolutely does not absorb into my skin at all. I&#x27;ve worn it around the entire day, and no matter what I try to apply on top, no matter how long I wait before applying make up, or after applying moisturizer, 5 minutes after moisturizer, while my skin is still wet, 15 minutes after, an hour, then once it&#x27;s on, 15 minutes to let it set, 20 minutes to let it set, an hour, no make up at all, different types of powders, foundations, people will walk up to me and say, &amp;#34;What is that on your face?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;You have something there...&amp;#34; Oh, no, heh, that&#x27;s my sunscreen. It just clumps around. I&#x27;ve tried about 20 different types of suncreens so far and this is by far the worst. I&#x27;ve never had the patience to write a bad review about a suncreen before, but this one, holy moly, I am NOT happy.</li>
            <li> I have two separate experiences with this sunscreen. My mother purchased a bottle from a Walgreens on our way to the beach. Gave it a try and really liked it. Had a few white areas that I had to re-rub in so if you are concerned about it not rubbing in for that &#x27;invisible&#x27; effect, apply and then spot check  yourself fifteen minutes or so later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this very positive experience with the product that she had purchased from the Walgreens, I purchased a bottle from Amazon. It was nearly half the price of what it cost at Walgreens. However, it did not work as sunscreen this time. I applied the same way, reapplied just as frequently, and used at a beach as well. Given that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible that the bottle I received from Amazon was expired or if it was stored in a manner that damaged the ingredients. I have used it twice since then, and am getting no sun protection from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have just had bad luck with this bottle from Amazon, but the product when purchased elsewhere worked well for me ( a fair skinned Irish-American)</li>
            <li> I learned from painful experience that my neck and upper chest react violently (red, sore, itchy) to homosalate, an ingredient in most sunscreens. So I was delighted to find this sunscreen that does not contain homosalate. I use it only on my neck, which is the sensitive area, and I don&#x27;t notice any visible whiteness if I rub it in well. I&#x27;m very grateful for a sunscreen I can use, since I have a history of skin cancer. It is gentle on my sensitive skin, and that&#x27;s what I need.</li>
            <li> first time to order this product but delivery was as promised and product works well...</li>
            <li> I found mine at a Rite-Aid Pharmacy and nabbed it to try. But it is this exact product. I love, love, love this stuff. Any lotions or foundations that contain traditional sunscreens tend to break my face out and I just can&#x27;t stand smelling the sunscreen smell all day long. But having a previous melanoma on my face, I&#x27;m under strict \\&quot;wear sunscreen at all times\\&quot; orders. This sunscreen finally does exactly what I need it to perfectly. It has no odor and it does not break out my skin. I&#x27;m so happy I could cheer and do a jig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers (here and on other sites) indicate that it is gloopy and/or leaves a white film. It certainly can and will if you splat a bunch in your palm and just smear it on. If I&#x27;m wearing it alone, I do small areas at the time and I&#x27;ve been fine with it. What I normally do, however, is mix it with my foundation in the palm of my hand first (I get the foundation a shade darker than I want so I can mix it with the sunscreen or standard lotion and have it come out the shade I want) and then spread that on my face. It works a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it boils down to what you&#x27;re looking for. In my case, I could overlook some minor white film if it gets me daily facial sunscreen that 1. doesn&#x27;t break me out and 2. doesn&#x27;t have the dreaded sunscreen smell. I should note, if I&#x27;m going to the beach or doing anything that requires what I would consider more intense sunscreen needs, I use a stronger and different sunscreen that also has water/sweatproofing and just deal with the breakout or smell. This is my DAILY WEAR sunscreen for my face. And I really just couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without Cerave PM moisturizer and Cerave hydrating cleanser, so I was eagerly awaiting their new sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good physical sunscreen and Cerave said this one was lightweight and invisible.  This sounded perfect, but sadly it is neither of those things.  It is thick and pasty, glops up in hairline and brows, sits heavily on top of the skin, and leaves a strong white cast.  I applied it everywhere but my eyelids and it looked like I was wearing eye shadow - that&#x27;s how much it lightened the rest of my face.  I&#x27;m fair skinned to begin with (which is why I need spf 50) so that&#x27;s excessive.  It&#x27;s too heavy to cover with makeup.  The good is that it&#x27;s unscented (hooray), it doesn&#x27;t seem to break me out, and so far I haven&#x27;t burned through it.  However, I will have to use it up working in the yard as I can&#x27;t wear it out in public.</li>
            <li> This was terrible sunscreen. I am very pale and the white cast was awful and it didn&#x27;t go away. It didn&#x27;t even apply evenly. It was very thick and difficult to get on without rubbing my skin too hard. I still used the entire thing, but that&#x27;s because it never broke me out.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this. He said the best thing to do for your skin is onscreen and this is his favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a sunscreen that will protect us from UV rays and actually get used by the family.  I bought CeraVe SPF 50 for our most recent beach vacation.  I liked the fact that it had zinc and titanium dioxide, so we gave it a try.  I was even more excited by the &amp;#34;invisible zinc&amp;#34; claim, since the kids hate sunscreen that leaves them white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zinc in this may be invisible, so it must be the titanium dioxide in this that left us white faced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with what I like...I used this for a one week vacation that involved a lot of time in the sun and I did not get burned or even tanned, so I&#x27;m very happy with the SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream was thick and spread OK on my skin. I could see exactly where it was because of the white residue, but it never rubbed in completely or disappeared.  After one use the kids refused to use it again.  I didn&#x27;t care so much.  It was unlikely that I&#x27;d run into any friends on this vacation and I did see a lot of badly burned tourists and did not want to join their ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I appreciate the protection that this sunscreen offered, I won&#x27;t be using it daily.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it under makeup.  It&#x27;s strictly a no-makeup, beach/pool sunscreen for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t match with the description of the product, I hate it, its oily and if using a small amount, still leave the face white. It is not a  lightweight formula and it does not spreads easily, when it dries it does with a white finish.  I am not really sure this is the real product Cerave, cause all the Cerave products I tried before are really as expected except this one, a friend of mine said that its a fake,  I don&#x27;t recommend buying it, if you are not going to like it and then if you want to returned it, you need to mail it with a tracking number, so you are sure they receive it, for the price its not good deal!  Very disappointed! waist of your money don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and found it to leave a white residue.  It did not apply smoothly (even though I used small amounts and targeted one part of my face at a time) and the white film did not disappear with time.  It is not a product I will use.&lt;br /&gt;La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 is my usual go-to sunscreen but I thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who may have a similar complaint, you might want to give Valeant Pharmaceuticals a call.  You will need your packaging and a receipt, but I was able to request a refund by calling 1-800-321-4576.  I will have to return the product, box and mail in a receipt copy, but the Valeant representative couldn&#x27;t have been nicer.</li>
            <li> Just one more reviewer letting you know that this product leaves your face a white, white, white that doesn&#x27;t fade. Ghastly.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is good for protecting your skin agains sun damage, specially if you are outdoors a lot, of if you are performing any sports. However, using it everyday is not very recommended as it leaves your skin a bit &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Yes, it leaves an annoying white cast if you don&#x27;t have recently moisturized skin or if you apply in a hurry. I&#x27;m lucky that my skin is pretty much white either way, so it only shows near my brows and hairline and that&#x27;s nothing a quick swipe with a tissue hasn&#x27;t eliminated. Wears really well under my makeup and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy! But best of all for me: every other brand of facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve EVER tried has made my skin sting all day and that always deterred me from wanting to wear facial sunscreen. My sister swears by Cerave&#x27;s other products so I tried this and I am SO HAPPY that I did!!! My face doesn&#x27;t hurt!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes, since all the other Cerave products I have used have been truly fantastic.  This, however, misses the mark in a BIG way.  The smell is incredibly strong and smells of petrol, which is hard to take so close to the nose.  The \\&quot;Invisible\\&quot; claim is ridiculous, unless you consider having a zinc-blue glow over your face to be \\&quot;invisible\\&quot;.  Maybe I just don&#x27;t look good with blue skin, but I really can&#x27;t recommend this sunscreen to anybody.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> As many have said, it&#x27;s not invisible. It will definitely turn your face white, especially if you have stubble on your face. I don&#x27;t care about that because I use it when cycling and hiking so I&#x27;m not concerned with how I look. The bottom line for me is that the performance is unbeatable. I have tried many, many \\&quot;sport\\&quot; sunscreens and this stuff is great. No sunscreen smell, dry to the touch (not greasy), it never runs (I sweat heavily), and frankly, because it turns your face white, you can easily see any spots you missed before heading out. Fantastic UVA and UVB protection and I rarely need to re-apply.</li>
            <li> Leaves a white residue behind</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive to use chemical sunscreens on a daily basis. This product is a physical sunblock which does not irritate my face or neck. In the past, I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free, another physical sunblock, which is formulated as a suspension with a more watery base. The CeraVe product has a lotion consistency which I like better. In the winter, the very slight white-ish cast is not really noticeable. In the summer, I use a foundation over this so my face doesn&#x27;t contrast with the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Rite Aid on the recommendation of a friend. In photos, your face glares white from the zinc oxide. It also didn&#x27;t end up being &amp;#34;breakout free&amp;#34; as it claims. Got some beauties from it. Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> Good product and sunscreen, ex</li>
            <li> i love the moisturizing cream but this sun screen is thick. not good for everyday under make up. it does contain zinc and it shows, probably real good for sun protection at beach or outdoor activity.</li>
            <li> Another great Cerave product! I read the reviews with so many people saying that it&#x27;s not invisible and leaves a white film but tried it anyway. I have olive skin and I use about a nickel sized amount and rub it in thoroughly one area at a time on my neck and face and any white film just disappears.  I feel anyone using this who says it leaves a white film is probably not rubbing it in properly.  Love that it has ceramides and niacinamides. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ive tried a ton of sunscreen  this works the best  I managed to come back from a week at the beach without a sunburnt child</li>
            <li> Super coverage!  Light &amp; not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Covers face very well and doesn&#x27;t appear thick &amp; greasy.  Will purchase again soon!</li>
            <li> CeraVe SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion is a great sunscreen for your face that feels nice on, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and doesn&#x27;t run in your eyes.  Unlike others, I have found that, after it is rubbed in, this sunscreen does not look white on me.  It is only noticeable if you get it on your eyebrows.  That said, like other zinc-containing products, though less so, you can&#x27;t just slather it on and expect it to disappear; you do have to rub it in.  My only complaint is the small size of the tube for the price, although it does go a long way.  I can easily coat my face and neck with a fairly small amount, and expect the tube to last me at least the rest of the summer.  I use a less expensive zinc-based sunscreen on my body, but that product made my face break out, whereas the CeraVe product does not.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out very easily, and always breaks out when I use sunscreen. After trying the breakout free Neutrogena and still getting acne, I stood in CVS and compared the active ingredients of all the facial sunscreens. The active ingredients in this one were different from all the others. I was hesitant to purchase this because Cera Ve face wash caused my skin to become inflamed and I had huge breakouts while using. However, my face hasn&#x27;t had a major break out while using this sunscreen. I still got one or two very small spots, but nothing in comparison to after using other sunscreens. Seems to work too, I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn, though I don&#x27;t burn easily so I might not be the best source for those who do burn easily. Overall good product if you have acne prone skin like mine!</li>
            <li> It has the ingredients of a SPF50, however the combination of sunblock, and lotion just doesn&#x27;t work in this case. This product is of somewhat thick consistency, which makes it hard to distribute over the face. In addition to this, it also leaves the skin white. Regardless, it still does the job of protecting your skin. Will updat when I figure out how to apply this, to avoid the whiteness,if possible...</li>
            <li> The reason this seems to be thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin is because it has zinc oxide.  However, many of the newer/popular sunscreens that contain Oxybenzone which is a penetration enhancer and has been proven to cause Cancer.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I get an oil free physical (as opposed to chemical) sunscreen for my acne prone skin. I found this at Ulta and it was a decent price compared to other brands I&#x27;ve seen online. I LOVE this sunscreen. A pea sized amount covers my whole face. There is absolutely NO greasy feeling and no nasty smell. It goes perfectly under makeup. It makes me look a little pale but not noticeably so. I am very active outdoors and I usually hate wearing sunscreen but with this sunscreen I&#x27;ll be much better about protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of this initially but my sensitive skin started feeling hot and burny from it within about 15 minutes of putting it on and I wasn&#x27;t even in the sun yet.  It definitely has a light feel, like most zinc based sunscreens it does have a light white film that will make you look a little bit pale but it&#x27;s not as white as the goopier brands.  I bought this specifically because it was supposed to be good for sensitive skin, I like their non-sunscreen facial moisturizer and cleanser a lot so I had high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.  If you only have mildly sensitive skin this may work well for you.  It didn&#x27;t for me.  The thicker glide on sunscreen stick they sell didn&#x27;t (chemical) burn me quite as much so I just put that on my nose and cheeks and wear a hat.  I passed this on to my husband and it works well for him.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this since I love and enjoy just about every CeraVe product I&#x27;ve ever tried. Sadly, this sunscreen was a huge disappointment. Not only is the consistency too thick, but worst of all, it settles to a noticeably white, chalky finish which is unflattering. Throughout the day it dries further and begins to flake off the skin. I cannot recommend this product. I do like the mineral SPF aspect, and not wanting it to go to waste, I&#x27;ve resorted to applying it on the backs of my hands to protect them while driving. But as a facial sunscreen this stuff is honestly awful. Too bad, because as I said I am generally pleased with this brand.</li>
            <li> So disappointed! It&#x27;s like smearing white paint onto your face. It doesn&#x27;t really soak in well enough and is left on your face like zinc. Makes you makeup look funny</li>
            <li> White zinc oxide settles into face and neck creases.  This is not invisable! I don&#x27;t recommend.  Nothing more to say.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days and had a red rash all over my face. I had to go to the dermatologist and get a prescription for a topical steroid to get rid of the rash. I contacted CeraVe about it, and I never got a reply.</li>
            <li> I purchase because I used their body sunscreen.  It goes on really nice, extremely lightweight and I feel it gives very good protection.  I did not purchase through Amazon -- I will do next time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY PLEASED with this sunscreen.  I once stupidly overexposed my neck to strong sun on a beach without using sunscreen (and I was taking a Rx diuretic that specifically warned against sun exposure while using----how stupid can I get????).  Well anyhow, I was left for MONTHS with a chronically itchy neck.  Even though I applied a chemical based sunscreen faithfully on my neck, EVERY time my neck was exposed to the sun it felt like someone was holding a hot hair dryer an inch from my skin, and the itching would intensify so much that I&#x27;d wake up with rake lines on my neck where I was scratching as I slept.  Hydrocortisone would help tame the itch for a short while, but  the dermatologist warned that overuse of hydrocortisone would thin my skin.  I thought I would never be able to go outside again without wrapping a scarf around my neck (NOT fun in summer heat!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has allowed me to go outdoors and enjoy the day with NO MORE itchy skin after I go out in the sun!  I only use a TINY bit evenly applied over my neck and gently rub it in thoroughly--it is a physical sunblock, so a very thin skim of the zinc is all it takes to protect against the sun.  I do NOT notice any &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; look after application (my skin tone is medium-light).  I apply it to my neck EVERY DAY, including in winter, since even sun exposure through a car window can start the heat-itch cycle.  Just in case I might ever forget to put it on, I even carry some in a tiny container in my purse---I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it since it saves me from misery..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from it&#x27;s extraordinary protection form the sun, it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. The price on Amazon (with free shipping) beats the Walmart price!</li>
            <li> That they even call this clear is a joke. It&#x27;s not quite as bad as putting zinc oxide paste on your face, but it&#x27;s pretty close. Doesn&#x27;t soak in. Just embarrassingly white. It&#x27;s going in the trash. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product, it was very tacky and heavy, had a bad whitecast. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those reasons.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin white. False advertisement!</li>
            <li> this product leaves a white film on the skin.  Also, although it&#x27;s supposed to be a facial sunscreen, but it caused my face, after a few uses, to develop red blotchy areas.  A much better product at half the price is Coppertone Oilfree faces 50SPF.</li>
            <li> Helpful hints for first-time WDW visitors.</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe products and always like to have a zinc sunscreen.  I feel protected with this, but it takes more effort to get it to absorb and it does not do well under makeup.</li>
            <li> This will make your face look white because of the zinc. Not a problem in the winter but it was too weird on a daily basis in the summer. I only use this when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen as I thought CeraVe was a reputable company.&lt;br /&gt;It says SPF50.&lt;br /&gt;My face was white as a clown after I used this product. It does not get absorbed by the skin but stays on top&lt;br /&gt;of your skin and STAYS WHITE.&lt;br /&gt;I looked ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Rather spend the money on another TERRIFIC product which so far I have only been able to purchase on Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Sport. It is the same price as Cerave and the WHITE mask disappears after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It works great.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the CeraVe because if it had worked, it was more readily available (in stores) than the Blue Lizard&lt;br /&gt;line. I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> I have never bought a bad product of CeraVe until now. It is impossible to rub in. Isn&#x27;t smooth at all! It ends up making my face look like a ghost. Not really the look I want. This was a total surprise coming from CeraVe. I use all kinds of their products and love the rest of them...NOT this one...too bad....</li>
            <li> I would like this is a bigger size...2 oz. is a bit small....I will look for it next time.....</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers that this does leave a white cast on the skin right after application, so at first I was a bit skeptical, but after giving it a few minutes to set It is no longer white and my skin does not feel greasy or heavy. It provides great protection from the sun and since I have melasma I need a good physical, and not chemical sunscreen. I only wish you got a little more for your $$</li>
            <li> I was really amped to try this when I saw it at the store. I work in a dermatology practice and we love all Cerave products and recommend them to patients, so I thought this would be another slam dunk product. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s absolutely not. I almost exclusively use physical blockers as my sunscreen, so I know that with some it takes a few minutes for the white tint to soak in. But this product simply doesn&#x27;t, and even with vigorous rubbing I found it collecting near my eyes, around my nose, etc. And I don&#x27;t want to have to rub that hard on the skin on my face anyways; it&#x27;s delicate skin that shouldn&#x27;t be manipulated to that degree. I was bummed but thought perhaps it would still be okay to use on my body just to get rid of the product so I didn&#x27;t feel it was a total waste, but it&#x27;s been 15 minutes of rubbing and it&#x27;s still all kinds of white on my arms. Disappointing product, and nothing like the Cerave AM facial moisturizer so many of  us love and use!! No wonder the Cerave product reps never came in and gave us samples of this to give to patients; it&#x27;s a total dud.</li>
            <li> Good insulation effect, high spf. I used this sunscreen directly after the painted eyebrows out more good-looking, beautiful eyebrow color.</li>
            <li> I have been through a lot of sunblocks in my life and this one has the worst staying power of any of them. I don&#x27;t know what ingredient is responsible for this, but basically, when you put it on, it produces a sort of powdery white top layer that either sticks to your skin or (even better!) goes EVERYWHERE. I put some on my face, arms, and legs, and even with giving it a few minutes to dry, it very quickly ended up all over my shorts, shirtsleeves, and in fact the entire top of my shirt from the collarbones up. It looked like some sort of hilariously awful deodorant accident and I ended up having to wash my shirt out in a friend&#x27;s sink. Fortunately, most of it came off with soap and water, but that&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous that they call this &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; zinc.  I bought it on this &amp;#34;fact&amp;#34; alone.  Buy this only if you want to look like you smeared toothpaste all over your face.</li>
            <li> It caused me to break out in a horrible rash. So in addition to not being able to use the product, I had to buy an expensive prescription to treat the rash. Ugh!</li>
