    <ol>
            <li>Great product and affordable!</li>
            <li>This used to be the best mascara</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!!!!  </li>
            <li>that being said, this is still an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Great at adding length.</li>
            <li>I have bought this item in the store and loved it.</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion and blondish hair  </li>
            <li>Good masacara.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s good if you might be out in the rain or something and don&#x27;t want your mascara to run.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and affordable mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and it doesnt smear on my lids like most do even when they SAY waterproof!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy to find it available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and it comes off nicely with the mascara remover (Maybelline Expert Eyes, oily).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mascara years ago (pre-fiber) and I LOVED it because it was smooth, lengthened and separated my lashes.</li>
            <li>Even though Amazon is great finding items cheaper, you might want to check Walmarts first.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara...</li>
            <li>BUT WHY IT IS BETTER PRICED HERE</li>
            <li>I love the length emphasis and separate lashes, rather than sticking them together.  </li>
            <li>This is mascara (formula) is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>For a fraction of the price of high-end mascara, my lashes look a million times better.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>I’ve gotten so many compliments on it after I began using that</li>
            <li>My lashes are finally nice and long again (like they use to be in my youth, lol).  </li>
            <li>It applies easily and the fibers don&#x27;t clump or come off even if you layer it without waiting to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it must be mentioned that the silver paint on the tube flakes off easily and sticks to your fingers and face.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of flaking off during the day as some mascara&#x27;s do, which is important to contact wearers.</li>
            <li>Great product- will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about this mascara.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff, better than fake lashes , lasts ALL day and looks AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my current favorite, but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li>Don’t even try to pump this thing full of Visine, it won’t work.</li>
            <li>I would have give it 5 Stars but the brush is so la la, and will probably work super for those that have thicker lashes then me....</li>
            <li>for best results, apply several coats to one eye at a time, not letting them dry in between.</li>
            <li>ALL DRIED UP.NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li>This one filled the bill and stays on very well.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara out of all of them so far.</li>
            <li>And not in the spidery gross kind of way.</li>
            <li>With all the different products out there this is def one of my top 5 picks.</li>
            <li>So I have to top it off with flower zoom in ultimate mascara.</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply (I apply at a slight angle going upwards on the top lashes and rub gently side to side on the bottom lashes).</li>
            <li>I love this mascara,make your lashes really long, you can wear it all day without problems and smudges.</li>
            <li>I find the increased cost (with the mascara alone and with having to purchase it more often than other types) worth it.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself was dry and clumpy and even if the brush had been better, the liquid would have still be too viscous to flow.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and when I put on additional coats for evening it turns to &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; quickly.</li>
            <li>I have short Asian lashes and this mascara gives my lashes amazing length but does not make my lashes fuller.</li>
            <li>I really need a mascara with fibers that is waterproof.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and have been using it for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>This mascara did not give me nearly as much length as I wanted.</li>
            <li>The only true thing about it is that it really is Waterproof.</li>
            <li>Not only does it go on nicely to make the lashes longer, but also holds up when you sweat (where other waterproof crumble off) ...</li>
            <li>Anyway, Illegal Length has topped all others I have tried (great for short/skimpy lashes).</li>
            <li>and I noticed its just like any normal mascara,there were no fibers.</li>
            <li>It went right into the trash, I got out the waterproof mascara remover and started over with a different brand.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>I then add a second coat with another product that gives my lashes more volume, based upon reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my old self!</li>
            <li>it looked horrible and this much more economical product did the trick WAY better!</li>
            <li>I am looking for a replacement for Maybelline XXL mascara, which now seems to be hard to find in the stores, but I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not to clumpy and give me lashes a natural look as if I were born with them.</li>
            <li>This product does not clump which is extremely natural looking.</li>
            <li>Prefer the round brush better, also it is not the same mascara as it was in 2006.</li>
            <li>I liked the thin brush.  </li>
            <li>I applied it to my right eye ,regular mascara to my left eye.</li>
            <li>I wanted a fiber mascara but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $30.00 for other brands.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for long, natural looking lashes, this is for you.</li>
            <li>The fibers in this stick to your natural lashes, therefore making it look as if you have long lashes by nature.</li>
            <li>This brand and type was highly reviewed on other sites and a magazine.</li>

            <li> This brand and type was highly reviewed on other sites and a magazine.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look really long</li>
            <li> Unlike other &amp;#34;lengthening&amp;#34; mascaras this one stays on a lot longer (and I don&#x27;t use the waterproof one) and the fibers that actually make your lashes longer stay on for hours.  </li>
            <li> Formula was dry and wish it lived up to up to its name.</li>
            <li> It was already on the dry side.</li>
            <li> My tried and true mascara proved to make my lashes longer and thicker with just one coat compared to two coats of the illegal length mascara.</li>
            <li> I like that it is one product as opposed to loose fibers that then have to be sealed with a separate application.  </li>
            <li> It is rather hard to find in the town that I live</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps I got a bad tube, but since there are others to try I would recommend you start with them.  :-)</li>
            <li> It is harder and harder to find in town...</li>
            <li> I have used the non-waterproof version of this mascara before and thought it was ok, but when I tried the waterproof one this weekend it was dry, cakey and clumpy - I was sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The first use proved that wrong for me.  </li>
            <li> I did not see any fibers in it, and did not see any difference between it and any other non-fiber mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> However when I received my mascara it must have been old because it never applied on very thick and seemed almost empty.</li>
            <li> If you want thin natural eyelashes, go for it,but you can&#x27;t layer it well</li>
            <li> But by late afternoon, there are little crumbles and a tiny bit of raccoon eye.</li>
            <li> If you typically replace your mascara after 3 months, with this you might need to do every 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries out faster than the normal mascara,and its uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> black is too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding brownish black in stores</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, the mascara dried out and began to flake immediately after application despite having lashes without residual mascara from the previous day.</li>
            <li> or they&#x27;re sticking out at a weird angle from your natural lash.</li>
            <li> I went into Sephora a few months ago and they put some $40 mascara on me...</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few cons though, which is why I couldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get it in black and it makes my eyelashes pop!</li>
            <li> The tiny brush was useless to lengthen lashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure why some vendors are selling this item (ie; 4 packs for $70+ dollars, craaaaazy).</li>
            <li> However it is extremely hard to take off with neutrogena makeup remover wipes!</li>
            <li> I really do like this mascara but am disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t come in brown!  </li>
            <li> It is also very hard to rewet this.</li>
            <li> (which was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;, not great</li>
            <li> way to long brush it is horrible</li>
            <li> and it is very uncomfortable to put on.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this purchase and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It gets really annoying when trying to apply makeup.</li>

            <li> I have bought this item in the store and loved it. However when I received my mascara it must have been old because it never applied on very thick and seemed almost empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara years ago (pre-fiber) and I LOVED it because it was smooth, lengthened and separated my lashes. It still does those things and the fibers can make your lashes longer, but sometimes they clump together or they&#x27;re sticking out at a weird angle from your natural lash. It&#x27;s not my current favorite, but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara...it&#x27;s not to clumpy and give me lashes a natural look as if I were born with them. With all the different products out there this is def one of my top 5 picks.</li>
            <li> One of the few mascaras that really does not smear.  Have been using this product for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> ALL DRIED UP.NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> This used to be the best mascara BUT Maybelline decided to change the brush to square and it is very uncomfortable to put on.  Prefer the round brush better, also it is not the same mascara as it was in 2006. Switching to another maybelline mascara.</li>
            <li> This brand and type was highly reviewed on other sites and a magazine. The first use proved that wrong for me.  The tiny brush was useless to lengthen lashes.

            <li> I really need a mascara with fibers that is waterproof.  This one filled the bill and stays on very well.  I have eye allergies which tends to cause eye watering and so I have to have waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara,make your lashes really long, you can wear it all day without problems and smudges.I use it on both upper and lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Great at adding length. After using it for a few weeks, the mascara dried out and began to flake immediately after application despite having lashes without residual mascara from the previous day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and affordable mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I really do like this mascara but am disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t come in brown!  I have a fair complexion and blondish hair  black is too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have been using it for a couple of years.  It is rather hard to find in the town that I live so I&#x27;m happy to find it available on Amazon.

            <li> way to long brush it is horrible and it also flakes into my contacts</li>
            <li> CAN NOT FIND THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE CHEAPER. i TAKE THIS OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE DAILY. I COULD GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT BUT WHY IT IS BETTER PRICED HERE</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff, better than fake lashes , lasts ALL day and looks AMAZING!!! I always buy three at a time!</li>
            <li> I have short Asian lashes and this mascara gives my lashes amazing length but does not make my lashes fuller. So I have to top it off with flower zoom in ultimate mascara. This product does not clump which is extremely natural looking.However it is extremely hard to take off with neutrogena makeup remover wipes! But because it gives my lashes such length i will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> Good masacara.  I liked the thin brush.  Seemed to dry out quickly. Did smear some for being waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love the length emphasis and separate lashes, rather than sticking them together.  But by late afternoon, there are little crumbles and a tiny bit of raccoon eye.</li>
            <li> This is mascara (formula) is outstanding.  Not only does it go on nicely to make the lashes longer, but also holds up when you sweat (where other waterproof crumble off) ... and it comes off nicely with the mascara remover (Maybelline Expert Eyes, oily).  I would have give it 5 Stars but the brush is so la la, and will probably work super for those that have thicker lashes then me....but it does go on ok.  I rather use the comb-on wand from the mascara \\&quot;Stilouette\\&quot; (spelling), which I use for all of the mascaras I have tried.  Anyway, Illegal Length has topped all others I have tried (great for short/skimpy lashes). My lashes are finally nice and long again (like they use to be in my youth, lol).  They finally touch my eyebrows again.  ;-)  PS:  Even though Amazon is great finding items cheaper, you might want to check Walmarts first.  Not sure why some vendors are selling this item (ie; 4 packs for $70+ dollars, craaaaazy).</li>
            <li> Great product- will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.  I wanted a fiber mascara but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $30.00 for other brands.  I like that it is one product as opposed to loose fibers that then have to be sealed with a separate application.  for best results, apply several coats to one eye at a time, not letting them dry in between.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara out of all of them so far. It is harder and harder to find in town... I love it! It makes my lashes look really long and it doesnt smear on my lids like most do even when they SAY waterproof!</li>
            <li> I am looking for a replacement for Maybelline XXL mascara, which now seems to be hard to find in the stores, but I absolutely love. Tried this one, but it does not even come close. I did not see any fibers in it, and did not see any difference between it and any other non-fiber mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. The only true thing about it is that it really is Waterproof.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this mascara. I get it in black and it makes my eyelashes pop! And not in the spidery gross kind of way. Easy to apply (I apply at a slight angle going upwards on the top lashes and rub gently side to side on the bottom lashes). For a fraction of the price of high-end mascara, my lashes look a million times better. I went into Sephora a few months ago and they put some $40 mascara on me... it looked horrible and this much more economical product did the trick WAY better! It lasts me a while. I only have to restock every two months or so and I use it almost daily.Makes my lashes fuller, darker, and longer. I am constantly complimented on my lashes! I will never ever ever use anything but this mascara!</li>
            <li> Unlike other &amp;#34;lengthening&amp;#34; mascaras this one stays on a lot longer (and I don&#x27;t use the waterproof one) and the fibers that actually make your lashes longer stay on for hours.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this.....I have trouble finding brownish black in stores so I buy it on Amazon.  It looks natural and when I put on additional coats for evening it turns to &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; quickly.</li>
            <li> This mascara did not give me nearly as much length as I wanted. But it does stay on well and doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake. So it&#x27;s good if you might be out in the rain or something and don&#x27;t want your mascara to run.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara! I like the brush! You can layer this mascara and it does not flake off.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!!!  My lashes have never been quite the same since going through chemo.  This product gives me that extra length back!  I then add a second coat with another product that gives my lashes more volume, based upon reading other reviews.  So I use two mascaras - this one for length, another for volume.  I feel like my old self!</li>
            <li> I just bought this mascara recently and I tested it out compared to my regular mascara. I applied it to my right eye ,regular mascara to my left eye. I opened it and applied and I noticed its just like any normal mascara,there were no fibers. It didn&#x27;t lengthen,&lt;br /&gt;volumize, or thicken my lashes. My tried and true mascara proved to make my lashes longer and thicker with just one coat compared to two coats of the illegal length mascara. If you want thin natural eyelashes, go for it,but you can&#x27;t layer it well once it&#x27;s tried. It dries out faster than the normal mascara,and its uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It was already on the dry side. Only lasted 2 weeks and that was pushing it.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this mascara. I bought this on Amazon without ever having tried it before. If you&#x27;re looking for long, natural looking lashes, this is for you. It applies easily and the fibers don&#x27;t clump or come off even if you layer it without waiting to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few cons though, which is why I couldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars:&lt;br /&gt;- Semi-unimportant but it must be mentioned that the silver paint on the tube flakes off easily and sticks to your fingers and face. It gets really annoying when trying to apply makeup. I resorted to putting a piece of duct tape around the cap to prevent further flaking.&lt;br /&gt;- The fibers in this stick to your natural lashes, therefore making it look as if you have long lashes by nature. It DOES NOT VOLUMIZE. If you want fuller and longer lashes, you will need to layer this product with a volumizing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;- This mascara dries out faster than, I think, any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It is also very hard to rewet this. Don’t even try to pump this thing full of Visine, it won’t work. If you typically replace your mascara after 3 months, with this you might need to do every 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this is still an awesome product. I’ve gotten so many compliments on it after I began using that I find the increased cost (with the mascara alone and with having to purchase it more often than other types) worth it.</li>
