    <ol>
            <li>Very impressed with this stuff, made the pain go away for about 2 or 3 hours</li>
            <li>Good price and product and excellent service.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT, Until I got to Dentist.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>This stuff is really amazing on  tooth pain.</li>
            <li>liquid is much more effective</li>
            <li>Make it adhere better, and this would warrant 5 stars.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work as effectively as I would hope, after waiting the right amount of time</li>
            <li>its cooling sensation i love and its pretty strong!</li>
            <li>I am happy and thank you for making a well based product, have more in my EDC bag incase of other issues.</li>
            <li>But as a straight up numbing agent, my sons infant oragel works significantly better (would just use them in conjunction to each other, lol).</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewer stated, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at just numbing the pain.</li>
            <li>how much I love this now, unlike some people I had a deep decay which bothered me for hours, with mind numbing pain which drove me to near-tears.</li>
            <li>It works ok but not for long.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this stuff does as good of a job as my kids teething orajel.  </li>
            <li>I really like using this product.</li>
            <li>For the price I expected better.  </li>
            <li>If your tooth gets infected enough, only a dentist will be able to help at that point.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the grainy texture of the new orajel pain relievers.</li>
            <li>for me this stuff wasn&#x27;t as fast acting as the old stuff.</li>
            <li>Paste does work nearly as well as gel.</li>
            <li>and it stayed gone for up to 2 hours, which was plenty of time for me to see the dentist and get the tooth fixed.</li>
            <li>really helped and the pain hasn&#x27;t come back now for about 2 months.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a relative and it worked very well on her.</li>
            <li>its fast acting and long lasting for my braces that just got put on.</li>

            <li> did kill the pain when it kicked in, but didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> I had a molar cracked in half and causing some massive pain.</li>
            <li> and then it helped the pain slowly come back, and that was easier then instant.</li>
            <li> The blue gel is hard to spread around and slips off!</li>
            <li> It does not have the same effect as the actual Gel Oragel, and it tastes AWFUL..</li>
            <li> This is horrible grainy stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well, the only issue is that this is a hick paste, thus it won&#x27;t stay where you need it like the gel does. Make it adhere better, and this would warrant 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer stated, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at just numbing the pain. You definitely feel the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; sensation, probably from the menthol. But as a straight up numbing agent, my sons infant oragel works significantly better (would just use them in conjunction to each other, lol). I&#x27;ll stick with their regular stuff going forward.</li>
            <li> liquid is much more effective and i was some what dissappointed in the gel which i will purchase the next t</li>
            <li> This did help temporarily as the label does suggest. Keyword being temporarily. If your tooth gets infected enough, only a dentist will be able to help at that point.</li>
            <li> its fast acting and long lasting for my braces that just got put on. its cooling sensation i love and its pretty strong!</li>
            <li> I really like using this product. If stop my ongong tootache pain. I had no problems with pain. After using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the grainy texture of the new orajel pain relievers. Seems to have changed over the years.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT, Until I got to Dentist. Wish he used it...LOL</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, &amp; he told me it&#x27;s a paste that didn&#x27;t stay on his gums, like the gel does.</li>
            <li> for me this stuff wasn&#x27;t as fast acting as the old stuff. did kill the pain when it kicked in, but didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> Paste does work nearly as well as gel. Also, paste is a blue color and leaves it all over your teeth.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as effectively as I would hope, after waiting the right amount of time I still feel the pain.</li>
            <li> I had a molar cracked in half and causing some massive pain. Very impressed with this stuff, made the pain go away for about 2 or 3 hours and then it helped the pain slowly come back, and that was easier then instant. I am happy and thank you for making a well based product, have more in my EDC bag incase of other issues.</li>
            <li> Good price and product and excellent service.</li>
            <li> You have no idea how much I love this now, unlike some people I had a deep decay which bothered me for hours, with mind numbing pain which drove me to near-tears. But when I went and got this, I applied it real quick, at first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work and would be disappointed. But soon I begun to feel the pain being soothed over till it was gone and it stayed gone for up to 2 hours, which was plenty of time for me to see the dentist and get the tooth fixed.</li>
            <li> really helped and the pain hasn&#x27;t come back now for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really amazing on  tooth pain. I wouldn&#x27;t try it on an infant but we use it while waiting to get to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I like the results.  It does deaden the pain on my tongue ulcers.  But!  The blue gel is hard to spread around and slips off!</li>
            <li> This is not a gel. This is a cream. This is horrible grainy stuff. It does not have the same effect as the actual Gel Oragel, and it tastes AWFUL.. I will not ever be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a relative and it worked very well on her.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this stuff does as good of a job as my kids teething orajel.  For the price I expected better.  It works ok but not for long.</li>
