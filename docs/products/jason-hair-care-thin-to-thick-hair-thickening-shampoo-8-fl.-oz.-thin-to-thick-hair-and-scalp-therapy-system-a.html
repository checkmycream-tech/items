            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>but here the prices are great for a product that really is effective!</li>
            <li>I love JASON products and am very happy with this product and the shampoo companion.  </li>
            <li>and he loved it.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I cannot love without it!</li>
            <li>have shared it with friends they are not as enthusiastic about it as I am.</li>
            <li>She is extremely happy with this product and highly recommends it to anyone looking for a great product to thicken their hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and where I use this conditioner it gives my hair the body it needs.</li>
            <li>One thing&#x27;s for sure--</li>
            <li>If anything I noticed more hair falling out.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask?  </li>
            <li>I love the Jason hair products.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many brands.  </li>
            <li>Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is okay</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>but since I have tried so many thing for my fine hair, I wanted to give it a try .</li>
            <li>My hair shines and is easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Just OK, nothing special.</li>
            <li>this product makes my hair feel thicker and more full.</li>
            <li>conditioner will also strengthen fine and chemically processed hair by infusing it with 22 amino acids.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who has fine hair.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free and top-of-the-line.</li>
            <li>Yes the smell takes some getting used to but is worth it!</li>
            <li>I have a decent amount of hair, but each hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the Jason&#x27;s Thing to Thick Shampoo and they are an excellent pair.  </li>
            <li>but I was more after not loosing as much hair rather than the thickness.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is THICK and it doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell either.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and rinse off, it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>Always a consistent product that helps provide volume and lots of shine to my aging hair!</li>
            <li>I was looking at more natural products in a health food store and a sales person said that her husband used it.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I think it may be worth a try.</li>
            <li>I believe this was better for my hair than chemical shampoos but as far as volume, nothing to write about.</li>
            <li>It also smells like cheap dish soap, which leads me to believe it&#x27;s not as natural as Jason products claim to be.</li>
            <li>wanted a good everyday product, this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>If your hair is dry you can use it between washes and it coats your hair and makes it feel better and thicker</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it is working for me...</li>
            <li>I asked if it really did make his hair thicker</li>
            <li>but he had stopped loosing as much hair</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and this conditioner really works.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping to really feel like my hair was thicker.</li>
            <li>Very Well to add body and fullness</li>
            <li>Here is the conditioner to compliment the Thin-to-thick shampoo that really does work.</li>
            <li>They really do make your hair thicker.  </li>
            <li>but really didn&#x27;t add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, clean and feels better than in the past.  </li>
            <li>If only it weren&#x27;t so expensive, when I am just trying to volumize my hair, this is the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use conditioner.</li>
            <li>I color my hair consistently and because Jason contains no sulphates, it never dulls or fades my haircolor.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t use it everyday; more for going out etc.)  </li>
            <li>I used this several times and found that it wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li>not sure if it made me grow more hair...</li>
            <li>My hair loss was so severe that it clogged the shower drain constantly while I showered, would float in the air as I blew my hair dry on the lowest setting, filled my brush and comb and was just all over the sink and floor.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had very little to almost no hair in the shower drain, little to none on my brush and no hair floating around while drying it and none, absolutely none, in the sink or counter top.  </li>
            <li>It can only do so much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it gives extra volume (like in a styling product way)</li>
            <li>She has used it for over a year and her hair is considerably softer, lustrous and looks fuller.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thinning hair and not sure this product and shampoo works</li>
            <li>I realize that postpartum shedding is hormonal (and normal) and cannot necessarily be controlled with products.  </li>
            <li>By the second use, I noticed a big difference in the feeling of volume in my hair and have used it steadily now for about 3 months.</li>
            <li>I started off using it daily, it is that gentle, and over several months I started using it several times a week.  </li>
            <li>so I looked for a natural shampoo and conditioner, and since I switched to Jason several months ago the gray has gone.</li>
            <li>I had lost a lot of my already thin hair and thought it was due to my advanced years but the loss was so much that I purchased a wig but just didn&#x27;t want to wear it.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have to worry about the harsh unnatural products found in other popular conditioners that I have used in past years.</li>

            <li> My has lacked luster, laid flat on my head.  </li>
            <li> I have really super thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair has been very dry and brittle since mid thirties and this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair had thinned out a lot and became very dry and brittle after the birth of our second child.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes far.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it leaves my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt full and thick, but not weighed down by product!</li>
            <li> I would have wanted to know how long it takes to see fuller locks before purchasing both products.</li>
            <li> Was having problems with unexplained hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t dry my hair or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> It did thicken my hair but it was dry and bushy.  </li>
            <li> My only thing is how little product you get for the $$$$.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use it every day), but not up to par with what I expected.</li>
            <li> My husband has been experiencing hair loss since being in the military.</li>
            <li> but it is not weighed down either.-i wash, condition &amp; air dry.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and may be justification for the cost.</li>
            <li> I truly dislike the fragrance of this product, as well as the fragrance in the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that I can wash and style my hair every other day instead of the every day routine.  </li>
            <li> I have decided not to use it anymore, but I do believe this may work for other hair types.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not falling out like it was using conventional shampoo/conditioners anymore.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find and I can&#x27;t find both products at the same time except in health food stores and on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I had to bang it upside down on the tub to move it  to the entrence then bang it on my hand to get it out.</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo I have a lot less breakage from my ends resulting in longer hair.</li>
            <li> less often it makes my hair \\&quot;springy\\</li>
            <li> It is hard to get out of the bottle but a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> but does little to thicken hair.</li>
            <li> For thickness I think my hair feels a little thicker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the midst of postpartum hair shedding and am looking for something to help boost my hair volume, especially since I already have naturally thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid of damaging my hair because it was too stiff, and I only used a tiny bit.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to change the texture of my super-fine hair, leaving it thicker, yes, but also not easy to style.  </li>
            <li> A small amount of this conditioner in the palm of your hand is all you need -- it is so luxe and</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed when I got it because it smells like pure chemicals</li>
            <li> A thick product with a small opening in the container, not to mention a pour cap which never, would this product pour.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is made out of a plastic so hard you can&#x27;t squeeze the bottle</li>
            <li> &quot; and hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jason&#x27;s exclusive hydrating complex, Planthenol-3(tm), Aloe Vera plus hair-loving proteins and seaweed extracts, thicken hair fibers by at least 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She leaves the conditioner in her hair for at least 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> it is very thick ad heavy on your hair, even hard to  squeeze the bottle !  </li>
            <li> It made my ultra thin hair feel like it was coated with a waxy substance.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> i like Jason products but disappointed in this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> the smell is terrible too .</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it with the Jason&#x27;s Thing to Thick Shampoo and they are an excellent pair.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just like the shampoo, the product delivers, adding volume and softness to my hair. i don&#x27;t have to worry about the harsh unnatural products found in other popular conditioners that I have used in past years.</li>
            <li> Just OK, nothing special. I don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; qualities actually. I prefer L&#x27;Oreal Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner, also from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Received ordered products in a timely manner.   I have fine thinning hair and not sure this product and shampoo works b/c I haven&#x27;t used it long enough. I would have wanted to know how long it takes to see fuller locks before purchasing both products.One thing&#x27;s for sure--a little goes a long way and may be justification for the cost.</li>
            <li> I like the product. My reason for buying it was to get a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t have the non-natural ingredients national brands have. My only thing is how little product you get for the $$$$.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner hoping that it would thicken my hair. I was sorely disappointed when I got it because it smells like pure chemicals and I didnt notice any difference. If anything I noticed more hair falling out. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> this product makes my hair feel thicker and more full. not sure if it made me grow more hair... using it again now! tried rogaine and that made my hair fall out!!! sticking with Jason!</li>
            <li> very good conditioner but does little to thicken hair.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and rinse off, it doesn&#x27;t take much.  I can&#x27;t really tell if it is working for me...</li>
            <li> I had lost a lot of my already thin hair and thought it was due to my advanced years but the loss was so much that I purchased a wig but just didn&#x27;t want to wear it.  My hair loss was so severe that it clogged the shower drain constantly while I showered, would float in the air as I blew my hair dry on the lowest setting, filled my brush and comb and was just all over the sink and floor.  Out of desperation I was looking at more natural products in a health food store and a sales person said that her husband used it.  I asked if it really did make his hair thicker and she said she didn&#x27;t know about that but he had stopped loosing as much hair and he loved it.  Well, that was all I needed to hear and purchased the shampoo and conditioner.  The first time I used it I had very little to almost no hair in the shower drain, little to none on my brush and no hair floating around while drying it and none, absolutely none, in the sink or counter top.  I started off using it daily, it is that gentle, and over several months I started using it several times a week.  My hair is soft, clean and feels better than in the past.  For thickness I think my hair feels a little thicker but I was more after not loosing as much hair rather than the thickness.  I still have my wig but have not worn it once.  I would recommend this product if you are wanting to help hair loss.  I use both the shampoo and conditioner according to the directions on the bottles.  Again, this helped me and that salesperson&#x27;s husband so I feel it has a wonderful chance to help just about anyone.  This is hard to find and I can&#x27;t find both products at the same time except in health food stores and on Amazon.  Great product and it does work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the midst of postpartum hair shedding and am looking for something to help boost my hair volume, especially since I already have naturally thin hair.  I realize that postpartum shedding is hormonal (and normal) and cannot necessarily be controlled with products.  However, I thought I would give this a try.  This does make my hair appear a bit thicker on the days I use it (I don&#x27;t use it every day), but not up to par with what I expected.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not condition my hair at all. It also smells like cheap dish soap, which leads me to believe it&#x27;s not as natural as Jason products claim to be. I am getting rid of this and looking for something, anything, else.</li>
            <li> The bottle is made out of a plastic so hard you can&#x27;t squeeze the bottle and I couldn&#x27;t actually get any conditioner out. So unless you are The Rock or a WWE wrestler I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this by accident thinking that is was the shampoo. It works. I like it. I don&#x27;t normally use conditioner.</li>
            <li> Awesome! No hassle! Absolutely love this stuff!! It instantly gives my hair volume and body. I cannot love without it!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has definitely made my hair softer, but it doesn&#x27;t appeared to have thickened it. I&#x27;m using it in addition to the Jason shampoo which doesn&#x27;t appear to be working either. (See review on that product&#x27;s page). Save your money and look for a different cruelty-free conditioner.</li>
            <li> I truly dislike the fragrance of this product, as well as the fragrance in the other products in this line. It seemed to change the texture of my super-fine hair, leaving it thicker, yes, but also not easy to style.  I was afraid of damaging my hair because it was too stiff, and I only used a tiny bit.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Jason!  Cruelty free and top-of-the-line. What more could you ask?  A small amount of this conditioner in the palm of your hand is all you need -- it is so luxe and a little bit goes far. My hair felt full and thick, but not weighed down by product!</li>
            <li> Always a consistent product that helps provide volume and lots of shine to my aging hair! I color my hair consistently and because Jason contains no sulphates, it never dulls or fades my haircolor.</li>
            <li> I love the Jason hair products.  They have a wonderful fragrance that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Just one guy&#x27;s testimonial: my hair was beginning to gray so I looked for a natural shampoo and conditioner, and since I switched to Jason several months ago the gray has gone.</li>
            <li> Yes the smell takes some getting used to but is worth it! This shampoo makes your hair feel thicker and fuller. It doesn&#x27;t make you grow hair. Since using this shampoo I have a lot less breakage from my ends resulting in longer hair. My hair has been very dry and brittle since mid thirties and this helps a lot. I also take a biotin supplement every day...unless I forget. Lol I do have the conditioner but use that less often it makes my hair \\&quot;springy\\&quot; and hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> Was having problems with unexplained hair loss.  Thought that the culprit may be the Sodium Laurel Sulfate, as it bothers me in toothpaste too.  Since starting this, my hair loss has virtually stopped.  I use the shampoo and conditioner - they work well for me.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and this conditioner really works. My husband has been experiencing hair loss since being in the military. We bought this at the Vitamin store much more expensive but here the prices are great for a product that really is effective!</li>
            <li> If only it weren&#x27;t so expensive, when I am just trying to volumize my hair, this is the best conditioner I have ever used. My ponytail is thicker when I use it too.  It adds body but doesn&#x27;t add a lot of curl.</li>
            <li> It can only do so much. If your hair is dry you can use it between washes and it coats your hair and makes it feel better and thicker&lt;br /&gt;I have shared it with friends they are not as enthusiastic about it as I am.</li>
            <li> I used this several times and found that it wasn&#x27;t the right product for me. My hair did get a lot of volume but it also got frizzy. I stopped using it. Too bad.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is THICK and it doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell either. It is hard to get out of the bottle but a little goes a LONG way. I have only been using it for a week but I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my hair feeling thicker. I have really super thin hair ( my pony tail diameter is smaller around than my pinky) and I was hoping to really feel like my hair was thicker. Meh. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Adds volume to flat hair.  My has lacked luster, laid flat on my head.  I had a shampoo and conditioner shop in my bathroom.  I have tried many brands.  I use both the shampoo and conditioner.  My hair shines and is easy to manage.  I have also noticed that I can wash and style my hair every other day instead of the every day routine.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner Work Very Well to add body and fullness and they don&#x27;t dry my hair or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love JASON products and am very happy with this product and the shampoo companion.  If I don&#x27;t use them I notice the difference.</li>
            <li> By the second use, I noticed a big difference in the feeling of volume in my hair and have used it steadily now for about 3 months. My hair is not falling out like it was using conventional shampoo/conditioners anymore. I use the Jason Thin-to-Thick Shampoo too. Very happy with these products.</li>
            <li> Here is the conditioner to compliment the Thin-to-thick shampoo that really does work. This also gives your hair UV protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner will also strengthen fine and chemically processed hair by infusing it with 22 amino acids. Also helps to mend split ends and prevent damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason&#x27;s exclusive hydrating complex, Planthenol-3(tm), Aloe Vera plus hair-loving proteins and seaweed extracts, thicken hair fibers by at least 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lusture, Body &amp; Manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> Using with the shampoo.  I really like it so far.  A little goes a long way and it leaves my hair shiny and soft.  I have a decent amount of hair, but each hair is very fine.  I can&#x27;t really say it gives extra volume (like in a styling product way) but it is not weighed down either.-i wash, condition &amp; air dry.  if you want the type of volume associated with styling products this probably won&#x27;t cut it (Davines Volu shampoo, conditioner and spray is what I use when I want really big hair.  That stuff is awesome but it makes your hair a bit wig-like and it builds up, so you can&#x27;t use it everyday; more for going out etc.)  wanted a good everyday product, this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Exellent product and service.</li>
            <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner.  They really do make your hair thicker.  And your hair feels great.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> based on the reviews, I hesitated to buy this product but since I have tried so many thing for my fine hair, I wanted to give it a try . Don&#x27;t buy it !  it is very thick ad heavy on your hair, even hard to  squeeze the bottle !  the smell is terrible too .</li>
            <li> Not for me.  It made my ultra thin hair feel like it was coated with a waxy substance.  I have decided not to use it anymore, but I do believe this may work for other hair types.  For the price, I think it may be worth a try.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is okay but really didn&#x27;t add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair had thinned out a lot and became very dry and brittle after the birth of our second child.  Her hairstylist told her to try an organic shampoo and conditioner and she accidentally came across this product at the store.  She has used it for over a year and her hair is considerably softer, lustrous and looks fuller.  She leaves the conditioner in her hair for at least 2 minutes.  She is extremely happy with this product and highly recommends it to anyone looking for a great product to thicken their hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner, a little goes a long way.  I have very thin, fine hair.  I believe this was better for my hair than chemical shampoos but as far as volume, nothing to write about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of the &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; generation, female, and have diabetes AND THINNING HAIR!!...This conditioner makes my hair appear fuller and I&#x27;ve been using it for several years!</li>
            <li> i like Jason products but disappointed in this conditioner.  It did thicken my hair but it was dry and bushy.  A thick product with a small opening in the container, not to mention a pour cap which never, would this product pour.  I had to bang it upside down on the tub to move it  to the entrence then bang it on my hand to get it out.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. My hair is very fine and where I use this conditioner it gives my hair the body it needs. I also have the&lt;br /&gt;shampoo and it works great. I recommend it to anyone who has fine hair.</li>
