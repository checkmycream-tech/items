    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get the hang of it, I guess, because the You Tube tutorial made it look so easy!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better to learn to do it without the use of an applicator</li>
            <li>works much better than tweezers</li>
            <li>You are better off just using your hands or tweezers.</li>
            <li>Much easier to apply my lashes, glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>Broke in two first use, but the seller made it right with out making me jump through hoops</li>
            <li>I used to have a metal one made by Maybelline, but evidently there is nothing like it made.</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t help get the lashes in place</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to align them without a lot of fumbling.</li>
            <li>It makes it much easier to put my lashes on.</li>
            <li>These tool really did not help me apply my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I was SO EXCITED when I finally received this in the mail!  </li>
            <li>Item is sturdy so able to hold lash tightly to apply.</li>
            <li>A helpful little gadget for applying eyelash sets just above your own.  </li>
            <li>It would help if it was just a bit longer as it is pretty darn short.</li>
            <li>I expected a lash applicator that would make applying lashes a lot easier and this one didn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
            <li>; both right &amp; left at once, let the adhesive dry a couple minutes &amp; then place both lashes in a few seconds.</li>

            <li> I am new to using false eyelashes - this tool is supposed to make it easier - so far I am still in training using it, but does seem to be helping so far</li>

            <li> At first, it was useless to me because my own lashes were getting in the way of the false ones and the applicator was of no help until I saw on YouTube that you could use the applicator to hold your natural lashes to make room for you to apply the false ones!</li>

            <li> I ordered this item and had it shipped overseas. When it arrived it was open and broken. So I can&#x27;t use it and it not worth the time and money to send it back. I will not buy again.</li>
