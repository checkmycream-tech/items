    <ol>
            <li>So happy to have found them online!</li>
            <li>Excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li>Phillips Sonicare tooth brushes are the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>They have always been an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li>This is the best price for these replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>My wife &amp; I have been using these brushes for year, excellent product best in the market.</li>
            <li>My dentist has been very happy with my chech ups since I have been using this brush!</li>
            <li>They proabably work great for others, but I just don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the best brush from the timer settings.  </li>
            <li>My Sonicare still works great</li>
            <li>Probably great for those with braces.</li>
            <li>When I went to the dentist six months ago I got great comments.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Great price for a replacement brush head.  </li>
            <li>I think that is one great advantage to buying online</li>
            <li>These brush heads are great.  </li>
            <li>The price was great and Iove this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the brush heads for my tooth brush and am thankful I found then since they seem to be unavailable in stores.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the transaction -</li>
            <li>After not receiving order originally, I am very pleased to say that I have received the order in working condition and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that my dental hygienists are just as happy as I am.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to try and thought that I could always send them back if they didn&#x27;t work, but am happy to report that they work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I still have my original Sonicare toothbrush and was happy to find these replacement heads.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Replacement Heads were brand new and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t fault the company selling them, they shipped quickly and the item was in good condition.</li>
            <li>The larger size hurts my mouth, so these are perfect!  </li>
            <li>and I have not been able to find the replacement brushes in any store.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have the correct toothbrush model though to match it too.  </li>
            <li>Thank you amazon for having these available, and on auto ship!</li>
            <li>most of anything that&#x27;s a Sonicare brand (there are exceptions)</li>
            <li>is good, smile :)</li>
            <li>I was able to find them and purchase them here.  </li>
            <li>BEEN USING SONICARE FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>Make sure you order more than one set.</li>
            <li>And I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>&quot; compact heads are not as effective as the full size heads.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>It fit my handle and worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li>I had signed up for purchases every six months with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I have had this Phillips Sonicare for many years and have had good reports from my dentist especially about gum tissue since I have been using the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>If you own an older Sonicare and need brush replacements...</li>
            <li>But my a-Series toothbrush is still working perfectly after 4 years, and I&#x27;m not up for spending $100 on a new system until necessary.</li>
            <li>These brush heads were too small, I guess I did not see world \\&quot;compact\\&quot;, otherwise - very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>My periodontist insists on this particular model, even if it isn&#x27;t the latest Sonicare type, because of its compact brush size - he says at regular exams he can tell which brush head his patients are using, this one being the most effective.  </li>
            <li>Life is full of compromises.</li>
            <li>Still, they feel as good as the originals, just smaller.</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, I have used the Sonicare system and replacement heads for years with full satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I was to find heads for my old, old Sonicare handle still available.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the smaller heads as now</li>
            <li>The product worked perfectly; however, it would be great to find a seller offering a normal full head brush replacement for this toothbrush instead of the small half size head.    </li>
            <li>(I personally don&#x27;t find the new ones that fit the e &amp; now also fit the a series to be as effective as the originals on the Advance handle)</li>
            <li>I love that Amazon still offers the a-series Sonicare toothbrush heads in the compact size.  </li>
            <li>I believe Philips Sonicare don&#x27;t produce the original size any more (regular size), what a shame..</li>
            <li>so I need to use a smaller brush head which aren&#x27;t very easy to find.</li>
            <li>These work very well, and I can really reach all my teeth easily.</li>
            <li>The compact size is especially good for someone with a smaller mouth or tight spots.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and transactions and shipping are always a breeze.</li>
            <li>The handle is about 17 years old and the motor still works fine.</li>
            <li>I have bright, white teeth and don&#x27;t have to go to the dentist until something major occures.</li>
            <li>In the future I will be more cautious in what I order and how.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare these brush heads fit is nearly twenty years in use</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase from Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>However they do all for better coverage in the back of the teeth</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare toothbrush since the first infomercial for it</li>
            <li>This is the first time we tried the compact heads.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>these are good quality products that last for the six months of twice-a-day daily use, as advertised.</li>
            <li>My last set of old heads had really expired, and I really didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d still be able to find heads that fit and worked.</li>
            <li>I have an older Sonicare and wasn&#x27;t able to find any replacement heads for it locally; they were all for the newer model.  </li>
            <li>With it, I can now easily brush the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>These are very durable.</li>
            <li>(or children) Compact is very compact though; so know what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li>Check to see if the regular size is available if you don&#x27;t want compact.</li>
            <li>I know that the Advance series is becoming obsolete, but I assumed that as long as I could get the brush heads, I could continue to use it since it still \\&quot;works\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again,Debbie in Maryland</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Because you did not buy in Japan, it was very helpful.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush really does the work for you, and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I have always liked the compact size but usually couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>After that, you will need new brushes and Amazon has them while most other stores don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life</li>
            <li>The larger heads hold toothpaste better while the smaller ones get into the spaces around your gums easier.  </li>
            <li>This was a classic \\&quot;bait and switch\\&quot; and I cancelled my subscription because of this.</li>
            <li>I wanted to warn people these brush heads are not the normal size.</li>
            <li>I am a full grown adult male.</li>
            <li>It is more proportioned to a single tooth than the brushes of a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had the original brush head and found it too wide for my mouth.</li>
            <li>It is new.</li>
            <li>never really felt clean like they do with the soni-care.</li>
            <li>My recent purchase went smoothly and I would definitely buy from the supplier again.</li>
            <li>My dentist says that I have very little evidence of plaque that used to build up before within 6 months, and my gums are healthy and have stopped receding.</li>
            <li>They do not wear out the same as a regular toothbrush, but you can tell the difference near the end of the sixth month when your teeth do not feel as clean as they should.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for years, and my gums have improved considerably.</li>
            <li>My teeth had been very well taken care of just by daily routine.</li>
            <li>Just wish they wouldn&#x27;t pull the replacement brushes before the end of the natural life of the product...</li>
            <li>They reach into the back of my mouth to get those hard-to reach places, so my mouth ends up much cleaner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting hard to find brush heads to fit older models.  </li>
            <li>I found the small heads very effective in reaching hard to brush areas of my mouth.</li>
            <li>The brush head is lot smaller than the original one, the advertised size is fine for kids but little too small for adults.</li>
            <li>Sonicare keeps retiring models and replacing them with different styles so as to force people to buy new units.  </li>
            <li>These really aren&#x27;t big enough brush heads for me.  </li>
            <li>The small brush heads do a good job of cleaning the hard to reach areas of the mouth.</li>
            <li>obviously the brush heads on the market are old.</li>
            <li>They are pretty small and we&#x27;re not sure we&#x27;ll buy them again, may switch back to the full size, depends on how we feel about them in another 4 months!</li>
            <li>I ended up choosing the Series A because it has a smaller head and is for young children or for adults with smaller mouths.  </li>
            <li>The system was recommended by my dentist due to plaque build-up and the inability to tackle the problem with normal brushing.  </li>

            <li> For folks with large teeth and small mouths, the compact heads are essential.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist noticed heavy plaque back there and planned to use local anesthetic at my next appointment in order to perform a proper prophylaxis.</li>

            <li> This is an older model and brush heads are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the brushes on these Sonicare heads were so small.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love that Amazon still offers the a-series Sonicare toothbrush heads in the compact size.  The larger size hurts my mouth, so these are perfect!  My recent purchase went smoothly and I would definitely buy from the supplier again.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare still works great and I have not been able to find the replacement brushes in any store.  The price is comparable to what I would have paid in the store also.  So happy to have found them online!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the brushes on these Sonicare heads were so small. I had been unaware brush heads this small even existed.  I found the small heads very effective in reaching hard to brush areas of my mouth. I felt that the shipping was slow and disproportionately expensive.  In the future I will be more cautious in what I order and how.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years, and my gums have improved considerably. I always get that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money. The small brush heads do a good job of cleaning the hard to reach areas of the mouth.</li>
            <li> I have an older Sonicare and wasn&#x27;t able to find any replacement heads for it locally; they were all for the newer model.  I ordered these to try and thought that I could always send them back if they didn&#x27;t work, but am happy to report that they work perfectly.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped promptly and received timely.  It fit my handle and worked like a charm.  The choice between compact and regular heads is a toss-up.  The larger heads hold toothpaste better while the smaller ones get into the spaces around your gums easier.  Life is full of compromises.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were too small, I guess I did not see world \\&quot;compact\\&quot;, otherwise - very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The brushes on this product have decreased by half. It is more proportioned to a single tooth than the brushes of a standard toothbrush. The price is now double and the product half in size. Very disappointing!  I&#x27;ll be looking for another electric toothbrush when these replacements wear out (which should be, also, quicker than before).</li>
            <li> The product worked perfectly; however, it would be great to find a seller offering a normal full head brush replacement for this toothbrush instead of the small half size head.    I am pleased with my purchase as this item is difficult to purchase.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are much smaller than the ones I&#x27;m using now.  I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but I hope they will fit into my base unit.</li>
            <li> I really hate it when things go obsolete.  I had the larger brush heads on Autoship and I guess they are being phased out.  These really aren&#x27;t big enough brush heads for me.  They proabably work great for others, but I just don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the best brush from the timer settings.  Probably great for those with braces.</li>
            <li> When I went to the dentist six months ago I got great comments. My teeth had been very well taken care of just by daily routine. My doctor said the only bad thing I had going for me was stains, which could not be removed by brushing alone. She recommended I try this product to get rid of that problem. I did. It works great. I have bright, white teeth and don&#x27;t have to go to the dentist until something major occures.</li>
            <li> Unlike the model before it, I have to wrap it in a washcloth because the water leaks out around the cap!</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare tooth brushes are the best I have used.  I have been using this product for 20 years and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare these brush heads fit is nearly twenty years in use and it&#x27;s still going strong. Unlike the current models, it&#x27;s built like a tank.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these before. They have always been an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using the soni-care, my cavity rate has plumeted!  Once, on vacation, I just carried a regular toothbrush and I can tell you my teeth never really felt clean like they do with the soni-care.</li>
            <li> Great price for a replacement brush head.  Make sure you have the correct toothbrush model though to match it too.  These are very durable.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the brush heads for my tooth brush and am thankful I found then since they seem to be unavailable in stores.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from Amazon.com.  I have had this Phillips Sonicare for many years and have had good reports from my dentist especially about gum tissue since I have been using the Sonicare.  They discontinued the style and I could not find the compact replacement heads - until I went to Amazon.com.  I was very pleased with the transaction - no problems!  The Sonicare Replacement Heads were brand new and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find any of the original heads for the Advance series. (I personally don&#x27;t find the new ones that fit the e &amp; now also fit the a series to be as effective as the originals on the Advance handle) I have always liked the compact size but usually couldn&#x27;t find it. The compact size is especially good for someone with a smaller mouth or tight spots. (or children) Compact is very compact though; so know what you&#x27;re buying. Check to see if the regular size is available if you don&#x27;t want compact. Thank you amazon for having these available, and on auto ship!</li>
            <li> I had signed up for purchases every six months with free shipping. I was charged shipping for my last order and did not realize that shipping was being charged till I received my order. This was a classic \\&quot;bait and switch\\&quot; and I cancelled my subscription because of this.</li>
            <li> The heads are much smaller than I expected. Still, they feel as good as the originals, just smaller. This is an older model and brush heads are hard to find.</li>
            <li> The brush head is lot smaller than the original one, the advertised size is fine for kids but little too small for adults. I have been using the same brand for years and this is my first time I have seen this small size. I believe Philips Sonicare don&#x27;t produce the original size any more (regular size), what a shame..</li>
            <li> Before using Sonicare, I used a regular toothbrush. Unfortunately, it was hard to get the large head of a traditional brush towards the back of my mouth. My dental hygenist noticed heavy plaque back there and planned to use local anesthetic at my next appointment in order to perform a proper prophylaxis. I just was not cleaning my back teeth well enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also recommended I buy the Sonicare toothbrush with the Ultra Compact Brush Heads. With it, I can now easily brush the back of my mouth. At my next appointment, my hygenist decided I no longer needed the anesthetic, because my back teeth required little prophylactic cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you brush your teeth twice per day with the Sonicare, you definitely need to replace the brush head after six months, just as the instructions say. They do not wear out the same as a regular toothbrush, but you can tell the difference near the end of the sixth month when your teeth do not feel as clean as they should.</li>
            <li> The bottom line: if your toothbrush is a Sonicare Advance, you are going to need replacement brush heads and that&#x27;s reality. Both of my kids are using Advance and they should be replaced at lest every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most of anything that&#x27;s a Sonicare brand (there are exceptions) these are good quality products that last for the six months of twice-a-day daily use, as advertised. After that, you will need new brushes and Amazon has them while most other stores don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is good, smile :)</li>
            <li> I know that the Advance series is becoming obsolete, but I assumed that as long as I could get the brush heads, I could continue to use it since it still \\&quot;works\\&quot;.  The problem is that none of the replacement heads that I have purchased in the last year will stay charged longer than one or two uses.  Save your money and invest in a new base - obviously the brush heads on the market are old.</li>
            <li> These \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; compact heads are not as effective as the full size heads. However they do all for better coverage in the back of the teeth so there is a trade off here. they&#x27;re \\&quot;OK\\&quot; for the money but I&#x27;d probably look for the standard size before i would buy this size again.</li>
            <li> After not receiving order originally, I am very pleased to say that I have received the order in working condition and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This was delivered on-time and just as expected.  I really like my Sonicare Advance 4000 series toothbrush, but was unable to find replacement brush heads anywhere locally - I checked almost every retail outlet.  Time for Amazon.  I was able to find them and purchase them here.  As usual, I received a prompt delivery and received exactly what I ordered.  I&#x27;m sure that my dental hygienists are just as happy as I am.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare toothbrush since the first infomercial for it , you couldn&#x27;t buy them in the stores yet. According to my dentist , I have a small mouth {my husband disagrees with this diagnoses!} so I need to use a smaller brush head which aren&#x27;t very easy to find. Needless to say , I can always count on Amazon.com.. The price is very reasonable and transactions and shipping are always a breeze. It came in the mail in just four days! I&#x27;m a very happy customer! Thanks again,Debbie in Maryland</li>
            <li> I got two heads for just a little over the cost of one from local retailers or on line competition.  As for the product itself, I have used the Sonicare system and replacement heads for years with full satisfaction.  The system was recommended by my dentist due to plaque build-up and the inability to tackle the problem with normal brushing.  Now with the Sonicare system it keeps track of my brushing time and I have cleaner teeth and healthier gums.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about the a-Series compact head is that it is getting ever harder to find, presumably because Sonicare has newer systems out.  But my a-Series toothbrush is still working perfectly after 4 years, and I&#x27;m not up for spending $100 on a new system until necessary. For folks with large teeth and small mouths, the compact heads are essential. Just wish they wouldn&#x27;t pull the replacement brushes before the end of the natural life of the product...</li>
            <li> Product ordered and not received when promised.  Re ordered and charged for 2 day shiping, received 15 days later.both shipments were not the product ordered they were returned with request to credit my charge card to date this has not happened.</li>
            <li> I returned the item back to the company.  They told me they didnot received it.  I told them I sent it by returning to the sender.  They left me unanswering.  Please dont buy from them if you dont want headach.  The bruse head were not in a closed package.  Keep me wondering about it. It is new.</li>
            <li> I have had this electric toothbrush for a number of years and always bought the other Series of Replacement Heads.  This time I took my time because I was online and had quite a few to select from, and read about all of them and the differences between them.  I ended up choosing the Series A because it has a smaller head and is for young children or for adults with smaller mouths.  And that&#x27;s me - an adult with a small mouth.  I never knew what the differences were before reading about it on Amazon.  I am very pleased with the smaller heads as now I have room to move the brush around in my mouth. I think that is one great advantage to buying online, you get a bigger selection to choose from and you can take all the time you need to read about the item without other people bumping into you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these compact heads in the local stores anymore.  They make it easier to get to the back teeth in a smaller mouth.  No complaints, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING SONICARE FOR MANY YEARS AND THE BRUSH REPLACEMENTS ARE A MUST.  THE BRUSHES ARE DESIGNED FOR MAXIMUM CLEANING.</li>
            <li> This paricular brand and compact size is very hard to find.  If you own an older Sonicare and need brush replacements...this is the place to get them.</li>
            <li> My periodontist insists on this particular model, even if it isn&#x27;t the latest Sonicare type, because of its compact brush size - he says at regular exams he can tell which brush head his patients are using, this one being the most effective.  I&#x27;d give this item a five star rating if only it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Just what my customer wanted. Thanks</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had our sonicare for years.  This is the first time we tried the compact heads.  They are pretty small and we&#x27;re not sure we&#x27;ll buy them again, may switch back to the full size, depends on how we feel about them in another 4 months!</li>
            <li> Sonicare keeps retiring models and replacing them with different styles so as to force people to buy new units.  It&#x27;s getting hard to find brush heads to fit older models.  If you buy a new unit and like it, stock up on the appropriate heads because the handle and charger base can last decades.</li>
            <li> Have had a Sonicare product for years. This is the best price for these replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great.  They reach into the back of my mouth to get those hard-to reach places, so my mouth ends up much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I wanted to warn people these brush heads are not the normal size. I know it says \\&quot;compact head\\&quot; but it&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture how small it really is. The brush section is just 1/4\\&quot; x 1/2\\&quot;, 5 little rows of bristles. I find it time consuming and uncomfortable to use. I also find it noisy with a lot of vibration. Maybe these were made for children, I don&#x27;t know, but it was disappointing.    I had bought a newer Sonicare model and gave it away because the brush heads on the newer models feel too small to me. This brush head is much smaller than those are.    I don&#x27;t fault the company selling them, they shipped quickly and the item was in good condition. I just can&#x27;t believe I spent almost $50 for something so useless, I just want to throw it out.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. The price was great and Iove this product. It deserves five stars. The end....</li>
            <li> I still have my original Sonicare toothbrush and was happy to find these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I have been using these brushes for year, excellent product best in the market.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare for about 10 years now and along with a flossing and waterpic routine that I have established, I have had no appearance of cavities. My dentist says that I have very little evidence of plaque that used to build up before within 6 months, and my gums are healthy and have stopped receding. I definitely recommend Sonicare.</li>
            <li> You did not make clearThat the heads came in compact and regular sizes . I recieved the compact size and am very unhappy with them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am a full grown adult male.</li>
            <li> I had the original brush head and found it too wide for my mouth. These work very well, and I can really reach all my teeth easily.</li>
            <li> Make sure you order more than one set. You will not want to run out. My dentist has been very happy with my chech ups since I have been using this brush!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have an electric toothbrush, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing!  The toothbrush really does the work for you, and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I was to find heads for my old, old Sonicare handle still available. The handle is about 17 years old and the motor still works fine. My last set of old heads had really expired, and I really didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d still be able to find heads that fit and worked. But I did, and they do. And I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Because you did not buy in Japan, it was very helpful.</li>
