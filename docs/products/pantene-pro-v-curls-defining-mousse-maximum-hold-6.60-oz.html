            <li>Kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li>This makes your hair kind of crunchy.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really work very good.</li>
            <li>It made my naturally curly hair look and feel great!</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a great mousse!</li>
            <li>This plain Curl Defining Mousse is the perfect one for me and so happy that it is affordable cause</li>
            <li>I do like the smell as with most Pantene products.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My teens love this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand of mousse for two years and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the years.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this mousse.</li>
            <li>It turns more into a cream in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>and she love it.</li>
            <li>I love this mousse.</li>
            <li>but my hair just didn&#x27;t look healthy because theends were frazzled).</li>
            <li>, this product helps but could b better.</li>
            <li>so why pay more?  </li>
            <li>if it amped up the volume just a bit more, but overall I&#x27;m very impressed with its versatility and lack of residue it leaves.  </li>
            <li>Great product for wave to straight hair</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d do better and holding curls.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and this stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>Love how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li>I apply it when my hair is still wet &amp; my hair looks great for 3 days!</li>
            <li>I am not one to go for a great looking style, but at the expense of not having touchably soft hair.  </li>
            <li>It works great for her naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic b/c there was a coupon to clip for it, but the product itself is ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always easy to find mousse that works well for curly hair but pair this with a bit of hairspray</li>
            <li>I live in the Northeast and we have high humidity and this product works great!</li>
            <li>but I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this exact kind again.</li>
            <li>On the days I do a full styling, the product works even better.  </li>
            <li>I first apply a creamy leave in to my damp hair, (currently loving Loreal&#x27;s EverSleek leave in), rake in well with my fingers, then part my hair in sections</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s fine, but I have a lot of it).  </li>
            <li>Yes, I want volume, but if I&#x27;m honest, I really want clean feeling hair more...</li>
            <li>Can not believe I purchased for such a great price at Amazon.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believed I got it for free.</li>
            <li>Really excited about this deal I got.</li>
            <li>Strong hold without being crispy (though don&#x27;t use too much or it will be.) washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Great price, lids don&#x27;t stay on but, never really keep them on anyway.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>The good news is that this product didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and it didn&#x27;t weigh down my ultra fine hair</li>
            <li>Quite strong and flowery, yet very pleasing (to me, anyway).  </li>
            <li>Great hold just makes my hair feel a little straw</li>
            <li>and it left my hair kind of frazzled and tangled looking after sleeping on it, but it did leave my hair looking shiny (two people noticed -</li>
            <li>This is the only Mousse that makes my hair look really nice.</li>
            <li>My hair can be straightened with the right products by blow drying and when curly isn&#x27;t shirley temple curls but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this to my mother to use because she doesn&#x27;t care what kind of mousse she uses, as long as it doesn&#x27;t leave a crunchy feel.</li>
            <li>But ever since I got a blonde ombre done on my hair, my hair has been dry and frizzy and it no longer is beautiful when I wake up.</li>
            <li>It holds my curls without being crunchy and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Smells good and give you a little hold while leaving your hair manageable</li>
            <li>have fine, very wavy hair and live in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves the curls in &amp; still lets my hair look natural and free flowing.  </li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive products (and still do, just to make sure there is nothing better) and have found nothing that works quite like this.  </li>
            <li>Started using curl defining gel when it first came out as i have rather wavey hair which I like to keep about 2&amp;#34; in length.  </li>
            <li>Love the mousse, as its way lighter than the gel, and it provides the same hold.  </li>
            <li>and I get positive comments from everyone.</li>
            <li>And at the same time, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any defined curls, the product had a strong smell, and it stayed on my hands, despite numerous hand washings and hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I have tried gels, custards, and other mousses (most recently Jane Carter&#x27;s Twist Out mousse) and seriously this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for two weeks straight</li>
            <li>great！I really like it</li>
            <li>So, I wet my hair, applied more of this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not expecting much.</li>
            <li>Besides, who wants to walk around looking like they just pulled their hand out of an electric socket.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair..</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thankfully I purchased it during a promotion and paid a pittance for it -- and even that was too much.</li>
            <li>I honestly wouldn&#x27;t waste my money</li>
            <li>I have very wavey hair and this works wonders taming the freeze with high humidity.</li>
            <li>when i wake up it gives my curls a more defined look and leaves them much less frizzy</li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;re looking for a replacement for the older mousse, you may have to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use only gentle sulfate free-shampoos (once a week I use either Kinky Curly Come Clean or a natural Soapnut shampoo,</li>
            <li>What I did after combing through the argan oil was apply this product to my wet, fine hair</li>
            <li>Knowing that I still have 3 more cans is a little daunting (I bought a pack of 4).</li>
            <li>(not saying anything negative about some of the very lovely &#x27;wild&#x27; hairstyles.).</li>
            <li>I have woken up and just thrown more mousse into my hair and used the diffuser for a few minutes and refreshed the look without having to wash my hair also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try using it a couple more times in different ways, but it looks like I&#x27;m probably going to switch back to my old brand.</li>
            <li>It is one of the few things that actually keeps curls in my hair for more than 5 minutes!  </li>
            <li>I have medium length blonde, fine, thinning hair, especially now into my 40s, and am always trying out new products to create body/volume/fullness.  </li>
            <li>new do with locks that fall in my face</li>
            <li>With the combo of leave in plus this mousse, my hair dries curly and soft, lasts all day, and decent looking  </li>
            <li>The older product has good reviews, the newer product is a stiff, sticky mess (think &amp;#34;whipped white glue&amp;#34;) and would be wonderful if you needed a stiff, sticky hairstyle (think: mohawk used to trap flies) that ultimately leaves your hair dried out.</li>
            <li>I dries without looking super wet and shiny.</li>
            <li>luckily they still sell this pink container one</li>
            <li>I use less of the mousse when compared to other mousses as this product spreads nicely, and provides the hold and control I need.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel natural.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut back on frizz really</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that&#x27;s still kind of thin.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every third day, and sometimes I do a full blow dry with styling</li>
            <li>It has a decent price compared o local retailers and does the job.</li>
            <li>So, what I normally do is take a shower, then I towel dry and comb through some argan oil, then I toss it up in a loose ballet bun at the top of my head and sleep wet on my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it for both straight styles and a large round brush soft curls/wave style.  </li>
            <li>Of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried, Pantene has been the one that is most gentle to my hair, meaning not  drying out or making it stiff, after a few hours.</li>
            <li>This is the only mousse (only styling product, really) that works for me.</li>
            <li>I add a palm full to my wet hair, scrunch my hair while I dry and then add some afterwards to separate the curls and give them definition.</li>
            <li>I can apply it and spend less than 5 min blow drying the bangs and smooth it out overall a bit, and I definitely notice a difference in how it dries.  </li>
            <li>If I put it on wet hair and don&#x27;t blow dry at all, the hair will dry a tad crunchy (and curly), but as I tend towards frizzy hair, I have found better results if I blow dry it just a bit.  </li>
            <li>I twist 1-2 inch sections of my hair pretty tightly</li>
            <li>Brushing it through the hair as I dry, the hair will feel very soft with not a bit of crunchiness.  </li>
            <li>Apparently they have stopped selling this because I&#x27;ve been to 10 different walmarts and they don&#x27;t have it anymore.</li>
            <li>I use this product: I try to distribute evenly throughout hair after applying a leave in conditioner (after washing/conditioning), usually a handful through roots and top of hair, then turn my head upside down and scrunch another 2 smaller handfuls though the ends and underneath roots</li>
            <li>and sometimes I just let air dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>Reviews for this product are all over the place for a reason: it was apparently very recently reformulated and is now sold in the white can that you see pictured, rather than the older, pink can.  </li>

            <li> Smells good and give you a little hold while leaving your hair manageable</li>
            <li> have fine, very wavy hair and live in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves the curls in &amp; still lets my hair look natural and free flowing.  </li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive products (and still do, just to make sure there is nothing better) and have found nothing that works quite like this.  </li>
            <li> Started using curl defining gel when it first came out as i have rather wavey hair which I like to keep about 2&amp;#34; in length.  </li>
            <li> Love the mousse, as its way lighter than the gel, and it provides the same hold.  </li>
            <li> and I get positive comments from everyone.</li>
            <li> And at the same time, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any defined curls, the product had a strong smell, and it stayed on my hands, despite numerous hand washings and hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I have tried gels, custards, and other mousses (most recently Jane Carter&#x27;s Twist Out mousse) and seriously this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for two weeks straight</li>
            <li> great！I really like it</li>
            <li> So, I wet my hair, applied more of this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting much.</li>
            <li> Besides, who wants to walk around looking like they just pulled their hand out of an electric socket.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair..</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thankfully I purchased it during a promotion and paid a pittance for it -- and even that was too much.</li>
            <li> I honestly wouldn&#x27;t waste my money</li>
            <li> I have very wavey hair and this works wonders taming the freeze with high humidity.</li>
            <li> when i wake up it gives my curls a more defined look and leaves them much less frizzy</li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re looking for a replacement for the older mousse, you may have to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use only gentle sulfate free-shampoos (once a week I use either Kinky Curly Come Clean or a natural Soapnut shampoo,</li>
            <li> What I did after combing through the argan oil was apply this product to my wet, fine hair</li>
            <li> Knowing that I still have 3 more cans is a little daunting (I bought a pack of 4).</li>
            <li> (not saying anything negative about some of the very lovely &#x27;wild&#x27; hairstyles.).</li>
            <li> I have woken up and just thrown more mousse into my hair and used the diffuser for a few minutes and refreshed the look without having to wash my hair also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try using it a couple more times in different ways, but it looks like I&#x27;m probably going to switch back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few things that actually keeps curls in my hair for more than 5 minutes!  </li>
            <li> I have medium length blonde, fine, thinning hair, especially now into my 40s, and am always trying out new products to create body/volume/fullness.  </li>
            <li> new do with locks that fall in my face</li>
            <li> With the combo of leave in plus this mousse, my hair dries curly and soft, lasts all day, and decent looking  </li>
            <li> The older product has good reviews, the newer product is a stiff, sticky mess (think &amp;#34;whipped white glue&amp;#34;) and would be wonderful if you needed a stiff, sticky hairstyle (think: mohawk used to trap flies) that ultimately leaves your hair dried out.</li>
            <li> I dries without looking super wet and shiny.</li>
            <li> luckily they still sell this pink container one</li>
            <li> I use less of the mousse when compared to other mousses as this product spreads nicely, and provides the hold and control I need.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel natural.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut back on frizz really</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that&#x27;s still kind of thin.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every third day, and sometimes I do a full blow dry with styling</li>
            <li> It has a decent price compared o local retailers and does the job.</li>
            <li> So, what I normally do is take a shower, then I towel dry and comb through some argan oil, then I toss it up in a loose ballet bun at the top of my head and sleep wet on my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it for both straight styles and a large round brush soft curls/wave style.  </li>
            <li> Of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried, Pantene has been the one that is most gentle to my hair, meaning not  drying out or making it stiff, after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is the only mousse (only styling product, really) that works for me.</li>
            <li> I add a palm full to my wet hair, scrunch my hair while I dry and then add some afterwards to separate the curls and give them definition.</li>
            <li> I can apply it and spend less than 5 min blow drying the bangs and smooth it out overall a bit, and I definitely notice a difference in how it dries.  </li>
            <li> If I put it on wet hair and don&#x27;t blow dry at all, the hair will dry a tad crunchy (and curly), but as I tend towards frizzy hair, I have found better results if I blow dry it just a bit.  </li>
            <li> I twist 1-2 inch sections of my hair pretty tightly</li>
            <li> Brushing it through the hair as I dry, the hair will feel very soft with not a bit of crunchiness.  </li>
            <li> Apparently they have stopped selling this because I&#x27;ve been to 10 different walmarts and they don&#x27;t have it anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this product: I try to distribute evenly throughout hair after applying a leave in conditioner (after washing/conditioning), usually a handful through roots and top of hair, then turn my head upside down and scrunch another 2 smaller handfuls though the ends and underneath roots</li>
            <li> and sometimes I just let air dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Reviews for this product are all over the place for a reason: it was apparently very recently reformulated and is now sold in the white can that you see pictured, rather than the older, pink can.  </li>
            <li> then I use a diffuser on my hair dryer on high heat and low setting and blow dry (head upside down!)</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s the key, start with a good base?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on the little one&#x27;s naturally curly hair for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This gives my hair body and keeps the curl in my hair all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not super thick, but a decent head of blonde hair that I highlight regularly.  </li>
            <li> If you put it in your hair and air dry your hair feels brittle.</li>
            <li> , then I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I have tried blowing it dry</li>
            <li> The mousse isn&#x27;t heavy nor does it cause that hard gel look if used in the right amount.  </li>
            <li> Works as intended but does weigh hair down some toward the latter hours.</li>
            <li> for about ten minutes only staying on one place for no more than 10 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dos provide the wet look unless blown dry.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but due to the length &amp; weight of my hair, it usually pulls all of the curls out.  </li>
            <li> My only issue with it is my hair is a little crispy at parts</li>
            <li> It has an alcohol scent which doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but the little one definitely prefers something more floral, fruity for her hair.</li>
            <li> I mean I can hardly apply any pressure at all no matter how hard I press it and when I can only a little is able to escape.</li>
            <li> The frizz was reduced some, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected based on the reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> Works well as expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flack like other mousse products.</li>
            <li> other days I just rinse my hair with As I am Cowash)  </li>
            <li> I did try the other pantene mousse, the conditioning whip one</li>
            <li> mousse can last all day, just depends on the humidity for me, if it is humid I usually put a little of the gel from this line in my tips and that helps to hold it longer.  </li>
            <li> It takes me so long to finish her hair because I literally am struggling just to get a small amount out of the can.</li>
            <li> Terrific Mousse for curly hair and to add control and volume to thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Staying head upside down</li>
            <li> (I had it down and went about my nightly business).</li>
            <li> I need a moisturizing product that won&#x27;t weigh my hair down while allowing my waves to stay shaped.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll tell you, with long thick hair, like I have, if I don&#x27;t use mousse,</li>
            <li> Even with the few formula changes I have noticed over the years, it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> and it was too heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, but holds the curl all day.</li>
            <li> but it still feels crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> You have to press down really hard to release the product.</li>
            <li> Just a little water to reactivate the mousse and voila!</li>
            <li> On day 2 I apply a small amount of water to my hands &amp; work it through my hair.</li>
            <li> so I usually mix this with some leave-in conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair all stiff and hard</li>
            <li> With the triple-threat of the gel, mousse and spray, I&#x27;m set until I get home late at night - all without that crunchy or stiff hair feeling.  </li>
            <li> The product is really hard to get out of the can too.</li>
            <li> I also found the pump to be extremely hard to operate.</li>
            <li> I have tried deva curl and every other expensive product out there.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair turned into a mass of frizz.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am probably going to look for another brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed at the moment though...</li>
            <li> and I hate it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this for two weeks straight and it doesn&#x27;t really work very good. If you put it in your hair and air dry your hair feels brittle. I do like the smell as with most Pantene products. I honestly wouldn&#x27;t waste my money</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  It made my naturally curly hair look and feel great!</li>
            <li> Terrific Mousse for curly hair and to add control and volume to thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> great！I really like it</li>
            <li> Thank you for .57 cents for all 3 cans is an amazing deal (bought on a coupon deal day!)</li>
            <li> This gives my hair body and keeps the curl in my hair all day long. Nothing else works as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, but holds the curl all day. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works as intended but does weigh hair down some toward the latter hours. It has a decent price compared o local retailers and does the job.</li>
            <li> I love how my curly hair looks when using this product! I live in the Northeast and we have high humidity and this product works great!</li>
            <li> Super curl for not alot of money!!!! Works every bit as well as the Paul Mitchell Enhancing Foam I used to splurge on.</li>
            <li> My teens love this product</li>
            <li> It holds my curls without being crunchy and is very reasonably priced. I&#x27;ve used this brand of mousse for two years and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love this mousse works great on my curls. Love how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years. I have tried deva curl and every other expensive product out there. I am in love with this mousse. I apply it when my hair is still wet &amp; my hair looks great for 3 days! I can only wash my hair every 3 days otherwise my hair &amp; scalp dries out. On day 2 I apply a small amount of water to my hands &amp; work it through my hair. My curls return to looking just as great as they did the day before. This product leaves my hair smelling great. My hair was not sticky or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Great hold just makes my hair feel a little straw like</li>
            <li> I have very wavey hair and this works wonders taming the freeze with high humidity.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that I can get to curl my hair without making it to sticky and greasy looking. I add a palm full to my wet hair, scrunch my hair while I dry and then add some afterwards to separate the curls and give them definition. I dries without looking super wet and shiny.</li>
            <li> The curly girls in my family love this product!  It turns more into a cream in your hand.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. My only issue with it is my hair is a little crispy at parts so I usually mix this with some leave-in conditioner as well. Smells good too. Would buy it again. Keep an eye out for a sale of this product in a package of 3 like I did!</li>
            <li> Not for me.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel natural.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she love it. Doesn&#x27;t flack like other mousse products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.  It works well for me and I was glad to find it at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this stuff is great!  It is one of the few things that actually keeps curls in my hair for more than 5 minutes!  I have naturally curly hair, but due to the length &amp; weight of my hair, it usually pulls all of the curls out.  This product leaves the curls in &amp; still lets my hair look natural and free flowing.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for 10+ years.  I have tried more expensive products (and still do, just to make sure there is nothing better) and have found nothing that works quite like this.  Even with the few formula changes I have noticed over the years, it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type: Not super thick, but a decent head of blonde hair that I highlight regularly.  My hair can be straightened with the right products by blow drying and when curly isn&#x27;t shirley temple curls but larger ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use this product: I try to distribute evenly throughout hair after applying a leave in conditioner (after washing/conditioning), usually a handful through roots and top of hair, then turn my head upside down and scrunch another 2 smaller handfuls though the ends and underneath roots (you should feel the product throughout your hair, but not overly so).  Staying head upside down I twist 1-2 inch sections of my hair pretty tightly then I use a diffuser on my hair dryer on high heat and low setting and blow dry (head upside down!) for about ten minutes only staying on one place for no more than 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mousse can last all day, just depends on the humidity for me, if it is humid I usually put a little of the gel from this line in my tips and that helps to hold it longer.  The mousse isn&#x27;t heavy nor does it cause that hard gel look if used in the right amount.  I have woken up and just thrown more mousse into my hair and used the diffuser for a few minutes and refreshed the look without having to wash my hair also.</li>
            <li> I love this mousse. Its the only mousse that works well on my hair #mixedpplhairproblems. Apparently they have stopped selling this because I&#x27;ve been to 10 different walmarts and they don&#x27;t have it anymore. I went to to the drug stores and nope nadda. Everywhere I go its been replaced with a white container with the same name and ingredients but its NOT the same. It makes my hair all stiff and hard and I hate it -____- luckily they still sell this pink container one online so thank goodness for that.</li>
            <li> I need something to combat the frizz, something that helps define my curls AND something that can be used in combination with the argan oil that I spritz into my hair after a shower... AND it needs to be something that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair in the process! I just got this product and I&#x27;ve only used it once, so I can&#x27;t truly judge it yet. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed at the moment though... So, what I normally do is take a shower, then I towel dry and comb through some argan oil, then I toss it up in a loose ballet bun at the top of my head and sleep wet on my hair. And then when I wake up in the morning, my curls are beautiful... But ever since I got a blonde ombre done on my hair, my hair has been dry and frizzy and it no longer is beautiful when I wake up. What I did after combing through the argan oil was apply this product to my wet, fine hair and I scrunched, then I let my hair air dry (I had it down and went about my nightly business). I didn&#x27;t notice any defined curls, the product had a strong smell, and it stayed on my hands, despite numerous hand washings and hand sanitizer. The frizz was reduced some, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected based on the reviews of this product. So, I wet my hair, applied more of this product and I put it up in a ballet bun... I&#x27;ll let you know how this worked out in the morning after I sleep on it. I&#x27;m not expecting much. The good news is that this product didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and it didn&#x27;t weigh down my ultra fine hair (it&#x27;s fine, but I have a lot of it).  Update: I&#x27;m downgrading from 3 to 2 stars because I can&#x27;t even finish the can. I&#x27;m giving this to my mother to use because she doesn&#x27;t care what kind of mousse she uses, as long as it doesn&#x27;t leave a crunchy feel. This stuff just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. It doesn&#x27;t cut back on frizz really and it left my hair kind of frazzled and tangled looking after sleeping on it, but it did leave my hair looking shiny (two people noticed - but my hair just didn&#x27;t look healthy because theends were frazzled). The product is really hard to get out of the can too. You have to press down really hard to release the product. I won&#x27;t ever buy this again!</li>
            <li> Not a lot of hold.  Kind of sticky.  It does the job but I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this exact kind again.</li>
            <li> This is the only mousse (only styling product, really) that works for me. I have curly hair that&#x27;s still kind of thin. Strong hold without being crispy (though don&#x27;t use too much or it will be.) washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this moouse in stores for YEARS. Can not believe I purchased for such a great price at Amazon. TRULY helps maintain curls and frizz control. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Amazing Value for a Product I love!</li>
            <li> new do with locks that fall in my face, this product helps but could b better. leave hair sticky too</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair. Just takes minutes to fix my hair in the morning and I get positive comments from everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  heard all the stores and lines about mousse. But I&#x27;ll tell you, with long thick hair, like I have, if I don&#x27;t use mousse, on my hair, then, after a day I&#x27;ll look like a wire brush that has been plugged into an electric socket. Of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried, Pantene has been the one that is most gentle to my hair, meaning not  drying out or making it stiff, after a few hours. And at the same time, easy to use. Besides, who wants to walk around looking like they just pulled their hand out of an electric socket. (not saying anything negative about some of the very lovely &#x27;wild&#x27; hairstyles.). A great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always easy to find mousse that works well for curly hair but pair this with a bit of hairspray and I&#x27;m set for the day.  If it&#x27;s not holding for you, like it sometimes does for me in the humidity, try putting a think layer of spray gel on your hands before working this through.  With the triple-threat of the gel, mousse and spray, I&#x27;m set until I get home late at night - all without that crunchy or stiff hair feeling.  I also loved that this is a 3-pack, so I&#x27;ve yet to panic that I&#x27;m almost out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair..</li>
            <li> Great buy with subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Great price, lids don&#x27;t stay on but, never really keep them on anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m chided by hair care professionals for buying Pantene gel and mousse for my hair but it works well and controls my hair with no frizzies so why pay more?  I use salon quality shampoo and conditioner so maybe that&#x27;s the key, start with a good base?  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have medium length blonde, fine, thinning hair, especially now into my 40s, and am always trying out new products to create body/volume/fullness.  I am very pleased with this Pantene mousse.  Yes, I want volume, but if I&#x27;m honest, I really want clean feeling hair more... well maybe they are of equal priority to me.  I am not one to go for a great looking style, but at the expense of not having touchably soft hair.  I wash my hair every third day, and sometimes I do a full blow dry with styling and sometimes I just let air dry naturally.  I think this product works well both ways.  I can apply it and spend less than 5 min blow drying the bangs and smooth it out overall a bit, and I definitely notice a difference in how it dries.  It creates volume without stickiness or any residue.  If I put it on wet hair and don&#x27;t blow dry at all, the hair will dry a tad crunchy (and curly), but as I tend towards frizzy hair, I have found better results if I blow dry it just a bit.  On the days I do a full styling, the product works even better.  Brushing it through the hair as I dry, the hair will feel very soft with not a bit of crunchiness.  I use it for both straight styles and a large round brush soft curls/wave style.  I also like the smell.  Quite strong and flowery, yet very pleasing (to me, anyway).  I&#x27;d give it 5/5 if it amped up the volume just a bit more, but overall I&#x27;m very impressed with its versatility and lack of residue it leaves.  Great.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair when i take a show at night and don&#x27;t want to bother straitening it in the morning. when i wake up it gives my curls a more defined look and leaves them much less frizzy…It works great for me in the summertime.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Smells good and give you a little hold while leaving your hair manageable</li>
            <li> Have used Pantene products for the last 20 years.  Started using curl defining gel when it first came out as i have rather wavey hair which I like to keep about 2&amp;#34; in length.  THis product provides great all day hold, while giving a bit of curl to my hair.  Love the mousse, as its way lighter than the gel, and it provides the same hold.  I use less of the mousse when compared to other mousses as this product spreads nicely, and provides the hold and control I need.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair kind of crunchy.  I have tried blowing it dry but it still feels crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair (which was already curly) to give it extra body and the curls extra hold. Unfortunately, my hair turned into a mass of frizz. I&#x27;ll try using it a couple more times in different ways, but it looks like I&#x27;m probably going to switch back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> Great product for wave to straight hair</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair that is affected by humidity. It dos provide the wet look unless blown dry. I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believed I got it for free. Thanks</li>
            <li> Reviews for this product are all over the place for a reason: it was apparently very recently reformulated and is now sold in the white can that you see pictured, rather than the older, pink can.  The older product has good reviews, the newer product is a stiff, sticky mess (think &amp;#34;whipped white glue&amp;#34;) and would be wonderful if you needed a stiff, sticky hairstyle (think: mohawk used to trap flies) that ultimately leaves your hair dried out. But, if you&#x27;re looking for a replacement for the older mousse, you may have to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, very wavy hair and live in a humid climate.  I need a moisturizing product that won&#x27;t weigh my hair down while allowing my waves to stay shaped.  This product isn&#x27;t for me.  Thankfully I purchased it during a promotion and paid a pittance for it -- and even that was too much.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a great mousse! My curls are good for 2 days after application. Just a little water to reactivate the mousse and voila!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on the little one&#x27;s naturally curly hair for about 3 weeks. Unfortunately I am probably going to look for another brand. It has an alcohol scent which doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but the little one definitely prefers something more floral, fruity for her hair. No reflection on the product, just a personal choice. I also found the pump to be extremely hard to operate. This is my biggest gripe. I mean I can hardly apply any pressure at all no matter how hard I press it and when I can only a little is able to escape. It takes me so long to finish her hair because I literally am struggling just to get a small amount out of the can. Knowing that I still have 3 more cans is a little daunting (I bought a pack of 4). The mousse itself works great once you get it out of the can.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works great and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great the price was for 3 bottles! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I have tried gels, custards, and other mousses (most recently Jane Carter&#x27;s Twist Out mousse) and seriously this one works the best for me.  I first apply a creamy leave in to my damp hair, (currently loving Loreal&#x27;s EverSleek leave in), rake in well with my fingers, then part my hair in sections (I ned up doing like 6 sections total) and apply a dollop of mousse to each section and separate curls diligently before moving on to next section.  With the combo of leave in plus this mousse, my hair dries curly and soft, lasts all day, and decent looking  second day hair also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use only gentle sulfate free-shampoos (once a week I use either Kinky Curly Come Clean or a natural Soapnut shampoo, other days I just rinse my hair with As I am Cowash)  and I do not notice any build up at all from using this mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I did try the other pantene mousse, the conditioning whip one and it was too heavy for me.  This plain Curl Defining Mousse is the perfect one for me and so happy that it is affordable cause I have a ton of hair.  Buying the  three pack is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the only Mousse that makes my hair look really nice. I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the best.  The price is also great.</li>
            <li> Works well as expected. Quite happy with the product and the price. Would recommend to all my friends. Good buy.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. It works great for her naturally curly hair. It does a good job at keeping frizz away.</li>
            <li> Really excited about this deal I got. In the store these are $4.97 a piece so for the 3 I bought, I saved $5 , ty !</li>
            <li> The best mousse for wavy hair in humid weather. Pantene understands different hair types. I use a baseball size amount on my mid back length hair.</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic b/c there was a coupon to clip for it, but the product itself is ok. I thought it&#x27;d do better and holding curls.</li>
            <li> dispensing valve does not work and can not use the content</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. This was a great deal. Will order it again in the future. Anyone with curly hair should try it.</li>
