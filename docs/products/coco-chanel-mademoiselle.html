            <li>Love this!  </li>

            <li>He wears Chanel Bleu, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Always wonderful, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Okay, not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s all time favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>If I need to get out of the dog house, impress her or just show her how much I love her, I just buy her a bottle of this.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>love everything about this perfume but the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d best rotate it with other fragrances</li>
            <li>You only have to use one spray to smell great all day.</li>
            <li>The smell also differs from the original.</li>
            <li>Did not even smell right!</li>
            <li>This perfume is awesome, however for  the same price you can buy the bigger bottle in the mall, or on Sephora.com.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful my favorite but over priced and its not even the big bottle but a small one.</li>
            <li>May rose, jasmine, patchouli, Haitian vetiver, Bourbon vanilla, and white musk</li>
            <li>The first impression is almost splashy—a warm, sparkling mix of citrus and white flowers.</li>
            <li>He too gets asked what he is wearing by both genders ;)</li>
            <li>Perfume did not come completely full and the bottle is different from the one purchased at the mall, the smell also differs from the original.</li>
            <li>The high price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought the trail, to see if I really wanted to spend the money for this perfume.</li>
            <li>This perfume was not the real Chanel.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for a very dear friend of mine for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately at the price it is,  I&#x27;ll only be able to purchase it once in a great while.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say it goes down as one of my top five favorites.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about scents so my husband can only wear what I approve of.</li>
            <li>But when patchouli and vetiver notes emerge after a few minutes, the scent takes on a sexy, full-hipped quality that&#x27;s a little mysterious and totally unique but should be compared to this http://amzn.to/1F7QGLf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells a little diferent than original</li>

            <li> I bought the trail, to see if I really wanted to spend the money for this perfume. I&#x27;m glad that I did. The smell is so regal. I definitely will purchase again, but because it is so expensive, I will probably only wear it on special occasions.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t buy this online, I go to department stores. This is the only perfume I wear and it is the one I will be wearing until the day that I die. I LOVE it. I always get asked by both men and women what I am wearing. You only have to use one spray to smell great all day. I am very picky about scents so my husband can only wear what I approve of. He wears Chanel Bleu, it smells amazing. He too gets asked what he is wearing by both genders ;)</li>
            <li> Bought this for a very dear friend of mine for her birthday.  Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> GREAT product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller!</li>

            <li> just not enough of it for the price and the smell does not last that long</li>
            <li> Horrible! Did not even smell right!</li>
            <li> love everything about this perfume but the price.</li>
            <li> This is way over priced for the size of the bottle.  You can get a 3.7 oz bottle for 135. at Dillards.</li>
            <li> I was given this by my FIL and I have to say it goes down as one of my top five favorites.  Has excellent staying power and smells beautiful and mysterious.  Unfortunately at the price it is,  I&#x27;ll only be able to purchase it once in a great while.  I&#x27;d best rotate it with other fragrances so I won&#x27;t run out for a very long time!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell</li>
            <li> The first impression is almost splashy—a warm, sparkling mix of citrus and white flowers. But when patchouli and vetiver notes emerge after a few minutes, the scent takes on a sexy, full-hipped quality that&#x27;s a little mysterious and totally unique but should be compared to this http://amzn.to/1F7QGLf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES:&lt;br /&gt;Sicilian orange, bergamot, May rose, jasmine, patchouli, Haitian vetiver, Bourbon vanilla, and white musk</li>
            <li> Smells a little diferent than original</li>
            <li> This perfume is awesome, however for  the same price you can buy the bigger bottle in the mall, or on Sephora.com.</li>
            <li> This is not worth $115. The larger bottle is at the mall for the same price.</li>
