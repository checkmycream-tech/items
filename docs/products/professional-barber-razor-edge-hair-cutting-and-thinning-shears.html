            <li>These shears are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, amazing price.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for a spectacular pair of shears, just a pair I can use for my family of four.</li>
            <li>these arrived promptly in a nice case.</li>
            <li>I am a DIY-er and I trim my own hair.</li>
            <li>This is a nice feature because while I use the shears to trim my fringe, the man also likes to trim his beard and mustache with them...</li>
            <li>They are also a nice size.</li>
            <li>They come in a nice zipper pouch with two bands to hold the scissors in place.  </li>
            <li>these scissors are really really nice.</li>
            <li>They also come in a nice case and have rubber rings in the finger holes to make it easier to hold (or adjust the size of the holes I guess).</li>
            <li>Thank they work a treat, nice to handle and use.</li>
            <li>This a nice scissors and cuts hair well.  </li>
            <li>They do cut nicely tho</li>
            <li>They also came with a nice case.</li>
            <li>I use them to cut my own hair and they work like a dream.  </li>
            <li>Scissor has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>the shears came in their own nice leatherish case, nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair</li>
            <li>They come in this really nice zippered case.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice for touch ups or to cut bangs.</li>
            <li>Also comes in a case which is nice.</li>
            <li>My own fault</li>
            <li>The scissors came in a nice cushioned case that will store and protect the scissors.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>Scissors have nice cut to the tip, no squirming of the hair; I had to remove one of the rubber liners in the holes (nice to have)to</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair so this is specifically geared towards using in a mirror by yourself.  </li>
            <li>Best hair shears I&#x27;ve ever purchased - highly recommended!</li>
            <li>And  Has a nice case too.  </li>
            <li>Nice scissors.</li>
            <li>Since the whole idea of trimming your hair is to remove dry/split ends and not to cause them, these worked out great!</li>
            <li>The end is more rounded than it looks in the pictures, which is good because I was worried I&#x27;d stab myself with them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Something I find amusing is the &amp;#34;gold plated&amp;#34; parts shown in the photos.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a nice pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>and they came in a nice \\&quot;leatherette\\&quot; case...</li>
            <li>They also came with a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li>They arrived right on time and they came in a beautiful leather case.  </li>
            <li>I received the scissors very quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sharp and great feel on hands, great scissors!</li>
            <li>I was able to cut a family members hair and my own with these babies.  </li>
            <li>but I liked the longer scissors even better.</li>
            <li>These are better than a $55 dollar pair from a popular manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>These scissors are awesome so far.</li>
            <li>Scissors are not as precise as I&#x27;d like them to be but do a fair job.</li>
            <li>While the shears still cut effectively without them, I feel there is better control with the inserts remaining in.</li>
            <li>, I just liked the feel better</li>
            <li>Very sharp, convenient case, great for keeping my bangs at the perfect length.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Relatively cheap, attractive form, and smooth functioning</li>
            <li>but these did just fine!</li>
            <li>Very smooth pair of shears.</li>
            <li>and my wife finds the handle inserts to be very comfortable and make the scissors easier to work with.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and is good quality for price.</li>
            <li>The shears are a good comfortable weight, they come apart easily which is a plus for hand sharpening.</li>
            <li>I bought them in order to be able trim ends and they get the job done.</li>
            <li>Love these</li>
            <li>It is like magic.  </li>
            <li>Love the case and finger inserts.</li>
            <li>Okay probably his eyebrows too.</li>
            <li>I think that most men would have to remove the inserts to be able to use them.  </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>for\\&quot; ... SOMETIMES YOU GET MORE.    </li>
            <li>For the money I doubt you could find better.</li>
            <li>I am greatly glad if I choose one with 6.5&#x27; size.</li>
            <li>Are there sharper better quality shears out there, sure, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat these guys.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>And the scissors do have a tension adjuster - I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll learn to use that in time.</li>
            <li>Love the rubber inlay on the finger holes</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>and my wife love them .</li>
            <li>, they handle and cut SOOOOO much better than the pair I was using.</li>
            <li>I love them, I love the tension control and the feel in my hands.</li>
            <li>These are lovely shears.  </li>
            <li>I looked at many reviews before buying these</li>
            <li>and I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>My daughter is just starting out and these have been perfect for her!</li>
            <li>I think this is a good buy item, well worth the price.</li>

            <li>like most people, I have had many scissors in my lifetime, but let me tell you, these babies are</li>
            <li>Not even able to return it cause</li>
            <li>I am also pleased with the quality of these shears for the price.  </li>
            <li>I also love how inexpensive they are.  </li>
            <li>So smooth and they cut so nicely.</li>

            <li>I love these shears</li>
            <li>They are more elegant than I am used to as well...</li>

            <li>I have been looking for a smaller pair of shears for trimming bangs and these are perfect.</li>
            <li>I am not quite sure what to say about these-</li>
            <li>All for a cheap price!</li>
            <li>But I thought everything made sure you knew the country of its origin.</li>
            <li>thought they were ok until I got these --- the difference in sharpness and just sturdiness is significant.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>the price, these are waaaay better.</li>
            <li>I love these scissors.</li>

            <li>The scissors were exactly as described and of good quality.</li>
            <li>Nice little scissors, perfect for grooming.</li>
            <li>I got the 5.5\\&quot; and they fit very comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate reading reviews and want to make sure this product is well represented in an accurate way.</li>

            <li>Both of these scissors arrived in great looking cases and the shear itself looks quite professional.</li>
            <li>and they seem to be made of good quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li>I cut my sons hair and they were perfectly sharp for me and the length of the shears was perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner at using these on my boys but was very impressed with how sharp they are.</li>
            <li>These are really sharp and cut my sons hair great!</li>
            <li>They are well made, sharp and the custom tension knob works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Perfect size and extremely sharp</li>
            <li>And the removable eyelets make them easy to use for anyone.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase and anticipate more uses in the future.</li>
            <li>Popping out the plastic pieces gives him a more comfortable fit, while I trim with them in.</li>
            <li>On a side note: it would be great if we could see the products made in Pakistan, IN Pakistan, as opposed to only here on Amazon, to get the sales going even more.</li>
            <li>yeah, they cut well, are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and manuever...</li>
            <li>I received the scissors very quickly.</li>
            <li>However it is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to remove the rubber &#x27;thingies&#x27; to fit your fingers more comfortably.</li>
            <li>the tension adjustment and finger grips make them easy to use.</li>
            <li>Utopia Care&#x27; logo is easily scraped off with a fingernail without any damage to the polish of the blade.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>The bright metal shows high quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend these for great value and quality in general.</li>
            <li>Excellent, sharp shears that fit my hands well.  </li>
            <li>They have very comfortable handles, that are also very pretty (glittery translucent rubber covering for comfort).</li>
            <li>and they were precise and easy to handle</li>
            <li>Handles work fine for me.</li>
            <li>I trimmed my hair a couple of days ago and the shears were just fine.  </li>
            <li>(he has fine hair for reference).</li>
            <li>These scissors are precise and easy to manipulate, the ability to change the tightness makes them flexible in the way I use them</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to hold and easy to manipulate.  </li>
            <li>These work fine.</li>
            <li>Delivery came quickly and it looks just like the picture!</li>
            <li>and they certainly will do nicely.</li>
            <li>I was definitely not disappointed in terms of performance: The product performs well, is weighted well, and is easy to handle--with one exception: The openings for finger and thumb, in my estimation, should&#x27;ve been made a bit</li>
            <li>I also cut my daughter&#x27;s hair using the back ponytail listed on that page and it also turned out good--not as good as mine, but fine and better than paying a salon.</li>
            <li>Finger rings are removable for a comfortable fit on large fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a nice case.</li>
            <li>Super sharp awesome scissors for my beard.</li>
            <li>Super sharp scissors , perfect size for trimming mustache .</li>

            <li>Better than expected, great price.</li>
            <li>What a huge improvement this is over anything I used before.</li>
            <li>Great product for trimming hair in between cuts, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>These are fantastic scissors.</li>
            <li>My husband could not even try them because his fingers don&#x27;t begin to fit.      </li>
            <li>Comfortable hold..</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the quality of the scissors.</li>
            <li>They were priced fairly cheap</li>
            <li>They are a fantastic value</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>- the finger holes fit me without the inserts.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>handle holes have removable rubber inserts to customize fit.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable without the inserts...</li>
            <li>and they fit my hand comfortably (righty.</li>
            <li>The finger inserts are great as it can be removed and inserted back based on the size of your fingers.</li>
            <li>Great scissors, but they are too short.</li>
            <li>barely fit in them.</li>
            <li>Most definitely worth $15.</li>
            <li>However, thus far it is doing a good job for home haircuts.</li>
            <li>They are solidly manufactured and came nicely packaged in their own zippered pouch.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to adjust the scissor tension to make it just right for me.</li>
            <li>The zippered case they come in is also very nice, and makes them present</li>
            <li>I will use them on VERY RARE occasions.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a decent pair of scissors to trim my son&#x27;s hair and these more than fit the bill!  </li>
            <li>Metal is polished, smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I have small hands and they fit perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>I finally used these scissors to cut my daughters hair, they were amazing!</li>
            <li>Perfect for a mustache, beard and even nostril trim but a bit on the small side.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the money !&lt;</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone looking for a sharp scissor at a good price!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>removable rubbery rings inside the finger holes were more than a bit snug for my large fingers, but once out, the scissors fit my fingers quite well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to exploring more of those tips and tricks, and since these scissors are sharp and easy to use, they were a perfect fit for me for occasional home use.</li>
            <li>, just go for it, they cut really nice and feel and look great, also I had no problem with the holes that people say are too small, they fit just right without the rubber circles they come with.</li>
            <li>Good quality scissors at a reasonable price with prompt delivery - thanks.</li>
            <li>Light weight, great feel, sharp blades</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d better take them off if you have large fingers.</li>
            <li>I bought the 5.5&amp;#34; to trim my beard, and for this it does a good job, cleanly slicing off the individual hairs that stick up.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast , it came with a nice protective case and also they are really pretty in person.</li>
            <li>Clean, quick cut every time.  </li>
            <li>good wish the finger holes were bigger</li>
            <li>so maybe I&#x27;ll get an extra one since it&#x27;s at a good price</li>
            <li>Love them, fast delivery</li>
            <li>I thought these scissors were very affordable and better quality than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>All in all for the price not a bad pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>These ones cut very cleanly and easily, and look very professional.</li>
            <li>get a comfortable fit for my thumb, but have large thumbs.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are great.  </li>
            <li>These shears are sharp and a great value for the price.  </li>
            <li>accompanying zippered faux leather case provides good storage and requires precious little space when stored on its side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it to cut my daughter&#x27;s bangs for the first time, it turned out fine.  </li>
            <li>They came quickly and the company followed up to assure my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery; item just as described</li>
            <li>All in all very pleased , especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>They are also tension adjustable and the large nut is easy to operate.</li>
            <li>exactly what was expected; great quality.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast returns</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality very sharp fast delivery very good overall</li>
            <li>My thumb is stopped before the first joint!  </li>
            <li>and I have pretty skinny fingers!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for to cut bangs!  </li>
            <li>Very nice, sharp!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and cut looks professional.</li>
            <li>I have to remove the inserts to use them and find that my fairly large fingers fit well.</li>
            <li>for little money it&#x27;s great value and works like pro Scisors</li>
            <li>Maybe if I didn&#x27;t have short chunky fingers they would fit better.</li>
            <li>Scissors are nice enough and cut well.</li>
            <li>they seem to bee ok so far.</li>
            <li>After one use, these Utopia Care scissors are far better than anything I had before.  </li>
            <li>An extra - It came in a nice case.</li>
            <li>it is worth noting.  </li>
            <li>far I am pleased and would order them again.</li>
            <li>Has great grip and is very sharp!</li>
            <li>I love these scissors and the quality of them is unbelievably good for the small price!</li>
            <li>Sharp, cheap and look nice.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re lightweight, feel comfortable, and are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and splits easily after a cut with bad scissors, but these have been great!</li>
            <li>Right on time before Christmas as gift to my brother</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to bend your arm until it hurts to get to the right position, then buy a longer pair.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall apart, have the right amount of tension.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long they ll hold an edge, but so far they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>Great little pair of scissors for the price!  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, great buy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>A great pair of well crafted and very sharp scissors for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>And I have very large hands and fingers.</li>
            <li>If you are new to cutting your own hair, I recommend you try it too--it took me exactly four minutes to cut my hair and it came out great!</li>
            <li>These are very comfortable, sharp and easy to use shears.  </li>
            <li>Great small scissors.</li>
            <li>These scissors somehow keep the hair in, so you cut it the hair the first time, right where you want to.  </li>
            <li>Great scissor...razor sharp so far !</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needed small, sharp dedicated hair scissors, and these fit the bill nicely and at a good price.</li>
            <li>do not occupy more than my fair share of space on this planet but, perhaps without my realizing it until now, my fingers and thumbs are a tad bit larger than those of the average female--although not noticeably so.</li>
            <li>The tension knob is a nice feature, however, it kept coming loose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not  a professional hair stylist, but these cut smoothly and easily without fraying or squeezing the hair.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Finger openings heard towards female hands but works OK for me</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair that mortal scissors cannot cut - the hairs simply get pushed aside by the blades.</li>
            <li>this will last for many years.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Super Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>Be aware they state</li>
            <li>Much better than your regular supermarket scissors.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li>Style and length were exactly what she needed.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this product really rocks.  </li>
            <li>Item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Fits my wife&#x27;s hand exactly and works wells every time.</li>
            <li>First:  </li>
            <li>and I shall return for more scissors in the future.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quality shipping and the entire product.</li>
            <li>and they look pretty swanky to boot.</li>
            <li>I love them I took out the inner plastic liners.&lt;br /&gt;Joanne</li>
            <li>is the first time I have purchased from this seller but I will be a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li>Nicely crafted and highly polished, no rough edges, has a high quality look.</li>
            <li>Really professional, good material but light, big enough...</li>
            <li>Easy to use for both a left hander (me) and right hander (hubby).</li>
            <li>Other than that, the quality is amazing for this price.</li>
            <li>These came sharp and in a nice case.</li>
            <li>I bought the 6.5 to cut my flat top with and they work to perfection.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp cut.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair the other day.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re not as sharp as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>They have a nice sharp edge on them</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>I have small hands, so I find these very comfortable and easy to control.</li>
            <li>This may be preferred for using the tips of the shears to cut in good light, but for trimming a beard along the neck where visibility is poor, I would have preferred the inside corners to also have been rounded to avoid the risk of nicking the skin.</li>
            <li>The hair cuts cleanly and just as I intended it to, with  no pulls or unexpected angles.  </li>
            <li>good quality scissors, used for cutting my own bangs.</li>
            <li>Now, this isn&#x27;t saying much, but I will say that they cut my coarse beard better than ANYTHING else</li>
            <li>I love these shears, exactly what I was looking for, I have two long haired cats their fur matts,</li>
            <li>perfect for little jobs like bangs, although you probably want something bigger for regular full haircuts.</li>
            <li>These are a very well made,  nice sharp pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li>razor sharp and comfortable fit....</li>
            <li>These remind me of my first pair of professional shears that were much more expensive, so I think overall they are a great deal!</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp!</li>
            <li>The new ones are slightly smaller, very sharp, in a very good case.  </li>
            <li>It cuts so easily , that I actually cut too much off the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>The shears are also sharp and cut cleanly, even through fine hair, and do not tug or pull.  </li>
            <li>But if I remember or someone prompts me in the next couple of months I will provide a full update!</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t think I have a large thumb.</li>
            <li>I have large hands and chubby fingers and had no problem with the finger holes.</li>
            <li>and I have large hands for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have not had them long enough to comment on how well they hold their edge, but so far I am happy with them.</li>
            <li>This also holds true for MANY, if not all, surgical instruments and sports goods, which are made in Pakistan but sadly, to my demise, exported mostly.</li>
            <li>They came in a decent case and look, feel and cut as well as my OL faithful ones from 94!</li>
            <li>Most scissors just die trying, but these are super sharp, and the adjustable tension lets you find the sweet spot where they&#x27;ll move smoothly, but still cut stiff beard hair.</li>
            <li>nice little case</li>
            <li>The scissors sit comfortably and yet firmly on my fingers and the gliding of the shears speaks to a really finely honed edge.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with ease of use even for this amateur.  </li>
            <li>Awesome cutting scissors.</li>
            <li>So many grooming items automatically come with eye-rolling pink accessories which is *not* my style.</li>
            <li>They shipped incredibly fast as well.</li>
            <li>I should have really looked at the ruler.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re an absolute must for precision and scissor-over-comb cuts.</li>
            <li>When working with thicker hair you hear the &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; more- wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend these shears for scissor over comb haircuts but still worth having as a back up.</li>
            <li>But, they do slice though hair very efficiently.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These scissors really work well</li>
            <li>The tensioning knob handles very well, &amp;#34;clicking&amp;#34; as you tighten, and do seem to serve their intended function.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks UTOPIA CARE</li>
            <li>fast shipping/delivery.</li>
            <li>Also, it comes with a very sturdy professional-looking case.</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>I really like the shorter blades to trim around my husband&#x27;s ears and the blunt end</li>
            <li>BUT IT ISN&#x27;T REALLY A PROBLE</li>
            <li>Quality product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>and I really like the removable inserts on them to adjust for finger size.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very comfortable/usable).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>The blade is convex which is supposed to give a smoother cut.  </li>
            <li>They cut very well</li>
            <li>Adjustable tension knob is a real plus.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve made some real progress in bringing up the quality of their metal</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve kept their edge really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just got through giving the scissors a very close inspection.</li>
            <li>These are the best hair cutting scissors I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I did remove the grommets though I didn&#x27;t really have to</li>
            <li>I love them but was surprised that the 5&amp;#34; measurement described the overall length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a gal who occasionally gets ballsy enough to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>These do that, handle quite nicely, and appear to be built to last (relatively).</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not rate them 5 stars is because the cool case they come with broke on the first time I tried to zip/unzip it.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>they are sharp, do not leave split ends, and are very comfortable on the hands.</li>
            <li>They ARE small but that suits me fine; they&#x27;re very sharp and as far as I can see, doing a good job!</li>
            <li>one real bad, these were perfect, the right size, am sure they would work for cutting one&#x27;s hair too, just love them!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely a good pair of scissors for the money, hope htey last and stay sharp.</li>
            <li>It is very sharp, so it cuts hair smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the leather carrying case to keep them sharp.</li>
            <li>Good value, however the thumb hole is very small.</li>
            <li>Im not a professional but the scissors work just fine.</li>
            <li>Overall though, I think these are great for an amateur like myself.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, and seem like really good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and very sharp which is a must for trimming your mustache and beard.</li>
            <li>The shears are sharp and cut very cleanly.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comfortable and don&#x27;t fatigue the hand after long usage.</li>
            <li>The short blades allow more maneuverability and make clipping around delicate areas more manageable.  </li>
            <li>The shear is very good and the seller have a nice service, but I wrongly choose the small size of 5.5&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li>After sharpening and tuning up my $360.00 shears since 1994 it was time for new ones!</li>
            <li>They are so sharp and accurate that you cant even hear them when cutting, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>The thumb and finger rings, are small, and best for small hands.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for trimming my mousche and beard, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>She likes these more than the more expensive shers that she has.</li>
            <li>better than the last 2 scissors (not the same make)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy a nicer more expensive pair until I was sure I could do a decent job</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see how a more expensive pair could be any better.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the smaller size because it gives me more control over the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are small, easy to handle, and designed for as exact a cut as a person could want!</li>
            <li>Very professional instrument for the price !  </li>
            <li>Seem like a high quality pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>They feel high quality just like ones used by proffesionals.</li>
            <li>High quality shears.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>They also cut very well: sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>They are fairly sharp and look nice, but they don&#x27;t work as well left handed.  </li>
            <li>For the man who takes a little more time to groom.</li>
            <li>They are quite sharp and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping so far</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to match the Remington barber scissors, made in Germany from the finest stainless steel, which have served me so well for the past dozen years.  </li>
            <li>Not for use by a man with normal size hands.</li>
            <li>Now, my hands pretty much have not grown since I stopped getting taller at age 12, but I can&#x27;t properly situate my fingers in the holes to operate the scissors.</li>
            <li>It definitely deserves five stars and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but they are very sharp and also look very cool.</li>
            <li>Right now, the only places that still have the gold color on it are those places that can&#x27;t be touched.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and work smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and fit my fingers well.</li>
            <li>Small, comfortable, excellent for cutting baby&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not kidding--I pulled it forward in a ponytail, used these scissors to carefully cut straight across, pulled it out of the ponytail, shook it out, and wham, new pretty style!).</li>
            <li>the knob for setting the tightness was new to me.</li>
            <li>Have tried it for my new hair style.</li>
            <li>In terms of the holes for the fingers -- I really appreciated that they stay on the top part of the fingers instead of sliding down as regular scissors do.</li>
            <li>very sharp blades, easy to grip.</li>
            <li>and they even do it for free for me; but my last visit left my bangs not how I described</li>
            <li>This is definitely a 5-star product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I know I shouldn&#x27;t care about this because it really has little bearing on the overall functionality of the item, but I was so happy the plastic pieces and case were BLACK.</li>
            <li>We spent a while trying to find ones that were the right length and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>star only because its priced higher considering that its made in Pakistan.</li>
            <li>The scissors were better than the ones I paid hundreds of dollars for in the past.</li>
            <li>The finger loops are a bit small but they came with rubber rings that pull out and give more room.</li>
            <li>be aware, the wholes (with the rubber) is TINY.</li>
            <li>Most \\&quot;beard trimmers\\&quot; are too small.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are sharp and make clean cuts.</li>
            <li>My hands are somewhat small and they fit really well.</li>
            <li>One note, the finger holes were quite different than regular scissors, but i got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to receive these shears because of all the good reviews, but upon receiving I was disappointed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have large hands but can only get my fingertips in the holes</li>
            <li>If you have large hands you may want to go with the bigger size.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>They are super sharp and</li>
            <li>they are super sharp which is a must</li>
            <li>I did try them out and they are super sharp, so I&#x27;ll be keeping them.  </li>
            <li>Scissors are great for cutting hair.</li>
            <li>keeps me from cutting him (which he greatly appreciates).  </li>
            <li>but they make you pay return shipping for an item that&#x27;s not that great and caught in my kids hair and pulled them out while I was cutting.</li>
            <li>The scissors function as they should, but when you state that they are made of Japanese stainless steel and its clearly stamped on the sheers . . . .</li>
            <li>It CLEARLY states MADE IN PAKISTAN on the item.</li>
            <li>These cut MUCH nicer than similarly priced scissors at chain stores.    </li>
            <li>Not anything  close to professional grade..</li>
            <li>Scissors feel like professional grade.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say much about precision and such as of yet because I&#x27;ve only used them once</li>
            <li>Please note I&#x27;m not a stylist or hair professional.</li>
            <li>, as our old \\&quot;professional\\&quot; scissors always pushed the hair out as you cut it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them to cut my hair, and didn&#x27;t have the hand fatigue as with my old pair.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;SS Pakistan\\&quot; although the dealer claims they are made with Japanese stainless steel.</li>
            <li>I like shears so much that I am ordering the second pair for home use.  </li>
            <li>These shear looked old and used.</li>
            <li>The finger rest and knob adjuster was gold in color but was faded from use, the case looked old as well.</li>
            <li>Gives me a much cleaner, nicer cut than my last pair</li>
            <li>Marked:</li>
            <li>I used to be a professional hairstylist and now just do it for friends and family on occasion.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I sometimes like to cut my own hair and the screw that holds the two parts of the scissors together tends to get in the way at times.</li>
            <li>I bought these to use as a beard/mustache &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34;-- wanted a decently sharp pair of shears that would fit well in my hand for some precision facial</li>
            <li>They cut okay, but very small finger holes.  </li>
            <li>The size is good, if a little small.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just had it too loose in the first place</li>
            <li>Quality scissors that are very sharp and excellent for cutting hair.</li>
            <li>Thus they are much smaller than I expected but still adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is incredibly thick, and these just breeze right through it!!  </li>
            <li>There is no other product information on any packaging and there are no inserts.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>This set was just right in terms of blade length and is very sharp and cuts well.  </li>
            <li>so that you can get very exact, very VERY sharp!  </li>
            <li>and I have spent a large amount of money on shears.  </li>
            <li>My old scissors never cut cleanly through thick hair but these do every time.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, easy to hold and seem like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to trim my mustache and do general hair maintenance.</li>
            <li>They are small but are perfect when I am cutting my kids and my husbands hair.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have expected too much for the price..  </li>
            <li>The soft rubber inserts make the finger holes smaller but that&#x27;s the point...</li>
            <li>I am a part time hair dresser and have only used them a dozen times so far.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I expected them to be much sharper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my second pair - my wife had used the prior pair to cut a thick plastic band and as a result they lost their magical powers - they could no longer cut my hair.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the rubber finger gribs pop out too easy.</li>
            <li>Only down side is that since I have a 5.5&amp;#34; wedding ring I thought that would be the right size for me.</li>
            <li>I would agree with other reviewers that these are too small for most men&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair on my own and one thing that is very difficult is to find is an inexpensive yet high quality hair scissors .</li>
            <li>These are way better than other hair cutting scissors available at the same price point.</li>
            <li>I found them helpful, although I do have pretty small fingers, so I had no trouble holding the scissors at all.</li>
            <li>I would not buy these as a professional, but for personal use only.</li>
            <li>and I felt these shears are not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and sharp!!</li>
            <li>I am a petite girl with thin fingers and the holes are a little tight, but I take out the anti-slip things inside the rings and they fit much better.</li>
            <li>These scissors are really sharp and great for cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember these have a razor edge and are not as forgiving as basic scissors so some hairs may get pulled out if you&#x27;re not careful as you go.&lt;br /&gt;These will be in my travel kit and bathroom permanently.  </li>
            <li>These shears are decent for the cost, sharp, and as described in the promo.</li>
            <li>Remember to never cut anything else with them or they will dull quickly just like all scissors.  </li>
            <li>No more throwing money at a hairdresser who never seems to get it quite right.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and do a great job at cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>I have large thumbs and the thumb hole is just large enough which makes the scissors uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t remove them frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them primarily for trimming the &#x27;stache, but I&#x27;ve also used them for cutting the kids&#x27; hair and they&#x27;ve proven to be very reliable (and sharp).&lt;br</li>

            <li> These work great for what we were looking for - something good for trimming my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I think most professionals would find them to be excellent as well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as my hairdresser can do--she is amazing--but I am happy with it and it does not look at all like I did it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Good quality scissors come in zippered storage pouchu.  </li>
            <li> Good pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> (Good).  </li>
            <li> Good cut ..</li>
            <li> yet again how good can something be for that price.</li>
            <li> They feel well in the hand and are a good length for my hair trimming purposes.</li>
            <li> Time will tell on the quality of the steel, but I am impressed with the fit and finish.  </li>
            <li> and so I decided that I would practice myself and get good at it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They arrived on time in good condition.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li> was just looking for a good, good-value pair of hair shears and these are just what I had in mind.</li>
            <li> The quality seems really good</li>
            <li> good looking cut</li>
            <li> A good value for the price.  </li>
            <li> price + good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Good price, too.</li>
            <li> They looked good for my needs, and appear to be what I wanted.</li>
            <li> so they fit me perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you had someone else cut your hair then these would be good.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work and keep trying for perfection.</li>

            <li> These shears are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, amazing price.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a spectacular pair of shears, just a pair I can use for my family of four.</li>
            <li> these arrived promptly in a nice case.</li>
            <li> I am a DIY-er and I trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> This is a nice feature because while I use the shears to trim my fringe, the man also likes to trim his beard and mustache with them...</li>
            <li> They are also a nice size.</li>
            <li> They come in a nice zipper pouch with two bands to hold the scissors in place.  </li>
            <li> these scissors are really really nice.</li>
            <li> They also come in a nice case and have rubber rings in the finger holes to make it easier to hold (or adjust the size of the holes I guess).</li>
            <li> Thank they work a treat, nice to handle and use.</li>
            <li> This a nice scissors and cuts hair well.  </li>
            <li> They do cut nicely tho</li>
            <li> They also came with a nice case.</li>
            <li> I use them to cut my own hair and they work like a dream.  </li>
            <li> Scissor has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> the shears came in their own nice leatherish case, nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair</li>
            <li> They come in this really nice zippered case.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice for touch ups or to cut bangs.</li>
            <li> Also comes in a case which is nice.</li>
            <li> My own fault</li>
            <li> The scissors came in a nice cushioned case that will store and protect the scissors.</li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> Scissors have nice cut to the tip, no squirming of the hair; I had to remove one of the rubber liners in the holes (nice to have)to</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair so this is specifically geared towards using in a mirror by yourself.  </li>
            <li> Best hair shears I&#x27;ve ever purchased - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> And  Has a nice case too.  </li>
            <li> Nice scissors.</li>
            <li> Since the whole idea of trimming your hair is to remove dry/split ends and not to cause them, these worked out great!</li>
            <li> The end is more rounded than it looks in the pictures, which is good because I was worried I&#x27;d stab myself with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something I find amusing is the &amp;#34;gold plated&amp;#34; parts shown in the photos.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a nice pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> and they came in a nice \\&quot;leatherette\\&quot; case...</li>
            <li> They also came with a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li> They arrived right on time and they came in a beautiful leather case.  </li>
            <li> I received the scissors very quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp and great feel on hands, great scissors!</li>
            <li> I was able to cut a family members hair and my own with these babies.  </li>
            <li> but I liked the longer scissors even better.</li>
            <li> These are better than a $55 dollar pair from a popular manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> These scissors are awesome so far.</li>
            <li> Scissors are not as precise as I&#x27;d like them to be but do a fair job.</li>
            <li> While the shears still cut effectively without them, I feel there is better control with the inserts remaining in.</li>
            <li> , I just liked the feel better</li>
            <li> Very sharp, convenient case, great for keeping my bangs at the perfect length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Relatively cheap, attractive form, and smooth functioning</li>
            <li> but these did just fine!</li>
            <li> Very smooth pair of shears.</li>
            <li> and my wife finds the handle inserts to be very comfortable and make the scissors easier to work with.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and is good quality for price.</li>
            <li> The shears are a good comfortable weight, they come apart easily which is a plus for hand sharpening.</li>
            <li> I bought them in order to be able trim ends and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Love these</li>
            <li> It is like magic.  </li>
            <li> Love the case and finger inserts.</li>
            <li> Okay probably his eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> I think that most men would have to remove the inserts to be able to use them.  </li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> for\\&quot; ... SOMETIMES YOU GET MORE.    </li>
            <li> For the money I doubt you could find better.</li>
            <li> I am greatly glad if I choose one with 6.5&#x27; size.</li>
            <li> Are there sharper better quality shears out there, sure, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat these guys.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> And the scissors do have a tension adjuster - I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll learn to use that in time.</li>
            <li> Love the rubber inlay on the finger holes</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> and my wife love them .</li>
            <li> , they handle and cut SOOOOO much better than the pair I was using.</li>
            <li> I love them, I love the tension control and the feel in my hands.</li>
            <li> These are lovely shears.  </li>
            <li> I looked at many reviews before buying these</li>
            <li> and I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> My daughter is just starting out and these have been perfect for her!</li>
            <li> I think this is a good buy item, well worth the price.</li>

            <li> like most people, I have had many scissors in my lifetime, but let me tell you, these babies are</li>

            <li> They are more elegant than I am used to as well...</li>
            <li> I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, TOTALLY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a smaller pair of shears for trimming bangs and these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure what to say about these-</li>
            <li> All for a cheap price!</li>
            <li> But I thought everything made sure you knew the country of its origin.</li>
            <li> thought they were ok until I got these --- the difference in sharpness and just sturdiness is significant.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> the price, these are waaaay better.</li>
            <li> I love these scissors.</li>

            <li> and they seem to be made of good quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I cut my sons hair and they were perfectly sharp for me and the length of the shears was perfect.</li>

            <li> I am happy with the purchase and anticipate more uses in the future.</li>
            <li> Popping out the plastic pieces gives him a more comfortable fit, while I trim with them in.</li>
            <li> On a side note: it would be great if we could see the products made in Pakistan, IN Pakistan, as opposed to only here on Amazon, to get the sales going even more.</li>
            <li> yeah, they cut well, are easy to use.</li>

            <li> and they were precise and easy to handle</li>
            <li> Handles work fine for me.</li>

            <li> and they certainly will do nicely.</li>
            <li> I was definitely not disappointed in terms of performance: The product performs well, is weighted well, and is easy to handle--with one exception: The openings for finger and thumb, in my estimation, should&#x27;ve been made a bit</li>
            <li> I also cut my daughter&#x27;s hair using the back ponytail listed on that page and it also turned out good--not as good as mine, but fine and better than paying a salon.</li>

            <li> The finger inserts are great as it can be removed and inserted back based on the size of your fingers.</li>
            <li> Great scissors, but they are too short.</li>
            <li> barely fit in them.</li>
            <li> Most definitely worth $15.</li>
            <li> However, thus far it is doing a good job for home haircuts.</li>
            <li> They are solidly manufactured and came nicely packaged in their own zippered pouch.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to adjust the scissor tension to make it just right for me.</li>

            <li> I will use them on VERY RARE occasions.</li>

            <li> They don&#x27;t fall apart, have the right amount of tension.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they ll hold an edge, but so far they&#x27;re great.</li>

            <li> If you are new to cutting your own hair, I recommend you try it too--it took me exactly four minutes to cut my hair and it came out great!</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable, sharp and easy to use shears.  </li>
            <li> Great small scissors.</li>
            <li> These scissors somehow keep the hair in, so you cut it the hair the first time, right where you want to.  </li>
            <li> Great scissor...razor sharp so far !</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needed small, sharp dedicated hair scissors, and these fit the bill nicely and at a good price.</li>
            <li> do not occupy more than my fair share of space on this planet but, perhaps without my realizing it until now, my fingers and thumbs are a tad bit larger than those of the average female--although not noticeably so.</li>
            <li> The tension knob is a nice feature, however, it kept coming loose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not  a professional hair stylist, but these cut smoothly and easily without fraying or squeezing the hair.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Finger openings heard towards female hands but works OK for me</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair that mortal scissors cannot cut - the hairs simply get pushed aside by the blades.</li>
            <li> this will last for many years.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Super Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> Be aware they state</li>
            <li> Much better than your regular supermarket scissors.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> Style and length were exactly what she needed.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product really rocks.  </li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Fits my wife&#x27;s hand exactly and works wells every time.</li>
            <li> First:  </li>
            <li> and I shall return for more scissors in the future.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quality shipping and the entire product.</li>
            <li> and they look pretty swanky to boot.</li>
            <li> I love them I took out the inner plastic liners.&lt;br /&gt;Joanne</li>
            <li> is the first time I have purchased from this seller but I will be a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li> Nicely crafted and highly polished, no rough edges, has a high quality look.</li>
            <li> Really professional, good material but light, big enough...</li>
            <li> Easy to use for both a left hander (me) and right hander (hubby).</li>
            <li> Other than that, the quality is amazing for this price.</li>
            <li> These came sharp and in a nice case.</li>
            <li> I bought the 6.5 to cut my flat top with and they work to perfection.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp cut.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair the other day.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re not as sharp as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> They have a nice sharp edge on them</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> I have small hands, so I find these very comfortable and easy to control.</li>
            <li> This may be preferred for using the tips of the shears to cut in good light, but for trimming a beard along the neck where visibility is poor, I would have preferred the inside corners to also have been rounded to avoid the risk of nicking the skin.</li>
            <li> The hair cuts cleanly and just as I intended it to, with  no pulls or unexpected angles.  </li>
            <li> good quality scissors, used for cutting my own bangs.</li>
            <li> Now, this isn&#x27;t saying much, but I will say that they cut my coarse beard better than ANYTHING else</li>
            <li> I love these shears, exactly what I was looking for, I have two long haired cats their fur matts,</li>
            <li> perfect for little jobs like bangs, although you probably want something bigger for regular full haircuts.</li>
            <li> These are a very well made,  nice sharp pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li> razor sharp and comfortable fit....</li>
            <li> These remind me of my first pair of professional shears that were much more expensive, so I think overall they are a great deal!</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp!</li>
            <li> The new ones are slightly smaller, very sharp, in a very good case.  </li>
            <li> It cuts so easily , that I actually cut too much off the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> The shears are also sharp and cut cleanly, even through fine hair, and do not tug or pull.  </li>
            <li> But if I remember or someone prompts me in the next couple of months I will provide a full update!</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t think I have a large thumb.</li>
            <li> I have large hands and chubby fingers and had no problem with the finger holes.</li>
            <li> and I have large hands for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have not had them long enough to comment on how well they hold their edge, but so far I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> This also holds true for MANY, if not all, surgical instruments and sports goods, which are made in Pakistan but sadly, to my demise, exported mostly.</li>
            <li> They came in a decent case and look, feel and cut as well as my OL faithful ones from 94!</li>
            <li> Most scissors just die trying, but these are super sharp, and the adjustable tension lets you find the sweet spot where they&#x27;ll move smoothly, but still cut stiff beard hair.</li>
            <li> nice little case</li>
            <li> The scissors sit comfortably and yet firmly on my fingers and the gliding of the shears speaks to a really finely honed edge.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with ease of use even for this amateur.  </li>
            <li> Awesome cutting scissors.</li>
            <li> So many grooming items automatically come with eye-rolling pink accessories which is *not* my style.</li>
            <li> They shipped incredibly fast as well.</li>
            <li> I should have really looked at the ruler.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re an absolute must for precision and scissor-over-comb cuts.</li>
            <li> When working with thicker hair you hear the &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; more- wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend these shears for scissor over comb haircuts but still worth having as a back up.</li>
            <li> But, they do slice though hair very efficiently.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These scissors really work well</li>
            <li> The tensioning knob handles very well, &amp;#34;clicking&amp;#34; as you tighten, and do seem to serve their intended function.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks UTOPIA CARE</li>
            <li> fast shipping/delivery.</li>
            <li> Also, it comes with a very sturdy professional-looking case.</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> I really like the shorter blades to trim around my husband&#x27;s ears and the blunt end</li>
            <li> BUT IT ISN&#x27;T REALLY A PROBLE</li>
            <li> Quality product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> and I really like the removable inserts on them to adjust for finger size.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very comfortable/usable).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> The blade is convex which is supposed to give a smoother cut.  </li>
            <li> They cut very well</li>
            <li> Adjustable tension knob is a real plus.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made some real progress in bringing up the quality of their metal</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve kept their edge really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just got through giving the scissors a very close inspection.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair cutting scissors I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I did remove the grommets though I didn&#x27;t really have to</li>
            <li> I love them but was surprised that the 5&amp;#34; measurement described the overall length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a gal who occasionally gets ballsy enough to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> These do that, handle quite nicely, and appear to be built to last (relatively).</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not rate them 5 stars is because the cool case they come with broke on the first time I tried to zip/unzip it.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> they are sharp, do not leave split ends, and are very comfortable on the hands.</li>
            <li> They ARE small but that suits me fine; they&#x27;re very sharp and as far as I can see, doing a good job!</li>
            <li> one real bad, these were perfect, the right size, am sure they would work for cutting one&#x27;s hair too, just love them!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely a good pair of scissors for the money, hope htey last and stay sharp.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp, so it cuts hair smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the leather carrying case to keep them sharp.</li>
            <li> Good value, however the thumb hole is very small.</li>
            <li> Im not a professional but the scissors work just fine.</li>
            <li> Overall though, I think these are great for an amateur like myself.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, and seem like really good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and very sharp which is a must for trimming your mustache and beard.</li>
            <li> The shears are sharp and cut very cleanly.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re comfortable and don&#x27;t fatigue the hand after long usage.</li>
            <li> The short blades allow more maneuverability and make clipping around delicate areas more manageable.  </li>
            <li> The shear is very good and the seller have a nice service, but I wrongly choose the small size of 5.5&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> After sharpening and tuning up my $360.00 shears since 1994 it was time for new ones!</li>
            <li> They are so sharp and accurate that you cant even hear them when cutting, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> The thumb and finger rings, are small, and best for small hands.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for trimming my mousche and beard, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> She likes these more than the more expensive shers that she has.</li>
            <li> better than the last 2 scissors (not the same make)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy a nicer more expensive pair until I was sure I could do a decent job</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see how a more expensive pair could be any better.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the smaller size because it gives me more control over the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are small, easy to handle, and designed for as exact a cut as a person could want!</li>
            <li> Very professional instrument for the price !  </li>
            <li> Seem like a high quality pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> They feel high quality just like ones used by proffesionals.</li>
            <li> High quality shears.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> They also cut very well: sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> They are fairly sharp and look nice, but they don&#x27;t work as well left handed.  </li>
            <li> For the man who takes a little more time to groom.</li>
            <li> They are quite sharp and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping so far</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to match the Remington barber scissors, made in Germany from the finest stainless steel, which have served me so well for the past dozen years.  </li>
            <li> Not for use by a man with normal size hands.</li>
            <li> Now, my hands pretty much have not grown since I stopped getting taller at age 12, but I can&#x27;t properly situate my fingers in the holes to operate the scissors.</li>
            <li> It definitely deserves five stars and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but they are very sharp and also look very cool.</li>
            <li> Right now, the only places that still have the gold color on it are those places that can&#x27;t be touched.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and work smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and fit my fingers well.</li>
            <li> Small, comfortable, excellent for cutting baby&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not kidding--I pulled it forward in a ponytail, used these scissors to carefully cut straight across, pulled it out of the ponytail, shook it out, and wham, new pretty style!).</li>
            <li> the knob for setting the tightness was new to me.</li>
            <li> Have tried it for my new hair style.</li>
            <li> In terms of the holes for the fingers -- I really appreciated that they stay on the top part of the fingers instead of sliding down as regular scissors do.</li>
            <li> very sharp blades, easy to grip.</li>
            <li> and they even do it for free for me; but my last visit left my bangs not how I described</li>
            <li> This is definitely a 5-star product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I know I shouldn&#x27;t care about this because it really has little bearing on the overall functionality of the item, but I was so happy the plastic pieces and case were BLACK.</li>
            <li> We spent a while trying to find ones that were the right length and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> star only because its priced higher considering that its made in Pakistan.</li>
            <li> The scissors were better than the ones I paid hundreds of dollars for in the past.</li>
            <li> The finger loops are a bit small but they came with rubber rings that pull out and give more room.</li>
            <li> be aware, the wholes (with the rubber) is TINY.</li>
            <li> Most \\&quot;beard trimmers\\&quot; are too small.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp and make clean cuts.</li>
            <li> My hands are somewhat small and they fit really well.</li>
            <li> One note, the finger holes were quite different than regular scissors, but i got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to receive these shears because of all the good reviews, but upon receiving I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have large hands but can only get my fingertips in the holes</li>
            <li> If you have large hands you may want to go with the bigger size.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> They are super sharp and</li>
            <li> they are super sharp which is a must</li>
            <li> I did try them out and they are super sharp, so I&#x27;ll be keeping them.  </li>
            <li> Scissors are great for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> keeps me from cutting him (which he greatly appreciates).  </li>
            <li> but they make you pay return shipping for an item that&#x27;s not that great and caught in my kids hair and pulled them out while I was cutting.</li>
            <li> The scissors function as they should, but when you state that they are made of Japanese stainless steel and its clearly stamped on the sheers . . . .</li>
            <li> It CLEARLY states MADE IN PAKISTAN on the item.</li>
            <li> These cut MUCH nicer than similarly priced scissors at chain stores.    </li>
            <li> Not anything  close to professional grade..</li>
            <li> Scissors feel like professional grade.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say much about precision and such as of yet because I&#x27;ve only used them once</li>
            <li> Please note I&#x27;m not a stylist or hair professional.</li>
            <li> , as our old \\&quot;professional\\&quot; scissors always pushed the hair out as you cut it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them to cut my hair, and didn&#x27;t have the hand fatigue as with my old pair.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;SS Pakistan\\&quot; although the dealer claims they are made with Japanese stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I like shears so much that I am ordering the second pair for home use.  </li>
            <li> These shear looked old and used.</li>
            <li> The finger rest and knob adjuster was gold in color but was faded from use, the case looked old as well.</li>
            <li> Gives me a much cleaner, nicer cut than my last pair</li>
            <li> Marked:</li>
            <li> I used to be a professional hairstylist and now just do it for friends and family on occasion.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I sometimes like to cut my own hair and the screw that holds the two parts of the scissors together tends to get in the way at times.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as a beard/mustache &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34;-- wanted a decently sharp pair of shears that would fit well in my hand for some precision facial</li>
            <li> They cut okay, but very small finger holes.  </li>
            <li> The size is good, if a little small.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just had it too loose in the first place</li>
            <li> Quality scissors that are very sharp and excellent for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Thus they are much smaller than I expected but still adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is incredibly thick, and these just breeze right through it!!  </li>
            <li> There is no other product information on any packaging and there are no inserts.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> This set was just right in terms of blade length and is very sharp and cuts well.  </li>
            <li> so that you can get very exact, very VERY sharp!  </li>
            <li> and I have spent a large amount of money on shears.  </li>
            <li> My old scissors never cut cleanly through thick hair but these do every time.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, easy to hold and seem like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to trim my mustache and do general hair maintenance.</li>
            <li> They are small but are perfect when I am cutting my kids and my husbands hair.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected too much for the price..  </li>
            <li> The soft rubber inserts make the finger holes smaller but that&#x27;s the point...</li>
            <li> I am a part time hair dresser and have only used them a dozen times so far.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I expected them to be much sharper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my second pair - my wife had used the prior pair to cut a thick plastic band and as a result they lost their magical powers - they could no longer cut my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the rubber finger gribs pop out too easy.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that since I have a 5.5&amp;#34; wedding ring I thought that would be the right size for me.</li>
            <li> I would agree with other reviewers that these are too small for most men&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair on my own and one thing that is very difficult is to find is an inexpensive yet high quality hair scissors .</li>
            <li> These are way better than other hair cutting scissors available at the same price point.</li>
            <li> I found them helpful, although I do have pretty small fingers, so I had no trouble holding the scissors at all.</li>
            <li> I would not buy these as a professional, but for personal use only.</li>
            <li> and I felt these shears are not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and sharp!!</li>
            <li> I am a petite girl with thin fingers and the holes are a little tight, but I take out the anti-slip things inside the rings and they fit much better.</li>
            <li> These scissors are really sharp and great for cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember these have a razor edge and are not as forgiving as basic scissors so some hairs may get pulled out if you&#x27;re not careful as you go.&lt;br /&gt;These will be in my travel kit and bathroom permanently.  </li>
            <li> These shears are decent for the cost, sharp, and as described in the promo.</li>
            <li> Remember to never cut anything else with them or they will dull quickly just like all scissors.  </li>
            <li> No more throwing money at a hairdresser who never seems to get it quite right.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and do a great job at cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> I have large thumbs and the thumb hole is just large enough which makes the scissors uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t remove them frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them primarily for trimming the &#x27;stache, but I&#x27;ve also used them for cutting the kids&#x27; hair and they&#x27;ve proven to be very reliable (and sharp).&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality, very sharp scissors.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the finger-holes are a bit small, but otherwise, I don&#x27;t think you can find a better deal for a pair of 5.5\\&quot; shears on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this to cut my dog&#x27;s hair and it is small enough to move around without worrying if I cut too much off</li>
            <li> On a ruler the 5 inch looked long but it is really short.</li>
            <li> Not a big problem, but I&#x27;d have given it five stars if it weren&#x27;t for that relatively minor flaw.</li>
            <li> These will be my go-to scissors for personal grooming for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Also, the closer the scissors are to parallel with the hair, the better chance they have of splaying and bending the hairs instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried cutting my hair with them, but from using them with my facial hair, I&#x27;m sure they would do a find job.  </li>
            <li> I use them to trim my mustache (as I hate it when the hairs get too long and start getting in my mouth - especially around the corners), and have had nothing but good experiences with them.  </li>
            <li> When closed, the tip is mildly rounded, but when opened, two sharp corners are exposed as the cutting edge runs right to the tip.</li>
            <li> When cutting hair you should just use the tips of your fingers for better control.  </li>
            <li> Maybe harder for someone larger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber.</li>
            <li> no professional and just cut my families hair</li>
            <li> I am not a professional stylist</li>
            <li> Caveat: I&#x27;m not a professional hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought these shears for grooming my long haired cat.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional, so I did a bit of research on shears before choosing these.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months and used it three times thus far.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no great discomfort or challenge with my operating the shears, but I definitely noticed the smallness of the openings the first time I used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not a professional stylist, but I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s longish curly hair for many years.</li>
            <li> These are good for small snips like cutting bangs.  </li>
            <li> they are really sharp and it was super easy cutting through my thick curly mane .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside for him is that the finger holes are a little small for his large manly hands.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Not sure how long they will stay sharp, but out of the box they cut very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to cut my husband&#x27;s hair, having previously tried one other type that was not nearly sharp enough.</li>
            <li> They are sharp scissors, only time will tell how long they will stay this way but hopefully awhile.</li>
            <li> so I knew I needed them to be a sharp, short pair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp for initial uses.</li>
            <li> Item is sharp yes, BUT NOT JAPANESE STEAL.</li>
            <li> I should have bought the other bigger size..</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp and solid.</li>
            <li> (I took out the one for my thumb, but left the other one</li>
            <li> I started cutting my own hair and thought I should get some real sharp scissors made for the job.</li>
            <li> The finger and thumb holes were a little small at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;For the last 5 or 6 years I&#x27;d been cutting my hair with a cheap pair I bought at Target: those are gummed up safety scissors by comparison to the Utopia pair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great cutting shears !!</li>
            <li> The only mark on them is the single letter &amp;#34;s&amp;#34; etched very small near the handle.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small these scissors are.  </li>
            <li> too small for my adult hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hairdresser, but I can definitely tell the difference between these and the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; Conair hair scissors -- they snip without any tug or drag, make a clean cut all the way to the tip of the scissors without pushing hair out, and they&#x27;re designed specifically for cutting wet hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely find this scissors very sharp and I also like the way I can adjust it.</li>
            <li> small ones are certainly big enough for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend these shears for anyone looking for a professional type of hair cutting tool without the high cost.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know how long they will hold their sharp cut.</li>
            <li> Now I have no idea how long they will stay sharp</li>
            <li> These hair cutting shears work just fine.</li>
            <li> Wish the holes were a little bigger</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about some of the reviews saying the holes are too big, but like someone else already mentioned you can just take the inserts out</li>
            <li> Also these are blunt tipped which can make it harder if you need to do fine cutting.</li>
            <li> The are super quiet when cutting hair which basically means they are sharp and are not ripping through the hair.</li>
            <li> They arrived in only a few days</li>
            <li> but I did find them on careful inspection.</li>
            <li> But I guess some faults in every product are to be expected.</li>
            <li> there is really not much else you need to know</li>
            <li> Not quite as I expected but not being a hairdresser</li>
            <li> Really solid &amp; very sharp!  </li>
            <li> I have only done some small clean-ups with the scissors, so I have limited time spent with them.  </li>
            <li> but I guess long enough for one person to give herself trims for the next 5 year at least!</li>
            <li> They are fairly sharp and precise with cutting.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp enough that I nipped my fingers a few times and didn&#x27;t even realize I had nipped myself until I saw blood on my fingers.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp which makes cutting hair easy.</li>
            <li> his hair is very straight and thick and its hard to cut</li>
            <li> cutting shears are very sharp, cut straight, just one problem , putting my thumb and finger into the opening is a little bit to small, the fit is rather  to tight.  </li>
            <li> I know I will probably use these as much in the next 5 years as my hairdresser will use a pair of scissors for a week or two of cutting all day long.</li>
            <li> Be careful, these things are razor sharp.</li>
            <li> The finger holes are not large like other reviews said even with the inserts out</li>
            <li> I have small hands, so finding scissors that don&#x27;t move around in my hand is fairly difficult; these fit well, and</li>
            <li> Just the other day I cut some paper.  </li>
            <li> They have &#x27;S. S. Pakistan&#x27; written on one side of the shears and \\&quot;Utopia Care\\&quot; on the other.  </li>
            <li> If you want a glossy company history then you&#x27;ll have to purchase other scissors.</li>
            <li> these are really sharp and pointy.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is the holes on handles seem small</li>
            <li> These shears appear well made and are quite sharp.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp, weight is nice...not dissappointed.</li>
            <li> It also came with 2 rubber rings to make the finger hole smaller for those with small fingers.</li>
            <li> I can tell that they are sharp and they cut well.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t like then for hair I can use the for other things.</li>
            <li> These scissors are marvelously sharp, and they came in a case with a spot for a matching set of thinning shears.</li>
            <li> Sharp with adjustable knob.</li>
            <li> I did not consider the other fingers..</li>
            <li> Sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;really SHARP....</li>
            <li> The only thing that I do not like about the shares is the small finger openings.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend the shares for someone who has small fingers.</li>
            <li> My husband, on the other hand, can&#x27;t get his fingers through the holes.  </li>
            <li> I ran my finger along one of the blades to see how sharp it was</li>
            <li> /&gt;The negative (minus 1 star) is that it is QUITE short.</li>
            <li> and it was my very first time cutting my bangs.</li>
            <li> and I found the blades to be too short and dull for me.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order them again when they get dull, which hopefully won&#x27;t be too soon.</li>
            <li> The finger holes are a little small, which isn&#x27;t an issue for me as I have tiny fingers</li>
            <li> The finger holes are a bit small and uncomfortable but otherwise they were totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can just get the tips of my fingers in the finger holes on the scissors.  </li>
            <li> smaller holes mean the scissors stay snugly on your fingers.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp for the price!  </li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well balanced and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Appear to be well built and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp.</li>
            <li> The blade is very sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These scissors are very, very sharp.</li>
            <li> My shears came with removable black sparkly plastic pieces in the finger holes.</li>
            <li> B004F9QBE6 BIC Cristal 1 0mm Black MSLP16 Blk]]</li>
            <li> It came in a zippable black case.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t not return these since I would have had to pay shipping which was half the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> Comes with a zippered black case.</li>
            <li> If that was a little less finicky i&#x27;d give them 5, and I&#x27;d give 4.5 if i could.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you decide to buy these super sharp scissors.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, right size for small hands, used for cutting paracord.</li>
            <li> The rubber inserts made them a little too tight</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the finger holes are way too small.</li>
            <li> but there were a few lines / scratches on the handle, though they were hidden</li>
            <li> I gave them 4 stars because like the other reviews I agree that the finger holes seem small.</li>
            <li> As noted in other reviews the finger holes are quite small with the rubber insert.</li>
            <li> The adjustable tensioner is a little</li>
            <li> just use to do a little cleanup trimming.  </li>
            <li> It made it much easier for cutting.</li>
            <li> These scissors made cutting hair much easier.</li>
            <li> I started cutting my fiance&#x27;s hair a few months back starting with some cheapo ones from target.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are VERY sharp, and the finger holes are small, like others have noted.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews were spot on!</li>
            <li> Less than $20.00!</li>
            <li> It is a little small for my hand.</li>
            <li> Finger holes are a little too small.</li>
            <li> Twenty years ago their exports were pretty crude.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars for the quality and value, but find that they are a bit thick to manage the really close cutting on the edges of my mustache and to trim hair close my scalp where needed.</li>
            <li> (I have small hands)</li>
            <li> The finger holes are small and the insert is grippy.  </li>
            <li> but my husband still says they are too small with the insert in place.    </li>
            <li> The holes to put your fingers in was too small to get my thumb in.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> And even with small fingers I took them out, I just did not like the feel.</li>
            <li> No, I won&#x27;t be ordering these again but for the price (and if you have small fingers)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if they will let me post links here, which is what I just tried to do, so if not, go to howtohairgirl dot com</li>
            <li> too small</li>
            <li> small</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t use them at all because they&#x27;re too small for his fingers.</li>
            <li> YUP, THE FINGER HOLES ARE A BIT SMALL</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> With my medium-sized hands I have somewhat of a problem of getting the fingers through the rings, as they are so small.</li>
            <li> The finger holes are a bit small</li>
            <li> I should have heeded others who mentioned the small thumb hole.</li>
            <li> I have small fingers</li>
            <li> I have extremely small hands (child hand size), i will guarantee that it will feel small on everyone else.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with small fingers and my fingers</li>
            <li> Some people were complaining that the finger holes are too small.  </li>
            <li> The scissor did snag when i tried to slice down the length of my hair, so that was a minor disappointment.</li>
            <li> take my criticism too hard guys.</li>
            <li> I have only been paying for a haircut about every 4 months since I started cutting it myself 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> Well, this Utopia cutting shears is at least the equal of my Remington.  </li>
            <li> Going to find a larger pair for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> not having the least idea of why they were doing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That layer of gold must be about one atom thick.</li>
            <li> You can change the tension by very small increments (clicks).  </li>
            <li> Very small holes.  </li>
            <li> And I have very small, \\&quot;kid size\\&quot; hands.  </li>
            <li> My  reasons for not giving a 5 star is they are very small ( can&#x27;t use with finger inserts)</li>
            <li> how long the cutting end should be and she said for non-barbering techniques it should be no longer than the length of your finger as you use your fingers to hold the hair</li>
            <li> My wife uses these to cut my hair and she has very small hands and couldn&#x27;t get her fingers in the holes without removing the rubber liners.</li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like about them is the finger inserts are very small, so</li>
            <li> My old hair cutting shears were rusty and dangerous, so I decided to replace them.</li>
            <li> Too small, even though I have small figures!!!</li>
            <li> Also, I ordered the 5.5 but have a feeling I should have ordered the 6.5 because the 5.5 is very small!</li>
            <li> I cut hair and there is nothing worse than cutting with dull scissors.</li>
            <li> maybe I was looking for the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> I purchases the 5.5&amp;#34; as I am not experienced at all with cutting hairs.</li>
            <li> It makes cutting the dogs hair rather  uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I do have about 5 years experience cutting my husbands hair</li>
            <li> &#x27;Cutting Shears&#x27;.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll cut myself with these.  </li>
            <li> but once I received them and started cutting I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> I just use for cutting my split ends though.  </li>
            <li> so I can have some movement from between cutting and combing.</li>
            <li> Oh, my bad.  </li>
            <li> I use these to make micro-trims to my ends while growing out a bad haircut.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the sharpest tool in the shed, but they aren&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> There is literally nothing bad I can say about these shears.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE SELLER.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great scissors, already gave myself a haircut and they were precise and easy to handle</li>
            <li> Im not a professional but the scissors work just fine. I bought them in order to be able trim ends and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great quality and good customer service!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a spectacular pair of shears, just a pair I can use for my family of four. I do have about 5 years experience cutting my husbands hair so I knew I needed them to be a sharp, short pair. They arrived in only a few days and I was happy to see they came in a zip up case! I cut my sons hair and they were perfectly sharp for me and the length of the shears was perfect. I gave them 4 stars because like the other reviews I agree that the finger holes seem small. I still like them but it took some time getting used to them. Maybe if I didn&#x27;t have short chunky fingers they would fit better.</li>
            <li> I bought these to cut and trim my toddlers hair. Used only once. Very happy with the size and sharpness. Handles work fine for me.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with ease of use even for this amateur.  Good weight and flexibility.  I was able to cut a family members hair and my own with these babies.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love these and I cut my own hair now ! No more throwing money at a hairdresser who never seems to get it quite right. These work great . And I have no problem with finger holes but I&#x27;m 5&#x27; and 110lbs so maybe a smaller sized person? Maybe harder for someone larger but I think these are great</li>
            <li> very sharp blades, easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Great scissors for the price.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, easy to hold and seem like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The blades are great. The thumb and finger rings, are small, and best for small hands.</li>
            <li> The scissors came in time and were just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> good quality scissors, used for cutting my own bangs.</li>
            <li> Scissors are nice enough and cut well. Made in Pakistan which I did not realize prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product and works as claimed. I mainly use it for trimming my mousche and beard, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Awesome cutting scissors. Wish the holes were a little bigger but that&#x27;s probably my issue, not the product&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> have only had the scissors a week or so. they seem to bee ok so far. waiting to see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> Great pair of scissors.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Finger openings heard towards female hands but works OK for me</li>
            <li> Fast shipping so far so good !!!</li>
            <li> Holes for your fingers were made for kids ... They need to be bigger</li>
            <li> Perfect trimmers!  Clean, quick cut every time.  And the removable eyelets make them easy to use for anyone.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SCISSORS IN VERY NICE CASE.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, right size for small hands, used for cutting paracord.</li>
            <li> These are scissors.  You might wonder if they actually cut things or not.  Well, I can tell you from first-hand experience... these actually cut things.  Just the other day I cut some paper.  I also cut some eyebrow hair!  It is like magic.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you decide to buy these super sharp scissors.  Oh, my bad.  &#x27;Cutting Shears&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Super sharp awesome scissors for my beard. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These work great for what we were looking for - something good for trimming my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> these arrived promptly in a nice case. gorgeous scissors. thanks!</li>
            <li> I use these to make micro-trims to my ends while growing out a bad haircut. They are VERY sharp, and the finger holes are small, like others have noted. Good value for this item, priced just right.</li>
            <li> I had been using a pair of scissors that came with a set of clippers I had for home use.  Those scissors did well until the plastic handle cracked.  After one use, these Utopia Care scissors are far better than anything I had before.  They are small, easy to handle, and designed for as exact a cut as a person could want!</li>
            <li> Excellent pro quality sheers.  Perfect for a mustache, beard and even nostril trim but a bit on the small side.&lt;br /&gt;Remember these have a razor edge and are not as forgiving as basic scissors so some hairs may get pulled out if you&#x27;re not careful as you go.&lt;br /&gt;These will be in my travel kit and bathroom permanently.  A++ quality.</li>
            <li> I am a DIY-er and I trim my own hair. My hair is fine and splits easily after a cut with bad scissors, but these have been great! Love the case and finger inserts. (I have small hands) Very comfortable and cut looks professional.</li>
            <li> Great product for trimming hair in between cuts, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber. These work great for maintaining my beard and mustache between visit to the barber. Tension adjustment and removable finger &amp;#34;spacers&amp;#34; allow for customization to make trimming comfortable and accurate.&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely great for the indivual. I think most professionals would find them to be excellent as well.</li>
            <li> These are great! Exactly what I wanted and sharp!!</li>
            <li> I like these scissors and use them often to keep my hair trimmed up. I have only been paying for a haircut about every 4 months since I started cutting it myself 3 years ago. These came sharp and in a nice case. The only complaint I have is that the finger holes are way too small. I don&#x27;t have large hands but can only get my fingertips in the holes</li>
            <li> Very sharp, great buy and fast shipping. A++++</li>
            <li> The scissors are great. I love them but was surprised that the 5&amp;#34; measurement described the overall length. I thought it was the size of the blade. Thus they are much smaller than I expected but still adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> Nice little scissors, perfect for grooming.</li>
            <li> Good quality scissors come in zippered storage pouchu.  I used it to cut my daughter&#x27;s bangs for the first time, it turned out fine.  I am happy with the purchase and anticipate more uses in the future.</li>
            <li> High quality, very sharp scissors. I have super fine hair that mortal scissors cannot cut - the hairs simply get pushed aside by the blades. These scissors are very sharp and will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second pair - my wife had used the prior pair to cut a thick plastic band and as a result they lost their magical powers - they could no longer cut my hair. So they are not indestructible. I bought this replacement pair and am happy with them (but I realized that for this pair I accidentally ordered the shorter, 5.5 inch, scissors. I like them but I liked the longer scissors even better.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality very sharp fast delivery very good overall</li>
            <li> The scissors were exactly as described and of good quality.</li>
            <li> Great pillow very supportive. We put it in the dryer for approx. an hour with some dryer sheets and no chemical smell at all.Will order another.</li>
            <li> Sharp, arrived quickly. These are way better than other hair cutting scissors available at the same price point. My shears came with removable black sparkly plastic pieces in the finger holes. This is a nice feature because while I use the shears to trim my fringe, the man also likes to trim his beard and mustache with them... Okay probably his eyebrows too. Guys, I feel for you and this lady appreciates the effort. Popping out the plastic pieces gives him a more comfortable fit, while I trim with them in. I know I shouldn&#x27;t care about this because it really has little bearing on the overall functionality of the item, but I was so happy the plastic pieces and case were BLACK. So many grooming items automatically come with eye-rolling pink accessories which is *not* my style. No BIC Cristal for Her in this house! [[ASIN:B004F9QBE6 BIC Cristal 1 0mm Black MSLP16 Blk]]</li>
            <li> These are fantastic scissors. Very smooth and very sharp which is a must for trimming your mustache and beard. They are also a nice size. I had a much smaller pair that came in a travel kit but I definitely prefer these. Strongly recommend. They shipped incredibly fast as well. For the man who takes a little more time to groom.</li>
            <li> These should be kid&#x27;s scissors.  I should have really looked at the ruler.  Seller said I could send back, but what a hassle.  Will try to make work.</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable, sharp and easy to use shears.  I trimmed my hair a couple of days ago and the shears were just fine.  They are from Pakistan and not Japan though.</li>
            <li> Good pair of scissors. One setback though: its made in Pakistan; the country I am from. I personally would expect lower price for a product made in Pakistan. On a side note: it would be great if we could see the products made in Pakistan, IN Pakistan, as opposed to only here on Amazon, to get the sales going even more. This also holds true for MANY, if not all, surgical instruments and sports goods, which are made in Pakistan but sadly, to my demise, exported mostly. Back to the product: like the feel, the metal but there were a few lines / scratches on the handle, though they were hidden but I did find them on careful inspection. You wouldn&#x27;t note these on usage though. But I guess some faults in every product are to be expected. -1 star only because its priced higher considering that its made in Pakistan. But +5 stars for the quality of the product overall!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I wanted. An extra - It came in a nice case. I like being able to adjust the scissor tension to make it just right for me. Prompt delivery too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hairdresser, but I can definitely tell the difference between these and the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; Conair hair scissors -- they snip without any tug or drag, make a clean cut all the way to the tip of the scissors without pushing hair out, and they&#x27;re designed specifically for cutting wet hair. They&#x27;re an absolute must for precision and scissor-over-comb cuts. The &amp;#34;Japanese steel&amp;#34; description is misleading, these are made in Pakistan, but I haven&#x27;t found fault with the quality yet.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. Well balanced and very sharp.</li>
            <li> The scissors function as they should, but when you state that they are made of Japanese stainless steel and its clearly stamped on the sheers . . . . .Pakistan, kinda leaves my hind quarters chapped. Name one thing thats made &amp;#34;well&amp;#34; in Pakistan. . . . . yeah im drawing a blank.</li>
            <li> Not being an expert in the field of shears, I chose this pair based on reviews and product information...not in that order. I was definitely not disappointed in terms of performance: The product performs well, is weighted well, and is easy to handle--with one exception: The openings for finger and thumb, in my estimation, should&#x27;ve been made a bit larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not occupy more than my fair share of space on this planet but, perhaps without my realizing it until now, my fingers and thumbs are a tad bit larger than those of the average female--although not noticeably so. There&#x27;s no great discomfort or challenge with my operating the shears, but I definitely noticed the smallness of the openings the first time I used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accompanying zippered faux leather case provides good storage and requires precious little space when stored on its side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Buy the product. You&#x27;ll not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product ! This is the best pair of sissors I have ever owned. They are super sharp and they&lt;br /&gt;are well made. this will last for many years. Worth the money !&lt;br /&gt;Super Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> This is a review of the 5.5\\&quot; shears.    These cut MUCH nicer than similarly priced scissors at chain stores.    These are better than a $55 dollar pair from a popular manufacturer.  The Utopia Care scissors cut smoother and feel nicer.    The finger holes are small and the insert is grippy.  My thumb is stopped before the first joint!  (Good).  My finger will go through but the insert is grippy so it holds in place.  You can change the tension by very small increments (clicks).  Very nice.    I think that most men would have to remove the inserts to be able to use them.  My husband could not even try them because his fingers don&#x27;t begin to fit.      They come in a nice zipper pouch with two bands to hold the scissors in place.  They have &#x27;S. S. Pakistan&#x27; written on one side of the shears and \\&quot;Utopia Care\\&quot; on the other.  The placement of \\&quot;Utopia Care\\&quot; must have improved since the review that said it was crooked.  Mine looks perfect.    There is no other product information on any packaging and there are no inserts.  If you want a glossy company history then you&#x27;ll have to purchase other scissors. :)    You don&#x27;t always \\&quot;get what you pay for\\&quot; ... SOMETIMES YOU GET MORE.    UPDATE - I purchased a pair of the 6.5\\&quot; size and the holes are larger but my husband still says they are too small with the insert in place.    My thumb goes all the way through on this size.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd pair of shears that I ordered for my daughter. She likes these more than the more expensive shers that she has. Comfortable hold.. Good cut ..</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected too much for the price..  Not anything  close to professional grade.. yet again how good can something be for that price.</li>
            <li> these scissors are really really nice. there is really not much else you need to know, just go for it, they cut really nice and feel and look great, also I had no problem with the holes that people say are too small, they fit just right without the rubber circles they come with.</li>
            <li> Was not expecting the world and beyond when I bought this pair of shears. They do the job and don&#x27;t snag but they definitely do not cut like butter. When working with thicker hair you hear the &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; more- wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend these shears for scissor over comb haircuts but still worth having as a back up.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt, but there was damage to the corner of the case they came with.  Not a big deal, as I was not expecting a case anyways, but it is worth noting.  Overall, I am happy with the quality of the scissors.</li>
            <li> Very smooth pair of shears. Great value price</li>
            <li> Better than expected, great price. The shears came in very nice case, that was not advertised. Just used them to trim around ears, great job with the shears.</li>
            <li> Scissors are great for cutting hair. Seller and shipment were perfect. The finger holes are a bit small and uncomfortable but otherwise they were totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner at using these on my boys but was very impressed with how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and is good quality for price. They are sharp scissors, only time will tell how long they will stay this way but hopefully awhile.</li>
            <li> Scissors were great, wife cuts my hair with them and loves them, no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> The holes to put your fingers in was too small to get my thumb in.  And I don&#x27;t think I have a large thumb.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts the family&#x27;s hair.  She has no issues with the finger-holes. Not sure how long they will stay sharp, but out of the box they cut very well.  For the money I doubt you could find better.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair on my own and one thing that is very difficult is to find is an inexpensive yet high quality hair scissors . these scissors are the best scissors I have ever bought. the shipping was fast , it came with a nice protective case and also they are really pretty in person. when I received these scissors I was eager to try them out . they are really sharp and it was super easy cutting through my thick curly mane .&lt;br /&gt;double thumbs UP</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to cut my husband&#x27;s hair, having previously tried one other type that was not nearly sharp enough. These ones cut very cleanly and easily, and look very professional. They are pretty small, but I found them easier to manage because of it (I got the 5.5 inch ones). They also come in a nice case and have rubber rings in the finger holes to make it easier to hold (or adjust the size of the holes I guess). I found them helpful, although I do have pretty small fingers, so I had no trouble holding the scissors at all. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a sharp scissor at a good price!</li>
            <li> These are a very well made,  nice sharp pair of scissors. They feel well in the hand and are a good length for my hair trimming purposes. They came quickly and the company followed up to assure my satisfaction. The case it comes in is also very nice and protects the scissor well.</li>
            <li> exactly what was expected; great quality.</li>
            <li> These are really sharp and cut my sons hair great! his hair is very straight and thick and its hard to cut but these did just fine!</li>
            <li> The shear is very good and the seller have a nice service, but I wrongly choose the small size of 5.5&amp;#34; ! I am greatly glad if I choose one with 6.5&#x27; size.</li>
            <li> I bought the 6.5 to cut my flat top with and they work to perfection. Plan to buy the 7.5 when they come back in stock. I would definitely recommend these to anybody looking for quality shears! Sharp, cheap and look nice.</li>
            <li> these are really sharp and pointy.  im no professional and just cut my families hair and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll cut myself with these.  But, they do slice though hair very efficiently.</li>
            <li> Great scissor...razor sharp so far ! Definitely a good pair of scissors for the money, hope htey last and stay sharp. I have small hands and I like the way they feel with out the grips inserted.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these scissors! Scissors feel like professional grade. Great quality for the price and even comes with a case. Trims hair with ease !</li>
            <li> The scissors work great.  They are sharp and work smoothly.  If you have large hands you may want to go with the bigger size.  I got both sizes and love them!</li>
            <li> Seem like a high quality pair of scissors.  The only thing is the holes on handles seem small and I have pretty skinny fingers!</li>
            <li> These shears appear well made and are quite sharp. Time will tell on the quality of the steel, but I am impressed with the fit and finish.  The blades are not serrated.</li>
            <li> Great scissors like them in the box.  Thank they work a treat, nice to handle and use.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on these based on others reviews.  They were priced fairly cheap so I had my doubts at the time of ordering but once I received them and started cutting I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Are there sharper better quality shears out there, sure, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat these guys.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the last 2 scissors (not the same make) I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> These work beautifully, and are very easy to use. I have small hands, so finding scissors that don&#x27;t move around in my hand is fairly difficult; these fit well, and I love the adjustable tension!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of these scissors. They have very comfortable handles, that are also very pretty (glittery translucent rubber covering for comfort). They also cut very well: sharp and smooth. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Not quite as I expected but not being a hairdresser maybe I was looking for the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> I have only done some small clean-ups with the scissors, so I have limited time spent with them.  The finger holes have removable inserts to accommodate different finger sizes.  Blades are sharp, weight is nice...not dissappointed.</li>
            <li> The bright metal shows high quality. It also came with 2 rubber rings to make the finger hole smaller for those with small fingers. You&#x27;d better take them off if you have large fingers. It&#x27;s sharp for initial uses. I hope it lasts. The adjustable tension knob is a plus.</li>
            <li> Great scissors. Use them to trim my beard. The size is good, if a little small. Very sharp, and seem like really good quality, especially for the price. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> These scissors are awesome so far. I can tell that they are sharp and they cut well. Glad I purchases the 5.5&amp;#34; as I am not experienced at all with cutting hairs. I use them to cut my bangs - I know you&#x27;re supposed to go to the hair dresser and they even do it for free for me; but my last visit left my bangs not how I described and so I decided that I would practice myself and get good at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, they cut well, are easy to use. I am a petite girl with thin fingers and the holes are a little tight, but I take out the anti-slip things inside the rings and they fit much better. I really can&#x27;t say much about precision and such as of yet because I&#x27;ve only used them once and it was my very first time cutting my bangs. But if I remember or someone prompts me in the next couple of months I will provide a full update! Hope this helps, and if anyone has questions, please let me know. I appreciate reading reviews and want to make sure this product is well represented in an accurate way. Also, it does come with a faux leather case that&#x27;s fuzzy like on the inside. And the scissors do have a tension adjuster - I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll learn to use that in time.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 5.5 inch scissor and in hindsight wish I would have ordered the 6.5 inch. On a ruler the 5 inch looked long but it is really short. However, thus far it is doing a good job for home haircuts. But I will order a longer set soon. As noted in other reviews the finger holes are quite small with the rubber insert. And even with small fingers I took them out, I just did not like the feel. Also these are blunt tipped which can make it harder if you need to do fine cutting. All in all for the price not a bad pair of scissors. Will have to see how they stand up to time.</li>
            <li> My old hair cutting shears were rusty and dangerous, so I decided to replace them. The new ones are slightly smaller, very sharp, in a very good case.  They arrived on time in good condition.  They are quite sharp and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very nice, sharp! Fast shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li> Very small holes.  Other than that they are great.  Nice sharp cut. No, I won&#x27;t be ordering these again but for the price (and if you have small fingers) it&#x27;s a good product.  I will be ordering longer scissors with bigger finger holes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this choice of scissor. It is very good quality and price. Feels good in your hand and cuts perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest &amp; best scissors I have ever used to cut hair. I will be ordering a pair for each of my daughters.</li>
            <li> I used these shears for the first time yesterday and they are perfect!  I got the 5.5\\&quot; and they fit very comfortably.  And I have very small, \\&quot;kid size\\&quot; hands.  I highly recommend these for anyone.  I am not a professional stylist but I do cut hair (mine and others).  I am a happy customer. A+++</li>
            <li> This a nice scissors and cuts hair well.  The finger holes are not large like other reviews said even with the inserts out</li>
            <li> small ones are certainly big enough for trimming my beard. Most scissors just die trying, but these are super sharp, and the adjustable tension lets you find the sweet spot where they&#x27;ll move smoothly, but still cut stiff beard hair. If that was a little less finicky i&#x27;d give them 5, and I&#x27;d give 4.5 if i could.</li>
            <li> I have searched for the best, lower priced scissor for years and this is it! My old scissors never cut cleanly through thick hair but these do every time. They work perfectly!</li>
            <li> I was looking for scissors to trim my bangs and these are amazing. They are very sharp which makes cutting hair easy. I love the leather carrying case to keep them sharp. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are very sharp and also look very cool. Love the rubber inlay on the finger holes</li>
            <li> I have large thumbs and the thumb hole is just large enough which makes the scissors uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t remove them frequently.They do cut nicely tho</li>
            <li> Not that great. Sometimes cuts my hair but also sometimes just bends it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick shipping and good product! Has great grip and is very sharp! The previous reviews were spot on! My fingers are not tiny and I had no problem using these! They also came with a nice case. They feel high quality just like ones used by proffesionals.</li>
            <li> High quality shears.  I use them to cut my own hair and they work like a dream.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great for keeping my goatee and handlebar moustache well groomed. No, they don&#x27;t cut like a $100 pair of hair styling shears, but they don&#x27;t cost $100 either and they do the job quite well. They are a fantastic value and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine cut their hair based on a DIY website and I was impressed with the results, so I decided to give it a try. If you are new to cutting your own hair, I recommend you try it too--it took me exactly four minutes to cut my hair and it came out great! (I&#x27;m not kidding--I pulled it forward in a ponytail, used these scissors to carefully cut straight across, pulled it out of the ponytail, shook it out, and wham, new pretty style!). It wasn&#x27;t as good as my hairdresser can do--she is amazing--but I am happy with it and it does not look at all like I did it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;howtohairgirl.com/2013/01/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if they will let me post links here, which is what I just tried to do, so if not, go to howtohairgirl dot com slash 2013 slash 01 slash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between these scissors and that page, I&#x27;m saving a ton of money now and in the future. I also cut my daughter&#x27;s hair using the back ponytail listed on that page and it also turned out good--not as good as mine, but fine and better than paying a salon. I&#x27;m looking forward to exploring more of those tips and tricks, and since these scissors are sharp and easy to use, they were a perfect fit for me for occasional home use. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great scissors -  just as described. These will be my go-to scissors for personal grooming for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time ! Great cutting shears !!</li>
            <li> These scissors really work well and my wife love them . I would recommend these scissors to any one !</li>
            <li> Please note I&#x27;m not a stylist or hair professional. I&#x27;m just a gal who occasionally gets ballsy enough to cut my own hair. I purchased the 5.5&amp;#34; length. I&#x27;m very pleased with this pair of scissors for what it cost. It came in a zippable black case. The tension of the blades can be tightened. The rubber grips are removable. Metal is polished, smooth and clean. Scissor has a nice weight to it. Easy to use for both a left hander (me) and right hander (hubby). I cut my own hair the other day. The blades are sharp enough that I nipped my fingers a few times and didn&#x27;t even realize I had nipped myself until I saw blood on my fingers. The scissor did snag when i tried to slice down the length of my hair, so that was a minor disappointment. Overall though, I think these are great for an amateur like myself.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t slip out of the scissors!  Amazing to me, as our old \\&quot;professional\\&quot; scissors always pushed the hair out as you cut it.  These scissors somehow keep the hair in, so you cut it the hair the first time, right where you want to.  One note, the finger holes were quite different than regular scissors, but i got used to it quickly.  Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> Caveat: I&#x27;m not a professional hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just looking for a good, good-value pair of hair shears and these are just what I had in mind. They ARE small but that suits me fine; they&#x27;re very sharp and as far as I can see, doing a good job!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for scissors that had somewhat larger finger holes and these are perfect. They are solidly manufactured and came nicely packaged in their own zippered pouch.  They are NOT made in China -- which is a plus.</li>
            <li> These are nice and short for close hair cutting. The soft rubber inserts make the finger holes smaller but that&#x27;s the point...smaller holes mean the scissors stay snugly on your fingers. Of course they remove easily enough. I like the adjustable tension knob too. I&#x27;m thinking about getting the longer version of these since they&#x27;re so inexpensive. Be careful, these things are razor sharp.</li>
            <li> great shears!  razor sharp and comfortable fit....</li>
            <li> cutting shears are very sharp, cut straight, just one problem , putting my thumb and finger into the opening is a little bit to small, the fit is rather  to tight.  It makes cutting the dogs hair rather  uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as a beard/mustache &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34;-- wanted a decently sharp pair of shears that would fit well in my hand for some precision facial trimming-- and they are just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relatively cheap, attractive form, and smooth functioning, they handle and cut SOOOOO much better than the pair I was using. Now, this isn&#x27;t saying much, but I will say that they cut my coarse beard better than ANYTHING else I&#x27;ve used-- and the feel of the actual cut, both in my hand and on my beard, tells me that they are indeed sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removable rubbery rings inside the finger holes were more than a bit snug for my large fingers, but once out, the scissors fit my fingers quite well. The tensioning knob handles very well, &amp;#34;clicking&amp;#34; as you tighten, and do seem to serve their intended function. The zippered case they come in is also very nice, and makes them present very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these ARE what I wanted. At a fraction of the price of &amp;#34;lower end&amp;#34; barber shears, I would have been happy with something that just let me cut my beard with some precision. These do that, handle quite nicely, and appear to be built to last (relatively).</li>
            <li> My husband needed some shears to trim his beard.  We spent a while trying to find ones that were the right length and a reasonable price.  The quality seems really good and he&#x27;s happy with how they cut.  The only downside for him is that the finger holes are a little small for his large manly hands.&lt;br /&gt;Also the shears came in their own nice leatherish case, nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with these shears! I bought the 6.5\\&quot; as well. After sharpening and tuning up my $360.00 shears since 1994 it was time for new ones! I saw these, read the reviews and thought ahhhh why not!? If I don&#x27;t like then for hair I can use the for other things. Less than $20.00! Keep in mind I am a part time hair dresser and have only used them a dozen times so far. I love them, I love the tension control and the feel in my hands. The rubber inserts made them a little too tight so I removed them. (no big deal there) They came in a decent case and look, feel and cut as well as my OL faithful ones from 94! Oh and they were shipped and delivered within 3 days! Thanks UTOPIA CARE I am impressed and will be looking at all your products!</li>
            <li> too small but it cuts hair so...</li>
            <li> A good value for the price!</li>
            <li> good looking cut good wish the finger holes were bigger, my wife can use them but I cannot.</li>
            <li> good price, cuts my hair great.. I just use for cutting my split ends though.  fast shipping/delivery. nice little case it comes with too.</li>
            <li> I have not used the shears yet.  They arrived in time and in great/new condition.  I bought these because I have 3 kids and a husband and would like to cut their hair myself.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy a nicer more expensive pair until I was sure I could do a decent job and/or even wanted to.  If so I may likely buy another pair later.  These definitely beat the ones that come in the clippers case.</li>
            <li> Quality scissors that are very sharp and excellent for cutting hair. Also, it comes with a very sturdy professional-looking case.</li>
            <li> Light weight, great feel, sharp blades</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and I found the blades to be too short and dull for me. I finally found a replacement for the shears I had been using for years and purchased them instead. I didn&#x27;t not return these since I would have had to pay shipping which was half the cost of the product. I will find another use for them</li>
            <li> Super sharp scissors , perfect size for trimming mustache .</li>
            <li> Excellent scissors! I&#x27;ve been using them primarily for trimming the &#x27;stache, but I&#x27;ve also used them for cutting the kids&#x27; hair and they&#x27;ve proven to be very reliable (and sharp).&lt;br /&gt;  I did have to remove the rubber inserts to accommodate my oversized sausages, but I understand that not everyone who uses these scissors is going to have such robust mitts.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp for the price!  They come in this really nice zippered case.  I&#x27;ve used them to cut my hair, and didn&#x27;t have the hand fatigue as with my old pair.</li>
            <li> Used it to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair and it worked great (he has fine hair for reference). The scissors are sharp and make clean cuts. The size is perfect for my petite hands.</li>
            <li> I love these shears, exactly what I was looking for, I have two long haired cats their fur matts, one real bad, these were perfect, the right size, am sure they would work for cutting one&#x27;s hair too, just love them!!!</li>
            <li> Item is sharp yes, BUT NOT JAPANESE STEAL. It CLEARLY states MADE IN PAKISTAN on the item. Also, I ordered the 5.5 but have a feeling I should have ordered the 6.5 because the 5.5 is very small! I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, oh and ALSO if you want to return the item, the seller MAKES YOU PAY, even though the item received is not the item described on the website. Will not buy again with them simply because I don&#x27;t trust them! Do yourself a favor first and visit the store to see what shear length works best instead of being out 15 bucks. HORRIBLE SELLER.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price with fast shipping. A++ Vendor.</li>
            <li> These are lovely shears.  Sturdy and as advertised.  A good value for the price.  I find the finger holes a touch small but I have big hands and they certainly will do nicely.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the sharpest tool in the shed, but they aren&#x27;t bad either. I would not buy these as a professional, but for personal use only. Be aware they state \\&quot;SS Pakistan\\&quot; although the dealer claims they are made with Japanese stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I really like these but they&#x27;re not as sharp as I would have liked. My husband can&#x27;t use them at all because they&#x27;re too small for his fingers. They&#x27;re nice for touch ups or to cut bangs.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and they fit perfectly for me.  I am impressed with their sharpness and love their length.  Its great to have a case also.</li>
            <li> These scissors are marvelously sharp, and they came in a case with a spot for a matching set of thinning shears.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Low price + good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Sharp with adjustable knob. Good price.</li>
            <li> good price, &amp; gets the job done!</li>
            <li> No complaints, works as advertised. Much better than your regular supermarket scissors. I looked at many reviews before buying these and I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to match the Remington barber scissors, made in Germany from the finest stainless steel, which have served me so well for the past dozen years.  Well, this Utopia cutting shears is at least the equal of my Remington.  It is made of high-quality materials and is exceptionally ergonomic in its design.  This is definitely a 5-star product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The scissors were better than the ones I paid hundreds of dollars for in the past. I am a professional and depend on a great pair of shears. They arrived right on time and they came in a beautiful leather case.  Highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> These are a great pair of affordable hair styling scissors. They are fairly sharp and precise with cutting. Many scissors elsewhere were upwards of $30, definitely a great deal for $15.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money. Scissors are not as precise as I&#x27;d like them to be but do a fair job. Also comes in a case which is nice.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price. Only down side is that since I have a 5.5&amp;#34; wedding ring I thought that would be the right size for me. My own fault I did not consider the other fingers.. lol.. I should have bought the other bigger size.. maybe 6&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 5.5 inch scissors for beard trimming and these work great. They are well made, sharp and the custom tension knob works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My daughter is just starting out and these have been perfect for her! Style and length were exactly what she needed.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product really rocks.  The scissors sit comfortably and yet firmly on my fingers and the gliding of the shears speaks to a really finely honed edge.  The hair cuts cleanly and just as I intended it to, with  no pulls or unexpected angles.  Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> These are great scissors!  Very sharp.  I really like the shorter blades to trim around my husband&#x27;s ears and the blunt end keeps me from cutting him (which he greatly appreciates).  Good price, too.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional stylist, but I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s longish curly hair for many years. What a huge improvement this is over anything I used before. It cuts so easily , that I actually cut too much off the first time I used them. In terms of the holes for the fingers -- I really appreciated that they stay on the top part of the fingers instead of sliding down as regular scissors do. It made it much easier for cutting. All in all very pleased , especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE SMOOTHEST OPERATING SCISSORS I HAVE EVER HAD.  YUP, THE FINGER HOLES ARE A BIT SMALL BUT IT ISN&#x27;T REALLY A PROBLE UNLESS YOU LIKE TO BURY YOUR FINGERS INTO THE LOOPS.  MOST BARBERING IS WITH FINGER-TIP CONTROL AND THESE ARE GREAT.  THEY DON&#x27;T MISS A HAIR, TUG, OR YANK.  JUST CUT.</li>
            <li> We wanted a nice pair of scissors for cutting hair. These are very nice. Smooth. Sharp. Feels great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very professional instrument for the price !  Quality product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!! I use it for trimming my beard and mustache and for the money you cant touch them! They are so sharp and accurate that you cant even hear them when cutting, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp! Easy to hold and manuever...perfect for little jobs like bangs, although you probably want something bigger for regular full haircuts.</li>
            <li> I love these!!!  Small so that you can get very exact, very VERY sharp!  I would recommend these and a great price.</li>
            <li> I received the scissors very quickly. I ordered another product with Amazon Prime and they both arrived at the same time. The scissors came in a nice cushioned case that will store and protect the scissors. I bought the 5.5\\&quot; scissors. I&#x27;ve only used the scissors once but they seem to work well. I also like the glittery cushion on the inside of the handles.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described. I have large hands and chubby fingers and had no problem with the finger holes.I think this is a good buy item, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dog groomer and I use these for ears and feet. I absolutely love them. I don&#x27;t know how long they ll hold an edge, but so far they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> Been a stylist for many years and I have spent a large amount of money on shears.  This 5.5 shear is wonderful for the money.  Small, comfortable, excellent for cutting baby&#x27;s hair.  I like shears so much that I am ordering the second pair for home use.  Nice product</li>
            <li> Scissors have nice cut to the tip, no squirming of the hair; I had to remove one of the rubber liners in the holes (nice to have)to get a comfortable fit for my thumb, but have large thumbs. Comes with a zippered black case. Can&#x27;t give 5 stars as I just used the scissors for one hair cut so don&#x27;t know how long they will hold their sharp cut.</li>
            <li> The product was great! It came in it&#x27;s padded carrying case without any hassles. I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying a larger pair than 5.5\\&quot; so maybe I&#x27;ll get an extra one since it&#x27;s at a good price</li>
            <li> I was looking for a decent pair of scissors to trim my son&#x27;s hair and these more than fit the bill!  I can&#x27;t see how a more expensive pair could be any better.  Perfect size and extremely sharp - the finger holes fit me without the inserts.  I&#x27;d buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Love these scissors!!!</li>
            <li> Does what hair-cutting scissors should do. Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Really professional, good material but light, big enough... excellent product!</li>
            <li> Not the best. After reading the reviews I expected them to be much sharper. I wanted to return them but they make you pay return shipping for an item that&#x27;s not that great and caught in my kids hair and pulled them out while I was cutting.</li>
            <li> Very nice feel. Appear to be well built and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Great shears. Very sharp and sturdy. Finger rings are removable for a comfortable fit on large fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a nice case.</li>
            <li> This shears is the perfect size for trimming my hair. Fits my wife&#x27;s hand exactly and works wells every time.</li>
            <li> Use it for personal grooming. Solid shear. It is a little small for my hand. I had to remove the rubber/silicone insert from the handle. However it is easy to maneuver. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> First:  I cut my own hair so this is specifically geared towards using in a mirror by yourself.  They are fairly sharp and look nice, but they don&#x27;t work as well left handed.  Also, the closer the scissors are to parallel with the hair, the better chance they have of splaying and bending the hairs instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> Great pair of scissors for the price. They have a nice sharp edge on them and I really like the removable inserts on them to adjust for finger size. They&#x27;re comfortable and don&#x27;t fatigue the hand after long usage.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive these shears because of all the good reviews, but upon receiving I was disappointed. These shear looked old and used. The finger rest and knob adjuster was gold in color but was faded from use, the case looked old as well. So I returned then for a refund.</li>
            <li> like most people, I have had many scissors in my lifetime, but let me tell you, these babies are&lt;br /&gt;really SHARP....thank you very much and I shall return for more scissors in the future.</li>
            <li> Too small, even though I have small figures!!! Not even able to return it cause I didn&#x27;t get reciete in package ...</li>
            <li> Just perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for to cut bangs!  Work beautifully</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do; i.e. cut hair. My only complaint is that I sometimes like to cut my own hair and the screw that holds the two parts of the scissors together tends to get in the way at times. Not a big problem, but I&#x27;d have given it five stars if it weren&#x27;t for that relatively minor flaw.</li>
            <li> I love these scissors!  My daughters hair is incredibly thick, and these just breeze right through it!!  Great buy!  I was pleased with the quality shipping and the entire product.</li>
            <li> I bought these shears for grooming my long haired cat.  The short blades allow more maneuverability and make clipping around delicate areas more manageable.  The shears are also sharp and cut cleanly, even through fine hair, and do not tug or pull.  I am also pleased with the quality of these shears for the price.  They are affordable and work well.</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to trim my four daughters hair as I cannot get to the salon as often as they need a trim.  I love how comfortable these scissors are and how compact.  I also love how inexpensive they are.  The only reason I did not rate them 5 stars is because the cool case they come with broke on the first time I tried to zip/unzip it.  I have already used them on one daughter&#x27;s hair and they were great.  I will definitely order them again when they get dull, which hopefully won&#x27;t be too soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to trim my mustache and do general hair maintenance. The tension adjustment works well and my wife finds the handle inserts to be very comfortable and make the scissors easier to work with. I have to remove the inserts to use them and find that my fairly large fingers fit well. I would give 5 stars for the quality and value, but find that they are a bit thick to manage the really close cutting on the edges of my mustache and to trim hair close my scalp where needed. I recommend these for great value and quality in general.</li>
            <li> These scissors are precise and easy to manipulate, the ability to change the tightness makes them flexible in the way I use them and they look pretty swanky to boot. The finger holes are a little small, which isn&#x27;t an issue for me as I have tiny fingers but if you&#x27;re rock sausage digits then you should probably find something else. But for the fine-fingered folk like myself, perfect!</li>
            <li> Right on time before Christmas as gift to my brother</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp and solid. With my medium-sized hands I have somewhat of a problem of getting the fingers through the rings, as they are so small. That&#x27;s already without the plastic rings.</li>
            <li> Nicely made good quality scissors. Comfortable to use. Great seller.</li>
            <li> They seem to be well made.  The adjustable tensioner is a little hokey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just use to do a little cleanup trimming.  Finger holes are a little too small.</li>
            <li> My  reasons for not giving a 5 star is they are very small ( can&#x27;t use with finger inserts) and they are stamped Made in Pakistan (description says Japanese steel).</li>
            <li> Love them!  Sharp and great feel on hands, great scissors!</li>
            <li> These shears are sharp and a great value for the price.  My only complaint is that the finger-holes are a bit small, but otherwise, I don&#x27;t think you can find a better deal for a pair of 5.5\\&quot; shears on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I finally used these scissors to cut my daughters hair, they were amazing! So smooth and they cut so nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought these barber scissors for touch-up at home. They are very sharp. I have not had them long enough to comment on how well they hold their edge, but so far I am happy with them. They also come with a well made case to hold them.&lt;br /&gt;The handle holes have removable rubber inserts to customize fit. The blade tension can be adjusted by a tension spring with knob as shown. They come in three sizes, I have the 5.5&amp;#34; size.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am pleased and would order them again. They are well priced.</li>
            <li> There is literally nothing bad I can say about these shears.  I use them to trim my mustache (as I hate it when the hairs get too long and start getting in my mouth - especially around the corners), and have had nothing but good experiences with them.  I haven&#x27;t tried cutting my hair with them, but from using them with my facial hair, I&#x27;m sure they would do a find job.  I was a little worried about some of the reviews saying the holes are too big, but like someone else already mentioned you can just take the inserts out (I took out the one for my thumb, but left the other one and it&#x27;s very comfortable/usable).  If you&#x27;re looking for a great bargain (good quality at a low price) these are the ones to get.</li>
            <li> I have a more expensive pair I bought at a beauty supply place (25.00) that do not cut as well as these.  You can cut the hair any where on the shat of the scissors no problem.  The are super quiet when cutting hair which basically means they are sharp and are not ripping through the hair. I am not a hairdresser I just trim my ends in between cuts and these are perfect!  I never noticed that it came with a leather like zip pouch so all the better.  They are comfortable without the inserts... and I have large hands for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;I asked my secretary (who is trained as a hairdresser!) how long the cutting end should be and she said for non-barbering techniques it should be no longer than the length of your finger as you use your fingers to hold the hair and you don&#x27;t want to nip yourself! so these were great for me.  Now I have no idea how long they will stay sharp but I guess long enough for one person to give herself trims for the next 5 year at least! :0) I know I will probably use these as much in the next 5 years as my hairdresser will use a pair of scissors for a week or two of cutting all day long.</li>
            <li> I love these shears they are super sharp which is a must and they fit my hand comfortably (righty. I would def. re purchase in about a year or so.</li>
            <li> These are the most precise, highest quality scissors I have ever used. I use them on my beard and they cut it like a dream. Gives me a much cleaner, nicer cut than my last pair</li>
            <li> Best hair shears I&#x27;ve ever purchased - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love these scissors and the quality of them is unbelievably good for the small price! I highly recommend them! They are more elegant than I am used to as well...the knob for setting the tightness was new to me.</li>
            <li> The shears are a good comfortable weight, they come apart easily which is a plus for hand sharpening. They are also tension adjustable and the large nut is easy to operate. The only thing that I do not like about the shares is the small finger openings. I would only recommend the shares for someone who has small fingers.</li>
            <li> Excellent, sharp shears that fit my hands well.  Perfect for doing my bangs at home. And  Has a nice case too.  Shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> Great little pair of scissors for the price!  Very happy with purchase. Don&#x27;t forget to remove the rubber &#x27;thingies&#x27; to fit your fingers more comfortably.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED 2 DIFFERENT PAIR OF THESE AND THEY CUT THE BEST OD ANY SHEARS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, TOTALLY SATISFIED. THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality, great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent scissors. They were smaller than I imagined, but that&#x27;s my fault for not looking at a ruler before purchasing. The blade is very sharp. I actually like the smaller size because it gives me more control over the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last 5 or 6 years I&#x27;d been cutting my hair with a cheap pair I bought at Target: those are gummed up safety scissors by comparison to the Utopia pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the knob that allows you to increase or decrease blade tension.</li>
            <li> Nice scissors. Easy and fast returns</li>
            <li> Great scissors- the tension adjustment and finger grips make them easy to use. I have been looking for a smaller pair of shears for trimming bangs and these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not  a professional hair stylist, but these cut smoothly and easily without fraying or squeezing the hair. Since the whole idea of trimming your hair is to remove dry/split ends and not to cause them, these worked out great!</li>
            <li> These hair cutting shears work just fine. The finger holes are a bit small so we had to remove the rubber liners. My wife uses these to cut my hair and she has very small hands and couldn&#x27;t get her fingers in the holes without removing the rubber liners. Not for use by a man with normal size hands.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional, so I did a bit of research on shears before choosing these. The blade is convex which is supposed to give a smoother cut.  The tension knob is a nice feature, however, it kept coming loose.  Maybe I just had it too loose in the first place so it came undone.  These are similar in design to shears 4x the price.  I only cut my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair once a month, so $14 is a great price!  The shears are sharp and cut very cleanly.  They are comfortable to hold and easy to manipulate.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Delivery came quickly and it looks just like the picture! They cut very well and I like it!</li>
            <li> Good value, however the thumb hole is very small. I should have heeded others who mentioned the small thumb hole.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months and used it three times thus far. We use it for family haircuts. They are sharp and very comfortable in the hand. The finger inserts are great as it can be removed and inserted back based on the size of your fingers.</li>
            <li> This is a very good seller to deal with, but my beef is with the scissors. The fingerholes are tiny. Now, my hands pretty much have not grown since I stopped getting taller at age 12, but I can&#x27;t properly situate my fingers in the holes to operate the scissors.</li>
            <li> Purchased these sizzors just to have on hand . They looked good for my needs, and appear to be what I wanted. I will use them on VERY RARE occasions. Have not had occasion to use them yet. I am very pleased with my purchase !!</li>
            <li> I purchased these shears for in home haircuts. These shears are decent for the cost, sharp, and as described in the promo. My only complaint is that the rubber finger gribs pop out too easy. While the shears still cut effectively without them, I feel there is better control with the inserts remaining in. The tension adjuster and carrring case are a plus. Overall, I would recommend these shears for anyone looking for a professional type of hair cutting tool without the high cost.</li>
            <li> What a beauty ...cuts like butter baby.</li>
            <li> These scissors are awesome!  They are very sharp and do a great job at cutting hair.  I have small fingers so they fit me perfectly.  My husband, on the other hand, can&#x27;t get his fingers through the holes.  They are small but are perfect when I am cutting my kids and my husbands hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these for periodic trimming and eliminating split ends, they cut well and the scissors feel really solid. The finger loops are a bit small but they came with rubber rings that pull out and give more room. The end is more rounded than it looks in the pictures, which is good because I was worried I&#x27;d stab myself with them. Came in a nice zippered case to keep them clean and protected. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome scissors! 5.5&amp;#34; is the perfect size for beard trimming. Going to find a larger pair for cutting hair. Great price and great quality. Amazon prime.... enough said</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure what to say about these- they are sharp, do not leave split ends, and are very comfortable on the hands. All for a cheap price!</li>
            <li> I definitely find this scissors very sharp and I also like the way I can adjust it. I use this to cut my dog&#x27;s hair and it is small enough to move around without worrying if I cut too much off or if I&#x27;m messing it up. I recommend these for anyone who wants to save a few bucks on dog hair cut.</li>
            <li> I started cutting my own hair and thought I should get some real sharp scissors made for the job. These work fine. The finger and thumb holes were a little small at first but I got used to them.</li>
            <li> Works great for me ! Have tried it for my new hair style. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! for little money it&#x27;s great value and works like pro Scisors</li>
            <li> I have small hands, so I find these very comfortable and easy to control. I would agree with other reviewers that these are too small for most men&#x27;s hands. Very sharp, convenient case, great for keeping my bangs at the perfect length.</li>
            <li> These scissors are superb - so sharp you have to watch yoursell!!  They slice through hair like butter.  My hands are somewhat small and they fit really well. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, fast delivery.  Superb!  Comes in a very nice case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needed small, sharp dedicated hair scissors, and these fit the bill nicely and at a good price.</li>
            <li> These scissors are quality!  Really solid &amp; very sharp!  I had to remove the plastic inserts from the finger holes...must have to have tiny fingers to need them.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small these scissors are.  I didn&#x27;t think they would do  the job.  One thing I don&#x27;t like about them is the finger inserts are very small, so if you have big fingers these aren&#x27;t for you.  I did try them out and they are super sharp, so I&#x27;ll be keeping them.  These are good for small snips like cutting bangs.  Possibly for my schnautzer&#x27;s beard!</li>
            <li> Very nice scissors. They&#x27;re lightweight, feel comfortable, and are nice and sharp. These scissors made cutting hair much easier.</li>
            <li> Love them, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Nicely crafted and highly polished, no rough edges, has a high quality look. Adjustable tension knob is a real plus. Plastic insert at the finger holes cushions blade closing. The (clunky) &#x27;Utopia Care&#x27; logo is easily scraped off with a fingernail without any damage to the polish of the blade. Marked: S.S. Pakistan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I bought the 5.5&amp;#34; to trim my beard, and for this it does a good job, cleanly slicing off the individual hairs that stick up. My only quibble is with the tip. When closed, the tip is mildly rounded, but when opened, two sharp corners are exposed as the cutting edge runs right to the tip. This may be preferred for using the tips of the shears to cut in good light, but for trimming a beard along the neck where visibility is poor, I would have preferred the inside corners to also have been rounded to avoid the risk of nicking the skin.</li>
            <li> Great scissors, but they are too short. Maybe if you had someone else cut your hair then these would be good. If you don&#x27;t want to bend your arm until it hurts to get to the right position, then buy a longer pair.</li>
            <li> I bought this scissors to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair and so far it is great. It is very sharp, so it cuts hair smoothly and quickly. It definitely deserves five stars and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality for Pakistan. Twenty years ago their exports were pretty crude. They&#x27;ve made some real progress in bringing up the quality of their metal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are very, very sharp. I ran my finger along one of the blades to see how sharp it was and it CUT MY FINGER!  I&#x27;ve had these for maybe 6 months or so and they&#x27;ve kept their edge really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I find amusing is the &amp;#34;gold plated&amp;#34; parts shown in the photos. I comes looking just like the picture....but within a month it has begun rubbing off. Right now, the only places that still have the gold color on it are those places that can&#x27;t be touched. Like the grooves on that tension knob. Everywhere else it&#x27;s been rubbed off. That layer of gold must be about one atom thick. They probably saw a pair of German or Swiss scissors that had a gold plated part so they did it too...not having the least idea of why they were doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take my criticism too hard guys. I&#x27;m just kidding with you. They&#x27;re a nice pair of scissors. Keep up the good work and keep trying for perfection. That&#x27;s the only way things get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got through giving the scissors a very close inspection. There is now no way of knowing where these scissors were manufactured. The only mark on them is the single letter &amp;#34;s&amp;#34; etched very small near the handle. I&#x27;m still impressed with the craftsmanship. But I thought everything made sure you knew the country of its origin.</li>
            <li> I love them I took out the inner plastic liners.&lt;br /&gt;Joanne</li>
            <li> too small for my adult hands</li>
            <li> These shears are amazing. I started cutting my fiance&#x27;s hair a few months back starting with some cheapo ones from target.&lt;br /&gt;I thought they were ok until I got these --- the difference in sharpness and just sturdiness is significant.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, these are waaaay better. They don&#x27;t fall apart, have the right amount of tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative (minus 1 star) is that it is QUITE short. The 5.5&amp;#34; inches include the finger rest thingie that sticks further out from the finger loops. I got used to it, I don&#x27;t necessarily need the bigger pair, but had I known ahead of time, I would have purchased the larger pair.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO be aware, the wholes (with the rubber) is TINY. I have extremely small hands (child hand size), i will guarantee that it will feel small on everyone else. I take the rubber off my thumb so I can have some movement from between cutting and combing.</li>
            <li> They cut okay, but very small finger holes.  I am a woman with small fingers and my fingers barely fit in them.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good pair of scissors to trim my beard.  Most \\&quot;beard trimmers\\&quot; are too small.  This set was just right in terms of blade length and is very sharp and cuts well.  My only complaint is that I can just get the tips of my fingers in the finger holes on the scissors.  I think I can get used to this as the scissors work quite well otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love these scissors. I cut hair and there is nothing worse than cutting with dull scissors. These are the best hair cutting scissors I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> These scissors are really sharp and great for cutting hair.  Remember to never cut anything else with them or they will dull quickly just like all scissors.  Some people were complaining that the finger holes are too small.  They are the size they are supposed to be.  When cutting hair you should just use the tips of your fingers for better control.  They aren&#x27;t meant to put your entire finger in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have purchased from this seller but I will be a repeat customer.  I received the scissors very quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. S.  I love the zippered case they came in.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these. Very good quality. I would recommend these to a friend</li>
            <li> Great small scissors. I use them for mustache, beard, ears, nose... all the places it grows on men, after it quits up top! And I have very large hands and fingers. I did remove the grommets though I didn&#x27;t really have to, I just liked the feel better and... you use just the tips of your fingers anyway. I like the removable brass post for resting your ring finger and they seem to be made of good quality stainless steel. Their adjust-ability feature works well and they came in a nice \\&quot;leatherette\\&quot; case... it should not say \\&quot;leather\\&quot;, although it is just the case. Most definitely worth $15. Buy them.</li>
            <li> Great scissors...would recommend them</li>
            <li> I thought these scissors were very affordable and better quality than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> A great pair of well crafted and very sharp scissors for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Use them to trim my mustache and beard - work great.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Removable plastic parts in the grips make them larger or smaller.</li>
            <li> Good quality scissors at a reasonable price with prompt delivery - thanks.</li>
            <li> just perfect as advertised</li>
            <li> Sharp and fit my fingers well. I like the leather container that comes with them. It makes life easier to store or carry them around.</li>
            <li> I bought two pairs of these scissors with different length for different usage. Both of these scissors arrived in great looking cases and the shear itself looks quite professional. I used these to cut my client hair and I felt these shears are not sharp enough. Other than that, the quality is amazing for this price.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, amazing price.  I cut my own hair, very happy with these!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery; item just as described</li>
            <li> I just received these shears in the mail a couple days ago. So far, they are working great and seem to be of a nice quality. They also came with a nice carrying case. I used to be a professional hairstylist and now just do it for friends and family on occasion. These remind me of my first pair of professional shears that were much more expensive, so I think overall they are a great deal!</li>
