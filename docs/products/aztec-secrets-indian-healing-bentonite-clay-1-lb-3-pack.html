            <li>feels wonderful on face, especially with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>where my favorite snakes I adore and enjoy to eat.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>The results worked out quite good, but still I kept getting oil skin on my face and the kind of mud masque product was the only thing I believed could afford to help me, and been doing this ritual for almost a year.</li>
            <li>it came out good better then good, it did mention about redness effects but for few minuets the redness fades away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so smooth and purges my impurities.</li>
            <li>oil free.</li>
            <li>great used for facial masks</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, my face feels super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>This was such a good buy.</li>
            <li>I started to develop woman hood at the age of 10 (it may sound too much to express</li>
            <li>I was struggling to not eat the things that were creating acne to my face and body and having oily face, even tried to keep my weight down to a 150 but as kids that&#x27;s what we loved sweet, greasy, salty snacks.</li>
            <li>This clay (mixed with other ingredients) has been the perfect addition to my beauty regimen.  </li>
            <li>I could feel my face being pulled or sucked right out of my chicks</li>
            <li>The positive effects are noticed right away.</li>
            <li>At the standing age of 11 that&#x27;s when I develop acne and my first crush for my dermatologist when my mom first took me to him.</li>
            <li>He prescribed me the epiduo face cream when it 1st came in the 90s he advise me to avoid from eating the things that was the cause for my acne; chocolate, greasy foods and snacks, and caffeinated sodas and within a couple of weeks I returned to my first crush dermatologist man and the results came out</li>
            <li>well I just had to continue to stay away from eating what was my favorite snakes from now on, and that was the last time I saw him.</li>
            <li>I just needed something better and affordable that could keep pimples coming back</li>
            <li>It really pulls out impurities!  </li>
            <li>I use it about once or twice a week as a clay wash (similar to the terressentials product), and I have noticed a tremendous difference in the moisture level in my African American 4c kinky hair, which has in turn given me some good hang to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Some of these acne products really worked well</li>
            <li>I really can tell the difference in pore size and skin feel.</li>
            <li>When I took the bowl out one morning the clay came out thick which that to me was good.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any other clay though to be able to have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li>: Neutrogena, clean &amp; clear, Clearasil, proactive, mary kaye, L&#x27;Oreal, clinique, oxy clean, some acne product from Europe and black soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done so many different acne treatments through out my teenage yrs to my up coming 20s</li>
            <li>Until in my mid twenties, suddenly I&#x27;ve grown to loose interest in eating the things I enjoyed as a kid because I was becoming and now a grown adult.</li>
            <li>the score on the clay were high reports lots of them</li>
            <li>I am new to bentonite clay, but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to say that it clears my skin as much as people say it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review after I try the mask, so far it&#x27;s about packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I felt my whole entire face being pulled even my neck</li>
            <li>I had fallen off the wagon numerous of times and hopping right back up.</li>
            <li>I use it for weekly clay masks (mixed with apple cider vinegar), as a main ingredient in our tooth powder, as a poultice for cuts and in baths for a detox effect.</li>
            <li>And so the results was amazing, for the whole entire day my face wasn&#x27;t too heavily oily somewhat moist but not to heavy which</li>
            <li>but I had to be quick before the clay dried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 yr old female of colore, semi-mulatto, and I&#x27;ve gone through acne and over loud of oily facial skin as long as I can remember.</li>

            <li> but I had to be quick before the clay dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 yr old female of colore, semi-mulatto, and I&#x27;ve gone through acne and over loud of oily facial skin as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> and I always heard black soap help clear away acne</li>
            <li> but the clay wasn&#x27;t dry enough</li>
            <li> so I continued the next step facial peel than I washed my face with the black soap and final moisturized my face</li>
            <li> It does feel weird and dries your skin a little, once you take it off pimples and blackheads become more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Ones the clay started to dry</li>
            <li> As I waited for 15mins for the mask to dry</li>
            <li> After time was up and finally dry this time</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the pack of three will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> My facial rituals was Sundays Queen Helene mud masque and facial peel to absorb away the oil and mud residues, adding with the black soap and the acne toner, where for the rest of the days of the week was black soap and acne toner.</li>
            <li> it may seem too costly but its better then the bad vinegar smell.</li>
            <li> They were wrapped together by the wide scotch tape which, when removed, took all instructions with it.&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tools: small plastic bowl (or small glass which ever useful) with cover, small modeling spatula (or silicone spatula where those can be found in art supply or cooking wear store), a small bottle applicator 2oz, instead a make-up brush</li>
            <li> I would sneak a drink of coke or pesi and a bite chocolate, chips, pizzas, and greasy fastfoods here and there, at home, at schools, in parties and stopping by down at a deli stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chose a synthetic paint brush ¾\\&quot; wide flat bristles not too thick or thin but slim short handle, measuring spoon, and real raw organic (no other)</li>
            <li> so I purchased 6 bars organic black soap for $11</li>
            <li> But, once again by accident I was at another store looking for black soap</li>
            <li> I take my ¾\\&quot; flat brush tipped it in the clay and with 1 stroke applied a thin layer on my face down to my neck</li>
            <li> I even mix it with a ton of green tea to make a liquid mixture to use with cotton sheet masks when I want to use it in a less harsh way than with raw apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> thinking I don&#x27;t bath much or that I&#x27;m a dirty eater or something.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> but I have tried it a few times and</li>
            <li> My face has been missing this.</li>
            <li> so when I went down to the store location shopping for my usual vitamins</li>
            <li> Like as usually I the routine is ones a week and for the rest of the days its just black soap, don&#x27;t want to over do it everyday.  </li>
            <li> but I went to reading the bad ones first to find out the others effects</li>
            <li> my moral judgment finally came through in my brain, it was time to make an end to my bad food</li>
            <li> I scooped 2tbl spoons, scraped off the extras, of the Indian healing clay into the small bowl, I take my applicator of raw organic apple cider vinegar 2tbl spoon than steer it until it became creamy like yogurt or cake mixer and not lumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also started making a blend to use as a face mask; I tried to do this about three times a week, but it usually ends up to about once a week.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s last problem driving me mad, paranoid, assuming people were glairing at me</li>
            <li> when I discovered the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay and one of the words listed about this item that caught my attention, you guess it, acne.</li>
            <li> but over all nothing wrong happened</li>
            <li> but it was so annoying to look like some grease face factory.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was such a good buy. 3 in 1 and the product is amazing. Makes my skin feel so smooth and purges my impurities.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask! I even mix it with a ton of green tea to make a liquid mixture to use with cotton sheet masks when I want to use it in a less harsh way than with raw apple cider vinegar. Divine!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to say that it clears my skin as much as people say it does. It does feel weird and dries your skin a little, once you take it off pimples and blackheads become more noticeable.</li>
            <li> all reviews I have read said it was awesome and you can feel your face pulsate but I have tried it a few times and it isn&#x27;t all its cracked up to be</li>
            <li> Very good for muscle aches and for face masks.</li>
            <li> I love this clay. I use it in my hair, on my skin, to wrap my hands a feet. It is an all around home spa product. I love love love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality clay. It is a multipurpose product in our home. I use it for weekly clay masks (mixed with apple cider vinegar), as a main ingredient in our tooth powder, as a poultice for cuts and in baths for a detox effect. A little goes a long way, so the pack of three will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review after I try the mask, so far it&#x27;s about packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a pack of 3, planning to gift 2 of them. They were wrapped together by the wide scotch tape which, when removed, took all instructions with it.&lt;br /&gt;Who could even come up with the idea of attaching a sticky tape all over the paper label on the jar??? Not a deep thinker obviously...&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t gift them now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 yr old female of colore, semi-mulatto, and I&#x27;ve gone through acne and over loud of oily facial skin as long as I can remember. I started to develop woman hood at the age of 10 (it may sound too much to express but I&#x27;m just making a point). At the standing age of 11 that&#x27;s when I develop acne and my first crush for my dermatologist when my mom first took me to him. He prescribed me the epiduo face cream when it 1st came in the 90s he advise me to avoid from eating the things that was the cause for my acne; chocolate, greasy foods and snacks, and caffeinated sodas and within a couple of weeks I returned to my first crush dermatologist man and the results came out well I just had to continue to stay away from eating what was my favorite snakes from now on, and that was the last time I saw him. The time in my adolescents mom would keep carrying on about what the dermatologist said to me about the things I was not to eat but I wouldn&#x27;t listened, I couldn&#x27;t help myself. Every where I was during my childhood days there where my favorite snakes I adore and enjoy to eat. I would sneak a drink of coke or pesi and a bite chocolate, chips, pizzas, and greasy fastfoods here and there, at home, at schools, in parties and stopping by down at a deli stores.&lt;br /&gt; I was struggling to not eat the things that were creating acne to my face and body and having oily face, even tried to keep my weight down to a 150 but as kids that&#x27;s what we loved sweet, greasy, salty snacks. I&#x27;ve done so many different acne treatments through out my teenage yrs to my up coming 20s: Neutrogena, clean &amp; clear, Clearasil, proactive, mary kaye, L&#x27;Oreal, clinique, oxy clean, some acne product from Europe and black soap. Some of these acne products really worked well some of the others didn&#x27;t, some were discontinued and some were too costly for me to afford. When I came to my 20s my moral judgment finally came through in my brain, it was time to make an end to my bad food crave crusade and it wasn&#x27;t easy. I had fallen off the wagon numerous of times and hopping right back up. Until in my mid twenties, suddenly I&#x27;ve grown to loose interest in eating the things I enjoyed as a kid because I was becoming and now a grown adult. Except my happy interest for chocolate, for some reason that have a powerful force. So I&#x27;ve managed a way to program my thoughts into making me believe that I don&#x27;t like chocolate and it have worked I&#x27;ve even been doing some daily superjuice body detoxing where that helps along.&lt;br /&gt;But still I continued to struggle with acne and greasy skin, when I read in the allure magazine that said some acne product ingredients can sometimes be a cause for oily skin, where I even believe it could be the leading cause of the acnes keeping on coming. So I stopped purchasing the popular acne soaps, where it was wearing my wallet out, but I kept using the acne toner and I always heard black soap help clear away acne and it&#x27;s affordable so I purchased 6 bars organic black soap for $11 saved me money saved me time. My facial rituals was Sundays Queen Helene mud masque and facial peel to absorb away the oil and mud residues, adding with the black soap and the acne toner, where for the rest of the days of the week was black soap and acne toner. The results worked out quite good, but still I kept getting oil skin on my face and the kind of mud masque product was the only thing I believed could afford to help me, and been doing this ritual for almost a year. I was happy, didn&#x27;t have too much pimples but it was so annoying to look like some grease face factory. That&#x27;s last problem driving me mad, paranoid, assuming people were glairing at me thinking I don&#x27;t bath much or that I&#x27;m a dirty eater or something.&lt;br /&gt;When one day, I was scrolling through online from a website for vitamins, that is when I discovered the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay and one of the words listed about this item that caught my attention, you guess it, acne. I was hoping it would be in store, not just sold in the website and what was the price so when I went down to the store location shopping for my usual vitamins the clay wasn&#x27;t in store. I fingered I could get the clay at amazon even for a fair price which it is, I also saw the reviews, by the looks of it the score on the clay were high reports lots of them but I went to reading the bad ones first to find out the others effects and I didn&#x27;t like what I read I felt heisted. But, once again by accident I was at another store looking for black soap and I found the healing clay there. For just $10 bucks on a 1 ounce jar that&#x27;s a good price so letting my worries aside I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;First I tested the clay, steer the powder with water at the even amount then applied some on my chicks and waited for 15mins. Ones the clay started to dry I could feel my face being pulled or sucked right out of my chicks I could even see it happening around the space of my skin it look like my chick was being pinched. So when it was time to remove the clay instead of washing it off I used a soak towel clothe to remove it, oh man it hurt but over all nothing wrong happened it came out good better then good, it did mention about redness effects but for few minuets the redness fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s how I made this work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tools: small plastic bowl (or small glass which ever useful) with cover, small modeling spatula (or silicone spatula where those can be found in art supply or cooking wear store), a small bottle applicator 2oz, instead a make-up brush I chose a synthetic paint brush ¾\\&quot; wide flat bristles not too thick or thin but slim short handle, measuring spoon, and real raw organic (no other) apple cider vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Process:1st I scooped 2tbl spoons, scraped off the extras, of the Indian healing clay into the small bowl, I take my applicator of raw organic apple cider vinegar 2tbl spoon than steer it until it became creamy like yogurt or cake mixer and not lumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I chose to store the bowl of clay, with the cover on, in my bathroom cabinet and left over night. When I took the bowl out one morning the clay came out thick which that to me was good. I take my ¾\\&quot; flat brush tipped it in the clay and with 1 stroke applied a thin layer on my face down to my neck but I had to be quick before the clay dried. As I waited for 15mins for the mask to dry I felt my whole entire face being pulled even my neck it felt like I was being straggled but the clay wasn&#x27;t dry enough so I waited an extra 5mins. After time was up and finally dry this time I washed the clay off and there was no redness but I still felt there were some clay left in my pores so I continued the next step facial peel than I washed my face with the black soap and final moisturized my face oil free. And so the results was amazing, for the whole entire day my face wasn&#x27;t too heavily oily somewhat moist but not to heavy which I am glade. Like as usually I the routine is ones a week and for the rest of the days its just black soap, don&#x27;t want to over do it everyday.  As for my acnes that&#x27;s been gone before I tried this clay treatment I just needed something better and affordable that could keep pimples coming back and I stopped using the acne toner , it may not be the cure but it helps. And I hope reading all of this have help you enough to get you to try the Indian healing clay. And instead of the vinegar I&#x27;m gonna switch for organic aloe vera juice it may seem too costly but its better then the bad vinegar smell.</li>
            <li> No joke at all, I feel it pulsate on my face!!!!</li>
            <li> I am new to bentonite clay, but so far I like it.  Have used in toothpaste, deodorant and as a mask and I love it.  Since this is a 3 pack I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be running out any time soon, but when I do I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product! My face has been missing this. The positive effects are noticed right away.</li>
            <li> Works great! I really can tell the difference in pore size and skin feel. I was not expecting such an improvement when using this as a mask. Definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> This clay (mixed with other ingredients) has been the perfect addition to my beauty regimen.  I use it about once or twice a week as a clay wash (similar to the terressentials product), and I have noticed a tremendous difference in the moisture level in my African American 4c kinky hair, which has in turn given me some good hang to my hair.  I also started making a blend to use as a face mask; I tried to do this about three times a week, but it usually ends up to about once a week.  It really pulls out impurities!  I haven&#x27;t used any other clay though to be able to have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my face feels super clean afterwards. Works best if mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> amazing price, great product. feels wonderful on face, especially with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> great used for facial masks</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent deal.</li>
            <li> I use this clay once every week for facial mask and it makes my skin feels softer and cleaner. I use apple cider vinegar and sometimes warm water.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to use it on my body next.</li>
