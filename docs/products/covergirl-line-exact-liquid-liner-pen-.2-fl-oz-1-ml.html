            <li>love it and it works great, i love the way it looks on me</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply with near perfect lines.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to apply since you can hold it like a sharpie which makes life easier :)</li>

            <li>Fits perfectly into my tiny make-up case.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I literally just looked online to see if there is supposed to be a way to twist the case to get more.</li>
            <li>finding a good product in this line is like trying to find the golden ticket.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for years and haven&#x27;t found anything that I like better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, no tugging on your eyelid.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide on so easy</li>
            <li>I swear by this...so easy to apply</li>
            <li>I thought this would be better coming from a better brand, but Maybelline is by far way better then this.</li>
            <li>The felt tip makes it really easy to get a clean line.  </li>
            <li>Good deep color and perfect for a dark eye.</li>
            <li>the first time i tried this i was in love.  </li>
            <li>the line quality was consistent and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This is my first times getting this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t smear when it dries, and only needs a mild soap and warm water to remove.</li>
            <li>ps this is the second liquid eyeliner I own</li>
            <li>I liked the CG eyeliner for the price, the tip applicator is fine, it allows you to line easily, but the L&#x27;Oreal or Maybelline Stiletto eye liners have lasted at least 3-4X longer.</li>
            <li>Same experience as many here.</li>
            <li>BUT the first day I used this liner I caught myself rubbing my eyes and thought uh</li>
            <li>After just one use nothing came out and even the first application there wasn&#x27;t even that much to work with.</li>
            <li>I love the look of liquid eyeliner but don&#x27;t have a steady enough hand to manage putting it on.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I usually would go buy this at the local drug store, its a great liner,</li>
            <li>a light grey.  </li>
            <li>(I feel that this is normal with any type of felt tip pen).  </li>
            <li>The product does, however, dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>Went on smooth and dried fast for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge down under her eyes.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t just \\&quot;not as dark\\&quot; or light black.</li>
            <li>the felt tip went through standard wear in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>and I received it so fast in the mail, thank you, I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>but with the other one I had, which I believe was Lancome, I constantly looked like a racoon and rarely could draw a straight line</li>
            <li>After several tries we finally found one that goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>the second dried out far too quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great liner with tip that allows for a thin or thick line.  </li>
            <li>I hardly use much each time as I dislike high definition in my eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Maybe 1 out of 10 of these tubes are decent enough to last me 2 weeks, but now I only get 2-4 days out of a single tube.</li>
            <li>I had to swipe it a couple of times before it became a very dilute black.</li>

            <li> But after a week it came out clear which has never happened to me with any other liner before.</li>
            <li> I use on the eyelash roots only, dab on, not really a line.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a fairly small package and gets used up quickly.</li>
            <li> other BIG drawback with Covergirl products is they still use animal testing!!!  </li>
            <li> however when i used it for one day, the ink was dry and the felt tip was no longer working because the ink was dry.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out before you use it up?</li>
            <li> It takes too long to dry, you end with a big mess in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell it is a liner because there is really no line with it being on the lash roots.  </li>
            <li> My only compliant is that over the past few months they don&#x27;t seem to be lasting as long as they used to.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with make up because I have the tendency to constantly touch my face or rub my eyes</li>
            <li> The next day the applicator had dried out even after I had tightly closed it.</li>
            <li> just disappointed the quality has gone down in the last year or so - and like many others, I thought I just got a defective product.</li>
            <li> Today, there is nothing left or, at least, nothing I can put on my lid.</li>
            <li> wasted money where i could have gone out and spent it buying it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I shook and stored it upside down</li>
            <li> It gave a very sharp and dark wing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it three times and each tube has lasted less than a month.  </li>
            <li> - it just pulls all the previous liner off.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to be much; dried up after a few weeks</li>
            <li> considering I use very little of it as I draw thin lines and use it once daily at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the line was so watered down that it was hardly a whisper--</li>
            <li> As of late, the formula seems to be a bit watery - even with ample shaking and agitation of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AS THICK AS I PLEASE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous</li>
            <li> Totally ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Tried this product twice and both failed to deliver a line after a few applications.</li>
            <li> Not a good choice.</li>
            <li> Creates thick or thin lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always known there wasn&#x27;t a lot of liquid in the compactness of the chamber, but now the quality just gets worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Terrible eye liner, is very runny</li>
            <li> AS THIN OR</li>
            <li> it really sucks it will come off within a few hours :(</li>
            <li> i can make it as dramatic as I want</li>
            <li> so it makes it to thick!!</li>
            <li> And God help you if you want to go over the line again (since it&#x27;s so faint)</li>
            <li> I always used &amp;#34;marker&amp;#34; eyeliners or gel eyeliners, but sadly this is by far the worst I&#x27;ve tried :(   </li>
            <li> It draws very faint lines, like a marker that&#x27;s run out of ink, and sometimes you can get globs of it, which I don&#x27;t want either.</li>
            <li> Just a tip: the people writing bad reviews about it drying out aren&#x27;t using the product correctly.</li>
            <li> awful.</li>
            <li> They are terrible.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m very disappointed in it!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> but the ink is terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this on amazon and I usually would go buy this at the local drug store, its a great liner, however when i used it for one day, the ink was dry and the felt tip was no longer working because the ink was dry. awful. wasted money where i could have gone out and spent it buying it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> it worked for like a week!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite eyeliner. I was so happy to find it cheaper! Love love, goes on perfect every time.</li>
            <li> perfect. 100 % recommended . all in perfect condition .</li>
            <li> I thought this would be better coming from a better brand, but Maybelline is by far way better then this.</li>
            <li> Please dont buy this eyeliner it really sucks it will come off within a few hours :(</li>
            <li> Same experience as many here. I&#x27;ve always known there wasn&#x27;t a lot of liquid in the compactness of the chamber, but now the quality just gets worse and worse. Maybe 1 out of 10 of these tubes are decent enough to last me 2 weeks, but now I only get 2-4 days out of a single tube. As of late, the formula seems to be a bit watery - even with ample shaking and agitation of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I do manage to get one of good quality, it&#x27;s the best liner I&#x27;ve ever used - it&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t smear when it dries, and only needs a mild soap and warm water to remove. If I splash my face with water and dab with a towel, it doesn&#x27;t come off. I only need to apply it once in the morning and it lasts all day, and I never end up looking like a raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just disappointed the quality has gone down in the last year or so - and like many others, I thought I just got a defective product.</li>
            <li> Terrible eye liner, is very runny and I had to apply several times when I put it on in the mornings.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner -- it stays all day! It&#x27;s easy to use, no tugging on your eyelid. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a fairly small package and gets used up quickly. However, maybe that is intentional so it doesn&#x27;t dry out before you use it up?</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with make up because I have the tendency to constantly touch my face or rub my eyes so I often end up smudging everything all over the place... BUT the first day I used this liner I caught myself rubbing my eyes and thought uh oh I ran to the bathroom and surprise surprise my cat eyes were still intact :D it is very easy to apply since you can hold it like a sharpie which makes life easier :) ps this is the second liquid eyeliner I own so I am no expert but with the other one I had, which I believe was Lancome, I constantly looked like a racoon and rarely could draw a straight line</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner ever made!  I have been using this solely for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Stays on all day, no irritation.  I use on the eyelash roots only, dab on, not really a line.  Can&#x27;t tell it is a liner because there is really no line with it being on the lash roots.  Ha!</li>
            <li> I bought this liner hoping to end my search for a good liner. I used it on day one by the end of the day the liner was on my lids and I looked like a clown. The next day the applicator had dried out even after I had tightly closed it. I will NOT buy covergirl liners again. They are terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner for years. It never runs or comes off even if I touch my eye. Just a tip: the people writing bad reviews about it drying out aren&#x27;t using the product correctly. You have to shake it at each use to get the liquid on the tip.</li>
            <li> Works well, Love the size. Fits perfectly into my tiny make-up case. Very easy to apply with near perfect lines.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge down under her eyes. Creates thick or thin lines. After several tries we finally found one that goes on smooth and lasts all day. Extremely happy and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to be much; dried up after a few weeks</li>
            <li> After just one use nothing came out and even the first application there wasn&#x27;t even that much to work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great liner with tip that allows for a thin or thick line.  It has great staying power.  However, there&#x27;s virtually NO product in the container.  I&#x27;ve purchased it three times and each tube has lasted less than a month.  This is ridiculous considering I use very little of it as I draw thin lines and use it once daily at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other BIG drawback with Covergirl products is they still use animal testing!!!  Are you reading this CoverGirl?</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  IT STAYS ON ALL DAY AND DOESN&#x27;T SMUDGE.&lt;br /&gt;I CAN MAKE THE LINE AS THIN OR AS THICK AS I PLEASE.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS.  I  USED TO BUY IT AT CVS&lt;br /&gt;BUT THEY NEVER HAVE IT ANYMORE.</li>
            <li> Great control for drawing the perfect cat eye. Good deep color and perfect for a dark eye.</li>
            <li> This is my first times getting this product! And I&#x27;m very disappointed in it!!!! It doesn&#x27;t glide on so easy it only has the liner come out on the side so it makes it to thick!! I wish it worked as it said</li>
            <li> I like the precision tip that makes an even application. The product does, however, dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> It takes too long to dry, you end with a big mess in your eyes. I&#x27;ve tried several times to use it since I have it there and always is the same it doesnt work, for over 15 years I always used &amp;#34;marker&amp;#34; eyeliners or gel eyeliners, but sadly this is by far the worst I&#x27;ve tried :(   It doesn&#x27;t work, buy something else.</li>
            <li> Looks smaller in person</li>
            <li> Great coverage and wears all day. Last for close to 2 months too!</li>
            <li> I liked the CG eyeliner for the price, the tip applicator is fine, it allows you to line easily, but the L&#x27;Oreal or Maybelline Stiletto eye liners have lasted at least 3-4X longer.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and have used it four times. I hardly use much each time as I dislike high definition in my eyeliner. Today, there is nothing left or, at least, nothing I can put on my lid. (When I try pressing the brush on a tissue, I get some of the gel but it won&#x27;t release on my lid.) I literally just looked online to see if there is supposed to be a way to twist the case to get more. Totally ridiculous. The gel worked well when I used it though.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried the more expensive brands and this eyeliner is the only one that lasts all day and does not run or smear after use.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a beauty guru on youtube was using it. The first two times I used it was awesome. It gave a very sharp and dark wing. But after a week it came out clear which has never happened to me with any other liner before. It wasn&#x27;t just \\&quot;not as dark\\&quot; or light black. I had to swipe it a couple of times before it became a very dilute black. I shook and stored it upside down and it did nothing. Horrible. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t work. It draws very faint lines, like a marker that&#x27;s run out of ink, and sometimes you can get globs of it, which I don&#x27;t want either. And God help you if you want to go over the line again (since it&#x27;s so faint) - it just pulls all the previous liner off.</li>
            <li> Tried this product twice and both failed to deliver a line after a few applications. It is a nice tip, but CG needs to work on how the liner reaches the tip. Not a good choice.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me. Went on smooth and dried fast for me.</li>
            <li> the first time i tried this i was in love.  the line quality was consistent and easy to apply.  the felt tip went through standard wear in a reasonable amount of time.  the second and third times were not so charming-- the second dried out far too quickly and the third simply never worked at all-- the line was so watered down that it was hardly a whisper-- a light grey.  finding a good product in this line is like trying to find the golden ticket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for years and haven&#x27;t found anything that I like better.  I love the look of liquid eyeliner but don&#x27;t have a steady enough hand to manage putting it on.  The felt tip makes it really easy to get a clean line.  You do have to give it a good shake before each use to redistribute the liquid inside (I feel that this is normal with any type of felt tip pen).  My only compliant is that over the past few months they don&#x27;t seem to be lasting as long as they used to.</li>
            <li> I swear by this...so easy to apply</li>
            <li> I like the felt tip but the ink is terrible. It doesn&#x27;t stay at all</li>
            <li> love it and it works great, i love the way it looks on me i can make it as dramatic as I want and I received it so fast in the mail, thank you, I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> No complaints, perfect timing n perfect product</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
