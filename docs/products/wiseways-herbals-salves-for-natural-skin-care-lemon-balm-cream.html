            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love to see WiseWays come out with a coconut oil version of this</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use it as a chapstick and love the way it smells (and tastes).</li>
            <li>Lips feel better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this lemon balm salve, it takes the pain out of fever blisters and also makes them go away almost immediately.</li>
            <li>it is much better.  </li>
            <li>I have been using lemon balm extract for my anxiety (which works wonders) and thought I would use this for more *</li>
            <li>Within hours I was feeling better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say even better than prescription ointment.</li>
            <li>I will post more info on it once I use it to let all know how it works.</li>
            <li>Was OK, but didn&#x27;t help the problem</li>
            <li>Alleviated a lot of the pain, burning and itching.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I honestly love this product.</li>
            <li>It works great, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It sure seems to stop them in their tracks, and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since buying it.  </li>
            <li>Again, I mostly just like the smell.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Product will buy again!  </li>
            <li>So many products out there are garbage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Within her first overnight use, she loved how her lips and the surrounding skin felt.  </li>
            <li>Gentle yet effective!</li>
            <li>The salve has a lovely strong lemon balm smell.</li>
            <li>i always use it for cuts scrapes etc- great natural remedy to use when you don&#x27;t want to use chemical laden ointments</li>
            <li>The aroma is lovely and it is so smooth on skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, always recommend products from Wiseways.</li>
            <li>This is a fine Lemon Balm salve.  </li>
            <li>I woke up this morning feeling fine and the six fever blisters are already crusting over.  </li>
            <li>Healed fever blisters more quickly than prescription drugs.  </li>
            <li>It heals rashes in only a matter of days and has been a great relief to me.</li>
            <li>Lemon Balm is great for sores, especially fever blister type.  </li>
            <li>Great seller, item was received earlier than indicated.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap to boot.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>And at such an amazing price!</li>
            <li>I grow lemon balm in my garden, so am familiar with it and use it in herbal teas for colds and fever.</li>
            <li>I love this salve so much!</li>
            <li>The sores would be huge making my lips swollen and full of pain.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin and any sores!</li>
            <li>It is not always safe to use antibiotic ointment in tender spots or large  sections of skin; that&#x27;s not what its meant for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited because I thought it would help it go away really quickly.</li>
            <li>Works really good, wish it came in a bigger container but</li>
            <li>Compared to similar coldsore treatments (ie Lysine+ ointment, though that does not contain lemon balm) this is a good value.  </li>
            <li>Lemon balm has very healing qualities, and this salve has many uses.  </li>
            <li>and now they are super</li>
            <li>and it clears them up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like the salve heals all kinds of abrasions quickly.</li>
            <li>I am a firm believer that medication should not be taken unless absolutely necessary, and lemon balm is the perfect substitute for many ailments.</li>
            <li>There are no chemicals, just old safe powerful herbs!</li>
            <li>When I started using this, I was very pleased because it actually works on your lips.</li>
            <li>Very good and safe product for the skin, check out their other products by a female owned and holistic business.</li>
            <li>I bought the Wise Ways White Pine Drawing Salve first.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!  </li>
            <li>This product does EXACTLY what it says it does!</li>
            <li>It has an oilier texture than the other, and a pleasantly lemony scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply over sore or itchy skin due to the nice consistency.  </li>
            <li>One correction is that the ingredients list on the bottle also includes licorice root extract, which is a powerful addition to this balm (it is not shown in the description).</li>
            <li>well it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great natural alternative that actually works.</li>
            <li>I put this on right away</li>
            <li>This lemon balm cream is very soothing and healing for any skin rashes or reactions (I am very sensitive to many products).</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to say which one helps the most, but I feel like they all help in their own way.</li>
            <li>If she happens to have an outbreak it heals super fast.</li>
            <li>After using this stuff  for about a week I quickly realized this stuff is for real.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was very fast too.</li>
            <li>Then I got this salve from Amazon and it did help with the poison ivy itching, which was very intense towards the end of the attack.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what was discribed.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more solid</li>
            <li>But here it is Friday (one week later), and it&#x27;s not any better.  </li>
            <li>but it does if you catch it at the first signs.</li>
            <li>The new larger size is nice too.</li>
            <li>I have heard that this can clear lesions in sensitive areas quickly, and it&#x27;s definitely true!</li>
            <li>not sure how good it is as yet</li>
            <li>I live the fact that this product can be used for many different reasons.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t help to much.</li>
            <li>Excellent cold sore remedy.</li>
            <li>From herpes cold sore relief to help diminish the appearance of acne, this salve is the BEST.</li>
            <li>My hands break out in a rash because I was my hands so much.  </li>
            <li>It really soothes him and the rashes he has had are almost gone.</li>
            <li>We apply this to those really troublesome areas and it defiantly helps.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>on time, thanks</li>
            <li>ointment and haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it much,</li>
            <li>so this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li>I have since bought lemon balm from Amazon since it is much cheaper</li>
            <li>I use this instead of cortisone if I get a rash and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the product and would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that the lid was cracked when it arrived.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed faster healing as of yet because I don&#x27;t want to use too much of it.</li>
            <li>It smelled awesome and was very hydrating but did not work for cold sores.</li>
            <li>Even the harsh treatments from the dermatologist were not as effective.</li>
            <li>This is a great cream for your fingers, lips and any other very dry skin area.</li>
            <li>Healed up my eczema quickly and effectively, after several other lotions did nothing!</li>
            <li>buy/make a better blend to heal your lips and use for other conditions as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>It has appears to have more lemon balm in it, even though the other one claims to have 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looking forward to using it for other applications  : )</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I found it at Amazon for much less.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great on my wife&#x27;s cold sores, they not only don&#x27;t last as long but the duration between outbreaks has increased greatly to almost appear cured.</li>
            <li>Works great for a tense lower back, just rub some in and relax.</li>
            <li>Most relief of all the things I have tried and doesn&#x27;t sting, keeps lips soft despite the cycle of cold sores and smells nice.</li>
            <li>(the sun will cause me to have a break out pretty easily if not careful) and this WORKS</li>
            <li>It seems reasonably priced and the ingredients look interesting, but I am not sure what to use it for at this point.</li>
            <li>My elbows get super dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>Lemon balm is wonderful for conditions such as cold sores, fever blisters, HSV, etc.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Keeps lips and skin soft!</li>
            <li>I especially use it if I can&#x27;t wait and eat something that&#x27;s too hot and burns my lips.</li>
            <li>The jar came opened and it had a huge black marker line over the bar code, like something that was defective.</li>
            <li>I know I dropped it a few times and the glass is strong too.  </li>
            <li>This is a HUGE jar in comparison to those little carmex containers.</li>
            <li>This lemon balm work great for cold sores.  </li>
            <li>and doesnt bother my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>and I have direct patient care.  </li>
            <li>WiseWays Herbals: Salves for Natural Skin Care, Lemon Balm Cream</li>
            <li>I use this at the sign of any rash and its gone with 72 hours if you catch it early.</li>
            <li>Was a complete lifesaver when my son and I contracted hand, foot and mouth disease.</li>
            <li>The dermatologist gave me a steroid cream prescription which worked early on to lessen the rash and itching.</li>
            <li>I first bought the lemon balm essential oil from our local natural food store.</li>
            <li>Seriously the scabbing was gone and the skin looked healthy.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and is not thick and heavy.  </li>
            <li>very soothing, softens and soothes chapped lips, lemon balm is effective against cold sores.  </li>
            <li>Works on lips, my eczema and just overall makes my hand soft!</li>
            <li>but when I do it takes about 2 weeks to heal a major pain.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing to use and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s meant for use on lips and nearby, I try to be careful not to ingest it :) ...</li>
            <li>We originally had bought the lemon balm cream called High Potency Lemon Balm and Echinacea Target from Meadowlake Farm but were not happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than other OTC products</li>
            <li>This is a past memory after I discovered this little magic.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend lemon balm tea as late at night, it relaxes you very well.</li>
            <li>Definitely stops cold sores right in their tracks, I&#x27;ve never seen something work so quickly...</li>

            <li> /&gt;I would love to see WiseWays come out with a coconut oil version of this</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use it as a chapstick and love the way it smells (and tastes).</li>
            <li> Lips feel better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this lemon balm salve, it takes the pain out of fever blisters and also makes them go away almost immediately.</li>
            <li> it is much better.  </li>
            <li> I have been using lemon balm extract for my anxiety (which works wonders) and thought I would use this for more *</li>
            <li> Within hours I was feeling better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say even better than prescription ointment.</li>
            <li> I will post more info on it once I use it to let all know how it works.</li>
            <li> Was OK, but didn&#x27;t help the problem</li>
            <li> Alleviated a lot of the pain, burning and itching.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this product.</li>
            <li> It works great, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It sure seems to stop them in their tracks, and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since buying it.  </li>
            <li> Again, I mostly just like the smell.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product will buy again!  </li>
            <li> So many products out there are garbage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within her first overnight use, she loved how her lips and the surrounding skin felt.  </li>
            <li> Gentle yet effective!</li>
            <li> The salve has a lovely strong lemon balm smell.</li>
            <li> i always use it for cuts scrapes etc- great natural remedy to use when you don&#x27;t want to use chemical laden ointments</li>
            <li> The aroma is lovely and it is so smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, always recommend products from Wiseways.</li>
            <li> This is a fine Lemon Balm salve.  </li>
            <li> I woke up this morning feeling fine and the six fever blisters are already crusting over.  </li>
            <li> Healed fever blisters more quickly than prescription drugs.  </li>
            <li> It heals rashes in only a matter of days and has been a great relief to me.</li>
            <li> Lemon Balm is great for sores, especially fever blister type.  </li>
            <li> Great seller, item was received earlier than indicated.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheap to boot.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> And at such an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I grow lemon balm in my garden, so am familiar with it and use it in herbal teas for colds and fever.</li>
            <li> I love this salve so much!</li>
            <li> The sores would be huge making my lips swollen and full of pain.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin and any sores!</li>
            <li> It is not always safe to use antibiotic ointment in tender spots or large  sections of skin; that&#x27;s not what its meant for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited because I thought it would help it go away really quickly.</li>
            <li> Works really good, wish it came in a bigger container but</li>
            <li> Compared to similar coldsore treatments (ie Lysine+ ointment, though that does not contain lemon balm) this is a good value.  </li>
            <li> Lemon balm has very healing qualities, and this salve has many uses.  </li>
            <li> and now they are super</li>
            <li> and it clears them up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like the salve heals all kinds of abrasions quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that medication should not be taken unless absolutely necessary, and lemon balm is the perfect substitute for many ailments.</li>
            <li> There are no chemicals, just old safe powerful herbs!</li>
            <li> When I started using this, I was very pleased because it actually works on your lips.</li>
            <li> Very good and safe product for the skin, check out their other products by a female owned and holistic business.</li>
            <li> I bought the Wise Ways White Pine Drawing Salve first.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!  </li>
            <li> This product does EXACTLY what it says it does!</li>
            <li> It has an oilier texture than the other, and a pleasantly lemony scent.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply over sore or itchy skin due to the nice consistency.  </li>
            <li> One correction is that the ingredients list on the bottle also includes licorice root extract, which is a powerful addition to this balm (it is not shown in the description).</li>
            <li> well it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great natural alternative that actually works.</li>
            <li> I put this on right away</li>
            <li> This lemon balm cream is very soothing and healing for any skin rashes or reactions (I am very sensitive to many products).</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to say which one helps the most, but I feel like they all help in their own way.</li>
            <li> If she happens to have an outbreak it heals super fast.</li>
            <li> After using this stuff  for about a week I quickly realized this stuff is for real.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was very fast too.</li>
            <li> Then I got this salve from Amazon and it did help with the poison ivy itching, which was very intense towards the end of the attack.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what was discribed.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more solid</li>
            <li> But here it is Friday (one week later), and it&#x27;s not any better.  </li>
            <li> but it does if you catch it at the first signs.</li>
            <li> The new larger size is nice too.</li>
            <li> I have heard that this can clear lesions in sensitive areas quickly, and it&#x27;s definitely true!</li>
            <li> not sure how good it is as yet</li>
            <li> I live the fact that this product can be used for many different reasons.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t help to much.</li>
            <li> Excellent cold sore remedy.</li>
            <li> From herpes cold sore relief to help diminish the appearance of acne, this salve is the BEST.</li>
            <li> My hands break out in a rash because I was my hands so much.  </li>
            <li> It really soothes him and the rashes he has had are almost gone.</li>
            <li> We apply this to those really troublesome areas and it defiantly helps.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> on time, thanks</li>
            <li> ointment and haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it much,</li>
            <li> so this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li> I have since bought lemon balm from Amazon since it is much cheaper</li>
            <li> I use this instead of cortisone if I get a rash and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that the lid was cracked when it arrived.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed faster healing as of yet because I don&#x27;t want to use too much of it.</li>
            <li> It smelled awesome and was very hydrating but did not work for cold sores.</li>
            <li> Even the harsh treatments from the dermatologist were not as effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for your fingers, lips and any other very dry skin area.</li>
            <li> Healed up my eczema quickly and effectively, after several other lotions did nothing!</li>
            <li> buy/make a better blend to heal your lips and use for other conditions as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> It has appears to have more lemon balm in it, even though the other one claims to have 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using it for other applications  : )</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I found it at Amazon for much less.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on my wife&#x27;s cold sores, they not only don&#x27;t last as long but the duration between outbreaks has increased greatly to almost appear cured.</li>
            <li> Works great for a tense lower back, just rub some in and relax.</li>
            <li> Most relief of all the things I have tried and doesn&#x27;t sting, keeps lips soft despite the cycle of cold sores and smells nice.</li>
            <li> (the sun will cause me to have a break out pretty easily if not careful) and this WORKS</li>
            <li> It seems reasonably priced and the ingredients look interesting, but I am not sure what to use it for at this point.</li>
            <li> My elbows get super dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> Lemon balm is wonderful for conditions such as cold sores, fever blisters, HSV, etc.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Keeps lips and skin soft!</li>
            <li> I especially use it if I can&#x27;t wait and eat something that&#x27;s too hot and burns my lips.</li>
            <li> The jar came opened and it had a huge black marker line over the bar code, like something that was defective.</li>
            <li> I know I dropped it a few times and the glass is strong too.  </li>
            <li> This is a HUGE jar in comparison to those little carmex containers.</li>
            <li> This lemon balm work great for cold sores.  </li>
            <li> and doesnt bother my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> and I have direct patient care.  </li>
            <li> WiseWays Herbals: Salves for Natural Skin Care, Lemon Balm Cream</li>
            <li> I use this at the sign of any rash and its gone with 72 hours if you catch it early.</li>
            <li> Was a complete lifesaver when my son and I contracted hand, foot and mouth disease.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist gave me a steroid cream prescription which worked early on to lessen the rash and itching.</li>
            <li> I first bought the lemon balm essential oil from our local natural food store.</li>
            <li> Seriously the scabbing was gone and the skin looked healthy.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and is not thick and heavy.  </li>
            <li> very soothing, softens and soothes chapped lips, lemon balm is effective against cold sores.  </li>
            <li> Works on lips, my eczema and just overall makes my hand soft!</li>
            <li> but when I do it takes about 2 weeks to heal a major pain.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing to use and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s meant for use on lips and nearby, I try to be careful not to ingest it :) ...</li>
            <li> We originally had bought the lemon balm cream called High Potency Lemon Balm and Echinacea Target from Meadowlake Farm but were not happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than other OTC products</li>
            <li> This is a past memory after I discovered this little magic.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend lemon balm tea as late at night, it relaxes you very well.</li>
            <li> Definitely stops cold sores right in their tracks, I&#x27;ve never seen something work so quickly...</li>
            <li> Due to a sever sunburn over the weekend I developed 6 fever blisters on lower lip yesterday.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with cold sores since early childhood and have recently been getting a lot more of them due to stress.</li>
            <li> This tub will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it all winter long and 1/3 left.</li>
            <li> sure enough, I had a cold sore in the morning.</li>
            <li> Works fast to calm and reduce swelling of cold sores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how much it helps with the cold sores, but I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin a little bit, but small price to pay to get rid of a fever blister so quickly.  </li>
            <li> In the wintertime I get very dry skin on my lower back</li>
            <li> Love this, I use it on my lips when I feel a cold sore coming on and</li>
            <li> Both of the salves are really softening for rough skin, and heal small skin breaks.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Heals minor irritations</li>
            <li> And it will definitely go a long way!</li>
            <li> I am always in search of something for my dry skin problem areas.</li>
            <li> By Tuesday, it started to dry up and flatten from the Abreva.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it makes my lips really dry.  </li>
            <li> I love it, when i have a cold sore applying this salve immediately dulls the itching.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop all cold sores but has seemed to help prevent them more then other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Will last for years with the size of jar you get &amp; only needing a very small dap for entire lips.</li>
            <li> I have been using a year and a half and only had one fever blister.</li>
            <li> and I have only used maybe half.</li>
            <li> After reading a bunch of material on this I went to the store to purchase some and quickly realized this stuff is just as expensive as abreva</li>
            <li> The container will last me ages even though I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Worked as I expected on itchy rash.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> other than that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> It also works on other rashes like razor burn and hear  rash.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly as it melts on contact with your body heat, making a little go a long way!</li>
            <li> There is nothing better for cold sores!  </li>
            <li> Next morning my blister was Almost gone and no more burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many creams for cold sores and nothing worked, until about a week ago when I got this!</li>
            <li> I used this once to get rid of some warts that would not go away with any other treatment.</li>
            <li> I deliberately exposed to myself to extra sun, too, in an effort to really test Melissa for cold sores.</li>
            <li> Sometimes even multiple cold sores when I am really stressed out.</li>
            <li> I have tried putting this goop on my three huge cold sores the past week-did it work?</li>
            <li> just a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was looking for lemon cream that would remove dark marks and scars.</li>
            <li> I broke the cap, unfortunately, and now it&#x27;s cracked, which I think is exposing it to too much air and messing with the texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small jar, but a little bit goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:1583332049 The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)]]</li>
            <li> I put it on specific areas, such as cold sores, rashes, dry spots etc.  </li>
            <li> cold sore is usually gone within a day, I also heavily use medicated chapstick from AVON, the two are a powerful combination!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need much, little bit will do.  </li>
            <li> A little dab does the job.</li>
            <li> a little lemon scent...</li>
            <li> Very soothing for cold sores.</li>
            <li> Red cold sore bump appeared last Friday, at which point I started applying Abreva throughout day.  </li>
            <li> Even used it on my horse for a few cuts/scrapes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now, and I like it.</li>
            <li> though I do plan to use it a few times a week as a preventative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applied this balm  few times during the day and at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using a prescription ointment in the past for fever blisters which calmed them down within a few days.  </li>
            <li> It worked wonders on my cold sore, however it didn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it within a few hours of the well known burning sensation.</li>
            <li> This works very well with ppl with bad rashes or irritations.</li>
            <li> I decided to try lemon balm cream instead of paying for an expensive subscription and this has helped immensely!</li>
            <li> I have not gotten a cold sore since I started using this balm in early September.  </li>
            <li> I have been applying it at night in all the areas where I usually get sores.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it had an impact or not.</li>
            <li> I feel a cold sore coming on, and this goes right on the cold sore and its gone within a few days.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this lemon balm because I seen on Dr Oz that it may help when a cold sore arises plus the healing time is cut short.</li>
            <li> Various people have told wonders about this lemon balm salve to heal their cold sores.</li>
            <li> It stopped cold sores almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always have have bought abreva cold sore medicine and paid the hefty price of 19.99 for a tiny tube of it.</li>
            <li> I started to feel tingling on my lip and saw a cold sore starting to form I put some lemon balm on it and stopped it in its tracks before it even had a chance to breakout.</li>
            <li> BecauseI caught it late, the Abreva didn&#x27;t prevent it.  </li>
            <li> A week later, applying this cream hasn&#x27;t helped at all and has made the cold sore hideous looking.  </li>
            <li> The recovery would be 9 days at least.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but I have used it now for several weeks, with at least 3 &#x27;attempted&#x27; cold sores and didn&#x27;t get a one.</li>
            <li> have found in the past that if I apply Abreva faithfully, it will definitely heal within a week and ususally doesn&#x27;t look like I have a horrible disease, and if I catch it early enought, the cold sore may not fully form.  </li>
            <li> I am taking other remedies/medications for cold sores</li>
            <li> After going through 1 1/2 of these and a few cold sores-</li>
            <li> but it is surprisingly thin</li>
            <li> but I was tired of having breakouts</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles and both of them came with broken caps.</li>
            <li> The only caveat with the salve is that it&#x27;s greasy because it has an olive oil base.</li>
            <li> I have not had  cold sore to try it on but anxious to try it when it does.</li>
            <li> This stuff works heals any cold sore or fever blister of any type usually under 48hrs and seems to prevent outbreaks</li>
            <li> BUT, before that stupid mistake, I absolutely have nothing bad to say about this.</li>
            <li> Bought this to have on-hand when my next cold sore hits; I read about it online in the middle of a horrible cold sore</li>
            <li> I use to get at least four cold sores a year</li>
            <li> Eh, unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Of course, I was so hoping that it shorten healing time on my cold sore, but instead I think it made things worse.</li>
            <li> In fact, it looks worse!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a weird flavor or smell.  </li>
            <li> The cold sore will be very small and heal within 3 days!</li>
            <li> My lips were in terrible shape and I was disappointed that this didn&#x27;t really seem to help.</li>
            <li> I got this for cold sores .</li>
            <li> Bought it for cold sore purposes after reading alot about it</li>
            <li> put it on cold sores when I get them and it feels comforting to add it on.</li>
            <li> I still have my cold</li>
            <li> I thought I had a cold sore coming</li>
            <li> Have also applied it on my lip when I feel the tingle of a cold sore.  </li>
            <li> This did not help with cold sores at all.  </li>
            <li> I discovered lemon balm after searching the internet for cold sore relief.</li>
            <li> Now I have something for my son when he gets cold sores.</li>
            <li> I got a cold sore on the tip of my nose</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who suffers from fever blisters.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my fridge to use on my cold sores when I get them.</li>
            <li> I put this on my lips after being in the sun, which is what triggers cold sores for me.  </li>
            <li> I was doing some research on home remedies for cold sores and I stumbled upon lemon balm.</li>
            <li> It evens stops cold cores when you start to feel one coming on.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any one that suffers from cold sores.</li>
            <li> I have been getting cold sores since being a toddler.</li>
            <li> If you are a cold sore sufferer like me you know when you feel that tingle a sore is on</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way, and if I apply this as soon as I feel the tingle it seems to stop the cold sore in it&#x27;s tracks.  </li>
            <li> My wife tried this on a cold sore that just started developing and it did nothing for her,  </li>
            <li> (Bought for cold sore prevention).</li>
            <li> it is preventative cold sore measure</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very expensive, so I recommend this to anyone who suffers from fever blisters to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Just apply a very thin layer to skin that gets covered by clothing!</li>
            <li> I wanted it to work so badly too.</li>
            <li> My son is 7 and has really bad eczema.</li>
            <li> If you get these painful things buy this and keep it with you at all times.</li>
            <li> They hurt and they look awful.  </li>
            <li> When they show up she&#x27;s miserable</li>
            <li> My cold sore was gone and healed!!!!</li>
            <li> So, I am walking around work looking horrific!!!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I had the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as effective as described</li>
            <li> Good balm!! Great scent</li>
            <li> In the wintertime I get very dry skin on my lower back and sometimes the chafing can turn into rashes. I decided to try lemon balm cream instead of paying for an expensive subscription and this has helped immensely! It heals rashes in only a matter of days and has been a great relief to me.</li>
            <li> I live the fact that this product can be used for many different reasons. Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> works great on skin abrashions and smells great, goes on smooth and not sticky, great price..took about a month however to get the item, but customer service was very nice and on top of it.</li>
            <li> Lemon Balm is great for sores, especially fever blister type.  This is a fine Lemon Balm salve.  Apply it to any sore or lesion to help heal.  It smells great, of course, because it is lemon balm.  Lemon Balm is NOT LEMON (like the yellow fruit).  It is from an herb bush.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with lemon balm plant for many things.</li>
            <li> it smells pleasant :) and i use it occasionally. it works well for its purpose.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on my wife&#x27;s cold sores, they not only don&#x27;t last as long but the duration between outbreaks has increased greatly to almost appear cured.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy i found this. Works for folliculitis better a corticosteroid cream. I don&#x27;t know how- it&#x27;s like pixie dust or something.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Works great for a tense lower back, just rub some in and relax. WiseWays Herbals seems legit.  I like the packaging, the lid is nice and sturdy. I know I dropped it a few times and the glass is strong too.  Very nice and calming salve, I&#x27;d say this has some aromatic effects.  It is a bit oily so you don&#x27;t need much, little bit will do.  It&#x27;s olive oil extracts so that&#x27;s what makes it oily. Despite what one review said about it being just like \\&quot;antibiotic ointment\\&quot; they are dissimilar.  It is not always safe to use antibiotic ointment in tender spots or large  sections of skin; that&#x27;s not what its meant for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see WiseWays come out with a coconut oil version of this, that would be magic.&lt;br /&gt;  [[ASIN:1583332049 The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)]]</li>
            <li> I got this for cold sores . I heard lemon balm works great for them. After going through 1 1/2 of these and a few cold sores- I&#x27;m relising it doesn&#x27;t help to much. I will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on a number of things. Razor burn, heat rash, chapped lips, bites, etc. Wonderful product!! Even used it on my horse for a few cuts/scrapes. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Bought it for cold sore purposes after reading alot about it but it didnt do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Great balm for any skin problem. Excellent ingredients and doesnt bother my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for cold sores. Most relief of all the things I have tried and doesn&#x27;t sting, keeps lips soft despite the cycle of cold sores and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Works great for outbreaks</li>
            <li> It works awesome ive been buying it for years now and reduces the duration of fever blisters awesome product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for fever blisters so I can&#x27;t speak on that. I am always in search of something for my dry skin problem areas. My elbows get super dry in the winter. I went to sleep with some on my elbows and was amazed at the difference the next morning. I put it on again the next morning and now they are super soft.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest impression this stuff made with me was when I put it on two chemical burns on my face (lactic acid peel). I could not believe the healing that took place the next morning. Seriously the scabbing was gone and the skin looked healthy. I used it again the next day under my makeup. This stuff knocked off about a week of recovery time.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with fever blisters/cold sores for 40 years and counting. I was skeptical about this product, but I have used it now for several weeks, with at least 3 &#x27;attempted&#x27; cold sores and didn&#x27;t get a one. I&#x27;m sold. One correction is that the ingredients list on the bottle also includes licorice root extract, which is a powerful addition to this balm (it is not shown in the description). I don&#x27;t think you can get/buy/make a better blend to heal your lips and use for other conditions as others have mentioned. The 2 ounce size is plenty and I divided it into several smaller jars to have it everywhere I need it (work, home, traveling).  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I feel a cold sore coming on, and this goes right on the cold sore and its gone within a few days.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for your lips. Excellent cold sore remedy. Smells a bit like a citronella candle, but not overpowering. This is a HUGE jar in comparison to those little carmex containers. Put some in a smaller container if you plan on carrying it around with you.</li>
            <li> Wow! It really works!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. VERY effective! I deliberately exposed to myself to extra sun, too, in an effort to really test Melissa for cold sores. (the sun will cause me to have a break out pretty easily if not careful) and this WORKS so well! No problems, not one. I am so happy about this!</li>
            <li> Works well for rashes &amp; has helped with fungle skin infections, definitely a good remedy to have.</li>
            <li> From herpes cold sore relief to help diminish the appearance of acne, this salve is the BEST.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome i always use it for cuts scrapes etc- great natural remedy to use when you don&#x27;t want to use chemical laden ointments</li>
            <li> Great seller, item was received earlier than indicated. It is exactly what was discribed. I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought the Wise Ways White Pine Drawing Salve first. It was wonderful! When I ran out of it, I decided to get the Lemon Balm Cream.  It has an oilier texture than the other, and a pleasantly lemony scent. I grow lemon balm in my garden, so am familiar with it and use it in herbal teas for colds and fever. Both of the salves are really softening for rough skin, and heal small skin breaks. Very soothing to use and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I will not use any type of salve, or ointment that is in a jar without a seal and this one came without one. I called WiseWays company, and was told that they do put seal covers on all of their products.  Therefore, I had to return the item to the sender, who was not WiseWays, and get a refund.</li>
            <li> This lemon balm work great for cold sores.  Put it on immediately and it clears them up quickly.  Nothing work better--and I have tried almost everything including prescription drugs.</li>
            <li> I love this salve so much! I use it as a chapstick and love the way it smells (and tastes). The container will last me ages even though I use it everyday. Lips feel better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on cold sores when I get them and it feels comforting to add it on. I am taking other remedies/medications for cold sores so it&#x27;s hard to say which one helps the most, but I feel like they all help in their own way.</li>
            <li> My hands break out in a rash because I was my hands so much.  I work in a hospital and I have direct patient care.  Washing my hands is critical.  This salve makes the itchy prickly feeling go away in contact.  The rash goes away by end of the day.  I use this all day , every day.</li>
            <li> Eh, unfortunately it did not work for me. I wanted it to work so badly too. No improvements in healing time whatsoever. I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s done though.</li>
            <li> I love this lemon balm salve, it takes the pain out of fever blisters and also makes them go away almost immediately. Thank you so much !! :D</li>
            <li> Helps make healing a speedy recovery, works amazingly fast &amp; smells wonderful! no complaints! it&#x27;s been my lifesaver-helping with pain too ^.^</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this lemon balm because I seen on Dr Oz that it may help when a cold sore arises plus the healing time is cut short. I have not had  cold sore to try it on but anxious to try it when it does.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, soothing on cuts and abrasions.  I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now, and I like it.</li>
            <li> We originally had bought the lemon balm cream called High Potency Lemon Balm and Echinacea Target from Meadowlake Farm but were not happy with it.  So we found this one and it is much better.  It has appears to have more lemon balm in it, even though the other one claims to have 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this one smells nice and seemed to help the rash from the shingles.</li>
            <li> Various people have told wonders about this lemon balm salve to heal their cold sores. I have tried putting this goop on my three huge cold sores the past week-did it work? I still have my cold sores- oh well it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughters eczema flare ups on her neck! Soothes it perfectly! A little goes a long way! I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product offering the true benefits from Lemon Balm. I use it in a tea and just scoop some in, which is why I like this balm. It can me used in multiple applications and you&#x27;ll still receive the benefit. I like this Lemon Balm.</li>
            <li> Works really good, wish it came in a bigger container but other than that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for your fingers, lips and any other very dry skin area. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! I have not gotten a cold sore since I started using this balm in early September.  When it&#x27;s gone...I will definitely be ordering more!  Great anti-bacterial!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream to help my with his rashes. It really soothes him and the rashes he has had are almost gone.</li>
            <li> works well. I thought I had a cold sore coming so I put some on my lip. It never came.</li>
            <li> My son is 7 and has really bad eczema. We apply this to those really troublesome areas and it defiantly helps. Its got a pleasant smell and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This product does EXACTLY what it says it does! And it&#x27;s cheap to boot. Smells really good and just a small amount goes a long way. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> WiseWays Herbals: Salves for Natural Skin Care, Lemon Balm Cream 2 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like this product, it&#x27;s the second time I order it and like it. Great for many things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came on time, thanks</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I have been using lemon balm extract for my anxiety (which works wonders) and thought I would use this for more *ahem* personal problems. I have heard that this can clear lesions in sensitive areas quickly, and it&#x27;s definitely true! Within hours I was feeling better. I will continue to use lemon balm for anything I can for the rest of my life. I am a firm believer that medication should not be taken unless absolutely necessary, and lemon balm is the perfect substitute for many ailments. And at such an amazing price! It&#x27;s a small jar, but a little bit goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> Works on lips, my eczema and just overall makes my hand soft! Will be ordering more soon, for my nephew!</li>
            <li> I use this at the sign of any rash and its gone with 72 hours if you catch it early. Love it and it smells nice</li>
            <li> THIS IS A CONCENTRATED SALVE. Use sparingly! It has a very strong lemon balm smell and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the quality of this product. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Compared to similar coldsore treatments (ie Lysine+ ointment, though that does not contain lemon balm) this is a good value.  A little goes a long way.  I do wish that the label gave the amount of lemon balm contained, but I would expect the company to provide that if asked.  Lemon balm is wonderful for conditions such as cold sores, fever blisters, HSV, etc.  I ordered this when I was low on Lysine+ ointment and haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it much, though I do plan to use it a few times a week as a preventative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: this is NOT a cream.  It is an ointment or salve as indicated in the picture.</li>
            <li> 4.5 stars work great. I&#x27;d say even better than prescription ointment. I will but again and again and again lol.</li>
            <li> The jar came opened and it had a huge black marker line over the bar code, like something that was defective.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply over sore or itchy skin due to the nice consistency.  Worked as I expected on itchy rash.  Have also applied it on my lip when I feel the tingle of a cold sore.  Seemed to stop the progression or it was a coincidence but I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  Good to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin and any sores! Healed up my eczema quickly and effectively, after several other lotions did nothing! Highly recommend to anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and is not thick and heavy.  A little dab does the job. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr Oz, but have not used it yet. I will post more info on it once I use it to let all know how it works.</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered this product. It is wonderful, soothing and healing</li>
            <li> My lips were in terrible shape and I was disappointed that this didn&#x27;t really seem to help.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz so I ordered it. I have been using a year and a half and only had one fever blister. I used to get them all the time so this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> I was looking for lemon cream that would remove dark marks and scars.</li>
            <li> I started using this to try and keep fever blisters at bay.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face/lips for 3 months.  No fever blisters yet!  (knock on wood.)  Smells nice, feels good.  Also seems to work on itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I have had fever blisters on and off all my life.  I have tried everything. They hurt and they look awful.  Due to a sever sunburn over the weekend I developed 6 fever blisters on lower lip yesterday. Anyone who has fever blisters knows what they felt like. I had heard of lemon salve on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show and had bought some several months ago. I even went home from work with a fever and felt like I had the flu. I woke up this morning feeling fine and the six fever blisters are already crusting over.  This stuff really works. If you get these painful things buy this and keep it with you at all times.</li>
            <li> It stopped cold sores almost instantly. Much cheaper than other OTC products and it smell good too! It also works on other rashes like razor burn and hear  rash. Great all around salve to keep around.</li>
            <li> Was OK, but didn&#x27;t help the problem</li>
            <li> Good price, good product,  fast delivery</li>
            <li> My partner has been suffering from fever blisters all the years I&#x27;ve known her.  When they show up she&#x27;s miserable and she&#x27;s tried all sorts of OTC products.  I was watching a Dr. Oz who mentioned lemon balm as a great alternative to over the counter stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within her first overnight use, she loved how her lips and the surrounding skin felt.  She uses it daily to prevent outbreaks.  If she happens to have an outbreak it heals super fast.</li>
            <li> This did not help with cold sores at all.  It smelled awesome and was very hydrating but did not work for cold sores.</li>
            <li> Lovely cream!!!!  Just received it so not sure how good it is as yet, however, had a skin rash yesterday and used it .......the itching stopped, the redness went away and it smells good  : )  Looking forward to using it for other applications  : )</li>
            <li> Works great for a lot of issues. Was a complete lifesaver when my son and I contracted hand, foot and mouth disease. Alleviated a lot of the pain, burning and itching.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more solid but it is surprisingly thin but it works amazingly and smells good wonderful product</li>
            <li> This lemon balm cream is very soothing and healing for any skin rashes or reactions (I am very sensitive to many products). Use sparingly as it melts on contact with your body heat, making a little go a long way!</li>
            <li> Definitely stops cold sores right in their tracks, I&#x27;ve never seen something work so quickly... though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s meant for use on lips and nearby, I try to be careful not to ingest it :) ... cold sore is usually gone within a day, I also heavily use medicated chapstick from AVON, the two are a powerful combination!</li>
            <li> Love this. Good energy. Good quality!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, always recommend products from Wiseways. Stronger Lemon Balm content than others ive purchased.</li>
            <li> I love it. I broke the cap, unfortunately, and now it&#x27;s cracked, which I think is exposing it to too much air and messing with the texture. BUT, before that stupid mistake, I absolutely have nothing bad to say about this.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better for cold sores!  I discovered lemon balm after searching the internet for cold sore relief. I have suffered with cold sores since early childhood and have recently been getting a lot more of them due to stress. I first bought the lemon balm essential oil from our local natural food store. It worked wonders on my cold sore, however it didn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I came across this and ordered it. I have been applying it at night in all the areas where I usually get sores. One night last week I forgot to apply it and sure enough, I had a cold sore in the morning. I put this on right away and the next day the sore was gone. Last night I had one starting to come up, so before I went to bed, I applied this and it never materialized! This stuff is worth the price and it goes a long way. It has a pleasant smell. I am so happy I found this. Now I have something for my son when he gets cold sores. I am so thankful that he will not have to suffer the way I did growing up! I have told everyone I know about this because I am so amazed. Abreva never worked for me and prescriptions were a joke too. Thank you so much for this wonderful product! The shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li> I got a cold sore on the tip of my nose and I found this stuff about 7 days in. It moisturized the blister but I&#x27;m not sure if it had an impact or not.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing Dr. Oz talk about how it works well on fever blisters.  I have been using a prescription ointment in the past for fever blisters which calmed them down within a few days.  But I have to say, the last fever blister I felt coming in was GONE the next day after putting this on it before I went to bed!  I am amazed and SOOO HAPPY to have found this as it worked so well!  It did dry out my skin a little bit, but small price to pay to get rid of a fever blister so quickly.  It isn&#x27;t very expensive, so I recommend this to anyone who suffers from fever blisters to give it a try.  Hopefully you will see the results I did.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very fast too.</li>
            <li> Works great and will order again. Very happy with this product it has everything recommended for my GHSV1 in one container. No skin irritation as I was worried about that. Smells good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this balm several months ago, did not have  a chance to use till yesterday. I had burning sensation in lower lip and beginning of blister. Applied this balm  few times during the day and at night. Next morning my blister was Almost gone and no more burning. This is great, better than any  OTC stuff or prescription medicine. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> very soothing, softens and soothes chapped lips, lemon balm is effective against cold sores.  my favorite winter lip balm!  pleasant mild taste too.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many creams for cold sores and nothing worked, until about a week ago when I got this! It works great, and I highly recommend it! (:</li>
            <li> Great!!! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a good salve! I use it this for skin rashes and scrapes. It smells nice...a little lemon scent...nothing overbearing! I use for my kids and myself! Gentle yet effective!</li>
            <li> Healed fever blisters more quickly than prescription drugs.  Fantastic product.  I would recommend it for anyone who suffers from fever blisters.</li>
            <li> This cream worked well to get rid of a rash that nothing else worked on. Smells good, too! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing Dr. Oz talk about it on his show. I keep it in my fridge to use on my cold sores when I get them. I&#x27;m not really sure how much it helps with the cold sores, but I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Wonderful salve. Works fast to calm and reduce swelling of cold sores. And it will definitely go a long way!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Heals minor irritations</li>
            <li> I love it! Feels great on my lips. The taste and smell is also good. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff works heals any cold sore or fever blister of any type usually under 48hrs and seems to prevent outbreaks</li>
            <li> I put this on my lips after being in the sun, which is what triggers cold sores for me.  It sure seems to stop them in their tracks, and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since buying it.  Obviously I am thrilled with it!  This tub will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Very good and safe product for the skin, check out their other products by a female owned and holistic business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always have have bought abreva cold sore medicine and paid the hefty price of 19.99 for a tiny tube of it. I was doing some research on home remedies for cold sores and I stumbled upon lemon balm. After reading a bunch of material on this I went to the store to purchase some and quickly realized this stuff is just as expensive as abreva but I was tired of having breakouts so I bought it anyways.  I don&#x27;t have breakouts to often but when I do it takes about 2 weeks to heal a major pain.  After using this stuff  for about a week I quickly realized this stuff is for real.  My cold sore was gone and healed!!!! It evens stops cold cores when you start to feel one coming on. I started to feel tingling on my lip and saw a cold sore starting to form I put some lemon balm on it and stopped it in its tracks before it even had a chance to breakout. I would recommend this to any one that suffers from cold sores. I have since bought lemon balm from Amazon since it is much cheaper then the store and the 2oz will last you for awhile. I have had the same container for the last six months and I have only used maybe half. I even use it just for maintenance and I have not had a break out in 6 months and counting. I will continue to buy this well worth it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles and both of them came with broken caps.</li>
            <li> The consistency is somewhat like frosting, and it smells amazing. I use this instead of cortisone if I get a rash and it works really well. Again, I mostly just like the smell.</li>
            <li> Used this for cracked and peeling lips and didn&#x27;t notice that it makes a difference. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I used this for poison ivy. The dermatologist gave me a steroid cream prescription which worked early on to lessen the rash and itching. I found out about lemon balm on the internet a week or so later. Then I got this salve from Amazon and it did help with the poison ivy itching, which was very intense towards the end of the attack. The salve has a lovely strong lemon balm smell. The only caveat with the salve is that it&#x27;s greasy because it has an olive oil base. Just apply a very thin layer to skin that gets covered by clothing!</li>
            <li> Lemon balm has very healing qualities, and this salve has many uses.  I put it on specific areas, such as cold sores, rashes, dry spots etc.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This balm was recommended on a skin care site so I&#x27;m glad I found it at Amazon for much less. The aroma is lovely and it is so smooth on skin. It remains on the surface a bit, but it does its healing powers.</li>
            <li> Of course, I was so hoping that it shorten healing time on my cold sore, but instead I think it made things worse. Red cold sore bump appeared last Friday, at which point I started applying Abreva throughout day.  BecauseI caught it late, the Abreva didn&#x27;t prevent it.  By Tuesday, it started to dry up and flatten from the Abreva.  It was on Tuesday night that the Lemon Balm Cream arrived.  I was so excited because I thought it would help it go away really quickly. I&#x27;ve been applying it constantly.  But here it is Friday (one week later), and it&#x27;s not any better.  In fact, it looks worse!  So, I am walking around work looking horrific!!!  I can tell people can&#x27;t take their eyes off of it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found in the past that if I apply Abreva faithfully, it will definitely heal within a week and ususally doesn&#x27;t look like I have a horrible disease, and if I catch it early enought, the cold sore may not fully form.  A week later, applying this cream hasn&#x27;t helped at all and has made the cold sore hideous looking.  Plus, it makes my lips really dry.  It seems reasonably priced and the ingredients look interesting, but I am not sure what to use it for at this point.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that the lid was cracked when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product will buy again!  Watch putting on lips as it drys out rather than moisturizes</li>
            <li> This product works really well. I use it for irritation to the skin from shaving. It helps keep razor bumps from forming and also keeps the area from itching ... (Bikini and underarm).. It has a nice scent (lemon) . I have since incorporated tea tree oil and aloe Vera gel and those work well also. The tea tree oil has a very strong scent though. In would recommend this product to others (lemon balm).</li>
            <li> I have been getting cold sores since being a toddler. Sometimes even multiple cold sores when I am really stressed out. The sores would be huge making my lips swollen and full of pain. The recovery would be 9 days at least. This is a past memory after I discovered this little magic. I usually apply it within a few hours of the well known burning sensation. The cold sore will be very small and heal within 3 days! There are no chemicals, just old safe powerful herbs!</li>
            <li> Love this, I use it on my lips when I feel a cold sore coming on and it never comes.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this not believing it would work but it does if you catch it at the first signs.</li>
            <li> Bought this to have on-hand when my next cold sore hits; I read about it online in the middle of a horrible cold sore I had recently.</li>
            <li> This is good to use for lip gloss!  Keeps lips and skin soft!</li>
            <li> I use to get at least four cold sores a year and since i purchased this over a year ago I have not had one. If you are a cold sore sufferer like me you know when you feel that tingle a sore is on it&#x27;s way, and if I apply this as soon as I feel the tingle it seems to stop the cold sore in it&#x27;s tracks.  My wife tried this on a cold sore that just started developing and it did nothing for her,  so I think the key is to apply this as soon as you feel one coming..</li>
            <li> This does seem to help but has a very strong lemon flavor. (Bought for cold sore prevention). Doesn&#x27;t stop all cold sores but has seemed to help prevent them more then other products I&#x27;ve tried. Will last for years with the size of jar you get &amp; only needing a very small dap for entire lips.</li>
            <li> I love it, when i have a cold sore applying this salve immediately dulls the itching. I haven&#x27;t noticed faster healing as of yet because I don&#x27;t want to use too much of it.</li>
            <li> This works very well with ppl with bad rashes or irritations. Gives you relief sometimes over night. Good for those with Herpes Virus also. Seen this on Dr Oz and guest who didn&#x27;t have Heath insurance suggested this product to heal a outbreak. Smells very good n fresh like lemon. Only problem is .... jar size is pretty small. Try n get larger one. Trust me works very good.</li>
            <li> I like the salve heals all kinds of abrasions quickly. The new larger size is nice too. Great product and good price.</li>
            <li> I use it as lip balm per Dr. OZ it is preventative cold sore measure &amp; I had the worst.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells nice while it works well on rashes and bites.</li>
            <li> So many products out there are garbage. When I started using this, I was very pleased because it actually works on your lips. I especially use it if I can&#x27;t wait and eat something that&#x27;s too hot and burns my lips. I also use it from time to time on the inside of my nostrils as the winter season starts drying me out. I also highly recommend lemon balm tea as late at night, it relaxes you very well. Lemon balm is an amazing herb. Believe it or not I am allergic to lemons themselves, but lemon balm has nothing to do with lemons and the tea tastes like tea with lemon! Bonus!</li>
            <li> great for my fever blisters</li>
            <li> I used this once to get rid of some warts that would not go away with any other treatment. Even the harsh treatments from the dermatologist were not as effective. I now keep this on hand to use for any and all skin irritations and rashes. Works great. It&#x27;s a great natural alternative that actually works.</li>
            <li> This balm is heaven sent.  It soothes, moisturizes and helps heal lips.  Plan on stocking up. It definitely helps that there is no petroleum in the balm.  It doesn&#x27;t have a weird flavor or smell.  I&#x27;ve used it all winter long and 1/3 left.</li>
