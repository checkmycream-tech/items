            <li>I wish about 4 inches longer, and it&#x27;d be perfect!  </li>

            <li>It holds soap really good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for about 6 months.</li>
            <li>so I ordered two of these since the price was so good.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;back brush&amp;#34;  is used on all the areas of my body I can reach, and that to good effect.  </li>
            <li>This brush is a good one.</li>
            <li>good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I named him \\&quot;Eaty\\&quot; because he loved eating.  </li>
            <li>This is a reasonably attractive, nice looking, and nice-feeling brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for a good while now</li>
            <li>and it still is in as good a quality now, as the day it arrived.</li>
            <li>, the brush seems to be good quality.</li>

            <li>This was a good deal.  </li>
            <li>This brush is of good construction but the bristles are to ridged.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good for exfoliating.</li>

            <li>Good product, good seller, good price.</li>
            <li>So I searched Amazon&#x27;s reviews for the perfect brush and this one IS The Perfect Back</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now one happy clean backed camper!</li>
            <li>I wouldnt be able to get to on my own!</li>
            <li>I love this brush !  </li>
            <li>A magical leprechaun appeared before me!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I might have preferred stiffer bristles but, this is a great brush that is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>This brush is a nice addition to the shower.</li>
            <li>I really liked it until it rusted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for your legs because it exfoliates and leaves your skin smooth and crack free.</li>
            <li>Would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li>Nice for putting lotion on at end of shower</li>
            <li>I actually liked this brush.</li>
            <li>I got this for our tub and its great has a feature on the back for a massage best buy</li>
            <li>This works really nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush but my handle cracked.</li>
            <li>Would be nice to have that added length</li>
            <li>Since I do not get reimbursed it is the best value now on Amazon, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Ideally, I&#x27;d prefer a little softer bristles, but it is wonderful to have.</li>
            <li>it rinses out very easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and took a chance because I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m fine with it because I tell myself it must be doing a really good job of scrubbing off dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and has a good grip.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right and the reach on them is great.</li>
            <li>Attractive appearance, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>Pretty in the shower and works great.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, it was not too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I liked this brush, it was convient for the length and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has a nice curve on the end which makes it an easy reach.</li>
            <li>and it is effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Item was received quickly and is good shape.  </li>
            <li>and it is perfect for scratching your back ass well.</li>
            <li>Still at this price I would gladly buy another.</li>
            <li>Better to buy one in person.  </li>
            <li>I love Olaplex..</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better-</li>
            <li>ok enough..lol</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This brush would work okay for cleaning the whitewalls on your car tires though.</li>
            <li>my back is very happy.</li>
            <li>Will continue looking for something better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Maybe would be OK for a bath, but not a shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>had a better grip</li>
            <li>I have to make sure</li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li>It gets the job done well, and isn&#x27;t over priced like so many of the &amp;#34;prettier&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with the purchase and use.</li>
            <li>This back brush is just perfect.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; handle brush is perfect in every way - for a short person.</li>
            <li>My back was permanently sprained in 2005 and this is just perfect for cleaining it where I cannot reach without reinjuring it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are still and will surly remove the top layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>But I love them for showering.</li>
            <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for most.</li>
            <li>This is much better than what it was replacing...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;d be even better if:&lt;br /&gt;1)  </li>
            <li>The head were angled to allow for better scrubbing leverage and&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>I would like it to be longer, but most of these are 14 inches.</li>
            <li>They love to use it when they take their showers.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the shape.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a better value than those sold in box stores.</li>
            <li>One of the best back brushes I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>you have to go from the top and</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful accessory for people who have issues with stiffness in the arms and upper body.</li>
            <li>However, it does get the the job done for the most part.</li>
            <li>WE were meant for more than that.</li>
            <li>The handle fits well and the length is just right, offering good control when being used.  </li>
            <li>Easy grip handle on this brush which makes it easy for effective body scrubbing.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect so far has not fallen apart and is doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and for the price, its a good buy.  </li>
            <li>This is a good brush, it does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>but overall, the brush is very good &amp; I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>This is some kind of lucite/plastic, which is sweet for keeping clean, but SLIPPERY as heck!  </li>
            <li>Great price and all is well so far!</li>
            <li>Overall this is a very good product for the price...</li>
            <li>very good job on my back.</li>
            <li>I think it works well and feels great on skin, rinses clear so no residue.  </li>
            <li>: the brush will NOT return to your hand on its own, no matter how authoritatively you command it.</li>
            <li>And unlike the wood-and-boar&#x27;s-hair brushes that are so popular right now, it&#x27;s not at risk of getting moldy or coming unglued.</li>
            <li>I share other peoples feeling that this product would be almost perfect if the handle was about 4 inches longer.  </li>
            <li>It is durable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>There are textured handle grooves that make it fairly easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>EASY TO USE BY DISABLE SENIOR.</li>
            <li>anyway I am glad I have it because it is a great brush for my back.</li>
            <li>it is easy to misplace.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The ribbon hangs on my shower handle easily.  </li>
            <li>This brush is easy to handle...</li>
            <li>Decent product, good for cleaning as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably exactly what you expect.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a sturdy grade of plastic, bristles give a good scrubbing but not painful, handle</li>
            <li>I good brush for decent price.</li>
            <li>The handle needs to be just a bit longer, and it would be perfect, but other than that, its fine.</li>
            <li>I was using this brush to scrub my back and it felt really nice, and then the most amazing thing happened.  </li>
            <li>My first wish was for my own velociraptor.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed some CLR and it look as good as new.</li>
            <li>and it has been as good as new after months of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had one with a thicker grip that would slip out of your hand, but rinse the soap off the handle before tou use and its fine.</li>
            <li>It is fine, but if you step on it, it may break.  </li>
            <li>The brush is fine except that I would prefer that the handle be about 2\\</li>
            <li>It lathered up just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Fine quality, just fine ---  </li>
            <li>The grip is just fine.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels fine.</li>
            <li>I like this little bath brush a lot, it arrived on time in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, after a couple more uses, the bristles became soft.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy it - so does my skin.</li>
            <li>is great for getting to the spots on your back</li>
            <li>Bristles are too scratchy and handle is too smooth can slip out of my hand.</li>
            <li>The brush part was great but the wood deteriorated in the shower over a short period of time with mildew and just falling apart.  </li>
            <li>Supper cheap.  </li>
            <li>However, it is easy to rinse off and keep clean, and doesn&#x27;t crack or mold like wooden/bristle bath brushes do in the humid environment of a shower.</li>
            <li>but it is clearly a light purple.  </li>
            <li>Great brush to apply Nair to my back.</li>
            <li>This is great at exfoliating the back during showers!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cheap shower brush, so expectations have been met.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was cheap, but in this case I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>But I found it to be great on my back.  </li>
            <li>The handle seems to be a comfortable length for me.  </li>
            <li>Its great for reaching unreachable parts of your back!</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t fit the bill for length or durability.</li>
            <li>It is on the cheap side</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>this brush is comfortable to hold .</li>
            <li>I find the handle a bit to light weight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Purchased 4 full years ago and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>This one was very reasonably priced and has done a great job so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, easy to grasp, won&#x27;t deteriorate like wood, &amp; the bristles do the job of cleaning &amp; making my back feel good, cheaply.</li>
            <li>If you want to feel clean and have smooth skin, then this is the scrubber for you.</li>
            <li>Great and long handle a plus</li>
            <li>You know your skin comes out really clean</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my Retriever.</li>
            <li>It came with a short looped cord or add your own longer one to put your fingers through for a better grip.  </li>
            <li>Oh well; maybe I can use the brush to clean the shower -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this to the mechanics to clean the trucks.</li>
            <li>We purchased this to clean the dogs.</li>
            <li>I CAN NOT GET 100% CLEAN</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic handle stays clean unlike some wood handled brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special that you can&#x27;t get in any drug store, but it arrived quickly and was just as cheap (even with shipping) as those you can buy in store.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and easy to manipulate, as well as having very soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting my back good and clean with this.</li>
            <li>okay, seriously NOT acceptable!</li>
            <li>This is also a good thing, since I&#x27;ve had a wooden handle with a rubberized handle cover that rotted under the cover after a month or two.  </li>
            <li>and this brush makes my skin so soft and nice.</li>
            <li>It has been used gently and hung safely when not in use.  </li>
            <li>This is a good brush...stiff enough to do the job without peeling skin.  </li>
            <li>nice bristle quality; scrubby &amp; not too soft.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say really.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot guarantee that you will have the same experience as me, but even if you do not this is still a good shower brush.  </li>
            <li>What is interesting is, I wasn&#x27;t applying that much pressure to the brush when it broke.</li>
            <li>Like the color clear and nice.  </li>
            <li>Might be good as a back scratcher but not for cleansing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already recruited a sidekick (The Grizzly Bar, a heroic, furry bar of soap), and I&#x27;m interviewing potential nemeses on Tuesday.</li>
            <li>She wanted something that also scratches her back effectively and this serves that purpose as well.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect and easy to use because of</li>
            <li>I bought another and its great for the other parts of the body...</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.    </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several back brushes over the years, and none of them has been perfect.</li>
            <li>but they do mildew quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, it is adequate in terms of price:quality ratio.</li>
            <li>My husband has cut the handle down and used a bandsaw to cut some notches in the handle to allow one to hang on to it with soapy hands - works great now.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money and the massage side feels great on my back and the brush side is great for scrubbing those hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li>Worked just great until the brush snapped in half after about 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li>But considering that this model costed noticeably less than those with longer handles, I still think it was a great deal and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>This brush fulfilled my needs at a reasonable price with very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Bristles are very sturdy and strong</li>
            <li>Six bucks, it&#x27;s at the house and ready to go... VERSUS walking out to shop for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent !!</li>
            <li>THIS is a great little Amazon deal.</li>
            <li>its ok, it would be a lot better if their were some kind of anti-slip bumps on the handle, its very hard to hold on to with soap on your hands</li>
            <li>I kept re-soaping the brush and ended up using twice as much because the soap literally dies in these cheap bristles.</li>
            <li>It hurts my back, but it&#x27;s amazing for my feet.</li>
            <li>I love the one piece plastic handle its comfortable to hold and not slippery like the wooden one gets when soapy.</li>
            <li>Albeit a bit rough on your back, it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>My old one had a textured handle - much better.</li>
            <li>I ordered this bath brush for my father and the size is ok, but the color I thought was supposed to be clear</li>
            <li>Nice exfoliant for back, heels, elbows and legs.</li>
            <li>I got this one because I wanted something softer for more frequent use and this works well.</li>
            <li>Not your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li>Makes a nice back scratcher.</li>
            <li>This item works as advertised, however it gets mildew ridden pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to find the company that made the original brush that was so much nicer.</li>
            <li>The hendle could be three inches longer but other than that it works good.</li>
            <li>Got this for my guy because he wanted to be able to wash his back in the shower but hasn&#x27;t been able to find a brush that&#x27;s not hard and scratchy.  </li>
            <li>I found it was just right for me.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right.  </li>
            <li>Hits all the right spots.</li>
            <li>Broke right at handle.</li>
            <li>I have found that if I squirt liquid soap right on the brush my hands don&#x27;t get slippery and holding the brush is no problem.</li>
            <li>Depending on what your needs for a bath brush are, this product may or may not be right for you.  </li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really get in there to clean them out.  </li>
            <li>Nice long handle..reaches where I need it and beyond.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how good of an exfoliating job this brush does, but it certainly does a good job of scratching up my back.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect brush for both scrubbing and scratching without being too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li>Nylon is preferred because natural bristles seem to get mildewed easily.</li>
            <li>Works great, not too rough and not too soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft, not even good for back scratching!</li>
            <li>We leave the brush in the shower, and it seems to dry nicely each day without leaving a moldy smell.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for reaching your back in the shower and other hard to reach places, provided you like a good scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would have liked one with a harder brush.</li>
            <li>I needed a bath brush to replace the many that I have bought recently.  </li>
            <li>but who checks the shower for pretty stuff?</li>
            <li>I felt like i was removing the top layer of skin and, once again, the handle is just too short.  </li>
            <li>would hope it would last more then ONE use.</li>
            <li>This is the first plastic one I have used.  </li>
            <li>Short handle and worked okay, but the rapid molding turned me off.</li>
            <li>the first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>Works better as a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>Better for scrubbing toes and elbows than your back--</li>
            <li>I purchased this exact brush at a Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>The first inexpensive shower brush that I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t feel like I was mauling myself with a joshua tree.</li>
            <li>This is my first bath brush and it does the trick.....</li>
            <li>it is ok, but the handle is too short.</li>
            <li>Not my first experience with the product and this vendor.</li>
            <li>He said, &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34; When we took it out of the box he wanted me to send it back because the handle didn&#x27;t have rubber at the molded grip area.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to be able to reach my back.</li>
            <li>this product came out exactly the way it looks and was delivered to me on time....</li>
            <li>But for somebody of size 46-long with a 78-inch arm span, this is more like a nail brush than a back brush.</li>
            <li>(however, this is my first shower brush, and my arms are pretty flexible).</li>
            <li>If you want a bit more quality go for a wooden handled variant.</li>
            <li>very scratchy!</li>
            <li>Ordered two and will most likely be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>The bristles are somewhat firm and feels good as you use it.</li>
            <li>Throwing it in the dishwasher once a week helps keep it clean and then throw it away when it isn&#x27;t clean enough.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a nice quality brush for the money.</li>
            <li>The Long handle made this easy to reach my back and the brush is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought a body brush along with this and the body brush is a bit hard, but this gives the perfect brush on my skin!</li>
            <li>Might work fine for a child or small adult or one with exceptional flexibility.</li>
            <li>if you are only going to use this for short term or once in a while its good.  </li>
            <li>This product is very functional and longer than most similar items I have had.  </li>
            <li>First things first, this is a rather intense brush.</li>
            <li>this AquaBella Long Handle Bath Brush (FREE Super Saver Shipping)</li>
            <li>Haha, I found it funny after reading some others</li>
            <li>This one works, but I am handicapped and reaching certain part of my body in the shower is a problem.</li>
            <li>smallish, tho, imho, 1st thought was like a large toothbrush.</li>
            <li>There certainly is a difference between exfoliation and scratching--i.e.</li>
            <li>After a lifetime of searching for the right one, I have finally found the right one!</li>
            <li>The brush and bristles feel very high quality.</li>
            <li>The nubs on the opposite side give a great little massage.</li>
            <li>The brush is not too hard or soft but holds soap great for brushing in all angles.</li>
            <li>It would also be very helpful to find one with a longer handle.</li>
            <li>With this brush you just lightly touch your back for a minute or two and your done.</li>
            <li>I really like this bath</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle and don&#x27;t hurt when you scrub.  </li>
            <li>a real bargain.</li>
            <li>I guess that is asking too much, huh?</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t apply much pressure for fear of feeling scratched.  </li>
            <li>I really like these bath brushes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain about this product though because it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>i feel very refreshed after using it with soap to massage and scrub my skin.</li>
            <li>I primarily use this brush to wash my back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others but much prefer these bamboo brushes.</li>
            <li>Ever since I switched to a bath brush with synthetic bristles, I am much happier with it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work OK, it is just scratchier than I  expected.  </li>
            <li>The brush is nice but you can just get something similar from your local CVS.</li>
            <li>I am sure for most people it will be stiff enough.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a stiff bristle back brush, this is a great brush.</li>
            <li>It is just right if your skin is not too sensitive or skin condition then I would not recommend using too often.</li>
            <li>It has the perfect touch--not too stiff, but firm enough to clean.  </li>
            <li>The handle could be three inches longer but other than that I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>but other than that it would be ok</li>
            <li>but since I knew what I was buying I have to give it 5-stars and at about 5 bucks with free shipping I have no major complaints.</li>
            <li>Works very well, soft bristles, doesn&#x27;t seem like terribly strong plastic for the handle but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>this was a must, and my back feels clean, comes in nicer color</li>
            <li>Soap doesn&#x27;t really stay on the bristles, so the brush doesn&#x27;t develop a decent lather.  </li>
            <li>THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE TRY TO CLEAN THE BOTTOM OF THE BUSH.</li>
            <li>I bought this to scrub my back clean.  </li>
            <li>The business end is two-sided: one has soft, but effective bristles and the other has hard little nubbins perfect for a scalp massage (while shampooing).</li>
            <li>Exactly like the &amp;#34;Aquasentials Exfoliating Bath Brush (15.5in) (Clear Handle)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, the handle seems to be adequate for me to reach all parts of my back form the top down or from the bottom up.  </li>
            <li>The bristles may feel too stiff at times, so this may not be suitable for older folks.</li>
            <li>The main problem with the brush is that it will not hold soap-------</li>
            <li>Like most people, I can&#x27;t reach the middle of my back to scrub when I take a shower or bath.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are sturdy, but soft enough that they are comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe he just has more sensitive skin, but I tried it and it still is a bit rough.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it particularly slippery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bristles are just firm enough to give a good cleansing to the skin without injury.</li>
            <li>The brush is about medeum perfect, not so hard and not so soft for the average guy.</li>
            <li>not sure what color mine is even though just got done using it, lol, it&#x27;s nice though, lathers up good with irish spring, my back is so bad with zits</li>
            <li>Excellent brushes for the bath and not at all too stiff as some have stated, at least not for my skin.</li>
            <li>My itchy dry winter skin is loving this long handled bath brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for others.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff enough to feel like it is providing a good clean but soft enough</li>
            <li>If it were a little longer, it would be better.</li>
            <li>Good tough bristles that have exfoliated my skin well.  </li>
            <li>inferior, poorly-engineered item looks almost identical to other products and is easy to confuse.</li>
            <li>I am extremely muscular (bench press 340 pounds) and do not feel like this will break easily (as I have a tendency to accidentally break things).</li>
            <li>No more moldy wooden shower brushes that fall apart and were too squishy to begin with to give you a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>Most easily recognised by the series of little &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; on back side opposite bristles, which don&#x27;t show in product photographs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is sturdy and the bristles are just the right level of harshness to scrub my back with.  </li>
            <li>It is exceptionally well made and will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s clear green or clear blue or something, good brush would recommend.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to get free shipping on my other purchases.  </li>
            <li>Nice for the price like another reviewer mentioned the handle does seem a little short.</li>
            <li>Little bumps a nice touch on back of the brush...</li>
            <li>I have a much longer-handled, larger, wooden bath brush that I use occasionally, but it&#x27;s really too rough for most uses, though I can easily reach all over my back with it.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one a couple of weeks, and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>The new one was wood.  </li>
            <li>A NEW ONE.</li>
            <li>I am able to wash my whole back by reaching down from my shoulders and then twisting it around and working up from my waist.</li>
            <li>I love that the bristles were firm enough to actually scrub and clean.</li>
            <li>but it is otherwise such a nice brush that I&#x27;m looking for a way to improve the grip, even if it means destroying that sleek/clean look of the handle...</li>
            <li>and the bristles are firm enough for a nice scrub.</li>
            <li>The bristles are secure and haven&#x27;t fallen out like my last back brush.  </li>
            <li>This is &#x27;soft&#x27;  and of high quality  IF....</li>
            <li>I like this back srcubber because it is strong enough to clean my back, but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate while I&#x27;m scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Love this brush -- not too soft, not too stiff:</li>
            <li>My only complaint (a very minor one) is that the string that comes as a loop through the handle&#x27;s hole feels kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>So I have one currently in use now and 1 more waiting in backup for the next inevitable handle snap.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my back stung for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>If anything this is TOO soft!  </li>
            <li>Ok, but brush-head somewhat to small for my liking.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be  equal or better quality to more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>The first one worked so well, I bought several, one for each family member and another for me.  </li>
            <li>I use it to lather soap and put it on my back, but it can also be used to discipline obnoxious children ;)</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t have to worry about the wooden head part falling off and hitting you on the toes or becoming loose and not staying in place on the brush anymore.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised once I received my new bath brush.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight easy to handle for disabled or elderly.</li>
            <li>This bristle is so stiff, though, that I have to press very lightly - if I press like I normally do, this scratches my back.</li>
            <li>I have found a Earth Therapeutics Feng Shui back brush at a local pharmacy which has a much longer handle, cost $6.99 and is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I am quite familiar with bath brushes, and have determined over the years that natural horse (or other natural) hair do not satisfy my needs.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching around for the right one, for a long time!</li>
            <li>Glad I got this plastic one vs. a typical wooden one.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied the bristles are not too stiff and haven&#x27;t fallen out like with more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Handle sturdy, but a little light.</li>
            <li>A little to firm in the bristles but its good</li>
            <li>The medium soft bristles are more realistically medium hard.  </li>
            <li>And, just a note, the picture makes it look like it&#x27;s a clear purple, but it&#x27;s just clear - no color.</li>
            <li>It looks like clear purple.</li>
            <li>One of the reviews said clear purple.</li>
            <li>Its clear.</li>
            <li>Just clear.</li>
            <li>The bristles are much stiffer than a similar natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li>The clear handle means it is almost invisible.</li>
            <li>You can save the clear plastic packaging dish that comes on the brush head for puting the brush head in and then fill it with hydrogen peroixide.</li>
            <li>I do like this product and it is much nicer and cleaner than the wooden versions, which splinter with wear.</li>
            <li>Itch be gone and a much cleaner back!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has soft bristles that are just what I wanted in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This brush costs twice as much at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>To the bristles are too soft.    </li>
            <li>The bristles were too soft for me.</li>
            <li>The brush is also too soft.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was listed as \\&quot;soft to medium\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li>In home health care I reorder this item frequently for my use with patients.</li>
            <li>so I put an old sock over it.</li>
            <li>I can handle the pain, but I would not recommend it for someone who have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really slippery and short</li>
            <li>We prefer natural bristles.</li>
            <li>The brush looks like it should be used by a child, not an adult.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as soft as puppy fur, but I don&#x27;t have to talk myself into using it every day.</li>
            <li>Note that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but also that I don&#x27;t use this brush vigorously either.</li>
            <li>My wife needed something to rub off dead skin and this does the job really well and makes her skin feel extra smooth.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft but not too soft.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>Basic nylon-bristled bath brush, there isn&#x27;t much to say about it.</li>
            <li>The brush works OK - but the handle should be at least one inch longer.  </li>
            <li>This one is too short to stand up straight - it keeps falling into the tub.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a brush nearly identical in appearance that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>Handles of wood break or bristles were to soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles may seem too soft at first touch but are really pretty firm in the shower.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only broken up a ring of those people who dig through the bagels with their bare hands at the bakery, but I&#x27;m off to a good start.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even decent as a back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>too hard for a Bath Brush in my opinion unless you...like...the sensation of a hard bristle hair brush on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;But definitely the best Back Scratcher everrrrr!</li>
            <li>Usually, I expect to replace back brushes annually or at best, every two years, because the bristles break down with constant, wet use.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and scrub away all the dead skin and dirt gently and effectively reaching in all the hard places.</li>
            <li>There were a number of wooden brushes (yuck}, scrubbies on a handle that flop around and don&#x27;t work, or highly over priced ones.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use as a shower brush, but as soon as I removed it from the box and held it aloft, feeling its delicate balance in my hand, waving it about with a heretofore unknown, purely instinctive deftness, I knew it was meant for more than that.</li>
            <li>, scratching does not necessarily mean that it&#x27;s exfoliating, and exfoliating doesn&#x27;t necessarily require scratching as an effect.</li>
            <li>The reason being that natural hairs collapse very early in the brush&#x27;s life span, plus I never felt that it scrubbed my body well enough.  </li>
            <li>Based on other reviews on Amazon, I understand that it takes awhile for this brush to become softer, but I&#x27;m not sure how many more uses my back can endure before my skin is rubbed completely raw (and I certainly don&#x27;t use this brush on a daily basis).</li>
            <li>If you like softer bristles, get it wet when you first get in the shower, wash you hair and then use the brush.</li>
            <li>I have an injured shoulder and needed something to wash my back without the contortions a normal person can make.  </li>
            <li>I wet the bristles first</li>
            <li>otherwise I only seldom use it for harsh exfoliation on my back, and more often for my feet.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m 6&amp;#34;2 ,  bristles are on brittler side like some other commenters mentioned so run under hot water first, I try and alternate days using since i&amp;#34;m just starting out using one,</li>
            <li>The handle is so unexpectedly short and the bristles are kind of weak.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty rough.</li>
            <li>Threw it away and currently looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>Simply put the back brush really does serve its purpose.</li>
            <li>The only place that it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much is on the back.  </li>
            <li>I thought my old brush was too soft, but this one literally feels like a coarse sandpaper.</li>
            <li>But I think many of the reviewers who report that it&#x27;s long enough to reach your whole back must be awfully small people.</li>
            <li>While the bristles are nice and firm, they are maybe *too* firm.</li>
            <li>So the “Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush (Clear Handle)” found a new home – under the sink.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this brush at a box store a few years back.</li>
            <li>Solid construction, moderately firm bristles that get you clean without tearing your skin to pieces.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay bath brush, I like that the bristles are stiff and scratchy, but it&#x27;s not long enough for me to reach the middle of my back no matter how I reach.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine as long as you like a stiff brush.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the brush turned it red and made it hurt.</li>
            <li>(I have a medicated body wash that I picked up over the counter), and the bristles barely hold a lather.  </li>
            <li>handle with my apparently overaggressive scrubbing techniques.</li>
            <li>It feels soft to the hand, but when used on my back, it is just like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>Brush is very coarse not at all soft.</li>
            <li>Brisles are just a little too hard for my tast, other then that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It is not hard and not soft.</li>
            <li>I cannot reach my feet well and this clears off dead skin better than a pumice with less skin damage,</li>
            <li>to last, strong enough to perform, does not mold easily and harsh enough brush to really scrub hard and get all the dirt and dead skin off my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Long enough to reach whole back, or just get from side  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for me as my skin is tough enough.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little stiffer than boar&#x27;s hair, but i happen to like a good, stiff brush for scrubbing down with, so that&#x27;s another plus in my book.</li>
            <li>At least it was cheap, so no big loss.  </li>
            <li>The color I received was clear, not blue as in the current picture.  </li>
            <li>Like the 3 bears, not too hard, not too soft, just right.  </li>
            <li>It is long enough so you can actually reach your whole back.</li>
            <li>This is actually a good thing, since I&#x27;ve pressed so hard with other brushes that I&#x27;ve snapped the handle in half.</li>
            <li>The bristles were very soft and the handle is long enough to reach any spot you would want.</li>
            <li>Using my Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush (Clear Handle), I would fight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so big, and I can barely reach to the center of my back — and even so, with enough difficulty that you&#x27;re not going to get much scrubbing done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This in NOT a long handle brush at all.</li>
            <li>I found a  “Bürstenhaus Redecker Beechwood Long Bath Brush with Natural Boar Bristles, 19.7-Inch” under the sink that I forgot I had.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t drop it; I didn&#x27;t hit it; I just used it to wash my back--and I&#x27;m not he-man either, so there was no excuse.  </li>
            <li>And the handle is definitely not long, which means the name of the product is inaccurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first lasted a few years before it broke, so it was forgivable.  </li>
            <li>SUPER hard scratchy bristles.</li>
            <li>The long smooth handle is hard to hold with soapy hands.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty stiff, but that was what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are way too stiff for use on skin, I had scratch marks the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The handle on this bath brush is relatively long and the bristles are soft enough to do the job without roughing up the skin.</li>
            <li>The description of \\&quot;Long-Handle\\&quot; may not mean that it is any longer than any other bath brush...</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush for all who need a rough, hardcore brush which can really scrub and last long.nd so far it is a long lasting product which the brush heads simply do not go soft and bend.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush for all who need a rough, hardcore brush which can really scrub and last long.</li>
            <li>Not long enough.</li>
            <li>Stiff brush and long-enough handle makes it cleaning your back pretty</li>
            <li>I am only 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; &amp; still fell it is not long enough!</li>
            <li>Most bath brushes are soft bristled or soft boar bristle, ALL the Back Scratcher&#x27;s are those monkey hand wood or plastic things that are worthless, so my husband first suggested a toilet brush...</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little softer than I wish they were but over all, a real treat.</li>
            <li>handle is a little short for me being really tall</li>
            <li>it took some time to get used to, and the bristles weren&#x27;t as hard or perfectly straight anymore, still, it isn&#x27;t a soft feel if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>

            <li> Would be nice to have that added length</li>
            <li> Since I do not get reimbursed it is the best value now on Amazon, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ideally, I&#x27;d prefer a little softer bristles, but it is wonderful to have.</li>
            <li> it rinses out very easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and took a chance because I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m fine with it because I tell myself it must be doing a really good job of scrubbing off dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and has a good grip.</li>

            <li> Still at this price I would gladly buy another.</li>
            <li> Better to buy one in person.  </li>
            <li> I love Olaplex..</li>

            <li> ok enough..lol</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This brush would work okay for cleaning the whitewalls on your car tires though.</li>
            <li> my back is very happy.</li>
            <li> Will continue looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Maybe would be OK for a bath, but not a shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> had a better grip</li>
            <li> I have to make sure</li>
            <li> Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> It gets the job done well, and isn&#x27;t over priced like so many of the &amp;#34;prettier&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with the purchase and use.</li>
            <li> This back brush is just perfect.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; handle brush is perfect in every way - for a short person.</li>
            <li> My back was permanently sprained in 2005 and this is just perfect for cleaining it where I cannot reach without reinjuring it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are still and will surly remove the top layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> But I love them for showering.</li>
            <li> I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for most.</li>
            <li> This is much better than what it was replacing...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;d be even better if:&lt;br /&gt;1)  </li>
            <li> The head were angled to allow for better scrubbing leverage and&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> I would like it to be longer, but most of these are 14 inches.</li>
            <li> They love to use it when they take their showers.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the shape.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a better value than those sold in box stores.</li>
            <li> One of the best back brushes I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> you have to go from the top and</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful accessory for people who have issues with stiffness in the arms and upper body.</li>
            <li> However, it does get the the job done for the most part.</li>
            <li> WE were meant for more than that.</li>
            <li> The handle fits well and the length is just right, offering good control when being used.  </li>
            <li> Easy grip handle on this brush which makes it easy for effective body scrubbing.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect so far has not fallen apart and is doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and for the price, its a good buy.  </li>
            <li> This is a good brush, it does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> but overall, the brush is very good &amp; I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This is some kind of lucite/plastic, which is sweet for keeping clean, but SLIPPERY as heck!  </li>
            <li> Great price and all is well so far!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a very good product for the price...</li>
            <li> very good job on my back.</li>
            <li> I think it works well and feels great on skin, rinses clear so no residue.  </li>
            <li> : the brush will NOT return to your hand on its own, no matter how authoritatively you command it.</li>
            <li> And unlike the wood-and-boar&#x27;s-hair brushes that are so popular right now, it&#x27;s not at risk of getting moldy or coming unglued.</li>
            <li> I share other peoples feeling that this product would be almost perfect if the handle was about 4 inches longer.  </li>
            <li> It is durable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> There are textured handle grooves that make it fairly easy to grip.  </li>
            <li> EASY TO USE BY DISABLE SENIOR.</li>
            <li> anyway I am glad I have it because it is a great brush for my back.</li>
            <li> it is easy to misplace.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The ribbon hangs on my shower handle easily.  </li>
            <li> This brush is easy to handle...</li>
            <li> Decent product, good for cleaning as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably exactly what you expect.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a sturdy grade of plastic, bristles give a good scrubbing but not painful, handle</li>
            <li> I good brush for decent price.</li>
            <li> The handle needs to be just a bit longer, and it would be perfect, but other than that, its fine.</li>
            <li> I was using this brush to scrub my back and it felt really nice, and then the most amazing thing happened.  </li>
            <li> My first wish was for my own velociraptor.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed some CLR and it look as good as new.</li>
            <li> and it has been as good as new after months of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had one with a thicker grip that would slip out of your hand, but rinse the soap off the handle before tou use and its fine.</li>
            <li> It is fine, but if you step on it, it may break.  </li>
            <li> The brush is fine except that I would prefer that the handle be about 2\\</li>
            <li> It lathered up just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Fine quality, just fine ---  </li>
            <li> The grip is just fine.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels fine.</li>
            <li> I like this little bath brush a lot, it arrived on time in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, after a couple more uses, the bristles became soft.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy it - so does my skin.</li>
            <li> is great for getting to the spots on your back</li>
            <li> Bristles are too scratchy and handle is too smooth can slip out of my hand.</li>
            <li> The brush part was great but the wood deteriorated in the shower over a short period of time with mildew and just falling apart.  </li>
            <li> Supper cheap.  </li>
            <li> However, it is easy to rinse off and keep clean, and doesn&#x27;t crack or mold like wooden/bristle bath brushes do in the humid environment of a shower.</li>
            <li> but it is clearly a light purple.  </li>
            <li> Great brush to apply Nair to my back.</li>
            <li> This is great at exfoliating the back during showers!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cheap shower brush, so expectations have been met.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was cheap, but in this case I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> But I found it to be great on my back.  </li>
            <li> The handle seems to be a comfortable length for me.  </li>
            <li> Its great for reaching unreachable parts of your back!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fit the bill for length or durability.</li>
            <li> It is on the cheap side</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> this brush is comfortable to hold .</li>
            <li> I find the handle a bit to light weight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Purchased 4 full years ago and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> This one was very reasonably priced and has done a great job so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, easy to grasp, won&#x27;t deteriorate like wood, &amp; the bristles do the job of cleaning &amp; making my back feel good, cheaply.</li>
            <li> If you want to feel clean and have smooth skin, then this is the scrubber for you.</li>
            <li> Great and long handle a plus</li>
            <li> You know your skin comes out really clean</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my Retriever.</li>
            <li> It came with a short looped cord or add your own longer one to put your fingers through for a better grip.  </li>
            <li> Oh well; maybe I can use the brush to clean the shower -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this to the mechanics to clean the trucks.</li>
            <li> We purchased this to clean the dogs.</li>
            <li> I CAN NOT GET 100% CLEAN</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic handle stays clean unlike some wood handled brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special that you can&#x27;t get in any drug store, but it arrived quickly and was just as cheap (even with shipping) as those you can buy in store.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and easy to manipulate, as well as having very soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> just right!</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting my back good and clean with this.</li>
            <li> okay, seriously NOT acceptable!</li>
            <li> This is also a good thing, since I&#x27;ve had a wooden handle with a rubberized handle cover that rotted under the cover after a month or two.  </li>
            <li> and this brush makes my skin so soft and nice.</li>
            <li> It has been used gently and hung safely when not in use.  </li>
            <li> This is a good brush...stiff enough to do the job without peeling skin.  </li>
            <li> nice bristle quality; scrubby &amp; not too soft.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say really.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot guarantee that you will have the same experience as me, but even if you do not this is still a good shower brush.  </li>
            <li> What is interesting is, I wasn&#x27;t applying that much pressure to the brush when it broke.</li>
            <li> Like the color clear and nice.  </li>
            <li> Might be good as a back scratcher but not for cleansing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already recruited a sidekick (The Grizzly Bar, a heroic, furry bar of soap), and I&#x27;m interviewing potential nemeses on Tuesday.</li>
            <li> She wanted something that also scratches her back effectively and this serves that purpose as well.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect and easy to use because of</li>
            <li> I bought another and its great for the other parts of the body...</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product.    </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several back brushes over the years, and none of them has been perfect.</li>
            <li> but they do mildew quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, it is adequate in terms of price:quality ratio.</li>
            <li> My husband has cut the handle down and used a bandsaw to cut some notches in the handle to allow one to hang on to it with soapy hands - works great now.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money and the massage side feels great on my back and the brush side is great for scrubbing those hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> Worked just great until the brush snapped in half after about 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li> But considering that this model costed noticeably less than those with longer handles, I still think it was a great deal and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brush fulfilled my needs at a reasonable price with very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very sturdy and strong</li>
            <li> Six bucks, it&#x27;s at the house and ready to go... VERSUS walking out to shop for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent !!</li>
            <li> THIS is a great little Amazon deal.</li>
            <li> its ok, it would be a lot better if their were some kind of anti-slip bumps on the handle, its very hard to hold on to with soap on your hands</li>
            <li> I kept re-soaping the brush and ended up using twice as much because the soap literally dies in these cheap bristles.</li>
            <li> It hurts my back, but it&#x27;s amazing for my feet.</li>
            <li> I love the one piece plastic handle its comfortable to hold and not slippery like the wooden one gets when soapy.</li>
            <li> Albeit a bit rough on your back, it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> My old one had a textured handle - much better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bath brush for my father and the size is ok, but the color I thought was supposed to be clear</li>
            <li> Nice exfoliant for back, heels, elbows and legs.</li>
            <li> I got this one because I wanted something softer for more frequent use and this works well.</li>
            <li> Not your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li> Makes a nice back scratcher.</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised, however it gets mildew ridden pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find the company that made the original brush that was so much nicer.</li>
            <li> The hendle could be three inches longer but other than that it works good.</li>
            <li> Got this for my guy because he wanted to be able to wash his back in the shower but hasn&#x27;t been able to find a brush that&#x27;s not hard and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I found it was just right for me.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right.  </li>
            <li> Hits all the right spots.</li>
            <li> Broke right at handle.</li>
            <li> I have found that if I squirt liquid soap right on the brush my hands don&#x27;t get slippery and holding the brush is no problem.</li>
            <li> Depending on what your needs for a bath brush are, this product may or may not be right for you.  </li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really get in there to clean them out.  </li>
            <li> Nice long handle..reaches where I need it and beyond.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how good of an exfoliating job this brush does, but it certainly does a good job of scratching up my back.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for both scrubbing and scratching without being too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li> Nylon is preferred because natural bristles seem to get mildewed easily.</li>
            <li> Works great, not too rough and not too soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft, not even good for back scratching!</li>
            <li> We leave the brush in the shower, and it seems to dry nicely each day without leaving a moldy smell.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for reaching your back in the shower and other hard to reach places, provided you like a good scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would have liked one with a harder brush.</li>
            <li> I needed a bath brush to replace the many that I have bought recently.  </li>
            <li> but who checks the shower for pretty stuff?</li>
            <li> I felt like i was removing the top layer of skin and, once again, the handle is just too short.  </li>
            <li> would hope it would last more then ONE use.</li>
            <li> This is the first plastic one I have used.  </li>
            <li> Short handle and worked okay, but the rapid molding turned me off.</li>
            <li> the first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li> Works better as a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Better for scrubbing toes and elbows than your back--</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact brush at a Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> The first inexpensive shower brush that I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t feel like I was mauling myself with a joshua tree.</li>
            <li> This is my first bath brush and it does the trick.....</li>
            <li> it is ok, but the handle is too short.</li>
            <li> Not my first experience with the product and this vendor.</li>
            <li> He said, &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34; When we took it out of the box he wanted me to send it back because the handle didn&#x27;t have rubber at the molded grip area.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to be able to reach my back.</li>
            <li> this product came out exactly the way it looks and was delivered to me on time....</li>
            <li> But for somebody of size 46-long with a 78-inch arm span, this is more like a nail brush than a back brush.</li>
            <li> (however, this is my first shower brush, and my arms are pretty flexible).</li>
            <li> If you want a bit more quality go for a wooden handled variant.</li>
            <li> very scratchy!</li>
            <li> Ordered two and will most likely be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> The bristles are somewhat firm and feels good as you use it.</li>
            <li> Throwing it in the dishwasher once a week helps keep it clean and then throw it away when it isn&#x27;t clean enough.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a nice quality brush for the money.</li>
            <li> The Long handle made this easy to reach my back and the brush is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought a body brush along with this and the body brush is a bit hard, but this gives the perfect brush on my skin!</li>
            <li> Might work fine for a child or small adult or one with exceptional flexibility.</li>
            <li> if you are only going to use this for short term or once in a while its good.  </li>
            <li> This product is very functional and longer than most similar items I have had.  </li>
            <li> First things first, this is a rather intense brush.</li>
            <li> this AquaBella Long Handle Bath Brush (FREE Super Saver Shipping)</li>
            <li> Haha, I found it funny after reading some others</li>
            <li> This one works, but I am handicapped and reaching certain part of my body in the shower is a problem.</li>
            <li> smallish, tho, imho, 1st thought was like a large toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There certainly is a difference between exfoliation and scratching--i.e.</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of searching for the right one, I have finally found the right one!</li>
            <li> The brush and bristles feel very high quality.</li>
            <li> The nubs on the opposite side give a great little massage.</li>
            <li> The brush is not too hard or soft but holds soap great for brushing in all angles.</li>
            <li> It would also be very helpful to find one with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> With this brush you just lightly touch your back for a minute or two and your done.</li>
            <li> I really like this bath</li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle and don&#x27;t hurt when you scrub.  </li>
            <li> a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I guess that is asking too much, huh?</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t apply much pressure for fear of feeling scratched.  </li>
            <li> I really like these bath brushes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain about this product though because it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> i feel very refreshed after using it with soap to massage and scrub my skin.</li>
            <li> I primarily use this brush to wash my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but much prefer these bamboo brushes.</li>
            <li> Ever since I switched to a bath brush with synthetic bristles, I am much happier with it.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work OK, it is just scratchier than I  expected.  </li>
            <li> The brush is nice but you can just get something similar from your local CVS.</li>
            <li> I am sure for most people it will be stiff enough.</li>
            <li> If you prefer a stiff bristle back brush, this is a great brush.</li>
            <li> It is just right if your skin is not too sensitive or skin condition then I would not recommend using too often.</li>
            <li> It has the perfect touch--not too stiff, but firm enough to clean.  </li>
            <li> The handle could be three inches longer but other than that I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> but other than that it would be ok</li>
            <li> but since I knew what I was buying I have to give it 5-stars and at about 5 bucks with free shipping I have no major complaints.</li>
            <li> Works very well, soft bristles, doesn&#x27;t seem like terribly strong plastic for the handle but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> this was a must, and my back feels clean, comes in nicer color</li>
            <li> Soap doesn&#x27;t really stay on the bristles, so the brush doesn&#x27;t develop a decent lather.  </li>
            <li> THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE TRY TO CLEAN THE BOTTOM OF THE BUSH.</li>
            <li> I bought this to scrub my back clean.  </li>
            <li> The business end is two-sided: one has soft, but effective bristles and the other has hard little nubbins perfect for a scalp massage (while shampooing).</li>
            <li> Exactly like the &amp;#34;Aquasentials Exfoliating Bath Brush (15.5in) (Clear Handle)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, the handle seems to be adequate for me to reach all parts of my back form the top down or from the bottom up.  </li>
            <li> The bristles may feel too stiff at times, so this may not be suitable for older folks.</li>
            <li> The main problem with the brush is that it will not hold soap-------</li>
            <li> Like most people, I can&#x27;t reach the middle of my back to scrub when I take a shower or bath.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy, but soft enough that they are comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe he just has more sensitive skin, but I tried it and it still is a bit rough.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it particularly slippery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles are just firm enough to give a good cleansing to the skin without injury.</li>
            <li> The brush is about medeum perfect, not so hard and not so soft for the average guy.</li>
            <li> not sure what color mine is even though just got done using it, lol, it&#x27;s nice though, lathers up good with irish spring, my back is so bad with zits</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes for the bath and not at all too stiff as some have stated, at least not for my skin.</li>
            <li> My itchy dry winter skin is loving this long handled bath brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for others.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff enough to feel like it is providing a good clean but soft enough</li>
            <li> If it were a little longer, it would be better.</li>
            <li> Good tough bristles that have exfoliated my skin well.  </li>
            <li> inferior, poorly-engineered item looks almost identical to other products and is easy to confuse.</li>
            <li> I am extremely muscular (bench press 340 pounds) and do not feel like this will break easily (as I have a tendency to accidentally break things).</li>
            <li> No more moldy wooden shower brushes that fall apart and were too squishy to begin with to give you a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> Most easily recognised by the series of little &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; on back side opposite bristles, which don&#x27;t show in product photographs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy and the bristles are just the right level of harshness to scrub my back with.  </li>
            <li> It is exceptionally well made and will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s clear green or clear blue or something, good brush would recommend.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to get free shipping on my other purchases.  </li>
            <li> Nice for the price like another reviewer mentioned the handle does seem a little short.</li>
            <li> Little bumps a nice touch on back of the brush...</li>
            <li> I have a much longer-handled, larger, wooden bath brush that I use occasionally, but it&#x27;s really too rough for most uses, though I can easily reach all over my back with it.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one a couple of weeks, and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> The new one was wood.  </li>
            <li> A NEW ONE.</li>
            <li> I am able to wash my whole back by reaching down from my shoulders and then twisting it around and working up from my waist.</li>
            <li> I love that the bristles were firm enough to actually scrub and clean.</li>
            <li> but it is otherwise such a nice brush that I&#x27;m looking for a way to improve the grip, even if it means destroying that sleek/clean look of the handle...</li>
            <li> and the bristles are firm enough for a nice scrub.</li>
            <li> The bristles are secure and haven&#x27;t fallen out like my last back brush.  </li>
            <li> This is &#x27;soft&#x27;  and of high quality  IF....</li>
            <li> I like this back srcubber because it is strong enough to clean my back, but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate while I&#x27;m scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Love this brush -- not too soft, not too stiff:</li>
            <li> My only complaint (a very minor one) is that the string that comes as a loop through the handle&#x27;s hole feels kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> So I have one currently in use now and 1 more waiting in backup for the next inevitable handle snap.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my back stung for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> If anything this is TOO soft!  </li>
            <li> Ok, but brush-head somewhat to small for my liking.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be  equal or better quality to more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> The first one worked so well, I bought several, one for each family member and another for me.  </li>
            <li> I use it to lather soap and put it on my back, but it can also be used to discipline obnoxious children ;)</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t have to worry about the wooden head part falling off and hitting you on the toes or becoming loose and not staying in place on the brush anymore.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised once I received my new bath brush.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight easy to handle for disabled or elderly.</li>
            <li> This bristle is so stiff, though, that I have to press very lightly - if I press like I normally do, this scratches my back.</li>
            <li> I have found a Earth Therapeutics Feng Shui back brush at a local pharmacy which has a much longer handle, cost $6.99 and is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I am quite familiar with bath brushes, and have determined over the years that natural horse (or other natural) hair do not satisfy my needs.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching around for the right one, for a long time!</li>
            <li> Glad I got this plastic one vs. a typical wooden one.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied the bristles are not too stiff and haven&#x27;t fallen out like with more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Handle sturdy, but a little light.</li>
            <li> A little to firm in the bristles but its good</li>
            <li> The medium soft bristles are more realistically medium hard.  </li>
            <li> And, just a note, the picture makes it look like it&#x27;s a clear purple, but it&#x27;s just clear - no color.</li>
            <li> It looks like clear purple.</li>
            <li> One of the reviews said clear purple.</li>
            <li> Its clear.</li>
            <li> Just clear.</li>
            <li> The bristles are much stiffer than a similar natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li> The clear handle means it is almost invisible.</li>
            <li> You can save the clear plastic packaging dish that comes on the brush head for puting the brush head in and then fill it with hydrogen peroixide.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it is much nicer and cleaner than the wooden versions, which splinter with wear.</li>
            <li> Itch be gone and a much cleaner back!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has soft bristles that are just what I wanted in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brush costs twice as much at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> To the bristles are too soft.    </li>
            <li> The bristles were too soft for me.</li>
            <li> The brush is also too soft.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was listed as \\&quot;soft to medium\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li> In home health care I reorder this item frequently for my use with patients.</li>
            <li> so I put an old sock over it.</li>
            <li> I can handle the pain, but I would not recommend it for someone who have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really slippery and short</li>
            <li> We prefer natural bristles.</li>
            <li> The brush looks like it should be used by a child, not an adult.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as puppy fur, but I don&#x27;t have to talk myself into using it every day.</li>
            <li> Note that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but also that I don&#x27;t use this brush vigorously either.</li>
            <li> My wife needed something to rub off dead skin and this does the job really well and makes her skin feel extra smooth.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft but not too soft.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> Basic nylon-bristled bath brush, there isn&#x27;t much to say about it.</li>
            <li> The brush works OK - but the handle should be at least one inch longer.  </li>
            <li> This one is too short to stand up straight - it keeps falling into the tub.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a brush nearly identical in appearance that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> Handles of wood break or bristles were to soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles may seem too soft at first touch but are really pretty firm in the shower.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only broken up a ring of those people who dig through the bagels with their bare hands at the bakery, but I&#x27;m off to a good start.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even decent as a back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> too hard for a Bath Brush in my opinion unless you...like...the sensation of a hard bristle hair brush on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;But definitely the best Back Scratcher everrrrr!</li>
            <li> Usually, I expect to replace back brushes annually or at best, every two years, because the bristles break down with constant, wet use.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and scrub away all the dead skin and dirt gently and effectively reaching in all the hard places.</li>
            <li> There were a number of wooden brushes (yuck}, scrubbies on a handle that flop around and don&#x27;t work, or highly over priced ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a shower brush, but as soon as I removed it from the box and held it aloft, feeling its delicate balance in my hand, waving it about with a heretofore unknown, purely instinctive deftness, I knew it was meant for more than that.</li>
            <li> , scratching does not necessarily mean that it&#x27;s exfoliating, and exfoliating doesn&#x27;t necessarily require scratching as an effect.</li>
            <li> The reason being that natural hairs collapse very early in the brush&#x27;s life span, plus I never felt that it scrubbed my body well enough.  </li>
            <li> Based on other reviews on Amazon, I understand that it takes awhile for this brush to become softer, but I&#x27;m not sure how many more uses my back can endure before my skin is rubbed completely raw (and I certainly don&#x27;t use this brush on a daily basis).</li>
            <li> If you like softer bristles, get it wet when you first get in the shower, wash you hair and then use the brush.</li>
            <li> I have an injured shoulder and needed something to wash my back without the contortions a normal person can make.  </li>
            <li> I wet the bristles first</li>
            <li> otherwise I only seldom use it for harsh exfoliation on my back, and more often for my feet.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 6&amp;#34;2 ,  bristles are on brittler side like some other commenters mentioned so run under hot water first, I try and alternate days using since i&amp;#34;m just starting out using one,</li>
            <li> The handle is so unexpectedly short and the bristles are kind of weak.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty rough.</li>
            <li> Threw it away and currently looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> Simply put the back brush really does serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> The only place that it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much is on the back.  </li>
            <li> I thought my old brush was too soft, but this one literally feels like a coarse sandpaper.</li>
            <li> But I think many of the reviewers who report that it&#x27;s long enough to reach your whole back must be awfully small people.</li>
            <li> While the bristles are nice and firm, they are maybe *too* firm.</li>
            <li> So the “Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush (Clear Handle)” found a new home – under the sink.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this brush at a box store a few years back.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, moderately firm bristles that get you clean without tearing your skin to pieces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay bath brush, I like that the bristles are stiff and scratchy, but it&#x27;s not long enough for me to reach the middle of my back no matter how I reach.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine as long as you like a stiff brush.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the brush turned it red and made it hurt.</li>
            <li> (I have a medicated body wash that I picked up over the counter), and the bristles barely hold a lather.  </li>
            <li> handle with my apparently overaggressive scrubbing techniques.</li>
            <li> It feels soft to the hand, but when used on my back, it is just like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> Brush is very coarse not at all soft.</li>
            <li> Brisles are just a little too hard for my tast, other then that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> It is not hard and not soft.</li>
            <li> I cannot reach my feet well and this clears off dead skin better than a pumice with less skin damage,</li>
            <li> to last, strong enough to perform, does not mold easily and harsh enough brush to really scrub hard and get all the dirt and dead skin off my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Long enough to reach whole back, or just get from side  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for me as my skin is tough enough.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiffer than boar&#x27;s hair, but i happen to like a good, stiff brush for scrubbing down with, so that&#x27;s another plus in my book.</li>
            <li> At least it was cheap, so no big loss.  </li>
            <li> The color I received was clear, not blue as in the current picture.  </li>
            <li> Like the 3 bears, not too hard, not too soft, just right.  </li>
            <li> It is long enough so you can actually reach your whole back.</li>
            <li> This is actually a good thing, since I&#x27;ve pressed so hard with other brushes that I&#x27;ve snapped the handle in half.</li>
            <li> The bristles were very soft and the handle is long enough to reach any spot you would want.</li>
            <li> Using my Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush (Clear Handle), I would fight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so big, and I can barely reach to the center of my back — and even so, with enough difficulty that you&#x27;re not going to get much scrubbing done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This in NOT a long handle brush at all.</li>
            <li> I found a  “Bürstenhaus Redecker Beechwood Long Bath Brush with Natural Boar Bristles, 19.7-Inch” under the sink that I forgot I had.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t drop it; I didn&#x27;t hit it; I just used it to wash my back--and I&#x27;m not he-man either, so there was no excuse.  </li>
            <li> And the handle is definitely not long, which means the name of the product is inaccurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first lasted a few years before it broke, so it was forgivable.  </li>
            <li> SUPER hard scratchy bristles.</li>
            <li> The long smooth handle is hard to hold with soapy hands.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty stiff, but that was what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are way too stiff for use on skin, I had scratch marks the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The handle on this bath brush is relatively long and the bristles are soft enough to do the job without roughing up the skin.</li>
            <li> The description of \\&quot;Long-Handle\\&quot; may not mean that it is any longer than any other bath brush...</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush for all who need a rough, hardcore brush which can really scrub and last long.nd so far it is a long lasting product which the brush heads simply do not go soft and bend.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush for all who need a rough, hardcore brush which can really scrub and last long.</li>
            <li> Not long enough.</li>
            <li> Stiff brush and long-enough handle makes it cleaning your back pretty</li>
            <li> I am only 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; &amp; still fell it is not long enough!</li>
            <li> Most bath brushes are soft bristled or soft boar bristle, ALL the Back Scratcher&#x27;s are those monkey hand wood or plastic things that are worthless, so my husband first suggested a toilet brush...</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little softer than I wish they were but over all, a real treat.</li>
            <li> handle is a little short for me being really tall</li>
            <li> it took some time to get used to, and the bristles weren&#x27;t as hard or perfectly straight anymore, still, it isn&#x27;t a soft feel if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> the price was right and this brush gets to those hard to get to places on my</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough for easy reach behind the back.</li>
            <li> The wooden ones mildew, the plastic ones are not as harsh as the wooden ones and in general, either they have short handles, soft brushes or they are flimsy and they break!</li>
            <li> Clear, so it blends with all decors, not too soft and not too stiff...</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff but not too much so.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes - they are a decent brush that isn&#x27;t too hard or too soft.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it the bristles were really stiff - ouch!  </li>
            <li> The price is right, but the bristles are way too rough and stiff for my skin.</li>
            <li> I do wish the handle was a color other than clear...</li>
            <li> Seriously, it will strip the skin right off your back...</li>
            <li> This brush is really too small to be called a back brush.  </li>
            <li> Long enough to reach toes and back.</li>
            <li> a year old long handle wooden one with a brush on one side and a cellulite massager on the other.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding a long handled shower brush and after reading all the positive reviews about this product, had decided to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Speaking of the handle, it&#x27;s long enough to reach the middle of my back, but not too long.</li>
            <li> This brush is probably fine for small people, but it is too short, and the brush is too small for me.  </li>
            <li> but because one reviewer said that it was hard bristled, EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite small and the bristles are a bit stiff, but then again it&#x27;s also cheap.</li>
            <li> The second was less than two months old.  </li>
            <li> The long handle is way too SHORT.  </li>
            <li> It is only about 14 inches long.</li>
            <li> I like the long handle for reaching my back and the bottoms of my legs.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to reach those areas you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> If this is long handled, what is short handled?  </li>
            <li> The handle is barely long enough (I&#x27;m 6&#x27; tall)</li>
            <li> I have long hair and when I wash it sometimes the conditioner residue stays on my back and makes me itch even after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> The thin &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; breaks easily during normal use or even dropping on a hard surface (like bottom of a bathtub!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This way your brush will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this back bush everyday and the bristles have not bent or become soft.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but firm enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin or are not used to exfoliating, this brush may be too harsh for you.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are just what I hoped for: neither too stiff or not stiff enough.</li>
            <li> Even though I bought it as a back brush, and I do wash my back with it, it is a little short to be considered \\&quot;convenient\\&quot; for washing your back.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like (being a tall person) is that the long handle isn&#x27;t all that long when you have a long torso.  </li>
            <li> I deducted a star, only because the bristles are stiff, rather than soft.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;, and my arm reach is not very far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually cheaper than other brushes at the local store.</li>
            <li> I like that the brush seems very sturdy and won&#x27;t fall apart like other wooden ones I purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> when i read other reviews and people complained that it is too short, i didnt think much of it since i&#x27;m a short guy...</li>
            <li> My first review, unfortunately it&#x27;s not a good one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just excess left over from manufacturing or if it&#x27;s just going to shed completely.</li>
            <li> , with the long handle, it helps me to reach some of the tougher places.</li>
            <li> It seems to be one of the few nylon bristled back brushes left out there for daily scrubbing.</li>
            <li> The handle seems plenty long to the users in this household.    </li>
            <li> Maybe a long while..</li>
            <li> I was looking for a long handle scrub brush to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as long as the other one I have, but I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> One minor point against it...</li>
            <li> I’d give this a five star if the handle was a bit long and was somehow made easier to hold.</li>
            <li> no way should it be called a long handle</li>
            <li> They may be too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you want a long handle this is not the brush for you.</li>
            <li> If you prefer a long handle brush, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Think of it as using a firm toothbrush verses a medium or soft one.</li>
            <li> Brush is not that long like it states.  </li>
            <li> and I used a decent amount of pressure and later realized I had very small cuts from brushing in two places.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a bit smaller than your typical back brush.</li>
            <li> This brush (clear) really is unbelievably stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too soft or too stiff and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> It is not to soft or to stiff in the bristle department.</li>
            <li> Medium to stiff bristles,  not too soft</li>
            <li> I bought both not realizing that, other than shape, they were the same.</li>
            <li> Other brushes have a non slip rubber handle, which actually breaks off after a while..</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I agree with some of the other reviews, it should be longer.  </li>
            <li> It works, and I can see how other people may have a different opinion of it.  </li>
            <li> This brush is much shorter and the head much smaller than the ones I have been using for the past few years.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> hang it up to air dry.</li>
            <li> However, its not a huge issue, when I use it in the shower I can scrub my back from above my shoulder, and then from below to get my lower back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The bristles are to stiff and hurt my back when I use it to try and wash my back in the shower.</li>
            <li> The angle of the brush is not right for using on your back.</li>
            <li> not worth it to send it back....</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that had been mixed regarding whether this bath brush was soft or hard.</li>
            <li> During the first few uses the bristles will scratch you if you scrub too hard.</li>
            <li> it just simply means that it is a typical length for a brush of this type.</li>
            <li> To address a few of the complaints;&lt;br /&gt;The handle seem long enough for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see that a few other reviewers say that the bristles are too soft for them (others say too hard).  </li>
            <li> It feels very sturdy in my hand, and I can scrub with it very hard.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that the handle could be a little longer for easier reach.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little larger than this.</li>
            <li> The brush head could be a little larger</li>
            <li> I went out bought a different one that was a little bit longer</li>
            <li> Do not waste your hard earned $$ on this product.  </li>
            <li> Not too soft, nor too hard.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it feels soft but again, in the shower it&#x27;s still too hard.  </li>
            <li> The bristles, Goldilocks would say &amp;#34; not to soft not to hard just right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This makes it hard to get proper pressure of bristles to back at some angles and the ribs just don&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> Yes I know that there are other ways to use it, but I am in Afghanistan and my shower stall is limited on space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s straight, so no angle makes it still difficult to reach parts of the back; then you have to transfer it and work from the bottom up to get the lower parts.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend buying an item like this if you have a long back and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiffer when it is wet and soften after use.</li>
            <li> If you like a harder brush, buy two and rotate them each day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The brush is too rough...</li>
            <li> I think the bristles are way too rough.</li>
            <li> I think it was because the brush handle was green, and I was using it with Irish Spring soap on St Patrick&#x27;s Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they are rough and hardcore brushes.</li>
            <li> It does all I  expected.</li>
            <li> However, over time the bristles have gotten a bit harder.</li>
            <li> It just sinks into the bristles</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as expected, delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Shipped and received as expected</li>
            <li> so it gets slippery when wet and soapy.</li>
            <li> The bristles may be a little stiff for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> On the second use, with hardly any pressure at all, the handle snapped in half and the sharp plastic edge scraped me causing deep long cuts that just missed an artery.</li>
            <li> Finally a one piece shower brush with stiff bristles for us greaseballs.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff but I like it for defoliating my back</li>
            <li> Other reviews said it was so stiff that it hurt the skin on your back.</li>
            <li> This brush is not a toy, but a heavy duty, long handle rough brush which lasts.</li>
            <li> other than that no complains</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also like the other plastic handle brush.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Other than that..</li>
            <li> Small and flimsy compared to your drug store variety back brush.</li>
            <li> I just use a bath bucket and along with my other bath stuff, I leave this brush standing vertically while leaning on the wall tile.</li>
            <li> I know the brush works because my back does not itch anymore due to dead skin!</li>
            <li> No more need for back scratchers.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The problem with the wood one was one side had to rest against the shelf in my surround so the other side would get moldy...</li>
            <li> The brush end is too small and the handle is short.</li>
            <li> The handle is slick, smooth and thin, hard to hold onto when wet.</li>
            <li> but the brush is solid and the brissels very firm.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had to purchase 4 of them so far because I&#x27;ve snapped 2 of them in the middle of the plastic</li>
            <li> head is pretty small too, and unnecessarily angled inward.</li>
            <li> After I received this brush, I randomly saw a wooden brush with soft bristles at Walgreens and picked it up to replace this one.  </li>
            <li> The brush I received is solid in construction, but the fibers are really stiff!  </li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re into sado-masochism, the bristles on this thing are simply too stiff to use!  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a heavy duty, hardcore, long handle, hard brush which does not mildew and is rough enough to get all the dead skin off my back, knees, inner elbows and all the hard to reach places!</li>
            <li> There is a hole where a string could be attached to wrap around your wrist, but my hand still slides up and down the handle making it pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> &quot; but in reality it&#x27;s medium hard and will be too stiff for anyone with sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard enough to feel like you&#x27;re getting good exfoliation without being painful or irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this rusted after less than four months of hanging in the shower (not in direct spray) and being used only a handful of times.</li>
            <li> I was confused because other people who purchased it said it was soft.</li>
            <li> A little to rough for me.</li>
            <li> A little rough on skin</li>
            <li> This brush it hard, although medium to the touch, once used on the body like the back</li>
            <li> The fibers are too hard, Not for human use at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard enough!</li>
            <li> Way too hard for your back it will scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the handle; It gets a little slick if you let soap get onto it.</li>
            <li> It reaches those hard to reach places on your back while bathing.  </li>
            <li> Handle short and slippery making it hard to hold.</li>
            <li> Bristles a little stiff for my preference and the handle is a little short.  </li>
            <li> I realized it too late when I started brushing my back</li>
            <li> The bristles are rather sparse though, which is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> This is probably NOT a good brush for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after a few uses, the bristles are falling out.</li>
            <li> It will last a lifetime (at least for this senior).</li>
            <li> The massage side is not really useful.</li>
            <li> Another plus point of this item is its sufficiently long handle; I can reach every inch behind my back with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an average length brush.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before buying the brush and after using it I don&#x27;t know why other people have had trouble.</li>
            <li> The base and top surface of the bristles turned reddish-brown.</li>
            <li> Do not put it head down on the bath tiles where the brush tips touch the tiles and wetness, because wetness brings mold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and I wonder, what do people want for $5?!    </li>
            <li> Threw out less than a year.  </li>
            <li> The odd (massaging?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these, and the heads of both of them broke in half.  </li>
            <li> The head busted in half while I was using it.</li>
            <li> I also like it because the handle is not made of wood, which means that it can be washed and is less prone to germs.</li>
            <li> I stored my previous brush in the space between the wall and my grab bar.  </li>
            <li> There is one subtle difference, however: the bristles on this brush are tiny.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiff and don&#x27;t lather as efficiently as I might like, and the handle is a bit slippery with wet hands.</li>
            <li> like it this way, reading the other comments it seems that others find the brush to be too stiff.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a bit softer as I find I rarely use this because it&#x27;s so unpleasant to scrub with.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because the leprechaun said I could not wish for additional wishes, and I felt that was not fair.</li>
            <li> the end had a little roughness to it.  </li>
            <li> The handle could have been a little longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish the ribbon tied to the loop was a little longer and made of rope or string.  </li>
            <li> but I wish the bristles were a little longer and stiffer.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews a little closer.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are a little bit tough on my back.</li>
            <li> I tried using it for a few weeks to see if they would soften up, but no dice.</li>
            <li> Recommend some type of abrasive tape be applied to the handle to allow for a firm grip.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The staples used to hold the bristles into the brush rusted after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I bought both this oval and the round brush heads of this.  </li>
            <li> The round has a sharper curve in the handle than the oval.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday..</li>
            <li> The handle needs to be a few inches longer.</li>
            <li> and I wanted firm bristles.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s either a problem with the plastic, or they&#x27;ve simply made the material in the head too thin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> does it job, but definitely not smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it a few times.</li>
            <li> so I would not get in trouble for it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, but they do not scratch or irritate.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble washing my feet</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days (just to wash my back) and had to stop because it was so irritating.</li>
            <li> A little stiff on the bristles, but like.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a little too stiff for me, to the point where it hurts my skin as I&#x27;m scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very stiff and sharp, and exfoliate rather than scrub.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used something like this in a few years and was put off when I scrubbed my arm with these unusually stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this based on other reviews stating it is to hard.  </li>
            <li> WAY to stiff and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too stiff.  </li>
            <li> But the bristles are stiff and they scratch.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure on the brush because it is somewhat stiff.</li>
            <li> the bristles are really, really stiff and sometimes ouchie.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a bit stiff but it works for what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are brutally stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles might be a bit too stiff for some and even with just water on the handle</li>
            <li> Bristles are too stiff.  </li>
            <li> Find something else, this brush is so stiff</li>
            <li> They are also stiff.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this product are plastic and stiff.</li>
            <li> But, it is too stiff for my liking....</li>
            <li> Some people like a stiff brush....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little difficult in reaching all of my back.</li>
            <li> rough, tough, firm bristles...</li>
            <li> The handle is just the right length to attack hard-to-reach evil without being cumbersome, and the bristles are firm enough to exfoliate villainy, but not so firm as to irritate its delicate combination</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a brush that is a little hard</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I think you&#x27;re taking a small risk with it.</li>
            <li> comes with a small ribbon for hanging it from a hook.</li>
            <li> As stated by someone else, the handle on the brush is too short making it useless to use in the shower if you are tall.  </li>
            <li> In a few months, this brush will have been scrubbing my families&#x27; backs for three years!  </li>
            <li> I prefer plastic brushes over wooden ones that harbor bacteria, mildew and creepy,  crawly things.</li>
            <li> I use to wash my back, and feel bristles are uncomfortable and not functional.</li>
            <li> Very firm bristles, if you like that.</li>
            <li> But, it is stiff!</li>
            <li> not good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is very stiff.</li>
            <li> This is a very stiff brush.</li>
            <li> The brussels  are very stiff.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want hard bristles, like from a hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> that is really hard to get to.</li>
            <li> I find the bristles to be too hard.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not that hard</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too hard.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE HARD TIME TO FIND IT.</li>
            <li> said it was too hard.    </li>
            <li> another reviewer noted, it&#x27;s also hard to get the soap onto the brush.</li>
            <li> They scrub so hard.</li>
            <li> it can be a bit hard to hold in the shower.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too hard at all for me.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are hard like I wanted them but</li>
            <li> Handle is hard to hold when wet,too slippery.</li>
            <li> Anyone who does this is push really hard or the handle is already cracked.</li>
            <li> If you are pushing that hard you can always move your hand up the handle or over the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to be delicate.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is, so it&#x27;s hard to give this a bad review!</li>
            <li> Not sure what else I can say about it!</li>
            <li> They scratch the back and is very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The long and sturdy handle makes it a lot easier to reach the outsides of feet and backs of ankles and legs which are ordinarily very difficult for me to reach.</li>
            <li> For me, they were too hard!  </li>
            <li> The handle is really short for a tall person :(  </li>
            <li> it is very hard.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit tough, but I prefer that, and they&#x27;ll soften over time with use anyway.  </li>
            <li> Tough bristles- can hurt a bit when scrubbing, but this is subjective</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> , little bit disappointed with it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed the handle is not long at all.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush, suds up well in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and therefore it is rather useless in the shower.    </li>
            <li> The ribs on the handle, shown in the pic go in the wrong direction.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> plastic bumps on the backside feel weird to me</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with one like this.</li>
            <li> but it requires an uncomfortable reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately he ate a bunch of people in my neighborhood,</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> After trying others that failed, this is my brand forever.  </li>
            <li> In November it fell into the bathtub from the edge, a mere foot, and it shattered...</li>
            <li> Very frustrating</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I point the shower head away so that the meager lather that it does hold won&#x27;t get lost as I scrub.  </li>
            <li> The bristles painfully scrape my skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost painful to use.  </li>
            <li> Painful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful to use.</li>
            <li> Simply painful.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was appalled when the brush arrived with a label advising me to replace it every 1-3 months.  </li>
            <li> Unless you hate having skin.</li>
            <li> just annoying</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very painful, so if you are looking for a body brush i wouldn&#x27;t pick this one.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The worst piece of crap I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and for the price, its a good buy.  I had one with a thicker grip that would slip out of your hand, but rinse the soap off the handle before tou use and its fine.</li>
            <li> The brush I received is solid in construction, but the fibers are really stiff!  I realized it too late when I started brushing my back and I used a decent amount of pressure and later realized I had very small cuts from brushing in two places.  I was confused because other people who purchased it said it was soft.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it is much nicer and cleaner than the wooden versions, which splinter with wear. Exactly like the &amp;#34;Aquasentials Exfoliating Bath Brush (15.5in) (Clear Handle)&amp;#34;. I bought both not realizing that, other than shape, they were the same. Very nice. Would have liked one with a harder brush. It would also be very helpful to find one with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy another one of these to use as a back scratcher! So easy to use and does a great job!  Itch be gone and a much cleaner back!</li>
            <li> Finally a one piece shower brush with stiff bristles for us greaseballs. No more moldy wooden shower brushes that fall apart and were too squishy to begin with to give you a good scrubbing. With this brush you just lightly touch your back for a minute or two and your done. And you don&#x27;t have to worry about the wooden head part falling off and hitting you on the toes or becoming loose and not staying in place on the brush anymore. The head on this brush could be a tiny bit bigger but its not a big deal at all. I love the one piece plastic handle its comfortable to hold and not slippery like the wooden one gets when soapy. Thank goodness I finally found this brush!!</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a bath brush. . it works just like a bath brush.  I enjoy it - so does my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this bath brush.&lt;br /&gt;It has soft bristles that are just what I wanted in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want hard bristles, like from a hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, with the long handle, it helps me to reach some of the tougher places.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush, suds up well in the shower.  You know your skin comes out really clean</li>
            <li> This brush costs twice as much at the local drug store.  It is excellent quality and free delivery to your door.  I use brush at gym shower and have bot brushes for our bathrooms.</li>
            <li> THIS is a great little Amazon deal. Six bucks, it&#x27;s at the house and ready to go... VERSUS walking out to shop for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent !!</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re into sado-masochism, the bristles on this thing are simply too stiff to use!  I tried using it for a few weeks to see if they would soften up, but no dice. Seriously, it will strip the skin right off your back...I can tolerate it on the soles of my feet, but nowhere else.  At least it was cheap, so no big loss.  Maybe I&#x27;ll use it to scrub the tires on my car!</li>
            <li> Brisles are just a little too hard for my tast, other then that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> this AquaBella Long Handle Bath Brush (FREE Super Saver Shipping) is great for getting to the spots on your back that is really hard to get to. and it is perfect for scratching your back ass well.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this brush at a box store a few years back. It seems to be one of the few nylon bristled back brushes left out there for daily scrubbing. Nylon is preferred because natural bristles seem to get mildewed easily. The handle seems plenty long to the users in this household.    I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and I wonder, what do people want for $5?!    It is a brush. The bristles are stiffer when it is wet and soften after use. If you like a harder brush, buy two and rotate them each day so you get firmer bristles. If you like softer bristles, get it wet when you first get in the shower, wash you hair and then use the brush. The bristles will be softer.     Throwing it in the dishwasher once a week helps keep it clean and then throw it away when it isn&#x27;t clean enough.</li>
            <li> Works very well, soft bristles, doesn&#x27;t seem like terribly strong plastic for the handle but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my Retriever. It works out great. Other brushes have a non slip rubber handle, which actually breaks off after a while.. Maybe a long while.. But I prefer this one. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Albeit a bit rough on your back, it does the job perfectly. If you want to exfoliate, this is an excellent brush. If you have very sensitive skin or are not used to exfoliating, this brush may be too harsh for you. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I find the bristles to be too hard. I just wish they were a bit softer as I find I rarely use this because it&#x27;s so unpleasant to scrub with.</li>
            <li> I took a chance with this - especially after reading a review that said metal staples hold the bristles in place (that is not so).    The first time I used it the bristles were really stiff - ouch!  Amazingly, after a couple more uses, the bristles became soft.  Nice!    It turned out to be just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The main problem with the brush is that it will not hold soap------- and therefore it is rather useless in the shower.    To the bristles are too soft.    I am going to use the brushes in the garage for cleaning the wheels of the cars.</li>
            <li> I needed a bath brush to replace the many that I have bought recently.  This one was very reasonably priced and has done a great job so far.  The bristles are gentle and don&#x27;t hurt when you scrub.  The weight is perfect and doesn&#x27;t cause any strain to hold it.  The only issue may be the handle which is plastic.  It is fine, but if you step on it, it may break.  Still at this price I would gladly buy another.</li>
            <li> This bath brush is O.K. The bristles may be a little stiff for sensitive skin. I gave it three stars because I wish the handle was longer and the head was angled a bit.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, moderately firm bristles that get you clean without tearing your skin to pieces. Helps me reach the areas of my back I wouldnt be able to get to on my own! Great for the price!</li>
            <li> Used it for about 3 weeks and it didn&#x27;t work to well. The bristles were too soft for me. Threw it away and currently looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> Purchased after hip replacement surgery, like the bristles and the length, but once you get soap on it the handle becomes too slippery to use. There is a hole where a string could be attached to wrap around your wrist, but my hand still slides up and down the handle making it pretty useless.  Recommend some type of abrasive tape be applied to the handle to allow for a firm grip.  Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush, it does exactly what I needed it to do. Works great, not too rough and not too soft. Only thing is that the handle could be a little longer for easier reach. other than that no complains</li>
            <li> Certainly a good deal! Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to get free shipping on my other purchases.  Better to buy one in person.  The bristles are too soft, not even good for back scratching! The handle is sturdy, might just last forever.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love Olaplex.. My hair has never looked better- EVER! A++&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This brush it hard, although medium to the touch, once used on the body like the back it is very hard.  That is the reason i bought the brush and i still use it but it&#x27;s very painful, so if you are looking for a body brush i wouldn&#x27;t pick this one.  Good brush otherwise though.</li>
            <li> I Got my back ! I bought another and its great for the other parts of the body...whats that exfoliating?...ok enough..lol</li>
            <li> I kept re-soaping the brush and ended up using twice as much because the soap literally dies in these cheap bristles. It&#x27;s a total waste of money. It wasn&#x27;t even decent as a back scratcher.  I don&#x27;t recommend it and I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine except that I would prefer that the handle be about 2\\&quot; shorter and the end had a little roughness to it.  The long smooth handle is hard to hold with soapy hands.  My husband has cut the handle down and used a bandsaw to cut some notches in the handle to allow one to hang on to it with soapy hands - works great now.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money. This in NOT a long handle brush at all. Seems two or three inches too short. The brush is also too soft.      Very disappointed.  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too scratchy and handle is too smooth can slip out of my hand. My old one had a textured handle - much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several back brushes over the years, and none of them has been perfect. This one comes closest though. And at $5, it&#x27;s quite the bargain!  I&#x27;m a guy, and I like a stiffer bristle. This bristle is so stiff, though, that I have to press very lightly - if I press like I normally do, this scratches my back. This is actually a good thing, since I&#x27;ve pressed so hard with other brushes that I&#x27;ve snapped the handle in half. The bristles are rather sparse though, which is my only complaint.  Speaking of the handle, it&#x27;s long enough to reach the middle of my back, but not too long. This handle is plastic, with no rubberized handle cover. This is also a good thing, since I&#x27;ve had a wooden handle with a rubberized handle cover that rotted under the cover after a month or two.  I&#x27;ve had this one a couple of weeks, and it still looks brand new. When it comes time to replace it, I&#x27;ll be getting this one again.</li>
            <li> The worst piece of crap I&#x27;ve ever bought! On the second use, with hardly any pressure at all, the handle snapped in half and the sharp plastic edge scraped me causing deep long cuts that just missed an artery. STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> My itchy dry winter skin is loving this long handled bath brush. The business end is two-sided: one has soft, but effective bristles and the other has hard little nubbins perfect for a scalp massage (while shampooing). Try it! You&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Really awesome brush. I have really dry skin in the winter and this brush makes my skin so soft and nice. It&#x27;s hard enough to feel like you&#x27;re getting good exfoliation without being painful or irritating to the skin. The nubs on the opposite side give a great little massage. Defiantly recommend!</li>
            <li> Simply put the back brush really does serve its purpose. It&#x27;s actually cheaper than other brushes at the local store. I use it everyday and it really feels like it exfoliates the skin. I love it and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Attractive appearance, exactly as advertised. Ideally, I&#x27;d prefer a little softer bristles, but it is wonderful to have.</li>
            <li> It works great!    The handle needs to be just a bit longer, and it would be perfect, but other than that, its fine.</li>
            <li> The bristles are to stiff and hurt my back when I use it to try and wash my back in the shower. This brush would work okay for cleaning the whitewalls on your car tires though.</li>
            <li> My first review, unfortunately it&#x27;s not a good one.  I had a brush I used in the shower and it was great but the handle broke.  So, I just bought another.  The new one was wood.  The brush part was great but the wood deteriorated in the shower over a short period of time with mildew and just falling apart.  (wood and water do not go well together).  So I bought a plastic handle brush.....the problem was.....it felt like the brush part was made of steel....WAY to stiff and scratchy.  So I went to Amazon and bought this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was listed as \\&quot;soft to medium\\&quot;.....it&#x27;s also like the other plastic handle brush.  It&#x27;s way too stiff.  It doesn&#x27;t wash, it scratches the dirt away!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems I have to choose between a wood handle that falls apart or a brush that feels like I&#x27;m using steel wool on my back, legs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well.....I&#x27;m trying to find the company that made the original brush that was so much nicer.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty stiff, but that was what I was looking for.  The staples used to hold the bristles into the brush rusted after a few weeks.  Can&#x27;t really get in there to clean them out.  Probably going to toss it if I can&#x27;t find another use for it.</li>
            <li> This brush is a nice addition to the shower. Well constructed and functional. Good product, good seller, good price.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush, it was convient for the length and really easy to use. The brush is not too hard or soft but holds soap great for brushing in all angles.</li>
            <li> Not so good. I suppose for a smaller person it might work well but at 6&#x27; it&#x27;s a little difficult in reaching all of my back. The handle could have been a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all is well that ends well. I found a  “Bürstenhaus Redecker Beechwood Long Bath Brush with Natural Boar Bristles, 19.7-Inch” under the sink that I forgot I had. It works great. So the “Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush (Clear Handle)” found a new home – under the sink.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I like that the brush seems very sturdy and won&#x27;t fall apart like other wooden ones I purchased in the past.  But the bristles are stiff and they scratch.  A little to rough for me.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for about 3 months.  It has been used gently and hung safely when not in use.  Recently it broke in my hand as I was using it.  The break was above where the handle meets the bristles.  Do not waste your hard earned $$ on this product.  I&#x27;m stunned that a plastic handle would break at all!</li>
            <li> I think it works well and feels great on skin, rinses clear so no residue.  my back is very happy.</li>
            <li> Sturdy plastic.  Supper cheap.  A little stiff on the bristles, but like.  It has a nice curve on the end which makes it an easy reach.</li>
            <li> i purchased this based on other reviews.  My satisfaction is not quite up to theirs.  The long handle is way too SHORT.  The medium soft bristles are more realistically medium hard.  I have an injured shoulder and needed something to wash my back without the contortions a normal person can make.  This item is not it.  Its attractive...but who checks the shower for pretty stuff? I felt like i was removing the top layer of skin and, once again, the handle is just too short.  Had to go to a store to find something that actually worked</li>
            <li> Used it several times.  It is durable and easy to use.  I was hoping for something a little larger than this.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.  After one use the brush crumbled. I wasn&#x27;t putting pressure on it.&lt;br /&gt;I would hope it would last more then ONE use.</li>
            <li> I love this brush !  It works as both back scratcher and bath brush I cannot reach my feet well and this clears off dead skin better than a pumice with less skin damage,</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife but she couldn&#x27;t brush her back with this. The fibers are too hard, Not for human use at all. Even for me, I simply can&#x27;t brush my back without pain and leaving red marks on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> great brush works great love it comfort it works great&lt;br /&gt;gave it a five star rating that is all I have to say</li>
            <li> This is a great bath brush! My husband loves it. It is long enough so you can actually reach your whole back. And the handle grooves help you hold onto it. When wet the bristles are soft and not scratchy. It&#x27;s sturdy and holds up well with use. Overall this is a very good product for the price...a real bargain.</li>
            <li> In home health care I reorder this item frequently for my use with patients. Since I do not get reimbursed it is the best value now on Amazon, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> ****DO NOT BUY **** Did not last through one use - it literally disintegrated into pieces with nothing but the handle left!</li>
            <li> This brush is a good buy.  The bristles are not too soft or too stiff and scratchy.  There are textured handle grooves that make it fairly easy to grip.  It came with a short looped cord or add your own longer one to put your fingers through for a better grip.  The color I received was clear, not blue as in the current picture.  So you may get a different color.  If it were a little longer, it would be better. It is only about 14 inches long.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said it was so stiff that it hurt the skin on your back. I found it was just right for me. Try it out.</li>
            <li> The handle could be three inches longer but other than that I love this brush.  I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Great and long handle a plus</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff so I put an old sock over it.</li>
            <li> I can handle the pain, but I would not recommend it for someone who have sensitive skin the bristles are a little bit tough on my back.</li>
            <li> This bath brush does a lot of work for the price.  I have had more expensive bath brushes made with wood but they do mildew quickly.  This is the first plastic one I have used.  I wet the bristles first and they do soften with soap and water.  Works great on the toes as well. Pleasant color.</li>
            <li> I guess I thought the brush part would be bigger from looking at the picture, but it seems a bit smallish for a back brush. It&#x27;s straight, so no angle makes it still difficult to reach parts of the back; then you have to transfer it and work from the bottom up to get the lower parts. I like the texture, but its not what I wanted. I still don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting my back good and clean with this. Will continue looking for something better.</li>
            <li> Got mold deep inside the bristle area.  Threw out less than a year.  Short handle and worked okay, but the rapid molding turned me off.</li>
            <li> not sure what color mine is even though just got done using it, lol, it&#x27;s nice though, lathers up good with irish spring, my back is so bad with zits this was a must, and my back feels clean, comes in nicer color think it&#x27;s clear green or clear blue or something, good brush would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the long handle for reaching my back and the bottoms of my legs. I don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure on the brush because it is somewhat stiff. It holds soap really good.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right.  Like the 3 bears, not too hard, not too soft, just right.  I bought both this oval and the round brush heads of this.  The round has a sharper curve in the handle than the oval.  ONE CAVEAT:  The ribs on the handle, shown in the pic go in the wrong direction.  This is some kind of lucite/plastic, which is sweet for keeping clean, but SLIPPERY as heck!  This makes it hard to get proper pressure of bristles to back at some angles and the ribs just don&#x27;t help.  Very frustrating but it is otherwise such a nice brush that I&#x27;m looking for a way to improve the grip, even if it means destroying that sleek/clean look of the handle... maybe adding some grip type material like I add to the underside of my shoulder strap on my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush...stiff enough to do the job without peeling skin.  Nice long handle..reaches where I need it and beyond.  I have some problems bending and this brush is ideal for washing my feet too.  Now if it just had a cord so I could plug it in and it would scrub my back without my help.  I guess that is asking too much, huh?</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiff and don&#x27;t lather as efficiently as I might like, and the handle is a bit slippery with wet hands. However, it is easy to rinse off and keep clean, and doesn&#x27;t crack or mold like wooden/bristle bath brushes do in the humid environment of a shower. Overall, would recommend, as it gets the job done, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Have had for a month or so, so can&#x27;t comment on mold.  It lathered up just fine for me.  The one thing I did notice was the surprisingly short handle.  I have used bath brushes for over a decae and have never felt like a handle was too short until I used this one ... the first couple of times I used it, I definitely had to strain a bit to reach parts of my back. I&#x27;m medium height at 5&#x27;8&amp;#34;, so beware if you&#x27;re that height or taller.</li>
            <li> I can finally reach the underside of my applebag!</li>
            <li> I like this little bath brush a lot, it arrived on time in excellent condition. Even though I bought it as a back brush, and I do wash my back with it, it is a little short to be considered \\&quot;convenient\\&quot; for washing your back. I do like it as an all around bath brush though. It is not to soft or to stiff in the bristle department. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I can&#x27;t reach the middle of my back to scrub when I take a shower or bath.  I&#x27;ve tried those oblong-type washcloths, but they don&#x27;t have enough pressure to get the job done.  I like this back srcubber because it is strong enough to clean my back, but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate while I&#x27;m scrubbing.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I agree with some of the other reviews, it should be longer.  I wish about 4 inches longer, and it&#x27;d be perfect!  However, its not a huge issue, when I use it in the shower I can scrub my back from above my shoulder, and then from below to get my lower back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can&#x27;t tell from the pictures, but the brush needles are held in place by glue, not staples as I think someone else had written.  No rust should occur on this since it&#x27;s all plastic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bath brush for my father and the size is ok, but the color I thought was supposed to be clear but it is clearly a light purple.  The brush head could be a little larger but now I will have to buy another one because I can&#x27;t give him a purple one.</li>
            <li> Soap doesn&#x27;t really stay on the bristles, so the brush doesn&#x27;t develop a decent lather.  Works better as a back scratcher. Maybe would be OK for a bath, but not a shower.</li>
            <li> use it everyday.. great brush</li>
            <li> I was having problems finding a bath brush locally. There were a number of wooden brushes (yuck}, scrubbies on a handle that flop around and don&#x27;t work, or highly over priced ones. This brush fulfilled my needs at a reasonable price with very quick shipping. I&#x27;m now one happy clean backed camper!</li>
            <li> The brush is too rough... it hurts my skin so i stopped using it. Although, left in the shower after a month, it started rusting..  Not that great.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding a long handled shower brush and after reading all the positive reviews about this product, had decided to give it a try! It was worth the money and the massage side feels great on my back and the brush side is great for scrubbing those hard to reach spots.  Glad I got this plastic one vs. a typical wooden one.</li>
            <li> Great brush to apply Nair to my back.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my grandmother as she can&#x27;t reach her back while taking a bath. She wanted something that also scratches her back effectively and this serves that purpose as well.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect and easy to use because of it&#x27;s length!</li>
            <li> Better for scrubbing toes and elbows than your back-- the bristles are really, really stiff and sometimes ouchie. But some people want that.</li>
            <li> I share other peoples feeling that this product would be almost perfect if the handle was about 4 inches longer.  I am able to wash my whole back by reaching down from my shoulders and then twisting it around and working up from my waist.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this rusted after less than four months of hanging in the shower (not in direct spray) and being used only a handful of times. The base and top surface of the bristles turned reddish-brown. I soaked it in bleach all day in case it was mildew, but that didn&#x27;t help. I really liked it until it rusted.</li>
            <li> A little to firm in the bristles but its good</li>
            <li> its ok, it would be a lot better if their were some kind of anti-slip bumps on the handle, its very hard to hold on to with soap on your hands</li>
            <li> Hits all the right spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I have sensitive skin and the brush turned it red and made it hurt. If you have really sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not that hard and it&#x27;s really slippery and short, little bit disappointed with it I went out bought a different one that was a little bit longer had a better grip</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised, however it gets mildew ridden pretty quickly.  The brush lasted for about 6 months and then went into the trash.  Prior to collecting mildew, it worked as intended.  Bottom line: it&#x27;s good for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact brush at a Wal-Mart.  I&#x27;m surprised to see that a few other reviewers say that the bristles are too soft for them (others say too hard).  For me, they were too hard!  I couldn&#x27;t apply much pressure for fear of feeling scratched.  I wanted something that I could use to apply my acne treatment easily to my back (I have a medicated body wash that I picked up over the counter), and the bristles barely hold a lather.  I have to make sure I point the shower head away so that the meager lather that it does hold won&#x27;t get lost as I scrub.  It works, and I can see how other people may have a different opinion of it.  But I think something like this is probably best purchased in a store so that you can get a feel of it before buying.  Otherwise, I think you&#x27;re taking a small risk with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best bath brush that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is very light weight and easy to manipulate, as well as having very soft bristles.  Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I might have preferred stiffer bristles but, this is a great brush that is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> This bath brush hurts on the skin!  The bristles are way too hard.  The only place that it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much is on the back.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.  Oh well; maybe I can use the brush to clean the shower - it&#x27;s hard enough!</li>
            <li> Good tough bristles that have exfoliated my skin well.  I like the &amp;#34;massaging bumps&amp;#34; on the backside.  Wish the ribbon tied to the loop was a little longer and made of rope or string.  I expect this product to fall off my hook in the shower multiple times over the month or two that I plan on using it.</li>
            <li> If you want to feel clean and have smooth skin, then this is the scrubber for you. It&#x27;s perfect for your legs because it exfoliates and leaves your skin smooth and crack free. A+++++</li>
            <li> Easy grip handle on this brush which makes it easy for effective body scrubbing. Lightweight easy to handle for disabled or elderly.</li>
            <li> The handle needs to be a few inches longer. I am only 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; &amp; still fell it is not long enough! Other than that, it is a nice quality brush for the money.</li>
            <li> if you are only going to use this for short term or once in a while its good.  the handle broke on mine so it had to be thrown away.  not good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Way too hard for your back it will scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted a back brush so I ordered two of these since the price was so good. I think the bristles are way too rough. We prefer natural bristles. I use it to brush the cat. She loves it and I don&#x27;t have to stretch to reach her!</li>
            <li> It works.... It is very stiff. The handle is too short. I was looking for a long handle scrub brush to use in the shower. This one works, but I am handicapped and reaching certain part of my body in the shower is a problem. If the handle was about 4\\&quot; longer it would be great. I like the curve of the handle for getting around curves on the body.</li>
            <li> nice bristle quality; scrubby &amp; not too soft. attractive &amp; grips help. the face is smallish, tho, imho, 1st thought was like a large toothbrush. oh well.</li>
            <li> The brush looks like it should be used by a child, not an adult. It is way too short to be used as a back brush.Yes I know that there are other ways to use it, but I am in Afghanistan and my shower stall is limited on space. The bristles are way too stiff for use on skin, I had scratch marks the first time I used it. The angle of the brush is not right for using on your back. I guess I will try another one. I&#x27;ll give this to the mechanics to clean the trucks.</li>
            <li> I really like these bath brushes. The bristles are just right and the reach on them is great. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had to purchase 4 of them so far because I&#x27;ve snapped 2 of them in the middle of the plastic handle with my apparently overaggressive scrubbing techniques. So I have one currently in use now and 1 more waiting in backup for the next inevitable handle snap.</li>
            <li> We purchased this to clean the dogs. It will serve its purpose but I wish the bristles were a little longer and stiffer.</li>
            <li> Bristles have give so youre not getting scratched up but still exfoliating. Lasts forever. Nothing more to say really. The end.</li>
            <li> 3.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;REALLY rough, tough, firm bristles... and I wanted firm bristles. I thought my old brush was too soft, but this one literally feels like a coarse sandpaper. It hurts my back, but it&#x27;s amazing for my feet. The odd (massaging?) plastic bumps on the backside feel weird to me so I don&#x27;t use them, but maybe some people would; IDK.&lt;br /&gt;If - over time - the brush loosens and/or softens it might become great... otherwise I only seldom use it for harsh exfoliation on my back, and more often for my feet.</li>
            <li> This is great at exfoliating the back during showers! It started rusting after about a month in the shower. I sprayed some CLR and it look as good as new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these, and the heads of both of them broke in half.  The first lasted a few years before it broke, so it was forgivable.  The second was less than two months old.  I didn&#x27;t drop it; I didn&#x27;t hit it; I just used it to wash my back--and I&#x27;m not he-man either, so there was no excuse.  There&#x27;s either a problem with the plastic, or they&#x27;ve simply made the material in the head too thin.  I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for my next back brush.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s just a back brush for in the shower.  The bristles are a bit tough, but I prefer that, and they&#x27;ll soften over time with use anyway.  It gets the job done well, and isn&#x27;t over priced like so many of the &amp;#34;prettier&amp;#34; back brushes out there.</li>
            <li> Long enough to reach whole back, or just get from side  i&#x27;m 6&amp;#34;2 ,  bristles are on brittler side like some other commenters mentioned so run under hot water first, I try and alternate days using since i&amp;#34;m just starting out using one,</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE BY DISABLE SENIOR. I HAVE HARD TIME TO FIND IT. THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE TRY TO CLEAN THE BOTTOM OF THE BUSH. I CAN NOT GET 100% CLEAN SO I RELPLACE A NEW ONE.</li>
            <li> This brush is much shorter and the head much smaller than the ones I have been using for the past few years. So it&#x27;s a bit smaller than your typical back brush.While the bristles are nice and firm, they are maybe *too* firm. The first time I used it, my back stung for hours afterwards. This is probably NOT a good brush for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after a few uses, the bristles are falling out. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just excess left over from manufacturing or if it&#x27;s just going to shed completely. I&#x27;ll update my review as time passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works for me, but it sort of looks like this product should have been called \\&quot;Back Brush, Jr.\\&quot; Definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush like this that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;scrubability&amp;#34; is (as Goldilocks would say about Baby Bear&#x27;s porridge) &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;  Now that I know what this one is like I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
            <li> I received this brush and I did not remember ordering it (I am 82 so maybe that is why) anyway I am glad I have it because it is a great brush for my back.</li>
            <li> The bristles painfully scrape my skin.  I was appalled when the brush arrived with a label advising me to replace it every 1-3 months.  I never would have purchased if I&#x27;d known this in advance.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The first inexpensive shower brush that I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t feel like I was mauling myself with a joshua tree. It&#x27;s not as soft as puppy fur, but I don&#x27;t have to talk myself into using it every day. The only drawback is the handle; It gets a little slick if you let soap get onto it. Other than that.. it&#x27;s a cheap shower brush, so expectations have been met.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush not because I wanted a bath brush but because one reviewer said that it was hard bristled, EXACTLY what I was looking for. Most bath brushes are soft bristled or soft boar bristle, ALL the Back Scratcher&#x27;s are those monkey hand wood or plastic things that are worthless, so my husband first suggested a toilet brush...okay, seriously NOT acceptable! Ha! But then said, what about a bath brush? So I searched Amazon&#x27;s reviews for the perfect brush and this one IS The Perfect Back Scratcher!&lt;br /&gt;Much too hard for a Bath Brush in my opinion unless you...like...the sensation of a hard bristle hair brush on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;But definitely the best Back Scratcher everrrrr!</li>
            <li> If anything this is TOO soft!  Haha, I found it funny after reading some others said it was too hard.    If anything the handle should be extended another 4-6\\&quot;.  It would be perfect so far has not fallen apart and is doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li> IF this is what you&#x27;re looking for.  Fine quality, just fine ---  I , however,  was hoping for a brisker scrub brush.  This is &#x27;soft&#x27;  and of high quality  IF....</li>
            <li> This thing was five dollars and it is effective and easy to use.  I find the bristle stiffness ideal.  I use it as a back brush, and as an over-all brush.  Limitations in mobility make me take a bath instead of a shower.  This &amp;#34;back brush&amp;#34;  is used on all the areas of my body I can reach, and that to good effect.  Would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Plastic bristles, plastic handle--can&#x27;t go wrong with one like this. And unlike the wood-and-boar&#x27;s-hair brushes that are so popular right now, it&#x27;s not at risk of getting moldy or coming unglued. The bristles are a little stiffer than boar&#x27;s hair, but i happen to like a good, stiff brush for scrubbing down with, so that&#x27;s another plus in my book.</li>
            <li> handle is a little short for me being really tall but the brush is solid and the brissels very firm.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good one. The bristles are stiff but not too much so. The only thing I would change is the handle length. I wish it were just an inch or two longer. Other than that, great product.    EDIT 04-16-2011:  Well, this brush suffered the same fate as my last one today. The head busted in half while I was using it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the combination of the heat and dryness here in Arizona or what. I guess I&#x27;ll get a wooden brush now.</li>
            <li> This is my first bath brush and it does the trick.....good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I should have known, great price but the handle is too short.  I&#x27;m not tall and the handle is still too short</li>
            <li> I am not sure how good of an exfoliating job this brush does, but it certainly does a good job of scratching up my back. There certainly is a difference between exfoliation and scratching--i.e., scratching does not necessarily mean that it&#x27;s exfoliating, and exfoliating doesn&#x27;t necessarily require scratching as an effect. Based on other reviews on Amazon, I understand that it takes awhile for this brush to become softer, but I&#x27;m not sure how many more uses my back can endure before my skin is rubbed completely raw (and I certainly don&#x27;t use this brush on a daily basis). Note that I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but also that I don&#x27;t use this brush vigorously either. I try to be delicate. I can&#x27;t really complain about this product though because it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to everyone.  The handle is long enough to reach those areas you can&#x27;t.  Sturdy handle.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are just what I hoped for: neither too stiff or not stiff enough. If the handle was 6&amp;#34; longer it would be perfect. I shopped around for an all-plastic bath brush with a longer handle but could not find anything, so this model was a compromise. I suppose I could use a piece of PVC pipe to extend the handle.  For the price it&#x27;s okay.  The ridges on the handle help you keep a grip on it when your hands are soapy.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is, so it&#x27;s hard to give this a bad review! My wife needed something to rub off dead skin and this does the job really well and makes her skin feel extra smooth.</li>
            <li> does it job, but definitely not smoothly. it took some time to get used to, and the bristles weren&#x27;t as hard or perfectly straight anymore, still, it isn&#x27;t a soft feel if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Long enough to reach toes and back. Nice exfoliant for back, heels, elbows and legs. I also like it because the handle is not made of wood, which means that it can be washed and is less prone to germs.</li>
            <li> A little rough on skin</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s those spots I cannot while showering.</li>
            <li> i use this brush for the intended uses and it works great for me. and it scrubs my skin very nicely. i feel very refreshed after using it with soap to massage and scrub my skin. it rinses out very easily. good product!</li>
            <li> Bristles are a bit stiff but it works for what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite small and the bristles are a bit stiff, but then again it&#x27;s also cheap.</li>
            <li> Construction wise, this brush is excellent. But I think many of the reviewers who report that it&#x27;s long enough to reach your whole back must be awfully small people. I&#x27;m not so big, and I can barely reach to the center of my back — and even so, with enough difficulty that you&#x27;re not going to get much scrubbing done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another 4 to 6 inches of handle please?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is pretty small too, and unnecessarily angled inward. Like the bristles. No you can&#x27;t please everybody. But this is definitely child sized.</li>
            <li> I have a much longer-handled, larger, wooden bath brush that I use occasionally, but it&#x27;s really too rough for most uses, though I can easily reach all over my back with it. I got this one because I wanted something softer for more frequent use and this works well. It&#x27;s not nearly as long as the other one I have, but I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price like another reviewer mentioned the handle does seem a little short. Bristles are soft but not too soft.  If the handle were longer i would give this five stars</li>
            <li> Small and flimsy compared to your drug store variety back brush. It works and all, but meh...next time I&#x27;ll go for something else.</li>
            <li> The description said the handle is 14 inches. Its not, the overall length is 14 inches; the handle length is 10.5 inches. Too short to reach my back with. I would say the bristles are medium-stiff not medium-soft. To get a lather worked up you need to put on a lot of soap.</li>
            <li> The thin &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; breaks easily during normal use or even dropping on a hard surface (like bottom of a bathtub!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This inferior, poorly-engineered item looks almost identical to other products and is easy to confuse. Most easily recognised by the series of little &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; on back side opposite bristles, which don&#x27;t show in product photographs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID!!!</li>
            <li> Nice for putting lotion on at end of shower</li>
            <li> Ok, but brush-head somewhat to small for my liking.</li>
            <li> If this is long handled, what is short handled?  Handle is standard length, no longer than the brushes they sell in dollar stores.  Not your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are brutally stiff. And the handle is definitely not long, which means the name of the product is inaccurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it a few times. The handle is barely long enough (I&#x27;m 6&#x27; tall) but it requires an uncomfortable reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted, it&#x27;s also hard to get the soap onto the brush. It doesn&#x27;t take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was cheap, but in this case I got what I paid for. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It will last a lifetime (at least for this senior). But, I may have no skin left on my back!  The bristles are very stiff and sharp, and exfoliate rather than scrub.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised once I received my new bath brush.  I was concerned after reading several reviews that mentioned that it felt like sand paper when using this brush.  But I found it to be great on my back.  The description of \\&quot;Long-Handle\\&quot; may not mean that it is any longer than any other bath brush...it just simply means that it is a typical length for a brush of this type. Great price and all is well so far!</li>
            <li> Turns out, quite a lot actually.  I was using this brush to scrub my back and it felt really nice, and then the most amazing thing happened.  A magical leprechaun appeared before me!  I think it was because the brush handle was green, and I was using it with Irish Spring soap on St Patrick&#x27;s Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the leprechaun said I got 3 wishes.  My first wish was for my own velociraptor.  He was great.  I named him \\&quot;Eaty\\&quot; because he loved eating.  Unfortunately he ate a bunch of people in my neighborhood, some of them children, so I had to use my second wish to get rid of him, and my third so I would not get in trouble for it.  But still, it was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot guarantee that you will have the same experience as me, but even if you do not this is still a good shower brush.  The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because the leprechaun said I could not wish for additional wishes, and I felt that was not fair.</li>
            <li> it is ok, but the handle is too short.</li>
            <li> Not my first experience with the product and this vendor. I keep using it and coming back with the same transactions, over and over.I am quite satisfied with the purchase and use. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Handle could be longer</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband and I just asked him what he thinks of it. He said, &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34; When we took it out of the box he wanted me to send it back because the handle didn&#x27;t have rubber at the molded grip area. But at $5, we decided, what the heck. Well, he loves it. The grip is just fine. He thought he would be losing his grip on it in the shower, but he doesn&#x27;t. And, just a note, the picture makes it look like it&#x27;s a clear purple, but it&#x27;s just clear - no color.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, but they do not scratch or irritate.  The handle seems to be a comfortable length for me.  I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;, and my arm reach is not very far.  However, the handle seems to be adequate for me to reach all parts of my back form the top down or from the bottom up.  We leave the brush in the shower, and it seems to dry nicely each day without leaving a moldy smell.</li>
            <li> Decent product, good for cleaning as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a great price. I primarily use this brush to wash my back. The bristles are stiff enough to feel like it is providing a good clean but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel as though it is taking off any skin. Not sure what else I can say about it!</li>
            <li> This brush is probably fine for small people, but it is too short, and the brush is too small for me.  Had to return it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a brush that is a little hard but this brush hurts and leaves my skin red. I now use it for my feet instead.</li>
            <li> Medium to stiff bristles,  not too soft</li>
            <li> Gets the job done well. I use it to put medicine on a rash I have on my back.</li>
            <li> The handle is so unexpectedly short and the bristles are kind of weak. However, it is adequate in terms of price:quality ratio.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little too stiff for me, to the point where it hurts my skin as I&#x27;m scrubbing. I just wanted to be able to reach my back. I do have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> Great brush. It feels very sturdy in my hand, and I can scrub with it very hard. I am extremely muscular (bench press 340 pounds) and do not feel like this will break easily (as I have a tendency to accidentally break things). For the price, this is a very good item. My only complaint (a very minor one) is that the string that comes as a loop through the handle&#x27;s hole feels kind of cheap. The brush and bristles feel very high quality. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome...I have trouble washing my feet and this helps me...this product came out exactly the way it looks and was delivered to me on time....I would recommend to anyone who looked at this product...it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that had been mixed regarding whether this bath brush was soft or hard. It feels soft to the hand, but when used on my back, it is just like sandpaper. If you are looking for sandpaper, this is the brush for you. I used it for a few days (just to wash my back) and had to stop because it was so irritating. I stopped two days ago and can still feel my back hurting as I write this. I will toss it and find something locally.</li>
            <li> Worked just great until the brush snapped in half after about 6 months of use.  What is interesting is, I wasn&#x27;t applying that much pressure to the brush when it broke.</li>
            <li> This is the best bath brush that I have ever had. I have been searching around for the right one, for a long time! The wooden ones mildew, the plastic ones are not as harsh as the wooden ones and in general, either they have short handles, soft brushes or they are flimsy and they break! Overall, it is one big headache to just find the proper product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a heavy duty, hardcore, long handle, hard brush which does not mildew and is rough enough to get all the dead skin off my back, knees, inner elbows and all the hard to reach places! I was looking for a brush that was built to last, strong enough to perform, does not mold easily and harsh enough brush to really scrub hard and get all the dirt and dead skin off my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this brush has all the qualities! To my surprise, it was not too good to be true. After a lifetime of searching for the right one, I have finally found the right one! This brush is not a toy, but a heavy duty, long handle rough brush which lasts. I have put it to test over and over and it has been as good as new after months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tip for you to not allow your back brush to be molded. Do not put it head down on the bath tiles where the brush tips touch the tiles and wetness, because wetness brings mold. Put the brush head up leaning on a side wall tile while the handle is on the horizontal tile. I just use a bath bucket and along with my other bath stuff, I leave this brush standing vertically while leaning on the wall tile. This way the brush tip airs out and the moisture does not get a chance to create mold on your brush. Also leave a window open a bit (if you have one) so air circulates and dries off the brush. This way your brush will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these and they are rough and hardcore brushes. They scrub so hard. I know the brush works because my back does not itch anymore due to dead skin! No more need for back scratchers. This brush does its job and so far it is a long lasting product which the brush heads simply do not go soft and bend. I recommend this brush for all who need a rough, hardcore brush which can really scrub and last long.nd so far it is a long lasting product which the brush heads simply do not go soft and bend. I recommend this brush for all who need a rough, hardcore brush which can really scrub and last long.</li>
            <li> This back brush is just perfect. Not too soft, nor too hard.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably attractive, nice looking, and nice-feeling brush. It feels good on the skin, and is great for soaping those hard-to-reach areas, like the spot between your shoulder blades. One minor point against it...I wish it had a longer handle. But considering that this model costed noticeably less than those with longer handles, I still think it was a great deal and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay bath brush, I like that the bristles are stiff and scratchy, but it&#x27;s not long enough for me to reach the middle of my back no matter how I reach.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;11&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and when I wash it sometimes the conditioner residue stays on my back and makes me itch even after rinsing.  I bought this to scrub my back clean.  This is the perfect brush for both scrubbing and scratching without being too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li> It does all I  expected.</li>
            <li> A solid brush with sturdy bristles. The bristles might be a bit too stiff for some and even with just water on the handle it can be a bit hard to hold in the shower. I’d give this a five star if the handle was a bit long and was somehow made easier to hold.</li>
            <li> Very firm bristles, if you like that. Great deal.</li>
            <li> SUPER hard scratchy bristles. Wish they were softer, gave my back marks.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; handle brush is perfect in every way - for a short person. The handle is indeed 14-inches and the bristles are firm enough for a nice scrub. But for somebody of size 46-long with a 78-inch arm span, this is more like a nail brush than a back brush. Think 24-inches instead of 14-inches.</li>
            <li> Basic nylon-bristled bath brush, there isn&#x27;t much to say about it. It is perfect for reaching your back in the shower and other hard to reach places, provided you like a good scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it this way, reading the other comments it seems that others find the brush to be too stiff.</li>
            <li> I love it!  My back was permanently sprained in 2005 and this is just perfect for cleaining it where I cannot reach without reinjuring it.  Thank you!  I do wish the handle was a color other than clear... it is easy to misplace.</li>
            <li> I use this back bush everyday and the bristles have not bent or become soft. It is just right if your skin is not too sensitive or skin condition then I would not recommend using too often.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed the handle is not long at all. no way should it be called a long handle</li>
            <li> Forgot I bought this quite a while ago. After about 2 months, all the bristles started falling out. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly and is good shape.  This product is very functional and longer than most similar items I have had.  The bristles are sturdy, but soft enough that they are comfortable to use.  I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> First things first, this is a rather intense brush. I haven&#x27;t used something like this in a few years and was put off when I scrubbed my arm with these unusually stiff bristles. They feel a bit like sandpaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fine with it because I tell myself it must be doing a really good job of scrubbing off dirt and oil. I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that you can put body wash in the bristles and it will come out when you scrub with the brush. That saves a lot of liquid -- and when every motion feels like a cat scratch, you want to finish as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a good while now and it still is in as good a quality now, as the day it arrived. It&#x27;s light and has a good grip.</li>
            <li> The bristles are secure and haven&#x27;t fallen out like my last back brush.  The bristles are somewhat firm and feels good as you use it. The massage side is not really useful.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very sturdy and strong</li>
            <li> The brush works OK - but the handle should be at least one inch longer.  I stored my previous brush in the space between the wall and my grab bar.  This one is too short to stand up straight - it keeps falling into the tub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably exactly what you expect.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a sturdy grade of plastic, bristles give a good scrubbing but not painful, handle length is perfect for reaching my back.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a small ribbon for hanging it from a hook.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews a little closer.  As stated by someone else, the handle on the brush is too short making it useless to use in the shower if you are tall.  I have found a Earth Therapeutics Feng Shui back brush at a local pharmacy which has a much longer handle, cost $6.99 and is exactly what I needed.  It would be helpful if the description of the product would mention the length of the handle.  Other than that, the brush seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> very good job on my back.</li>
            <li> I have had all kinds of these brushes. This one seems to be  equal or better quality to more expensive brushes. Works well too.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my grandmother, but after hearing her rave about it I think I want one!  It&#x27;s nothing special that you can&#x27;t get in any drug store, but it arrived quickly and was just as cheap (even with shipping) as those you can buy in store.</li>
            <li> I actually liked this brush. Was a good price and size. I love that the bristles were firm enough to actually scrub and clean. The handle is actually longer than it looks in the advertisement which is helpful when scrubbing your back.</li>
            <li> The first one worked so well, I bought several, one for each family member and another for me.  After trying others that failed, this is my brand forever.  Its great for reaching unreachable parts of your back!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, easy to grasp, won&#x27;t deteriorate like wood, &amp; the bristles do the job of cleaning &amp; making my back feel good, cheaply. That&#x27;s all I want or expect.</li>
            <li> Handle 6 inches shorter than others I have owned and is way to short for anything but a child.  The bristles are still and will surly remove the top layer of skin.  The handle is slick, smooth and thin, hard to hold onto when wet.</li>
            <li> I got this for our tub and its great has a feature on the back for a massage best buy</li>
            <li> It looks like clear purple. One of the reviews said clear purple. That was why I chose this over another one. Its clear. No color. Just clear.</li>
            <li> Item was as described. Im very happy with the product. Great Seller.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered three of these brushes at a time. Over time and usage they will get brittle and, if dropped, split. But I love them for showering. I&#x27;ve tried others but much prefer these bamboo brushes. I just keep extras on hand.</li>
            <li> Got this for my guy because he wanted to be able to wash his back in the shower but hasn&#x27;t been able to find a brush that&#x27;s not hard and scratchy.  Got this one because it says \\&quot;soft\\&quot; in the title.  When it arrived it feels soft but again, in the shower it&#x27;s still too hard.  I thought maybe he just has more sensitive skin, but I tried it and it still is a bit rough.  It will be going to the dog to chew up.</li>
            <li> Come on, it&#x27;s a bath brush!  The hendle could be three inches longer but other than that it works good.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this based on other reviews stating it is to hard.  I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and took a chance because I LOVE it!  I have normal skin and it&#x27;s not too hard at all for me.  I actually bought a body brush along with this and the body brush is a bit hard, but this gives the perfect brush on my skin!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fit the bill for length or durability. Broke right at handle. Don&#x27;t recommend buying an item like this if you have a long back and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Not long enough. I found this to be several inches shorter than the brush I wanted to replace. Might work fine for a child or small adult or one with exceptional flexibility. Otherwise, it seems to be made well enough. I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for most.</li>
            <li> This works really nicely.  The handle is long enough for easy reach behind the back. The only gotcha is the rigidity of the bristles.  The bristles may feel too stiff at times, so this may not be suitable for older folks.</li>
            <li> This is much better than what it was replacing... a year old long handle wooden one with a brush on one side and a cellulite massager on the other. The problem with the wood one was one side had to rest against the shelf in my surround so the other side would get moldy... this one doesn&#x27;t have that problem. The bristles are stiff but I like it for defoliating my back so I&#x27;ll get use to it. It is on the cheap side but since I knew what I was buying I have to give it 5-stars and at about 5 bucks with free shipping I have no major complaints.</li>
            <li> The bristles are much stiffer than a similar natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Tough bristles- can hurt a bit when scrubbing, but this is subjective I guess. It&#x27;s okay for me as my skin is tough enough. Some people complain about the length being too short, but I don&#x27;t have any problems with that (however, this is my first shower brush, and my arms are pretty flexible).</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty rough. I&#x27;m hoping that they soften with use.</li>
            <li> This is a very stiff brush. I only use it on my feet. The clear handle means it is almost invisible.</li>
            <li> Bristles a little stiff for my preference and the handle is a little short.  Otherwise good for the price</li>
            <li> The bristles may seem too soft at first touch but are really pretty firm in the shower. They may be too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The Long handle made this easy to reach my back and the brush is easy to clean.  I would buy the same brush when I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> Good Deal and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. Good Deal and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. Good Deal and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The bristles were very soft and the handle is long enough to reach any spot you would want. However, over time the bristles have gotten a bit harder. If you want a bit more quality go for a wooden handled variant.</li>
            <li> It does the job. The bristles are soft and scrub away all the dead skin and dirt gently and effectively reaching in all the hard places.</li>
            <li> In a few months, this brush will have been scrubbing my families&#x27; backs for three years!  It has the perfect touch--not too stiff, but firm enough to clean.  The handle fits well and the length is just right, offering good control when being used.  Usually, I expect to replace back brushes annually or at best, every two years, because the bristles break down with constant, wet use.  But, this one just might see me into retirement.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice but you can just get something similar from your local CVS.</li>
            <li> Stiff brush and long-enough handle makes it cleaning your back pretty easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d be even better if:&lt;br /&gt;1)  The head were angled to allow for better scrubbing leverage and&lt;br /&gt;2)  The bristles were softer. The product name says \\&quot;medium-soft,\\&quot; but in reality it&#x27;s medium hard and will be too stiff for anyone with sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Clear, so it blends with all decors, not too soft and not too stiff...&#x27;just right&amp;#34; as Goldilocks said.</li>
            <li> Good quality. I never used one of these before. It is slippery if you have soap on your hand, but I think they all are. I would like it to be longer, but most of these are 14 inches. I have found that if I squirt liquid soap right on the brush my hands don&#x27;t get slippery and holding the brush is no problem.</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard like I wanted them but handle feels fragile like it&#x27;s going to break.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too stiff.  Was hoping for softer</li>
            <li> This was a good deal.  I am very satisfied the bristles are not too stiff and haven&#x27;t fallen out like with more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve tried.  Also, the plastic handle stays clean unlike some wood handled brushes.</li>
            <li> Handle is hard to hold when wet,too slippery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as described. Looks and feels fine. Handle sturdy, but a little light. Makes the brush head &amp;#34;top heavy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> During the first few uses the bristles will scratch you if you scrub too hard. However, I have no complaints about this item.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  The bristles are a little softer than I wish they were but over all, a real treat.</li>
            <li> The handle is really short for a tall person :(  but other than that it would be ok</li>
            <li> Like the color clear and nice.  The brush is about medeum perfect, not so hard and not so soft for the average guy.</li>
            <li> Purchased 4 full years ago and still going strong.  Best shower brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Period.</li>
            <li> Nice brush but my handle cracked.</li>
            <li> This brush is of good construction but the bristles are to ridged. They scratch the back and is very uncomfortable to use. I will find another use for it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the brushes I gave my grandchildren.  They love to use it when they take their showers.  Great item.</li>
            <li> Depending on what your needs for a bath brush are, this product may or may not be right for you.  I am quite familiar with bath brushes, and have determined over the years that natural horse (or other natural) hair do not satisfy my needs.  The reason being that natural hairs collapse very early in the brush&#x27;s life span, plus I never felt that it scrubbed my body well enough.  Ever since I switched to a bath brush with synthetic bristles, I am much happier with it.  If you are not willing/able to allow your body (especially your stomach, chest &amp; neck) to become accustomed to the \\&quot;tingling sensation\\&quot; caused by synthetic bristles/hairs, then this may NOT be the product for you.  I love this product.  Another plus point of this item is its sufficiently long handle; I can reach every inch behind my back with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does exactly what it says it will do.  I love the shape.  It reaches those hard to reach places on your back while bathing.  It does not mold or mildew while hanging in the shower/tub area and keeps its shape for years.  I highly recommend this product for others.</li>
            <li> This does what it is supposed to do. The price was right.</li>
            <li> Despite the title this brush has a very short handle. If you want a long handle this is not the brush for you.</li>
            <li> This brush HURTS to the point that I can&#x27;t use it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for scrubbing your wheels and tires.</li>
            <li> great!! very scratchy!</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a bath brush. But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> If you prefer a stiff bristle back brush, this is a great brush. I&#x27;ve had it for a while, and the bristles haven&#x27;t softened. If you prefer a long handle brush, this isn&#x27;t for you. It&#x27;s an average length brush. I prefer plastic brushes over wooden ones that harbor bacteria, mildew and creepy,  crawly things. For the price, it&#x27;s a better value than those sold in box stores. I deducted a star, only because the bristles are stiff, rather than soft. Think of it as using a firm toothbrush verses a medium or soft one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Feels sturdy!</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes for the bath and not at all too stiff as some have stated, at least not for my skin. One of the best back brushes I&#x27;ve come across. Ordered two and will most likely be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Pretty in the shower and works great.  Still hoping it lasts longer than the similar one I bought at a local store and I think it will since it seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> This brush (clear) really is unbelievably stiff. That&#x27;s what I thought I was looking for to help me exfoliate, but after two months of use it still feels like a brillo pad on my back. And when you put soap on the bristles, it doesn&#x27;t lather up. It just sinks into the bristles then you have to dig it out. I&#x27;m surprised at all the good reviews. Might be good as a back scratcher but not for cleansing. Unless you hate having skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.  The handle is sturdy and the bristles are just the right level of harshness to scrub my back with.  The ribbon hangs on my shower handle easily.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Find something else, this brush is so stiff it&#x27;s almost painful to use.  I bought something to replace it almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This brush is really too small to be called a back brush.  I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Painful.  Brush is very coarse not at all soft.</li>
            <li> Just the helping hand I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Bought this item in September. In November it fell into the bathtub from the edge, a mere foot, and it shattered... will never buy again.</li>
            <li> The price is right, but the bristles are way too rough and stiff for my skin. It&#x27;s painful to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, that&#x27;s all. when i read other reviews and people complained that it is too short, i didnt think much of it since i&#x27;m a short guy...but it is too short. to do your back. you have to go from the top and then from the lower back. just annoying</li>
            <li> I good brush for decent price. I should be giving if 5 stars but I would prefer a stiffer brush. I am sure for most people it will be stiff enough.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as expected, delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a brush nearly identical in appearance that I have used for years.  There is one subtle difference, however: the bristles on this brush are tiny.  They are also stiff.  Together, using this on your skin is like washing with a thousand tiny needles.  Simply painful.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but firm enough to do the job. I read other reviews before buying the brush and after using it I don&#x27;t know why other people have had trouble. To address a few of the complaints;&lt;br /&gt;The handle seem long enough for me and I am 6&#x27; 5&amp;#34;. I can get all my back from coming over my shoulder or under the shoulder lower back.&lt;br /&gt;Breaking the handle. Anyone who does this is push really hard or the handle is already cracked. If you are pushing that hard you can always move your hand up the handle or over the brush.&lt;br /&gt;It is a plastic handle but I don&#x27;t find it particularly slippery.&lt;br /&gt;I hang it up to air dry. No problem yet. People who do get mold can soak the head and brush area in hydrogen peroxide and that will take care of the probelm. You can save the clear plastic packaging dish that comes on the brush head for puting the brush head in and then fill it with hydrogen peroixide. The hydrogen peroxide is not toxic for this use and will oxidize the mold and kill it.&lt;br /&gt;I would get this brush again.</li>
            <li> It is not hard and not soft. Good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> happy with item because i could not find what i wanted in stores locally&lt;br /&gt;always happy to find what i want on line</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful accessory for people who have issues with stiffness in the arms and upper body. The bristles are just firm enough to give a good cleansing to the skin without injury. The long and sturdy handle makes it a lot easier to reach the outsides of feet and backs of ankles and legs which are ordinarily very difficult for me to reach. Even if I were younger (and not fighting arthritic joints), I would value this brush. It is exceptionally well made and will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> The brush end is too small and the handle is short. Using it is like washing your back with a toothbrush. I like the stiffness of the bristles so I will use it.</li>
            <li> After purchasing wood handled brushes of all types I gave up. Handles of wood break or bristles were to soft. this brush is comfortable to hold . The bristles, Goldilocks would say &amp;#34; not to soft not to hard just right&amp;#34;. I think this brush is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;m stanky and need a shower!</li>
            <li> I use it to lather soap and put it on my back, but it can also be used to discipline obnoxious children ;)</li>
            <li> Love this brush -- not too soft, not too stiff: just right!</li>
            <li> I find the handle a bit to light weight.  The brussels  are very stiff.  Almost like a paint brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is not that long like it states.  It looks as though is a regular length. However, it does get the the job done for the most part.</li>
            <li> the price was right and this brush gets to those hard to get to places on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Like it!</li>
            <li> Seems to work OK, it is just scratchier than I  expected.  Makes a nice back scratcher. No problems.  Shipped and received as expected</li>
            <li> This brush has ver had bristles that do not absorb or spread soap around.  After I received this brush, I randomly saw a wooden brush with soft bristles at Walgreens and picked it up to replace this one.  Buying this product was a mistake.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this product are plastic and stiff. They don&#x27;t hold the soap and do not have a pleasing feel. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a shower brush, but as soon as I removed it from the box and held it aloft, feeling its delicate balance in my hand, waving it about with a heretofore unknown, purely instinctive deftness, I knew it was meant for more than that. WE were meant for more than that. Using my Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush (Clear Handle), I would fight crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only broken up a ring of those people who dig through the bagels with their bare hands at the bakery, but I&#x27;m off to a good start. I&#x27;ve already recruited a sidekick (The Grizzly Bar, a heroic, furry bar of soap), and I&#x27;m interviewing potential nemeses on Tuesday. The handle is just the right length to attack hard-to-reach evil without being cumbersome, and the bristles are firm enough to exfoliate villainy, but not so firm as to irritate its delicate combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution: the brush will NOT return to your hand on its own, no matter how authoritatively you command it. So don&#x27;t throw it.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes - they are a decent brush that isn&#x27;t too hard or too soft.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like (being a tall person) is that the long handle isn&#x27;t all that long when you have a long torso.  Would be nice to have that added length but overall, the brush is very good &amp; I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Works like it should. Bristles are a little stiff. No grip on handle so it gets slippery when wet and soapy.</li>
            <li> Handle short and slippery making it hard to hold. I use to wash my back, and feel bristles are uncomfortable and not functional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine as long as you like a stiff brush.  A simple reasonably-priced product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I managed without this before!</li>
            <li> Title says it all and the handle is way too short.  I would definitely recommend staying away from this product.</li>
            <li> The handle on this bath brush is relatively long and the bristles are soft enough to do the job without roughing up the skin.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to handle...Little bumps a nice touch on back of the brush...&lt;br /&gt;The contour is good. But, it is too stiff for my liking....I&#x27;ll keep it.....not worth it to send it back....But, it is stiff! Some people like a stiff brush....if that&#x27;s you, then you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
