    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The coverage is wonderful and not sticky.</li>
            <li>What a great idea!</li>
            <li>I especially love spraying this around the boobage area before we go riding.</li>
            <li>I would say one of the best &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; deodorants and antiperspirants</li>
            <li>Best anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue on my shirts!!!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!!!</li>
            <li>The Dove formula has always worked well for me, and this spray antiperspirant is honestly some of the best I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li>(the spray is the greatest invention in the deodorant world, honestly), but you can feel the coverage immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great scent and</li>
            <li>2 stars because it smells great....</li>
            <li>This is actually a great antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>have found it to be very effective at odor protection.</li>
            <li>We love Dove, have used their products for years, and this one is awesome!</li>
            <li>This product, however, I was pleasantly surprized by.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Spray being spray, it gets in the air, and although the smell is pleasant, breathing this stuff in is not.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant</li>
            <li>and I never felt they had the superior level of sweat protection that a stick does.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;spray\\&quot; button is cushy and built into the top of the can.</li>
            <li>smells good, works well.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this product and find it to be just as good as any stick and much better than any roll-on.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it works great.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this deodorant!</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this product is the can!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this spray antiperspirant and plan on making this my go to brand!</li>
            <li>perfect for hot &amp; humid Iowa days</li>
            <li>For one, it smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and it is a spray-on antiperspirant rather than a roll on.</li>
            <li>Effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is a feminine mixture of baby powder with notes of  jasmine and rose and it claims to keep you protected for up to 48 hours.</li>
            <li>It works well in this spate of warm weather to prevent perspiration.  </li>
            <li>and I am loving it .</li>
            <li>As an antiperspirant, the product is effective.</li>
            <li>A nice change of pace from a roll on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent antiperspirant, but the real news is the way it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good anti-perspirant/deodorant because I&#x27;m allergic to most.</li>
            <li>I used it and actually liked it.</li>
            <li>I get this on subscribe and save nice way not to have to Remember to get it.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of body spray that used to be so popular in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>but I have to say how nice and refreshing this feels.</li>
            <li>Works well, long-lasting, sweet &amp; pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>goes on invisible, nice and light and an effective antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light floral scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice when not so strong.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used spray antiperspirant for many years</li>
            <li>I love that is</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cake on your clothing like many of the sticks and solids</li>
            <li>but these sprays work better for me than a roll on.  </li>
            <li>really love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more concern of how people here are using it.</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about this antiperspirant!!  </li>
            <li>okay, I&#x27;ll use up this can</li>
            <li>but maybe I&#x27;d better not get used to this</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m unwittingly exposed to all kinds of harmful things, some I even realize but can do nothing about.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m unwittingly exposed to all kinds of harmful things, some I even realize but can do nothing about.</li>
            <li>I like this so much more than the bars.</li>
            <li>just make sure to spray in a well-ventilated area or with the fan turned</li>
            <li>For the most part, I like this.</li>
            <li>I do love that it&#x27;s a spray</li>
            <li>I love spray deodorant.  </li>
            <li>This Dove spray has a nice odor and feels light going on.  </li>
            <li>: I love this stuff</li>
            <li>That gave us a good laugh when we discovered his mishap.</li>
            <li>I was happy with it and through it worked very well, but I would NOT wear it to the gym or during anything strenuous.</li>
            <li>In addition, the sweet powder fragrance is light &amp; pleasant, not over-whelming.</li>
            <li>I used this with caution and am happy to report it hasn&#x27;t caused any issues thus far where my allergy is concerned (will update should that change).</li>
            <li>Most important, there are No skin reactions noted.</li>
            <li>Dove is a brand that consistently offers great reliable products with this deodorant being no exception.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Plus the deodorant/dry spray piece is a clean and refreshing scent that lasts around 36-48 hrs...and leaves the skin feeling nourished.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite strong.  </li>
            <li>one also smells pretty nice for a powdery/floral mix.</li>
            <li>The performance was fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick drying and the moisturizer is welcome on my sensitive</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of spray antiperspirants/deodorants.</li>
            <li>I got to try this for free.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t supposed to use deodorant/antiperspirant prior to the exam, so the facility kindly provides a can of spray antiperspirant spray for those who don&#x27;t want to tote their own for after the exam.</li>
            <li>It is a very fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of the Dove brand as Dove always leaves me feeling amazingly clean and pampered.</li>
            <li>, this is quick drying and easy and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much always loved and used Dove products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it isn&#x27;t summer time, I haven&#x27;t really been able to test its drying factor, but it seems like a good deodorant so far.</li>
            <li>So, I was thrilled when they offered me their new spray antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray is dry and works great.</li>
            <li>It smells great but does not live up to its name.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I won&#x27;t go out of my way to purchase this antiperspirant/deodorant in the future, it&#x27;s a good &amp;#</li>
            <li>I loved the scents, but I felt that they ran short in the odor protection department.</li>
            <li>, solids have always been good enough for me, etc.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m OK with that because I like the product so much.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad deodorant.  </li>
            <li>While there are improvements here to old-style deodorant sprays, I still find a solid to be far more pleasant.</li>
            <li>I like how quickly they can be applied.</li>
            <li>, you should know that it&#x27;s a mild antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>As an antiperspirant, this Dove Dry Spray seems to perform fairly well.</li>
            <li>It does smell good, but just a little too strong.</li>
            <li>This is great if you have a little weight on you and want something to help prevent chaffing.</li>
            <li>This one is a pleasant surprise as it is in an elegant easy to grip metal bottle with a plastic pop top and when I applied it it felt cool and dry with no sticky wetness like usual sprays!</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty quickly, has a nice light smell and is dry going on.</li>
            <li>Whether you live in a warm climate all year long as we do in AZ, or you need a gentle product that keeps you dry, then this one is the Perfect selection.</li>
            <li>So when you go outside you&#x27;re nice and toasty, but transitioning inside can be a bit dicey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice that it&#x27;s not sticky or tacky, like a solid antiperspirant stick</li>
            <li>My biggest issue with it was that I had to hold my breath to spray it on, then run out of the room for fresh air.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about baby powder smell on adults and would prefer a lavender,</li>
            <li>This one is still fairly loaded with chemicals however it performs extremely well as an antiperspirant with</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even work up a sweat right now</li>
            <li>Read the warnings, don&#x27;t smoke, and I just pray for no freak static electricity conflagration some fine winter, but I&#x27;m not even sure if that&#x27;s even a \\&quot;thing\\&quot; outside of urban legend lore.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much slimmer,smaller and more elegant than other spray antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>think this might be a fine antiperspirant for someone who is not sensitive to strong odors or spray products.  </li>
            <li>I very much prefer antiperspirants without scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it go on super easy</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very intense when you first spray it.  </li>
            <li>After the first time of applying this antiperspirant, I was perspiring under my arms within hours.  </li>
            <li>It is overpowering when first sprayed.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with spray antiperspirant, and it&#x27;s rather a pain to use.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also no way it could last for 48 hours like it claims - maybe 24 at the most.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried that it would burn and drip all over my clothes</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>I think I need to find that happy middle of how much to use and also let it dry 100% before putting on my shirt.</li>
            <li>I swear I&#x27;m not that sweaty, but many of them don&#x27;t last a whole day</li>
            <li>(Example of a product routinely pilloried both by the more \\&quot;fringe\\&quot;-y health adherents and much of the medical community worldwide:</li>
            <li>(Example of a product routinely pilloried both by the more \\&quot;fringe\\&quot;-y health adherents and much of the medical community worldwide:</li>
            <li>I have a generally positive outlook on Dove deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Adore their soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and stick deodorants, so I pretty much figured I would like this product</li>
            <li>Dove, please stop with the irritating commercials that talk about every woman/girl being beautiful and so on.</li>
            <li>Dove, please stop with the irritating commercials that talk about every woman/girl being beautiful and so on.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I&#x27;ve now used this spray four days in a row and only the first day I found it was ineffective.  </li>
            <li>I love Dove Dry Spry antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply once you get the hang of it and over the initial \\&quot;cold\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powdery-fresh sort of scent, and I feel like I can smell large whiffs of it every time I raise my arms.  </li>
            <li>It kept me dry and smelling good, but so do solid</li>
            <li>Like others have said, it has a VERY strong smell after you first use it that lingers for a little while.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about a dry spray deodorant as I am pretty loyal to my Dove solid stick form.  </li>
            <li>Getting warmed up that fast sometimes is a bit TOO much for the armpits to take and some sweating occurs.</li>
            <li>It’s much too flowery for me.  </li>
            <li>and I sincerely really like this product, so</li>
            <li>Because it works REALLY</li>
            <li>Because it works REALLY</li>
            <li>I go through it much faster than the stick</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I had some real problems with using this product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just really loosing my strength</li>
            <li>works really well for me at stopping odor and perspiration.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming the problem can be easily fixed if I wait a few minutes to get dressed after applying the &amp;#34;dry spray.&amp;#34; This isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I most likely will not be buying this in the future (I originally received the product for free).</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant once the initial shock wears off--it&#x27;s a light floral when it finally settles down--</li>
            <li>Also, my grocery stores did not have this on their shelves a few weeks ago, glad to know I can order it right here.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time in the kitchen over a hot stove and this keeps me dry and fresh!</li>
            <li>Nice smell, long lasting, recommend.</li>
            <li>I had 2 full days of photo shoots - over 40 families in my studio in 2 days - and I only had to apply in the morning for all-day-long coverage.</li>
            <li>the end of the day, while this worked fine, I far prefer the experience of using solid deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps the skin dry yet comfortable.</li>
            <li>This Dove Dry Spray Antiperspirant definitely seems to keep me dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li>It dries quick and I don&#x27;t worry about the white marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>in particular I like the cucumber one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The can is easy to hold (which, having use other sprays, I know can be a problem) and the cap comes on and off</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this spray.</li>
            <li>Pass the broiled crow.y entrenched sources, compelling independent research, *something</li>
            <li>Going about my normal day, this lasted about 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>Going about my normal day and then adding my workout into the mix, this lasted about 8-10 hrs.</li>
            <li>If you spray it from the recommended six inches from your underarms, it pretty much dries instantly.</li>
            <li>It dries VERY fast, but is not a dry application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big girl and have tried many anti-perspirants to keep the pits dry.</li>
            <li>I believe I&#x27;ve just met my new life-long deodorant, friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m betting that a lifetime of spray deodorant can&#x27;t stack up to two weeks with new carpets, off-gassing-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m betting that a lifetime of spray deodorant can&#x27;t stack up to two weeks with new carpets, off-gassing-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband made a comment that he didn&#x27;t like the way the new lotion felt on his face after shaving.</li>
            <li>During normal activities it probably works better than the Dove stick deodorant I&#x27;ve used in the past (for odor and sweat barrier).</li>
            <li>Other fun flammables that raise health concerns from certain quarters.</li>
            <li>Overall, while it looks pretty, the spray bottle design needs an overhaul.</li>
            <li>I do often use Dove, but this appears to be a higher concentration, and aluminum has been tied to a host of different maladies...</li>
            <li>I have used Dove products in the past and have been satisfied with their performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well compared to other deodorants but smell pretty strong, as other reviewers indicated before I purchased.</li>
            <li>It is certainly an improvement on earlier spray-style deodorants.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve tried the 3.8 versions of Degree, Axe, Dove for Men and now Dove.</li>
            <li>At this point I notice that the nozzle is conservative and does not waste product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as duration, there&#x27;s a reason they say *up to* 48</li>
            <li>And as someone with sensitive skin, this antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>It does the trick as far as an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>spray itself feels cool, but dry in initial contact.</li>
            <li>It is not just good for under the arms, either, Because it doesn&#x27;t get wet or sticky, it also works in other areas where you might have skin folds (not intimate areas, of course).</li>
            <li>Not 48 hours, mind you, but pretty long!</li>
            <li>but it was hard especially on my right side when I had to use my left hand to spray it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; deodorant that I have had in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money since it outlast other deodorants.</li>
            <li>I think if the smell was toned down just a little bit, this would be my new favorite antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li>but apparently something in the fine mist is enough to give me that tight feeling in my lungs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, Dove&#x27;s Dry Spray really works.</li>
            <li>It goes on dry, doesn&#x27;t cake up and really works well.  </li>
            <li>CFCs (now pretty much a thing of the past for US manufacturing.</li>
            <li>There are also advantages to the spray, which goes on fast and very dry.  </li>
            <li>This has a high concentration of aluminum, which is present in almost all standard brand antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the high aluminum content, I would actually use this regularly.</li>
            <li>will be apparent.</li>
            <li>I had to reapply this a few times throughout the day in order to stay fresh.  </li>
            <li>This really does go on light and dry without leaving behind a lot of residue.</li>
            <li>- I do listen to the organics/ecology community, but if I don&#x27;t see interest and substantiation from less politically entrenched sources, compelling independent research, *something</li>
            <li>This spray is NOT, I repeat NOT a dry application.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I may have plastered it on thick, I really don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;m supposed to use.</li>
            <li>I have been trying other &amp;#34;deodorants&amp;#34; but most either won&#x27;t last ...and odor will start occurring or excessive sweat</li>
            <li>Sprays\\&quot; have gotten a certain - erm - connotation in the wake of Axe and other scent assault products for younger persons of the male gender.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s basically a second going down the armpit and be smart and don&#x27;t apply it in a confined environment like your bathroom.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The coverage is wonderful and not sticky.</li>
            <li> What a great idea!</li>
            <li> I especially love spraying this around the boobage area before we go riding.</li>
            <li> I would say one of the best &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; deodorants and antiperspirants</li>
            <li> Best anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue on my shirts!!!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> The Dove formula has always worked well for me, and this spray antiperspirant is honestly some of the best I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li> (the spray is the greatest invention in the deodorant world, honestly), but you can feel the coverage immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great scent and</li>
            <li> 2 stars because it smells great....</li>
            <li> This is actually a great antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> have found it to be very effective at odor protection.</li>
            <li> We love Dove, have used their products for years, and this one is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product, however, I was pleasantly surprized by.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Spray being spray, it gets in the air, and although the smell is pleasant, breathing this stuff in is not.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant</li>
            <li> and I never felt they had the superior level of sweat protection that a stick does.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;spray\\&quot; button is cushy and built into the top of the can.</li>
            <li> smells good, works well.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product and find it to be just as good as any stick and much better than any roll-on.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it works great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this deodorant!</li>
            <li> favorite thing about this product is the can!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this spray antiperspirant and plan on making this my go to brand!</li>
            <li> perfect for hot &amp; humid Iowa days</li>
            <li> For one, it smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and it is a spray-on antiperspirant rather than a roll on.</li>
            <li> Effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is a feminine mixture of baby powder with notes of  jasmine and rose and it claims to keep you protected for up to 48 hours.</li>
            <li> It works well in this spate of warm weather to prevent perspiration.  </li>
            <li> and I am loving it .</li>
            <li> As an antiperspirant, the product is effective.</li>
            <li> A nice change of pace from a roll on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent antiperspirant, but the real news is the way it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good anti-perspirant/deodorant because I&#x27;m allergic to most.</li>
            <li> I used it and actually liked it.</li>
            <li> I get this on subscribe and save nice way not to have to Remember to get it.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of body spray that used to be so popular in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> but I have to say how nice and refreshing this feels.</li>
            <li> Works well, long-lasting, sweet &amp; pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> goes on invisible, nice and light and an effective antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light floral scent.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice when not so strong.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used spray antiperspirant for many years</li>
            <li> I love that is</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cake on your clothing like many of the sticks and solids</li>
            <li> but these sprays work better for me than a roll on.  </li>
            <li> really love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more concern of how people here are using it.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about this antiperspirant!!  </li>
            <li> okay, I&#x27;ll use up this can</li>
            <li> but maybe I&#x27;d better not get used to this</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m unwittingly exposed to all kinds of harmful things, some I even realize but can do nothing about.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m unwittingly exposed to all kinds of harmful things, some I even realize but can do nothing about.</li>
            <li> I like this so much more than the bars.</li>
            <li> just make sure to spray in a well-ventilated area or with the fan turned</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like this.</li>
            <li> I do love that it&#x27;s a spray</li>
            <li> I love spray deodorant.  </li>
            <li> This Dove spray has a nice odor and feels light going on.  </li>
            <li> : I love this stuff</li>
            <li> That gave us a good laugh when we discovered his mishap.</li>
            <li> I was happy with it and through it worked very well, but I would NOT wear it to the gym or during anything strenuous.</li>
            <li> In addition, the sweet powder fragrance is light &amp; pleasant, not over-whelming.</li>
            <li> I used this with caution and am happy to report it hasn&#x27;t caused any issues thus far where my allergy is concerned (will update should that change).</li>
            <li> Most important, there are No skin reactions noted.</li>
            <li> Dove is a brand that consistently offers great reliable products with this deodorant being no exception.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Plus the deodorant/dry spray piece is a clean and refreshing scent that lasts around 36-48 hrs...and leaves the skin feeling nourished.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite strong.  </li>
            <li> one also smells pretty nice for a powdery/floral mix.</li>
            <li> The performance was fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick drying and the moisturizer is welcome on my sensitive</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of spray antiperspirants/deodorants.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t supposed to use deodorant/antiperspirant prior to the exam, so the facility kindly provides a can of spray antiperspirant spray for those who don&#x27;t want to tote their own for after the exam.</li>
            <li> It is a very fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of the Dove brand as Dove always leaves me feeling amazingly clean and pampered.</li>
            <li> , this is quick drying and easy and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much always loved and used Dove products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it isn&#x27;t summer time, I haven&#x27;t really been able to test its drying factor, but it seems like a good deodorant so far.</li>
            <li> So, I was thrilled when they offered me their new spray antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray is dry and works great.</li>
            <li> It smells great but does not live up to its name.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I won&#x27;t go out of my way to purchase this antiperspirant/deodorant in the future, it&#x27;s a good &amp;#</li>
            <li> I loved the scents, but I felt that they ran short in the odor protection department.</li>
            <li> , solids have always been good enough for me, etc.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m OK with that because I like the product so much.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad deodorant.  </li>
            <li> While there are improvements here to old-style deodorant sprays, I still find a solid to be far more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like how quickly they can be applied.</li>
            <li> , you should know that it&#x27;s a mild antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> As an antiperspirant, this Dove Dry Spray seems to perform fairly well.</li>
            <li> It does smell good, but just a little too strong.</li>
            <li> This is great if you have a little weight on you and want something to help prevent chaffing.</li>
            <li> This one is a pleasant surprise as it is in an elegant easy to grip metal bottle with a plastic pop top and when I applied it it felt cool and dry with no sticky wetness like usual sprays!</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty quickly, has a nice light smell and is dry going on.</li>
            <li> Whether you live in a warm climate all year long as we do in AZ, or you need a gentle product that keeps you dry, then this one is the Perfect selection.</li>
            <li> So when you go outside you&#x27;re nice and toasty, but transitioning inside can be a bit dicey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice that it&#x27;s not sticky or tacky, like a solid antiperspirant stick</li>
            <li> My biggest issue with it was that I had to hold my breath to spray it on, then run out of the room for fresh air.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about baby powder smell on adults and would prefer a lavender,</li>
            <li> This one is still fairly loaded with chemicals however it performs extremely well as an antiperspirant with</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even work up a sweat right now</li>
            <li> Read the warnings, don&#x27;t smoke, and I just pray for no freak static electricity conflagration some fine winter, but I&#x27;m not even sure if that&#x27;s even a \\&quot;thing\\&quot; outside of urban legend lore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much slimmer,smaller and more elegant than other spray antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> think this might be a fine antiperspirant for someone who is not sensitive to strong odors or spray products.  </li>
            <li> I very much prefer antiperspirants without scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does it go on super easy</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very intense when you first spray it.  </li>
            <li> After the first time of applying this antiperspirant, I was perspiring under my arms within hours.  </li>
            <li> It is overpowering when first sprayed.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with spray antiperspirant, and it&#x27;s rather a pain to use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also no way it could last for 48 hours like it claims - maybe 24 at the most.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried that it would burn and drip all over my clothes</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> I think I need to find that happy middle of how much to use and also let it dry 100% before putting on my shirt.</li>
            <li> I swear I&#x27;m not that sweaty, but many of them don&#x27;t last a whole day</li>
            <li> (Example of a product routinely pilloried both by the more \\&quot;fringe\\&quot;-y health adherents and much of the medical community worldwide:</li>
            <li> (Example of a product routinely pilloried both by the more \\&quot;fringe\\&quot;-y health adherents and much of the medical community worldwide:</li>
            <li> I have a generally positive outlook on Dove deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Adore their soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and stick deodorants, so I pretty much figured I would like this product</li>
            <li> Dove, please stop with the irritating commercials that talk about every woman/girl being beautiful and so on.</li>
            <li> Dove, please stop with the irritating commercials that talk about every woman/girl being beautiful and so on.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I&#x27;ve now used this spray four days in a row and only the first day I found it was ineffective.  </li>
            <li> I love Dove Dry Spry antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply once you get the hang of it and over the initial \\&quot;cold\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powdery-fresh sort of scent, and I feel like I can smell large whiffs of it every time I raise my arms.  </li>
            <li> It kept me dry and smelling good, but so do solid</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it has a VERY strong smell after you first use it that lingers for a little while.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about a dry spray deodorant as I am pretty loyal to my Dove solid stick form.  </li>
            <li> Getting warmed up that fast sometimes is a bit TOO much for the armpits to take and some sweating occurs.</li>
            <li> It’s much too flowery for me.  </li>
            <li> and I sincerely really like this product, so</li>
            <li> Because it works REALLY</li>
            <li> Because it works REALLY</li>
            <li> I go through it much faster than the stick</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I had some real problems with using this product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just really loosing my strength</li>
            <li> works really well for me at stopping odor and perspiration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming the problem can be easily fixed if I wait a few minutes to get dressed after applying the &amp;#34;dry spray.&amp;#34; This isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I most likely will not be buying this in the future (I originally received the product for free).</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant once the initial shock wears off--it&#x27;s a light floral when it finally settles down--</li>
            <li> Also, my grocery stores did not have this on their shelves a few weeks ago, glad to know I can order it right here.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in the kitchen over a hot stove and this keeps me dry and fresh!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, long lasting, recommend.</li>
            <li> I had 2 full days of photo shoots - over 40 families in my studio in 2 days - and I only had to apply in the morning for all-day-long coverage.</li>
            <li> the end of the day, while this worked fine, I far prefer the experience of using solid deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It also keeps the skin dry yet comfortable.</li>
            <li> This Dove Dry Spray Antiperspirant definitely seems to keep me dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li> It dries quick and I don&#x27;t worry about the white marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> in particular I like the cucumber one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The can is easy to hold (which, having use other sprays, I know can be a problem) and the cap comes on and off</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this spray.</li>
            <li> Pass the broiled crow.y entrenched sources, compelling independent research, *something</li>
            <li> Going about my normal day, this lasted about 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> Going about my normal day and then adding my workout into the mix, this lasted about 8-10 hrs.</li>
            <li> If you spray it from the recommended six inches from your underarms, it pretty much dries instantly.</li>
            <li> It dries VERY fast, but is not a dry application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big girl and have tried many anti-perspirants to keep the pits dry.</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;ve just met my new life-long deodorant, friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting that a lifetime of spray deodorant can&#x27;t stack up to two weeks with new carpets, off-gassing-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting that a lifetime of spray deodorant can&#x27;t stack up to two weeks with new carpets, off-gassing-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband made a comment that he didn&#x27;t like the way the new lotion felt on his face after shaving.</li>
            <li> During normal activities it probably works better than the Dove stick deodorant I&#x27;ve used in the past (for odor and sweat barrier).</li>
            <li> Other fun flammables that raise health concerns from certain quarters.</li>
            <li> Overall, while it looks pretty, the spray bottle design needs an overhaul.</li>
            <li> I do often use Dove, but this appears to be a higher concentration, and aluminum has been tied to a host of different maladies...</li>
            <li> I have used Dove products in the past and have been satisfied with their performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well compared to other deodorants but smell pretty strong, as other reviewers indicated before I purchased.</li>
            <li> It is certainly an improvement on earlier spray-style deodorants.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve tried the 3.8 versions of Degree, Axe, Dove for Men and now Dove.</li>
            <li> At this point I notice that the nozzle is conservative and does not waste product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as duration, there&#x27;s a reason they say *up to* 48</li>
            <li> And as someone with sensitive skin, this antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> It does the trick as far as an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> spray itself feels cool, but dry in initial contact.</li>
            <li> It is not just good for under the arms, either, Because it doesn&#x27;t get wet or sticky, it also works in other areas where you might have skin folds (not intimate areas, of course).</li>
            <li> Not 48 hours, mind you, but pretty long!</li>
            <li> but it was hard especially on my right side when I had to use my left hand to spray it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; deodorant that I have had in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money since it outlast other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I think if the smell was toned down just a little bit, this would be my new favorite antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li> but apparently something in the fine mist is enough to give me that tight feeling in my lungs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Dove&#x27;s Dry Spray really works.</li>
            <li> It goes on dry, doesn&#x27;t cake up and really works well.  </li>
            <li> CFCs (now pretty much a thing of the past for US manufacturing.</li>
            <li> There are also advantages to the spray, which goes on fast and very dry.  </li>
            <li> This has a high concentration of aluminum, which is present in almost all standard brand antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the high aluminum content, I would actually use this regularly.</li>
            <li> will be apparent.</li>
            <li> I had to reapply this a few times throughout the day in order to stay fresh.  </li>
            <li> This really does go on light and dry without leaving behind a lot of residue.</li>
            <li> - I do listen to the organics/ecology community, but if I don&#x27;t see interest and substantiation from less politically entrenched sources, compelling independent research, *something</li>
            <li> This spray is NOT, I repeat NOT a dry application.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I may have plastered it on thick, I really don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;m supposed to use.</li>
            <li> I have been trying other &amp;#34;deodorants&amp;#34; but most either won&#x27;t last ...and odor will start occurring or excessive sweat</li>
            <li> Sprays\\&quot; have gotten a certain - erm - connotation in the wake of Axe and other scent assault products for younger persons of the male gender.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s basically a second going down the armpit and be smart and don&#x27;t apply it in a confined environment like your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Bought it once to try, worked, but was more expensive and didn&#x27;t last as long as my solid.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt last long and left white marks all over my clothes</li>
            <li> It is a little stiff, especially when I use my left hand to spray my right pit.</li>
            <li> * how long the one can was going to last me.</li>
            <li> Long enough to get hooked on the convenience and the savings</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using this until it&#x27;s gone and going to consider buying a can of this for a long vacation ride we plan on taking next</li>
            <li> A very subtle, clean smell.</li>
            <li> Actually, there are a lot of advantages to aerosol antiperspirants, as they go on a lot drier, dry faster, and don&#x27;t cake on your clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that I had to put it on immediately after the shower and let it dry for several minutes before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> Same basic concept for all of them, but the packaging, percentage of active ingredient, and scent are all different.  </li>
            <li> - the spray goes on quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a cloud of spray behind.  </li>
            <li> It dries immediately and gives wetness protection all day long.  </li>
            <li> When sprayed it doesn&#x27;t produce the giant wet splotch that old-style spray deodorants would.</li>
            <li> All I know is it gets me to the end of my long day still smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How long?</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how long, now LEAVE ME</li>
            <li> As I do for practically any manufactured product with a long ingredients list.</li>
            <li> As I do for practically any manufactured product with a long ingredients list.</li>
            <li> It lasts a a long time too.</li>
            <li> And 8 weeks is a fraction of how long a stick</li>
            <li> Its been a long time since I used a spray antiperspirant having stopped using aerosols when they used to use ozone-destroying gases.  </li>
            <li> From seeing some other reviews, I see I am not the only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But, it works well to keep me dry.</li>
            <li> (because, I sweat copiously, and would rather not chance it), but for what it does, it&#x27;s keeps me dry during the 24 hour period.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t seem as dry as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I have always used Dove but tried the dry spray and am hooked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spray on and it kept me dry on the three days I used.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t really go on completely dry.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong as it felt cool on my skin</li>
            <li> and my armpits are still dry!</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant is different from others I&#x27;ve used in the past from Dove, but still maintains the same levels of high-quality from the brand.</li>
            <li> the past, I had the opportunity to try Dove&#x27;s entire line of solid stick deodorants.</li>
            <li> When I applied this to the back of my hand there was slight \\&quot;sheen\\</li>
            <li> Also I felt very dry throughout the day</li>
            <li> This aerosol works well because it has a very limited target area</li>
            <li> Not much is needed for each application, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It is a bit wet and smeared on my clothes when dressing if I didn&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> This deodorant does not work for anyone that has moderate to heavy sweating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often have to use my inhaler, and now is certainly not one of the seasons where I am bothered by allergies,</li>
            <li> Two of the days, within minutes of using this Dove Dry Spray, I had to hunt down my inhaler.  </li>
            <li> It promises \\&quot;instant\\&quot; dry, but there is a slight \\&quot;wetness\\&quot; upon application</li>
            <li> It does not overwhelm or compete with other scents that you may have applied to your body.</li>
            <li> the other hand?</li>
            <li> Dove&#x27;s antipersperants have been working well for me since I started having some irritation from other antiperspirants and Dove</li>
            <li> I do like some of Dove&#x27;s other scents--</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s alright though since I don&#x27;t skip applying deodorant every other day.</li>
            <li> I like the spray, but will probably stick with roll on products due to my budget.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend one of DOVE&#x27;s other antiperspirant deodorants.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other flowery</li>
            <li> 4.5 stars due to the fact that it can stain clothes but also how well it works.</li>
            <li> It feels wet and slick long after application.  </li>
            <li> less than other brands and other types (gels, roll on, talc based bars, etc).</li>
            <li> I thought that it would provide me with less protection, because I tend to sweat a lot (due to nervousness).</li>
            <li> It does work well but is not worth having an asthma attack.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that sometimes it will stain my underarms of clothes.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have ALLERGIES is not the product&#x27;s fault; maybe you should put down any product that smells at all.</li>
            <li> I am not willing to test that promise out!</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s so dry about it.</li>
            <li> It had one of those typical non-nondescript fruity/floral deodorant scents that I just don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> (You&#x27;ll still get a little pit stink by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I wish the spray button was a little easier to push.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is really hard to press the nozzle to get it on.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on and the area I applied it to is still wet to the touch for at least a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with deodorant that lasts, and this felt like it lasted a lot longer than the others.</li>
            <li> Any closer will leave some wetness that dries after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> This one is slightly floral, feminine, but I think a man could wear it if he could get past the &amp;#34;nourished beauty&amp;#34; logo.  </li>
            <li> I live in a cold area of the country so</li>
            <li> The button to release the spray is encased in plastic which makes it awkward to press and even more awkward to keep depressed while navigating the armpit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However - this Dove Dry Spray is a game changer.</li>
            <li> I am a fan and will be buying this if it goes on sale along with my usual form of Dove deodorant.</li>
            <li> 34;back up&amp;#34; to have in case I run out of my usual stick.</li>

            <li> I usually like DOVE products.</li>
            <li> Once it dissipates, it is not strong or unpleasant on your underarms, but the initial few seconds were a little overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It is, however, quite cold when sprayed on skin,and even if it isn&#x27;t wet to the touch, it feels wet when sprayed.  </li>
            <li> The particles just linger in the air and make it hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply underneath a shirt.</li>
            <li> It protects from wetness and odor for at least 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I mean, for you to use your inhaler, were you applying it for 5 seconds on each arm pit?</li>
            <li> I hate sprays because they are very wet, but this dry spray wasn&#x27;t.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This antiperspirant is different from others I&#x27;ve used in the past from Dove, but still maintains the same levels of high-quality from the brand. It smells nice and it is a spray-on antiperspirant rather than a roll on. I thought that it would provide me with less protection, because I tend to sweat a lot (due to nervousness). But, it works well to keep me dry. Dove says this deodorant last 48 hours. I have not tried this spray to see if it will last for 48 hours (because, I sweat copiously, and would rather not chance it), but for what it does, it&#x27;s keeps me dry during the 24 hour period.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this deodorant! I&#x27;ve had issues before with deodorants not working well. I swear I&#x27;m not that sweaty, but many of them don&#x27;t last a whole day and I find myself having to reapply. The Dove formula has always worked well for me, and this spray antiperspirant is honestly some of the best I&#x27;ve worn. I had 2 full days of photo shoots - over 40 families in my studio in 2 days - and I only had to apply in the morning for all-day-long coverage. Yay!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal with winter in the Midwest - you MUST layer if you want to survive. So when you go outside you&#x27;re nice and toasty, but transitioning inside can be a bit dicey. Getting warmed up that fast sometimes is a bit TOO much for the armpits to take and some sweating occurs. The struggle is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However - this Dove Dry Spray is a game changer. I put it on this morning and have been outside/inside several times (coat, 2 layers, the works) and my armpits are still dry! This is unheard of for deodorant for me!  Not only does it go on super easy (the spray is the greatest invention in the deodorant world, honestly), but you can feel the coverage immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting. Easy to use. A very subtle, clean smell. Effective. I believe I&#x27;ve just met my new life-long deodorant, friends.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about a dry spray deodorant as I am pretty loyal to my Dove solid stick form.  This one is a pleasant surprise as it is in an elegant easy to grip metal bottle with a plastic pop top and when I applied it it felt cool and dry with no sticky wetness like usual sprays! There was no residue on my bathroom counter or on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a feminine mixture of baby powder with notes of  jasmine and rose and it claims to keep you protected for up to 48 hours. I am a fan and will be buying this if it goes on sale along with my usual form of Dove deodorant.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this spray. It goes on pretty quickly, has a nice light smell and is dry going on. I do know one reason people like to use spray deodorant is to avoid aluminum, and this one unfortunately does have aluminum in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can is easy to hold (which, having use other sprays, I know can be a problem) and the cap comes on and off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it isn&#x27;t summer time, I haven&#x27;t really been able to test its drying factor, but it seems like a good deodorant so far.</li>
            <li> Dove spray antiperspirant does what it claims to do.  It sprays on and instantly dries.  It works well in this spate of warm weather to prevent perspiration.  But the scent?  Ugh.  It’s much too flowery for me.  I very much prefer antiperspirants without scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOUR STARS!</li>
            <li> I have this one as well the one for men. I actually prefer the smell of one for men, as I am not too keen on the coconut smell in this one for women. However, they both work just as well in stopping sweat and preventing any odor from it for the entire time I work, about 8 hours. It also keeps the skin dry yet comfortable.</li>
            <li> I ususally use a Dove stick or sometimes Secret or Suave.  I usually don&#x27;t like spray ons because they go on so cold on your skin and I never felt they had the superior level of sweat protection that a stick does.  This product, however, I was pleasantly surprized by.  For one, it smells AMAZING.  I wish they would come out with a perfume/body spray in the same scent.  Also, it didn&#x27;t feel cold going on even after a shower in November!  It dries immediately and gives wetness protection all day long.  I am really happy with this product and find it to be just as good as any stick and much better than any roll-on.</li>
            <li> This spray is NOT, I repeat NOT a dry application.  It feels wet and slick long after application.  Even about 10 minutes after application if you run your fingers along your underarm you will still feel the slippery slickness of the spray.  After the first time of applying this antiperspirant, I was perspiring under my arms within hours.  Fortunately I&#x27;ve now used this spray four days in a row and only the first day I found it was ineffective.  I think my body just needed to adjust to a different type of antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s aerosol, it does fill the room with a bit of a haze which I have to fan away with my hand so I don&#x27;t inhale it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I won&#x27;t go out of my way to purchase this antiperspirant/deodorant in the future, it&#x27;s a good &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; to have in case I run out of my usual stick.</li>
            <li> This really does go on light and dry without leaving behind a lot of residue. It is not just good for under the arms, either, Because it doesn&#x27;t get wet or sticky, it also works in other areas where you might have skin folds (not intimate areas, of course). This is great if you have a little weight on you and want something to help prevent chaffing. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used spray antiperspirant for many years and I am loving it . The coverage is wonderful and not sticky. I love that is doesn&#x27;t seem to have the problems with getting on my clothes.  Love the smell and I think I will be switching to the product.</li>
            <li> I have a generally positive outlook on Dove deodorants.  I&#x27;ve been using their solid deodorants for years.  This is not a bad deodorant.  It is certainly an improvement on earlier spray-style deodorants.  I&#x27;m not convinced, though, that spray deodorant is something that needs to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is advertised as a dry-spray deodorant.  When sprayed it doesn&#x27;t produce the giant wet splotch that old-style spray deodorants would. It is, however, quite cold when sprayed on skin,and even if it isn&#x27;t wet to the touch, it feels wet when sprayed.  The scent is quite strong.  It&#x27;s a powdery-fresh sort of scent, and I feel like I can smell large whiffs of it every time I raise my arms.  The performance was fine.  It kept me dry and smelling good, but so do solid deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, while this worked fine, I far prefer the experience of using solid deodorant.  While there are improvements here to old-style deodorant sprays, I still find a solid to be far more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Unilever, I think it is, has been going &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; and is releasing a series of 3.0 oz spray antiperspirants (as opposed to the usual stick antiperspirants). Actually, there are a lot of advantages to aerosol antiperspirants, as they go on a lot drier, dry faster, and don&#x27;t cake on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unilever is going &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;, having released a number of 3.8 ounce Aerosol deodorant sprays.  So far, I&#x27;ve tried the 3.8 versions of Degree, Axe, Dove for Men and now Dove. Same basic concept for all of them, but the packaging, percentage of active ingredient, and scent are all different.  For example, both Dove sprays have 20.2% Aluminum Chlorhydrate, while in Axe and Degree, it&#x27;s 23.3%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All sprays have a different scent.  This one is slightly floral, feminine, but I think a man could wear it if he could get past the &amp;#34;nourished beauty&amp;#34; logo.  It seems to be marketed towards women, but again could work either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As an antiperspirant, the product is effective. There are also advantages to the spray, which goes on fast and very dry.  It won&#x27;t cake on your clothing like many of the sticks and solids will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it though. Good product. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> What a great idea! A nice change of pace from a roll on, Dove&#x27;s Dry Spray really works. It&#x27;s an excellent antiperspirant, but the real news is the way it&#x27;s applied. The spray is dry and works great. It&#x27;s so nice that it&#x27;s not sticky or tacky, like a solid antiperspirant stick is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely moving to Dove!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but these sprays work better for me than a roll on.  Nice smell, long lasting, recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of spray antiperspirants/deodorants. I like how quickly they can be applied. I also like that I can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; that I sprayed my entire armpit area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I had the opportunity to try Dove&#x27;s entire line of solid stick deodorants. I loved the scents, but I felt that they ran short in the odor protection department. So, I was thrilled when they offered me their new spray antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the scent of this product. It has a very light floral scent. It does not overwhelm or compete with other scents that you may have applied to your body. It promises \\&quot;instant\\&quot; dry, but there is a slight \\&quot;wetness\\&quot; upon application but it dries in seconds. When I applied this to the back of my hand there was slight \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; so this has some moisturizer in it. There is no white residue or greasiness left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found it to be very effective at odor protection. I live in a cold area of the country so, I have not sweated with it yet. The label promises 48 hours of protection. I am not willing to test that promise out! All I know is it gets me to the end of my long day still smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this product is the can! It&#x27;s so much slimmer,smaller and more elegant than other spray antiperspirants. The \\&quot;spray\\&quot; button is cushy and built into the top of the can. Other spray deodorants have the old fashion spray nozzle that can pop off and get lost...NOT DOVE! Also the can is only 7 1/4 inches tall. It fits on the middle shelf of my medicine cabinet...Just try that with a taller can of another brand. Dove says the can can last up to 8 weeks! I only just started with it so, I will have to update my review. At this point I notice that the nozzle is conservative and does not waste product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this spray antiperspirant and plan on making this my go to brand!</li>
            <li> smells good, works well. that&#x27;s all it has to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reading all of this reviews and I sincerely really like this product, so I&#x27;m more concern of how people here are using it. I mean, for you to use your inhaler, were you applying it for 5 seconds on each arm pit? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s how it works, It&#x27;s basically a second going down the armpit and be smart and don&#x27;t apply it in a confined environment like your bathroom. Also, if you have ALLERGIES is not the product&#x27;s fault; maybe you should put down any product that smells at all.</li>
            <li> I had to reapply this a few times throughout the day in order to stay fresh.  It also didn&#x27;t seem as dry as advertised.  My biggest issue with it was that I had to hold my breath to spray it on, then run out of the room for fresh air.  It is overpowering when first sprayed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a room big enough to spray this in. The particles just linger in the air and make it hard to breathe. Ick. Also I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s so dry about it. I spray it on and the area I applied it to is still wet to the touch for at least a couple of minutes. I give it one star for the fact that it does the trick as an antiperspirant, but I&#x27;ll stick to my trusty Mitchum from here on out.</li>
            <li> Bought it once to try, worked, but was more expensive and didn&#x27;t last as long as my solid. Will go back to the solid.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this and swears by it. Great scent and it lasts. She says that she will NEVER us another deodorant again. Worth the money since it outlast other deodorants. We would recommend it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> Oh my god!  Cannot say enough good things about this antiperspirant!!  Just try it.  Closest to perfection I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Last fall I had my regular mammogram. You aren&#x27;t supposed to use deodorant/antiperspirant prior to the exam, so the facility kindly provides a can of spray antiperspirant spray for those who don&#x27;t want to tote their own for after the exam. Spray makes sense when contact would make for hygiene issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I sprayed, I thought, \\&quot;Hey, this is quick drying and easy and why _don&#x27;t_ I use sprays these days, anyway?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of trying out this product, I remembered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) \\&quot;Body Sprays\\&quot; have gotten a certain - erm - connotation in the wake of Axe and other scent assault products for younger persons of the male gender. One might say a bad rap. (All things being equal, they might be poised for a comeback.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) CFCs (now pretty much a thing of the past for US manufacturing. Butane. Other fun flammables that raise health concerns from certain quarters. Bottom line, sprays use propellants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I though okay, I&#x27;ll use up this can but maybe I&#x27;d better not get used to this, solids have always been good enough for me, etc. I had *no idea* how long the one can was going to last me. How long? Long enough to get hooked on the convenience and the savings, that&#x27;s how long, now LEAVE ME ALONE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(regrouping) (Okaybetternow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one also smells pretty nice for a powdery/floral mix. It&#x27;s quick drying and the moisturizer is welcome on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I bought another one. It&#x27;s a habit now. Read the warnings, don&#x27;t smoke, and I just pray for no freak static electricity conflagration some fine winter, but I&#x27;m not even sure if that&#x27;s even a \\&quot;thing\\&quot; outside of urban legend lore.  I also avoid spraying around the barbecue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What *is* a thing is insistence on the part of the organic products crowd that the butane is going to hurt me. All I can say to that is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - I do listen to the organics/ecology community, but if I don&#x27;t see interest and substantiation from less politically entrenched sources, compelling independent research, *something*, then I take it with a grain of salt. (Example of a product routinely pilloried both by the more \\&quot;fringe\\&quot;-y health adherents and much of the medical community worldwide: Aspertame.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m unwittingly exposed to all kinds of harmful things, some I even realize but can do nothing about. I&#x27;m betting that a lifetime of spray deodorant can&#x27;t stack up to two weeks with new carpets, off-gassing-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone else without mentioning potential issues of allergies, chemical or asthmatic sensitivies, etc.  As I do for practically any manufactured product with a long ingredients list. If you&#x27;ve ever had a serious allergy, you&#x27;ll understand where I&#x27;m coming from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I caved. Dove, please stop with the irritating commercials that talk about every woman/girl being beautiful and so on. You ain&#x27;t my girlfriend, my mentor, my confidante.

            <li> I have always used Dove but tried the dry spray and am hooked. I go through it much faster than the stick but I&#x27;m OK with that because I like the product so much. It dries quick and I don&#x27;t worry about the white marks on my clothes. I use the subscribe and save option and it ends up being cheaper than the stores.</li>
            <li> I like this so much more than the bars. I must be allergic to some ingredient in the bars that this spray doesn&#x27;t have. I love the smell and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good anti-perspirant/deodorant because I&#x27;m allergic to most. I used this with caution and am happy to report it hasn&#x27;t caused any issues thus far where my allergy is concerned (will update should that change). The smell is pleasant once the initial shock wears off--it&#x27;s a light floral when it finally settles down--just make sure to spray in a well-ventilated area or with the fan turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray itself feels cool, but dry in initial contact. No white flakes or cake develops under the arms, which is a plus. As far as duration, there&#x27;s a reason they say *up to* 48 hrs.--it&#x27;s because you&#x27;d need to be an utter un-glistening sloth for that period of time. Going about my normal day, this lasted about 24 hrs. Going about my normal day and then adding my workout into the mix, this lasted about 8-10 hrs. YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ultimately lowered this deodorant&#x27;s score was ease of use. The button to release the spray is encased in plastic which makes it awkward to press and even more awkward to keep depressed while navigating the armpit. Overall, while it looks pretty, the spray bottle design needs an overhaul.</li>
            <li> Biggest issue with this product is the aluminum. This has a high concentration of aluminum, which is present in almost all standard brand antiperspirants. I do often use Dove, but this appears to be a higher concentration, and aluminum has been tied to a host of different maladies...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand? I used it and actually liked it. I have trouble with deodorant that lasts, and this felt like it lasted a lot longer than the others. Not 48 hours, mind you, but pretty long! I hate sprays because they are very wet, but this dry spray wasn&#x27;t. If it wasn&#x27;t for the high aluminum content, I would actually use this regularly.</li>
            <li> I love Dove Dry Spry antiperspirant. I spend a lot of time in the kitchen over a hot stove and this keeps me dry and fresh! It lasts a a long time too. Only have to replenish after showering! And as someone with sensitive skin, this antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> We love Dove, have used their products for years, and this one is awesome! Whether you live in a warm climate all year long as we do in AZ, or you need a gentle product that keeps you dry, then this one is the Perfect selection. Not much is needed for each application, and it lasts all day. In addition, the sweet powder fragrance is light &amp; pleasant, not over-whelming. Most important, there are No skin reactions noted. Also, my grocery stores did not have this on their shelves a few weeks ago, glad to know I can order it right here. Works well, long-lasting, sweet &amp; pleasant fragrance. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> As an antiperspirant, this Dove Dry Spray seems to perform fairly well. During normal activities it probably works better than the Dove stick deodorant I&#x27;ve used in the past (for odor and sweat barrier). This spray stuff also has the added advantage of &#x27;no white residue&#x27; unlike its stick counterparts (no matter what they claim).&lt;br /&gt;During strenuous exercise it&#x27;s no miracle but I thought it held up well. Of course, I may have plastered it on thick, I really don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;m supposed to use. The bottle says &#x27;hold x inches away from underarm&#x27; and that it should last up to &#x27;8 weeks&#x27;. No further instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antiperspirant rating &#x3D; 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions rating &#x3D; 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle design &#x3D; 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve discovered I dislike sprays. This was my first experience with spray antiperspirant, and it&#x27;s rather a pain to use. Spray being spray, it gets in the air, and although the smell is pleasant, breathing this stuff in is not. It&#x27;s hard to apply underneath a shirt. And 8 weeks is a fraction of how long a stick lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray ease-of-use rating &#x3D; 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Its been a long time since I used a spray antiperspirant having stopped using aerosols when they used to use ozone-destroying gases.  I remembered liking them and decided to give this one a try.  Dove&#x27;s antipersperants have been working well for me since I started having some irritation from other antiperspirants and Dove was the one that was soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:  goes on invisible, nice and light and an effective antiperspirant.  Non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I just couldn&#x27;t like the fragrance.  It had one of those typical non-nondescript fruity/floral deodorant scents that I just don&#x27;t like.  It isn&#x27;t foul or anything, I just kept getting faint whiffs of it throughout the day and it was just not how I like to smell.  I do like some of Dove&#x27;s other scents--in particular I like the cucumber one.  It is a very fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I get this on subscribe and save nice way not to have to Remember to get it. It does spray on powdery so can get on clothes but I like it.</li>
            <li> 2 stars because it smells great.... but it doesnt last long and left white marks all over my clothes</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free. I&#x27;ve pretty much always loved and used Dove products. For the most part, I like this. Like others have said, it has a VERY strong smell after you first use it that lingers for a little while. It does smell good, but just a little too strong. There&#x27;s also no way it could last for 48 hours like it claims - maybe 24 at the most. That&#x27;s alright though since I don&#x27;t skip applying deodorant every other day. I do love that it&#x27;s a spray and it won&#x27;t leave residue on my clothes. I think if the smell was toned down just a little bit, this would be my new favorite antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love spray deodorant.  It reminds me of body spray that used to be so popular in the 80&#x27;s.  This Dove spray has a nice odor and feels light going on.  It does the trick as far as an antiperspirant.  I have used Dove products in the past and have been satisfied with their performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says it will last 8 weeks but I doubt that.  I like the spray, but will probably stick with roll on products due to my budget.</li>
            <li> **This smells like a Goodwill store! Something grandma-y and floral. But it goes away after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical of this product. I hate spray antiperspirant! It DOES do what it says about wetness! (You&#x27;ll still get a little pit stink by the end of the day but it&#x27;s not a deodorant)  I did get a cyst under one of my arms after the second day so I think it must have clogged up a sweat gland somewhere, but just that one and no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this until it&#x27;s gone and going to consider buying a can of this for a long vacation ride we plan on taking next year!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I love this stuff and I&#x27;ll never go back to pit sticks if I can help it! I especially love spraying this around the boobage area before we go riding. It dramatically reduces the stinking wetness I get under my sports bras. My man uses this sometimes too</li>
            <li> I usually like DOVE products. Adore their soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and stick deodorants, so I pretty much figured I would like this product but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST, you should know that it&#x27;s a mild antiperspirant. It&#x27;s a spray on and it kept me dry on the three days I used.  You should note though that it&#x27;s currently winter and it&#x27;s more difficult to perspire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, after the third day I decided to end my test.  Two of the days, within minutes of using this Dove Dry Spray, I had to hunt down my inhaler.  I don&#x27;t often have to use my inhaler, and now is certainly not one of the seasons where I am bothered by allergies, but apparently something in the fine mist is enough to give me that tight feeling in my lungs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO I DON&#x27;T suggest this spray to anyone with even a hint of asthma. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an ingredient or the propellant, but I found it irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend one of DOVE&#x27;s other antiperspirant deodorants.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant works well.  If you spray it from the recommended six inches from your underarms, it pretty much dries instantly. Any closer will leave some wetness that dries after a few minutes.  It protects from wetness and odor for at least 24 hours.  It did not leave wetness or stains on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I had some real problems with using this product.  The fragrance is very intense when you first spray it.  Once it dissipates, it is not strong or unpleasant on your underarms, but the initial few seconds were a little overpowering.  The fragrance is nice when not so strong.  Also, every time I used this antiperspirant, it aggravated my asthma.  From seeing some other reviews, I see I am not the only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this might be a fine antiperspirant for someone who is not sensitive to strong odors or spray products.  If you are, or have asthma, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.  It does work well but is not worth having an asthma attack.</li>
            <li> This is the first &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; deodorant that I have had in a very long time.  I must say, I like it.  It goes on dry, doesn&#x27;t cake up and really works well.  My only complaint is it is really hard to press the nozzle to get it on.  Maybe I&#x27;m just really loosing my strength but it was hard especially on my right side when I had to use my left hand to spray it.  Other than that, I would give it 5 stars..</li>
            <li> This aerosol works well because it has a very limited target area - the spray goes on quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a cloud of spray behind.  I wish the spray button was a little easier to push.  It is a little stiff, especially when I use my left hand to spray my right pit. The scent is pleasant but I&#x27;m not crazy about baby powder smell on adults and would prefer a lavender, cherry other flowery scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works really well for me at stopping odor and perspiration.</li>
            <li> Works well compared to other deodorants but smell pretty strong, as other reviewers indicated before I purchased.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a spray antiperspirant before but I have to say how nice and refreshing this feels. Just shake, aim, and spray and your done. At first I was worried that it would burn and drip all over my clothes but I was wrong as it felt cool on my skin and it didn&#x27;t drip at all. Also I felt very dry throughout the day and I didn&#x27;t need to renew it. The smell wasn&#x27;t over powering and disappeared one I added my body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that sometimes it will stain my underarms of clothes. I think I need to find that happy middle of how much to use and also let it dry 100% before putting on my shirt. 4.5 stars due to the fact that it can stain clothes but also how well it works.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great antiperspirant. I have been trying other &amp;#34;deodorants&amp;#34; but most either won&#x27;t last ...and odor will start occurring or excessive sweat will be apparent. I was trying to move away from antiperspirant because of all the chemicals and the feeling they left after using them (almost like water/soap repelling). This one is still fairly loaded with chemicals however it performs extremely well as an antiperspirant with less than other brands and other types (gels, roll on, talc based bars, etc). Plus the deodorant/dry spray piece is a clean and refreshing scent that lasts around 36-48 hrs...and leaves the skin feeling nourished. I would say one of the best &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; deodorants and antiperspirants i have used.</li>
            <li> I like the way the deodorant feels and it works well throughout the day. I found that I had to put it on immediately after the shower and let it dry for several minutes before getting dressed. It is a bit wet and smeared on my clothes when dressing if I didn&#x27;t wait. I also use spray lotion. My husband made a comment that he didn&#x27;t like the way the new lotion felt on his face after shaving. I explained that it was the same lotion. Turns out he sprayed the deodorant on his face! Haha! That gave us a good laugh when we discovered his mishap.</li>
            <li> Best anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m a big girl and have tried many anti-perspirants to keep the pits dry. Not only does it do that, it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue on my shirts!!!  Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> perfect for hot &amp; humid Iowa days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of the Dove brand as Dove always leaves me feeling amazingly clean and pampered. This Dove Dry Spray Antiperspirant definitely seems to keep me dry and smelling great. However, it doesn&#x27;t really go on completely dry. It dries VERY fast, but is not a dry application. I also had an issue with it leaving white streaks on my clothes once I put my shirt on. I&#x27;m assuming the problem can be easily fixed if I wait a few minutes to get dressed after applying the &amp;#34;dry spray.&amp;#34; This isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I most likely will not be buying this in the future (I originally received the product for free). It smells great but does not live up to its name.</li>
            <li> Dove is a brand that consistently offers great reliable products with this deodorant being no exception. It is easy to apply once you get the hang of it and over the initial \\&quot;cold\\&quot; feeling that happens when you aim an aerosol stream at your armpit. I was happy with it and through it worked very well, but I would NOT wear it to the gym or during anything strenuous. Another plus is that it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> This deodorant does not work for anyone that has moderate to heavy sweating. I would say it probably wouldn&#x27;t even last for the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sweating person. I found myself either reapplying or grabbing my solid deodorant to go over it. It&#x27;s winter and I don&#x27;t even work up a sweat right now and it still doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
