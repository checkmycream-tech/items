    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I imagine if you slept perfectly still, this would not come off.</li>
            <li>Works great for my husband!</li>
            <li>Works perfect.  </li>
            <li>Not the best</li>
            <li>It is excellent</li>
            <li>Great product, best solution for snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband snores beautifully with his jaw shut, so make a test before purchase</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Great idea,</li>
            <li>Its also adjustable strap for perfect fit of head size.</li>
            <li>My guess is that this is a top a seller b/c of the picture - great marketing - poor/cheap product.</li>
            <li>Just 2 more inches at each end!</li>
            <li>Great for snoring issue but too bulky to fit my cpap mask over.</li>
            <li>It is probably a great strap for the size of head it would fit, however I don&#x27;t feel like impacted teeth</li>
            <li>that i got this in exchanged of my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>I rated this item a two because I cant honestly say whether it works or not.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product as a friend recommendation and the result is not 100% effective</li>
            <li>The product is very much effective in controlling the snoring issue.</li>
            <li>every night.&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It also is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to modify it.</li>
            <li>but I wish they would have added about 2 more inches of fabric at each end.</li>
            <li>Bought a mouth piece designed for snoring which worked much better.</li>
            <li>Use an app to track sleep and snoring and wearing this made me snore MORE, plus I woke up with a sore jaw and headache that lasted for 3 days.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Well my husband says it works for the better part of the night.</li>
            <li>I was sent this product free to review and gave honest feedback</li>
            <li>I can sleep better than before.</li>
            <li>so I never was able to try it.</li>
            <li>Now i can sleep better.</li>
            <li>This chin strap is super effective.</li>
            <li>This was easy to put on, had no problems with the holes going over his ears.</li>
            <li>Easy problem to solve though.</li>
            <li>Slips around to easily on your head.</li>
            <li>has strong rubbery smell</li>
            <li>1 ) Has a strong plastic smell - will take a number of washes to remove.</li>
            <li>It also has a strong chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>Amazon did a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and although almost at the limit of its adjustment it fits fine.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and am satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>It dose have a very strong plastic smell when its first opened up.</li>
            <li>a longer adjustable strap may make it more useful.  </li>
            <li>I am also comfortable wearing this while sleeping.</li>
            <li>Says it comfortable</li>
            <li>I find it comfortable</li>
            <li>It seems to fit</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my husband&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my husband&#x27;s head, so we don&#x27;t know if it would work or not.</li>
            <li>It does comfortably hold your mouth shut while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>A little more research and engineering and this could have been a great product.</li>
            <li>So far this is the second best chin strap.  </li>
            <li>chin strap, constructed well, does fill the wider chin portion that I was looking for and has a very nice, comfortable wide padded chin area.  </li>
            <li>I still woke up to the sound of my own snore several nights in a row.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I think it would work great if it were the right size.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li>and I just could not get it comfortable enough to be able to go to sleep with it.</li>
            <li>but I guess my grandson thinks it is fun to play with.</li>
            <li>This strap is better than any of the many other chin straps I have tried.</li>
            <li>The slots for the ears are about the right size for a chipmunk.</li>
            <li>Kind of small but works OK.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the overall fit and size of that chin strap was just fine.  </li>
            <li>Great design but way too tight for a normal head.</li>
            <li>No, sorry to say, it did not work at all.  </li>
            <li>and I am sure it&#x27;s life span will be short.</li>
            <li>He said that he felt better in the morning and felt like he actually got rest.</li>
            <li>Not that I have a big head (maybe to some people :) )</li>
            <li>If would be nice to have different size choices, and also maybe a piece that goes around the back of your head that would help keep the top part from sliding too far</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>I was wondering even if it was new because the strap was sitting inside the envelope with no plastic wrapping to ensure fresh newness.</li>
            <li>have a large head, 7 3/4, which I cannot change</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t help it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have a large head.  </li>
            <li>Did not stop me from snoring much to my wife&#x27;s dismay.....</li>
            <li>and i got this and very thankful with it.</li>
            <li>which is very comfort to wear,i tried it myself also to check if it it comfy.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t stay positioned very well while sleeping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel that it works:/</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that it almost doesn&#x27;t fit all the way around</li>
            <li>This stayed on his head the whole night too unlike others he has tried.</li>
            <li>He didn’t snore too much that night either.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>work very well for me</li>
            <li>Holes do not line up with ones ears very well.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is it works better than all the other straps I&#x27;ve tried and I will be replacing them as I need them.</li>
            <li>He said it felt better than other ones that he has tried.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear a full face mask as the extra pressure breaks the seal with my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He can snore pretty loud and keep me awake at times.</li>
            <li>The first problem as mentioned by many others is that it&#x27;s really too small.</li>
            <li>This is too generic and doesn&#x27;t allow for recognition of different head shapes and sizes I can&#x27;t find a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; spot on the top of my head where it will stay without either sliding too far forward or backward, which loosens the whole system.</li>
            <li>but it barely reached around my head enough for the velcro to snap without crushing my skull.</li>
            <li>I wear a large size gas mask if anyone is familiar with the fitment of those, my head is longer than your average bear though.</li>
            <li>I live alone</li>
            <li>it was advertised accurately- easy to use and less intrusive than masks.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive feeling.</li>
            <li>It has reduced his loud snore!</li>
            <li>Really small didn&#x27;t even fit my husband!</li>
            <li>works great &amp; fits well, I use it to keep my mouth closed with the pillow C-pap mask, as I hate the face mask I had to use before, now I can use the pillow mask instead &amp; sleep soooooo much better, thanks</li>
            <li>This has helped for more restful sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The chin portion of the strap that was provided by my insurance is very narrow in the chin area</li>
            <li>The strap barely reached around my head and was over tight the first night, but it quickly loosened up.  </li>
            <li>If you have a large head this definitely isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>feelings.&lt;br /&gt;The material is padded and soft</li>
            <li>but  it did reduce the loud noise that wife can tolerate.</li>
            <li>I bought this anti snore chin strap for my husband to stop his loud snoring.</li>
            <li>One of my friend was having this loud snoring problem.</li>
            <li>and I gave it the old college try.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes!</li>
            <li>Very tight fit.  </li>
            <li>However, the rest of the strap is way too small and barely fit my head.  </li>
            <li>I need one that will cover my 25 inches comfortably and this one is way too small.</li>
            <li>I have tried 4 or 5 other chin straps and this is the first KEEPER of them all.</li>
            <li>It seams like it would work for someone who just snores and has no other sinus issues, but for me my nose plugs up</li>
            <li>I really thought it was going to help me sleep better and not snore, or at least snore less.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with and is pictured wrapped around a clear plastic mannequin head instead of a human head on the product blurbs by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Since it does not fit I can&#x27;t say how useful it is.</li>
            <li>Other than that it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>Due to the necessity of a fairly high pressure to alleviate apnea episodes</li>
            <li>On top of the fact, that it runs small, it is itchy, and there is a strong unpleasant plastic smell.</li>

            <li> Since it does not fit I can&#x27;t say how useful it is.</li>
            <li> Other than that it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> Due to the necessity of a fairly high pressure to alleviate apnea episodes</li>
            <li> On top of the fact, that it runs small, it is itchy, and there is a strong unpleasant plastic smell.</li>
            <li> not sure if it really works for me</li>
            <li> It is still useable, but don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying several different types of headgear trying to keep my mouth closed, I saw this one and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much of a chin line and every other one that I&#x27;ve tried has a really narrow chin holder and slips away from my chin during the night.</li>
            <li> and it was a itchy uncomfortable fit.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat difficult to get the strap adjusted comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Well, I really wanted this to solve (or at least help)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a total mouth breather, and snore even if my mouth is closed, according to my wife.</li>
            <li> definitely keeps my mouth closed.</li>
            <li> It does stop dry mouth (leather tongue, as I call it).  </li>
            <li> I think that I needed a larger one as it does not fit over my ears properly.</li>
            <li> I found this very uncomfortable, no matter how many adjustments I made.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty large noggin and this was just painful to wear.</li>
            <li> The strap is too short it is only for someone with a small head or its for a child.  </li>
            <li> I did find that if you turn it inside out, the chin part is much smoother and less scratchy; as others have complained about as well.</li>
            <li> and  his head is much larger than mine, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The material was not breathable it held moisture and got wet.</li>
            <li> I had to wear the strap in front of and partially over my ears.  </li>
            <li> it is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> and im having a rough time to sleep beside him</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent my snoring since I still snore with my mouth closed.  </li>
            <li> Keep slipping off my husbands head.</li>
            <li> Material is too rough inside.</li>
            <li> Kept mouth closed, snoring continued.</li>
            <li> Hot, uncomfortable, itchy, limited efficacy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain if this is something which is supposed to help over time, but for me time&#x27;s up on this item.</li>
            <li> We ended up only putting one ear through the ear hole because if we used both it rubbed the ear raw on one side.  </li>
            <li> Had it been a little larger and not so tight, it may have helped, but I guess I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
            <li> 2) Fits only a SMALL head.</li>
            <li> My husband snores every night mostly due to his jaw relaxing</li>
            <li> I suggested him to try this snoring chinstrap and he thanked me endlessly.</li>
            <li> Wife did not like this strap, uncomfortable and HOT.  </li>
            <li> I tried adjusting the straps and re-positioning them to no avail, it either gave me a headache from being too tight or slipped off from being to loose.  </li>
            <li> Not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> However its not very comfortable to sleep with a strap on your head and mouthpiece in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not very comfortable to wear overnight; I found myself waking up to remove it.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to try this item because I already use a chin strap for snoring and dry mouth along with a CPAP nasal mask.</li>
            <li> After wearing it just for a few hours my jaw was in extreme pain.  </li>
            <li> No more open mouth and no more snoring.</li>
            <li> It was too tight.</li>
            <li> Strap was too tight.</li>
            <li> Too tight.  </li>
            <li> but I did have to add a little extension to it.  </li>
            <li> A little too small and not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days and have this to say.</li>
            <li> So far difficult to get used to.</li>
            <li> Is it possible it made the snoring worse?  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does not fit to allow ears to protrude thru the side openings.</li>
            <li> tone size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> does not fit around ears comfortly</li>
            <li> slid around on face at night, not comfortable...</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times-</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Perhaps that would go away after a few washes.</li>
            <li> The material is not smooth and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I could hardly put it in my ears (and I have an average size head).</li>
            <li> I am a small woman and have an &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; head, yet it did not fit.</li>
            <li> The Chin Strap was to small and did not fit around my husband&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star though mine is too small.</li>
            <li> Even too small it worked</li>
            <li> It is to small for my husband we had to add an inch of velcro for it to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, even when extended fully.  </li>
            <li> The ear slots were cut to small.</li>
            <li> I need to get a CPAP and will use it so I can use the small nose mask.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, do not buy!</li>
            <li> Way too small.</li>
            <li> Seems to work some but not really sure.</li>
            <li> but it was too small</li>
            <li> The thing is small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too small for me.</li>
            <li> Not very good.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep in place on head</li>
            <li> The material felt rough on my chin and was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My husband used a VPAP and takes it off at least twice a night</li>
            <li> so returning it, at least won&#x27;t have to pay return postage.  </li>
            <li> shows because it was too tight and uncomfortable to do so</li>
            <li> It was just too tight and it made it uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Hard to imagine anyone wearing this strap - uncomfortable to say the least...........</li>
            <li> It was so small even with the minimum amount of velcro contact, but was still extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It was also very small, making it uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> The mesh-like fabric where the chin goes is very uncomfortable when this is tight on your head.</li>
            <li> I found quite uncomfortable and chafed my chin quite a bit.</li>
            <li> and this creates a difficult situation with chin straps.</li>
            <li> but in reality I didn&#x27;t snore because I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep with it on as it is so uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Really uncomfortable. ....</li>
            <li> It was a fake to me.</li>
            <li> I tried it because the mouth pieces seem to work but are uncomfortable and</li>
            <li> So uncomfortable for someone who has a bob.</li>
            <li> but it was extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and it was uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Im afraid it is putting pressure on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> That turned out to be very uncomfortable and made for a</li>
            <li> This strap is very uncomfortable and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s makes it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> It was impossible.</li>
            <li> It also has a bad smell.</li>
            <li> like I was a bad kid.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this product from the moment I opened the padded envelop it came in.</li>
            <li> Terrible uncomfortable !</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and they hated it and ended up having to trash it since it did not perform.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would work but the smell of the material is horrible</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m shocking, I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> This item was horrible and did not do as described by the seller.</li>
            <li> It also has an awful chemical smell in the fabric.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product but had to send back.  It was too tight.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star though mine is too small. I&#x27;ll be able to modify it. Even too small it worked but I wish they would have added about 2 more inches of fabric at each end. Just 2 more inches at each end!</li>
            <li> The strap is too short it is only for someone with a small head or its for a child.  Since it does not fit I can&#x27;t say how useful it is. a longer adjustable strap may make it more useful.  I bought 2 with the hope that if it worked for me, then I would have one for my husband. Since it didn&#x27;t work for me. and  his head is much larger than mine, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The chin strap is not one size fits all. It is to small for my husband we had to add an inch of velcro for it to work. It does however slide off while sleeping. So it should be larger.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all for me</li>
            <li> I bought this device with the highest expectations.  I really thought it was going to help me sleep better and not snore, or at least snore less.  No, sorry to say, it did not work at all.  I still woke up to the sound of my own snore several nights in a row.  So, there it is.  It did not work for me.  I have to say I did not enclose my ears like the picture shows because it was too tight and uncomfortable to do so and that is why I gave it two stars instead of only one.  Maybe if it fits properly it will help someone.  I am a small woman and have an &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; head, yet it did not fit.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this product from the moment I opened the padded envelop it came in. I was wondering even if it was new because the strap was sitting inside the envelope with no plastic wrapping to ensure fresh newness. There was no written material that came with the package. I used it for a few days and have this to say. The material was not breathable it held moisture and got wet. The material felt rough on my chin and was uncomfortable. I am comparing it with Stop Snoring Chin Strap I replaced it with and is pictured wrapped around a clear plastic mannequin head instead of a human head on the product blurbs by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try this item because I already use a chin strap for snoring and dry mouth along with a CPAP nasal mask. This has helped for more restful sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The chin portion of the strap that was provided by my insurance is very narrow in the chin area and so it somewhat hurt or irritated my chin by morning.  I also have a goatee that may or may not play into this.  Otherwise the overall fit and size of that chin strap was just fine.  So I wanted to try something with a wider chin area.&lt;br /&gt;This chin strap, constructed well, does fill the wider chin portion that I was looking for and has a very nice, comfortable wide padded chin area.  My chin did not hurt nor was it irritated by morning.  However, the rest of the strap is way too small and barely fit my head.  Also using the cutouts for your ears didn&#x27;t work well either.  If I used the cutouts the strap would slip off the back of my head.  I had to wear the strap in front of and partially over my ears.  That turned out to be very uncomfortable and made for a not so restful night.&lt;br /&gt;So I will be returning this chin strap and maybe look for something else.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Because it wraps around the ears it won&#x27;t slip off.</li>
            <li> So far difficult to get used to. The seller&lt;br /&gt;and Amazon did a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep trying!&lt;br /&gt;I have a large head, 7 3/4, which I cannot change</li>
            <li> My wide woke me up to tell me that I was snoring loudly. I c thought I had forgotten to wear it.  I was very disappointed w h en o realized that I was wearing the chin strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chin strap is a bust!</li>
            <li> Did not stop me from snoring much to my wife&#x27;s dismay.....</li>
            <li> I imagine if you slept perfectly still, this would not come off. It&#x27;s small, even when extended fully.  Fell off before I could get to sleep.  Hard to imagine anyone wearing this strap - uncomfortable to say the least...........</li>
            <li> I think that I needed a larger one as it does not fit over my ears properly. Other than that, I think it would work great if it were the right size.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, My Mistake</li>
            <li> has strong rubbery smell</li>
            <li> The design of this apparatus was, no doubt, copied from something found in a medieval torture chamber...I awoke after two hours of use screaming &amp;#34;please NO MORE.&amp;#34; For a moment (as I was clearing my head from the pain) I thought that I&#x27;d been kicked in the chin by a Missouri mule. My tongue was throbbing. This was a foolish and wishful purchase on my part...don&#x27;t make the same mistake...it is a total waste of money. I will say that it was promptly delivered, thank you.</li>
            <li> Hot, uncomfortable, itchy, limited efficacy.  The slots for the ears are about the right size for a chipmunk.</li>
            <li> Great for snoring issue but too bulky to fit my cpap mask over.</li>
            <li> 1 ) Has a strong plastic smell - will take a number of washes to remove. 2) Fits only a SMALL head. 3) I found quite uncomfortable and chafed my chin quite a bit. My guess is that this is a top a seller b/c of the picture - great marketing - poor/cheap product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as he snores a lot and im having a rough time to sleep beside him and i got this and very thankful with it.It works well and he doesnt snore at all anymore.Hes sleeping well and breathing well with it ,no uncomfort feelings.&lt;br /&gt;The material is padded and soft which is very comfort to wear,i tried it myself also to check if it it comfy.Its also adjustable strap for perfect fit of head size.Great product, best solution for snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad that i got this in exchanged of my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me!</li>
            <li> Does not stop all snores, buyer beware! My husband snores beautifully with his jaw shut, so make a test before purchase</li>
            <li> The Chin Strap was to small and did not fit around my husband&#x27;s head. The ear slots were cut to small. I was not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent my snoring since I still snore with my mouth closed.  It does stop dry mouth (leather tongue, as I call it).  I need to get a CPAP and will use it so I can use the small nose mask.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all, Guess I now have to be checked for Sleep Apnea.</li>
            <li> Is it possible it made the snoring worse?  It certainly didn&#x27;t help it.</li>
            <li> This product did not reduce snoring at all. Waste of money. My husband snores every night mostly due to his jaw relaxing so I thought this product would work. He tried it out and it didn&#x27;t work. It still allows your jaw to move back and it was a itchy uncomfortable fit. He had to remove it in the middle of the second night wearing it. It also has a strong chemical smell to it. I will give it one star and that&#x27;s pushing it.</li>
            <li> Great design but way too tight for a normal head. Also doesn&#x27;t stay positioned very well while sleeping. Bought a mouth piece designed for snoring which worked much better.</li>
            <li> It does not fit to allow ears to protrude thru the side openings. Also it will not stay on thru the night requiring sleep interruption.</li>
            <li> Great idea, but I can&#x27;t use it.  I need one that will cover my 25 inches comfortably and this one is way too small.</li>
            <li> Did not work! Keep slipping off my husbands head. Still snored with it in place. Waste of money, do not buy!</li>
            <li> It is somewhat difficult to get the strap adjusted comfortably.  We ended up only putting one ear through the ear hole because if we used both it rubbed the ear raw on one side.  I have also noticed that the fabric around the ear hole is fraying.  It is still useable, but don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  So far this is the second best chin strap.  My husband used a VPAP and takes it off at least twice a night and this creates a difficult situation with chin straps.</li>
            <li> Not confortable to use. Material is too rough inside.</li>
            <li> I rated this item a two because I cant honestly say whether it works or not.  Well, technically it worked because I didn&#x27;t snore when I was wearing it, but in reality I didn&#x27;t snore because I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep with it on as it is so uncomfortable.  I tried adjusting the straps and re-positioning them to no avail, it either gave me a headache from being too tight or slipped off from being to loose.  I am going to try the mouth piece next.</li>
            <li> I am told that I still snore.</li>
            <li> Way too small. Not even my dog can use it.</li>
            <li> This is so different but seems to work..but just getting them to use it..great product..</li>
            <li> Very tight fit.  Should keep mouth from opening.  This is except for people on a CPAP.</li>
            <li> Sleeping on my side to reduce snoring was not working for me.  I have very sensitive feeling. I don’t like the feeling of putting something on my nose. Wife has been complaining about my snoring problem and she is tired on always putting me on my side to reduce the sound. Bought this product as a friend recommendation and the result is not 100% effective but  it did reduce the loud noise that wife can tolerate. I am also comfortable wearing this while sleeping.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep in place on head</li>
            <li> does not stay in place while even putting it on, let alone sleeping.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would work but the smell of the material is horrible so it&#x27;s makes it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> did&#x27;t  work to short.....</li>
            <li> A little too small and not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel that it works:/</li>
            <li> Works great for my husband! Says it comfortable</li>
            <li> tone size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> This strap is very uncomfortable and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 or 5 other chin straps and this is the first KEEPER of them all. When it needs replacing I will go with this same one</li>
            <li> I felt it was working but daughter says otherwise and strap gets stuck in my hair</li>
            <li> Nope. Use an app to track sleep and snoring and wearing this made me snore MORE, plus I woke up with a sore jaw and headache that lasted for 3 days. Waste of money. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t stay on over night. slips off head.</li>
            <li> does not fit around ears comfortly</li>
            <li> This was an experiment to see if a chin strap would make any difference. My husband  says I have not snored once since I started using it. I find it comfortable and although almost at the limit of its adjustment it fits fine. I love it.</li>
            <li> Works perfect.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty large noggin and this was just painful to wear. The mesh-like fabric where the chin goes is very uncomfortable when this is tight on your head. It was so small even with the minimum amount of velcro contact, but was still extremely uncomfortable. I wear a large size gas mask if anyone is familiar with the fitment of those, my head is longer than your average bear though.</li>
            <li> slid around on face at night, not comfortable...</li>
            <li> Well my husband says it works for the better part of the night. However its not very comfortable to sleep with a strap on your head and mouthpiece in your mouth. I toss a lot to it stayed on but woke up with my ear hurting during the night one time where it was pinching it . If you can sacrafice comfort go for it. I was sent this product free to review and gave honest feedback</li>
            <li> I bought this anti snore chin strap for my husband to stop his loud snoring. I also wanted to get some sleep myself. When he use it, it works. It has reduced his loud snore! I can sleep better than before. If you are looking for a snoring solution, give it a try.</li>
            <li> One of my friend was having this loud snoring problem. I suggested him to try this snoring chinstrap and he thanked me endlessly. The product is very much effective in controlling the snoring issue.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m shocking, I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Seems to work some but not really sure.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and am satisfied with the product.  The only problem I have is that it almost doesn&#x27;t fit all the way around and I don&#x27;t have a large head.  They should make it in longer lengths.  Other than that it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> This strap is better than any of the many other chin straps I have tried. I use it with my cpap on a nightly basis. it can&#x27;t be used with your ears through the slots as it slides off the back of your head when you do.  The strap barely reached around my head and was over tight the first night, but it quickly loosened up.  The elastic is getting longer and  It has to be tightened up every couple of weeks and I am sure it&#x27;s life span will be short. I ware the strap in front of my ears. Bottom line is it works better than all the other straps I&#x27;ve tried and I will be replacing them as I need them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this because I thought it would keep me from snoring. I&#x27;m a total mouth breather, and snore even if my mouth is closed, according to my wife. I wear a CPAP with a mask that just covers my nose. Due to the necessity of a fairly high pressure to alleviate apnea episodes I can&#x27;t wear a full face mask as the extra pressure breaks the seal with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying several different types of headgear trying to keep my mouth closed, I saw this one and decided to give it a try. It sort of does what I need it to, but I&#x27;m constantly having to move it back into place on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it...the widest/best chin strap of any I have ever tried. I don&#x27;t have much of a chin line and every other one that I&#x27;ve tried has a really narrow chin holder and slips away from my chin during the night. In combination with the overall quality of the material, this stays on my chin all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it would take to get to five stars for me....This is too generic and doesn&#x27;t allow for recognition of different head shapes and sizes I can&#x27;t find a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; spot on the top of my head where it will stay without either sliding too far forward or backward, which loosens the whole system. If would be nice to have different size choices, and also maybe a piece that goes around the back of your head that would help keep the top part from sliding too far forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely keeps my mouth closed.</li>
            <li> Really uncomfortable. ....can&#x27;t sleep in this</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times- it was advertised accurately- easy to use and less intrusive than masks.  I live alone so I don&#x27;t have someone&lt;br /&gt;complaining about my snoring- if I do- so no push to use it every day.</li>
            <li> Not very good. Started shredding and coming apart after 2 months use. Thrown away</li>
            <li> It advertised one size fits all but it was too small so I never was able to try it.</li>
            <li> My husband starting using this the night we received it. He can snore pretty loud and keep me awake at times. This was easy to put on, had no problems with the holes going over his ears. He said it felt better than other ones that he has tried. This stayed on his head the whole night too unlike others he has tried. He didn’t snore too much that night either. He said that he felt better in the morning and felt like he actually got rest. He says he will definitely wear this every night.&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> This item was horrible and did not do as described by the seller. I bought this for a friend and they hated it and ended up having to trash it since it did not perform. It was a fake to me.</li>
            <li> Well, I really wanted this to solve (or at least help) my sleep apnea problem and I gave it the old college try. The first problem as mentioned by many others is that it&#x27;s really too small. Not that I have a big head (maybe to some people :) ) but it barely reached around my head enough for the velcro to snap without crushing my skull. It was just too tight and it made it uncomfortable to wear. I did find that if you turn it inside out, the chin part is much smoother and less scratchy; as others have complained about as well. I tried putting it over my ears, in front of my ears and around my ears and I just could not get it comfortable enough to be able to go to sleep with it. Had it been a little larger and not so tight, it may have helped, but I guess I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
            <li> This really works. I use it in conjunction with my CPAP mask and it keeps my chin in place so when I lie on my back, my face doesn&#x27;t sag and so the seal on my mask stays without developing leaks. It also is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Wish there would be size charts or sizes on the description.  It is probably a great strap for the size of head it would fit, however I don&#x27;t feel like impacted teeth so returning it, at least won&#x27;t have to pay return postage.  If you have a large head this definitely isn&#x27;t for you.  For anyone else wondering my head measures 27.5&amp;#34; for the total circumference around my head in the way this sits.</li>
            <li> It seems to fit well it looks like it will do what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It does not work. Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> The chin strap has not helped my snoring but it does keep me from breathing through my mouth.</li>
            <li> This might work for some but it did not help me at all.  I think it may have increased my snoring, rather than easing it.  My wife (my biggest critic) did not notice any change upon applying it.  Also, it is not very comfortable to wear overnight; I found myself waking up to remove it.  I&#x27;m not certain if this is something which is supposed to help over time, but for me time&#x27;s up on this item.</li>
            <li> This thing didn&#x27;t work for me. It was also very small, making it uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> not sure if it really works for me</li>
            <li> It shifts and does not stay in place. It also has an awful chemical smell in the fabric. Perhaps that would go away after a few washes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my husband&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I knew this was wishful thinking.  I tried it because the mouth pieces seem to work but are uncomfortable and Im afraid it is putting pressure on my teeth.  But all this product did was hold my mouth shut and did nothing to help the snoring.  Waist of money.</li>
            <li> works great &amp; fits well, I use it to keep my mouth closed with the pillow C-pap mask, as I hate the face mask I had to use before, now I can use the pillow mask instead &amp; sleep soooooo much better, thanks</li>
            <li> Wife did not like this strap, uncomfortable and HOT.  Did not breath</li>
            <li> So uncomfortable for someone who has a bob. You can&#x27;t tie your hair (hair tie won&#x27;t stay)!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t recommend this product at all! I had such high hopes!</li>
            <li> Chin strap will not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Kind of small but works OK. Not the best but it serves its purpose</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me but I guess my grandson thinks it is fun to play with.</li>
            <li> I found this very uncomfortable, no matter how many adjustments I made.  It also has a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Strap was too tight. It says one size fits all but it was extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> disappointment--doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my husband&#x27;s head, so we don&#x27;t know if it would work or not.</li>
            <li> It seams like it would work for someone who just snores and has no other sinus issues, but for me my nose plugs up and i start gasping for air.  It does comfortably hold your mouth shut while sleeping.  It dose have a very strong plastic smell when its first opened up.</li>
            <li> Really small didn&#x27;t even fit my husband!</li>
            <li> Terrible uncomfortable ! does not work!</li>
            <li> It is excellent but I did have to add a little extension to it.  Too tight.  Easy problem to solve though.</li>
            <li> The thing is small. I could hardly put it in my ears (and I have an average size head). My husband could not even do that. I tried to sleep in it. It was impossible. On top of the fact, that it runs small, it is itchy, and there is a strong unpleasant plastic smell. Returning it.</li>
            <li> The material is not smooth and irritated my skin. I think it may work if I could wear it.</li>
            <li> After wearing it just for a few hours my jaw was in extreme pain.  Several weeks later and the pain is still there.</li>
            <li> Google quality and design excep it&#x27;s too small for me.</li>
            <li> work very well for me</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and it was uncomfortable</li>
            <li> This chin strap is super effective. No more open mouth and no more snoring. Works just as described. Now i can sleep better. Keeps in place all the time. Five star product.</li>
            <li> Kept mouth closed, snoring continued. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Did not help my husband, he still snores</li>
            <li> Slips and slides around and twists my ears like I was a bad kid.</li>
            <li> Slips around to easily on your head. Holes do not line up with ones ears very well. A little more research and engineering and this could have been a great product.</li>
