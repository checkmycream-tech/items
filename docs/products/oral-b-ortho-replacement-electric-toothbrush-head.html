            <li>Best deal around when ordered through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the best toothbrush heads I have every come across for braces!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>This is the ideal brush head for Braces.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect tool for effectively cleaning teeth while in braces!</li>
            <li>For those of us with sensitivities to dyes and colorants, it&#x27;s a good find!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless together they&#x27;re great for cleaning your braces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As advertised - nice, and durable!</li>
            <li>It never pushes off the bracket and they have each loved this product.</li>
            <li>GOOD FOR BRACES WISH THEY HAD A MULTI PACK</li>
            <li>and I got them at a good price.</li>
            <li>More companies should get wise to the fact that consumers don&#x27;t want the chemicals!</li>
            <li>This is the best way to keep teeth clean while wearing braces.</li>
            <li>But much more affordable than the ones my orthodontist is selling!</li>
            <li>I have used these for too many years as my children have gone through braces (3 kids!).</li>
            <li>I am sure it does a good job if you do have orthodontics.  </li>
            <li>the power tip will even go in between teeth like a floss and all around brackets and wire to leave your teeth and braces nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my son who has braces on his teeth love this product and I love it because I get a good report from my dentist.</li>
            <li>He stated he liked this brush better than the one he had at home.</li>
            <li>More effective for me than sonic care.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel nice and clean!</li>
            <li>I wish these brushes were able in stores.  </li>
            <li>Most children&#x27;s electric toothbrushes come as one piece - the brush and the head.</li>
            <li>I am reordering another type and not using this one any more.</li>
            <li>and they also say it fits under and around the wire better.</li>
            <li>We want to be sure that there are no cavities lurking under the braces when they come off.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you buy a bunch of sets as all that metal tends to wear out bristles a bit faster then teeth a d you might find yourself needing to replace heads more often.</li>
            <li>The best thing to clean and to use on braces, and this is the only place that I have found the refill and the price is great, and fast delivery service.</li>
            <li>They were so excited at his oral hygiene habits!</li>
            <li>and you can tell it really does a great job getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>A friend suggested we get theses brush heads to help keep her teeth in good health with the braces and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>also love how I can use it to clean under the molar bands</li>
            <li>Thanks, Oral B. Nicely Done.</li>
            <li>Why is this cheap knockoff even carry the brand name?</li>
            <li>Great for kids with braces as they don&#x27;t get destroyed as quickly by the wire brackets as regular brush heads.</li>
            <li>Her dentist commended her on how well she was keeping her teeth clean.</li>
            <li>He said nothing else works and makes his mouth/teeth clean.</li>
            <li>wife loved it especially since she put the braces on</li>
            <li>My 9 year old with braces loved the brush head, but the 13 year old likes a manual brush better than electric with his braces.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like the clean feeling a fresh brush head gives, right?</li>
            <li>Works very well with braces, easy to use</li>
            <li>Right one, received quickly.</li>
            <li>He has been having trouble keeping his orthodontist happy with his brushing.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price to get the Oral-B replacement head.</li>
            <li>These are a bit spendy, but worth it for my kid in braces.  </li>
            <li>I realized how well the orthodontic heads really worked and that they are worth the pricey replacement cost!</li>
            <li>(she called it a &amp;#34;kid&#x27;s brush&amp;#34;), and I have to say</li>
            <li>My daughter has braces and just had her first cleaning since she got them.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This head works perfect on standard brace brackets as it wraps around the outside of the bracket to pick up any food debris and polishes the bracket itself with the middle brushes.</li>
            <li>Cleans around brackets better than regular tooth brushes</li>
            <li>We got the toothbrush from the orthodontist, and it really helps with brushing around the braces.</li>
            <li>But, this is very abrasive if you don&#x27;t have braces.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and my son have braces and really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>I thought the oral b pro-health ortho brush was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have done very well for my teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those with braces.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this and the normal (non-ortho) brush.  </li>
            <li>So save your money and buy the normal set instead (which normally comes in a multipack).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush head does a better job at cleaning around the brackets than the regular \\&quot;full\\&quot; oral-b brush head (I&#x27;ve always used the blue soft ones before braces) and</li>
            <li>I expected same exact brush head which came with the originally purchased Oral-b brush.  </li>
            <li>I use these with adult braces with no problem.</li>
            <li>This was bought for our 11 year old&#x27;s Pro-Health For Me toothbrush.</li>
            <li>According to my dentist, it&#x27;s because the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; heads for electric toothbrushes are too hard and too big for the bristles to fit well against the brackets, and therefore the tooth closest to the bracket gets missed.</li>

            <li> I do recommend buying several at once, though, as it seems they need to be replaced roughly once a month.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I could not find a similar brush that had a standard round brush pattern.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the expensive Oral B toothbrush thru my son&#x27;s orthodontist when he first got his braces and it came with 3 of the orthodontic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I found every other replacement head but that one!</li>
            <li> But, it feels too stiff and harsh on my gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and am only sad that it is harder to get shipped now. :(</li>
            <li> (my teeth are small so the band goes from the crown right to the gum) and even forgo flossing if I&#x27;m running late and not feel dirty and guilty afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement because I had hard time figuring out which replacement head to order.  </li>
            <li> Maybe hard on the enamel.  </li>
            <li> These are getting hard to find</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t tell you that you can&#x27;t buy the orthodontic replacement heads in stores.</li>

            <li> I wish these brushes were able in stores.  Great for kids with braces as they don&#x27;t get destroyed as quickly by the wire brackets as regular brush heads.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect tool for effectively cleaning teeth while in braces!</li>
            <li> I have the misfortune of needing braces for the SECOND time in my life, and I&#x27;ve been struggling with plaque build-up. According to my dentist, it&#x27;s because the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; heads for electric toothbrushes are too hard and too big for the bristles to fit well against the brackets, and therefore the tooth closest to the bracket gets missed. She recommended I try something like this (she called it a &amp;#34;kid&#x27;s brush&amp;#34;), and I have to say - I think it is making a difference. Plus, I searched at King Soopers, Safeway, Target, etc., and this is the only place I&#x27;ve found such heads. Most children&#x27;s electric toothbrushes come as one piece - the brush and the head. Nowhere could I find a &amp;#34;child&#x27;s&amp;#34; head for an electric toothbrush. I do recommend buying several at once, though, as it seems they need to be replaced roughly once a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B for about 25 years and no brush cleans around your teeth like it does.  I have all my wisdom teeth and the shape makes it easier to reach and brush  all around them.</li>
            <li> Works very well with braces, easy to use and you can tell it really does a great job getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Right one, received quickly.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  I use these with adult braces with no problem.</li>
            <li> Still have to make my kids work at it to get the yellow off their teeth around the brackets. Seems like any head would need the same effort. But much more affordable than the ones my orthodontist is selling!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for cleaning teeth with braces.  Timely de!ivery.</li>
            <li> My daughter has braces and just had her first cleaning since she got them. Her dentist commended her on how well she was keeping her teeth clean. A friend suggested we get theses brush heads to help keep her teeth in good health with the braces and it really helps.</li>

            <li> Best deal around when ordered through subscribe and save. They come every three months, which is easier than having to remember to purchase them at the store.</li>
            <li> Works well with braces but your orthodontist may have it for a lower price.</li>
            <li> My son loves this toothbrush for his braces. The only one to use!</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I can find these brush heads for braces.  Signed up for autoship every couple months so I never run out.</li>
            <li> my son who has braces on his teeth love this product and I love it because I get a good report from my dentist.</li>
            <li> These are a bit spendy, but worth it for my kid in braces.  We got the toothbrush from the orthodontist, and it really helps with brushing around the braces.</li>
            <li> I was so thankful to find these replacement heads on Amazon! I had searched for them in all my local stores to no avail. I purchased the expensive Oral B toothbrush thru my son&#x27;s orthodontist when he first got his braces and it came with 3 of the orthodontic replacement heads. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t tell you that you can&#x27;t buy the orthodontic replacement heads in stores. I found every other replacement head but that one! Once they ran out and he had to use a different toothbrush/head I realized how well the orthodontic heads really worked and that they are worth the pricey replacement cost! My son won&#x27;t use anything else now. He said nothing else works and makes his mouth/teeth clean. Once ordered I received my package in 2 days. Fast shipping! Will definitely continue to purchase thru amazon.com!</li>

            <li> Great product! Makes my teeth feel nice and clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only brand and style without the blue bristles. For those of us with sensitivities to dyes and colorants, it&#x27;s a good find! More companies should get wise to the fact that consumers don&#x27;t want the chemicals!</li>
            <li> I purchased this ortho brush for my grandson.  He just got his braces and spends lots of time at my home.  He stated he liked this brush better than the one he had at home.</li>
            <li> As advertised - nice, and durable!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I could not find a similar brush that had a standard round brush pattern. they work just as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter and my son have braces and really like this brush.  They&#x27;d used a standard oral-b brush before this one.  They feel this brush gets their teeth cleaner and they also say it fits under and around the wire better.</li>
            <li> We want to be sure that there are no cavities lurking under the braces when they come off.  My kids both like this as the proper brush for their Oral B for these two years.</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR BRACES WISH THEY HAD A MULTI PACK</li>
            <li> I thought the oral b pro-health ortho brush was better than I expected. I will recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> The best thing to clean and to use on braces, and this is the only place that I have found the refill and the price is great, and fast delivery service.</li>
            <li> The Orthodontist sang my son&#x27;s praises after I bought this product.  They were so excited at his oral hygiene habits!</li>
            <li> Had braces on for 2 years now and these are all I use. Have to order them online though can&#x27;t find them anywhere at retail locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best toothbrush heads I have every come across for braces!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have done very well for my teeth. Highly recommended for those with braces.</li>
            <li> These are getting hard to find and I got them at a good price.</li>
            <li> More effective for me than sonic care.</li>
            <li> This is the ideal brush head for Braces.  Just enough bristles to to the job but not get in the way of all the metalwork.  Thanks, Oral B. Nicely Done.</li>
            <li> wife loved it especially since she put the braces on</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.  I expected same exact brush head which came with the originally purchased Oral-b brush.  Why is this cheap knockoff even carry the brand name?</li>
            <li> I think it is a very personal thing.  My 9 year old with braces loved the brush head, but the 13 year old likes a manual brush better than electric with his braces.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in an actual store and it was a set (2 brush heads and 2 power tips). It was their last one so I grabbed it. I have never seen those in a store since then though.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless together they&#x27;re great for cleaning your braces.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head does a better job at cleaning around the brackets than the regular \\&quot;full\\&quot; oral-b brush head (I&#x27;ve always used the blue soft ones before braces) and the power tip will even go in between teeth like a floss and all around brackets and wire to leave your teeth and braces nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I also love how I can use it to clean under the molar bands (my teeth are small so the band goes from the crown right to the gum) and even forgo flossing if I&#x27;m running late and not feel dirty and guilty afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! Make sure you buy a bunch of sets as all that metal tends to wear out bristles a bit faster then teeth a d you might find yourself needing to replace heads more often. There&#x27;s nothing like the clean feeling a fresh brush head gives, right?</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Recommended by the dental tech. It gets the job done with my granddaughters braces.</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for</li>
