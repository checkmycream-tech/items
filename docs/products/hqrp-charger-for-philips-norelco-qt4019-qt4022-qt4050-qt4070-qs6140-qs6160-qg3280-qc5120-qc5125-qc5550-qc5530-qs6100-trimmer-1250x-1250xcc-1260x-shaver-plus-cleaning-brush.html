            <li> I lost the charger for my Philips/Norelco QT4014 and ordered this as a replacement.  I have now used it to recharge the trimmer in the USA, in Australia, and in several other countries.  Works fine with both 110v/60 Hz and 220v/50 Hz systems electrical systems.</li>
            <li> The power adapter came as advertised, I cannot comment on if it works as I think my shaver battery died.</li>
