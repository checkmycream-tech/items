    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Of all the gel brands out there, I like Opi the best.  </li>
            <li>Application waas great, didnt have any shrinking issue.</li>
            <li>Pools very easy and doesn&#x27;t seem to cap edges</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love that I can now wear my favorite shade in gel!</li>
            <li>Suitable for going out as well as the workplace.  </li>
            <li>love, love, love this color!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite OPI color</li>
            <li>I use it with a gel top coat and it looks like I had a gel mani at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>my clients love it and request this color for gel nails all the time.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This of one of the colors (in polish &amp; gel) that has made Opi who they are today, top quality &amp; ahead of the curve.  </li>
            <li>if it thickens up more, I will probably not like that.  </li>
            <li>I love this color, however it takes ages to cure under a uv light.</li>
            <li>but I loved this color so much I wanted to get it anyways...</li>
            <li>The color would look great, but it took me five layers (not include the top and bottom, making seven layers total) to get any sort of color out of it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful on toes especially.  </li>
            <li>This was my first Opi gel color, &amp; Amazon has it to thank for my many, many orders since.  </li>
            <li>OPI Gelcolor formula is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I have 3 Gelcolor colors and they are all fabulous.  </li>
            <li>(I realize you are supposed to use a led light)</li>
            <li>you REALLY want this color to work because it would look awesome, but save yourself the hours of agony and move on to a different color.</li>
            <li>easy to order and shipped right on time.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fine and the polish appears to be fresh.</li>
            <li>The thing I love, love, love about Opi Ink is a fine sparkle down in the cured color--it has depth, an almost 3D effect, when you look at your nails in daylight.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>its very very pretty.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty color.</li>
            <li>.This was my first time purchasing nail polish from amazon</li>
            <li>The shimmer in this color is beautiful but the formula sucks!</li>
            <li>Just as easy to use as regular polish and each coat cures in about a minute under the lamp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very runny and will not stay where you put it</li>
            <li>it seems like the gel and the color pigment didn&#x27;t want to stay together no matter how much I shook it.</li>
            <li>A Waitress applied well with no issues, but OPI Ink was so oily that I could not get any color on my brush no matter how much I shook the bottle.</li>
            <li>but this is one of the reasons I like it so much.  </li>
            <li>This color is gorgeous and complex.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and looks different in shade vs. sun.  </li>
            <li>If you get this shade you&#x27;re better off applying one or two coats over another gel polish (like a dark blue or purple).</li>
            <li>Maybe it is old?</li>
            <li>and I was worried that it might be old, damaged, etc.  </li>
            <li>Me, I come back to Ink over &amp; over, no matter what new color or effect</li>
            <li>Of course, in all lights, you get the iconic dark, dark purple-blue that is Ink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more thick than other SOGs and is never streaky.  </li>
            <li>Depending on the light, it can be a very dark blue with glitter flecks or dark purple with glitter flecks.</li>

            <li> I tried shaking it for a VERY long time and it still didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> , this deep dark sparkly purple will not dissappoint you...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not Really</li>
            <li> Not consistent in application.</li>
            <li> I am curious to try the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> THis color is a dark jelly based with has purple glitter</li>
            <li> Very watery which makes it extremely difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this color is watered down.  </li>
            <li> Basically the color is watered down</li>
            <li> This is a very dark purple.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because a lot of gel polishes can be boring or plain</li>
            <li> With a little practice, you can build thin layers that stay on for weeks--I always use 3 layers of color, i.e, a coat of base, 3 coats of color, the top coat.  </li>
            <li> no matter how hard you try.</li>
            <li> Some people have commented that they don&#x27;t like how thick it is</li>
            <li> A very complex color.</li>
            <li> how thin they layer I applied.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it wouldn&#x27;t set up.</li>
            <li> I have heard bad reviews on some of the opi gelcolor polishes</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Not consistent in application. Pools very easy and doesn&#x27;t seem to cap edges well no matter how hard you try.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. Depending on the light, it can be a very dark blue with glitter flecks or dark purple with glitter flecks. A very complex color. It&#x27;s nice because a lot of gel polishes can be boring or plain but this one is definitely not.</li>
            <li> I feel like this color is watered down.  I used it at the nail shop and the consistency was different then the same one the nail shop had.  Basically the color is watered down you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite OPI color and I absolutely love that I can now wear my favorite shade in gel!</li>
            <li> This is a very dark purple.  I use it with a gel top coat and it looks like I had a gel mani at the salon.  Just as easy to use as regular polish and each coat cures in about a minute under the lamp.  Love it.</li>
            <li> THis color is a dark jelly based with has purple glitter its very very pretty. Application waas great, didnt have any shrinking issue.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty color. I bought it to use for the 4th of July. Unfortunately it wouldn&#x27;t set up. I have never had a problem before with soak off gel polish by OPI. Maybe it is old? Something is wrong with it for sure.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this color! easy to order and shipped right on time. my clients love it and request this color for gel nails all the time.</li>
            <li> Very watery which makes it extremely difficult to use.  I tried shaking it for a VERY long time and it still didn&#x27;t help.  This color does not apply as well as it did at the salon when I had it done there.</li>
            <li> OPI colors always rock, this deep dark sparkly purple will not dissappoint you...I love it and it goes with everything</li>
            <li> The shimmer in this color is beautiful but the formula sucks! It&#x27;s very runny and will not stay where you put it, I did a lot of cleanup around the cuticle area, also it is very sheer...it seems like the gel and the color pigment didn&#x27;t want to stay together no matter how much I shook it. If you get this shade you&#x27;re better off applying one or two coats over another gel polish (like a dark blue or purple). I have heard bad reviews on some of the opi gelcolor polishes but I loved this color so much I wanted to get it anyways...big mistake.</li>
            <li> The color would look great, but it took me five layers (not include the top and bottom, making seven layers total) to get any sort of color out of it. Also, the polish did not glide on to nails, rather, it continued to fall/leak/etc all around the nail no matter how thin they layer I applied. I feel you-- you REALLY want this color to work because it would look awesome, but save yourself the hours of agony and move on to a different color. I recommend Bastille My Heart. Now that&#x27;s how nail polish is supposed to look and apply.</li>
            <li> This was my first Opi gel color, &amp; Amazon has it to thank for my many, many orders since.  Of all the gel brands out there, I like Opi the best.  With a little practice, you can build thin layers that stay on for weeks--I always use 3 layers of color, i.e, a coat of base, 3 coats of color, the top coat.  The thing I love, love, love about Opi Ink is a fine sparkle down in the cured color--it has depth, an almost 3D effect, when you look at your nails in daylight.  Of course, in all lights, you get the iconic dark, dark purple-blue that is Ink.  This of one of the colors (in polish &amp; gel) that has made Opi who they are today, top quality &amp; ahead of the curve.  Me, I come back to Ink over &amp; over, no matter what new color or effect I try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gelish for about a year now and decided to try out OPI. I&#x27;m Not Really A Waitress applied well with no issues, but OPI Ink was so oily that I could not get any color on my brush no matter how much I shook the bottle. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous and complex.  It&#x27;s rich and looks different in shade vs. sun.  OPI Gelcolor formula is fabulous.  It&#x27;s more thick than other SOGs and is never streaky.  Some people have commented that they don&#x27;t like how thick it is but this is one of the reasons I like it so much.  Of course, I haven&#x27;t had the bottles for long so if it thickens up more, I will probably not like that.  I have 3 Gelcolor colors and they are all fabulous.  Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive...or they came in smaller bottles at a cheaper price.  I am curious to try the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this color, however it takes ages to cure under a uv light. (I realize you are supposed to use a led light) it took 6 mins a coat to fully cure, whereas gelish takes me 2-3 mins a coat. So... Maybe skip this polish if using uv</li>
            <li> A deep, deep, amost-black purple.  Even darker than the color appears on the cap.  Beautiful on toes especially.  I got a ton of compliments. Suitable for going out as well as the workplace.  (I use the regular INK polish on my toes, and use the matching INK gelcolor on my fingernails.)  .This was my first time purchasing nail polish from amazon and I was worried that it might be old, damaged, etc.  Shipping was fine and the polish appears to be fresh.</li>
