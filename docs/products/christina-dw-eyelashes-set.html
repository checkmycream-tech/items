            <li>For a more dramatic look, just double stack it!</li>

            <li> i mean the price is right, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with false lashes, and I used the same lash glue I always use, but when I put these lashes on, 3 hours later I got a wicked eye infection that lasted for about a week!!!</li>
            <li> Reusable, a little flashy but not ridiculously so...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered them twice in the past year -</li>

            <li> Love them just wish they were full but nice</li>
            <li> Love love love!! Reusable if taken care well. For a more dramatic look, just double stack it! üòä</li>
            <li> Love them because they are light weight and they look amazing on me</li>
            <li> Got these as a gift and now I will be making an order. I love to double stack these lashes. They are so beautiful!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Reusable, a little flashy but not ridiculously so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn these with and without eyeliner and they&#x27;re just as beautiful. Someone is always asking me are these my real lashes. They can&#x27;t believe when I say they&#x27;re strips! Will buy again and again and continue to share with my friends!</li>
            <li> OMG I even like this one&#x27;s better than the red cherry believe it or notüòÉ</li>
            <li> These are pretty much identical to the Red Cherry lashes. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the quantity. If you take care of your lashes, and keep them clean, you can get multiple uses out of them so 12 pairs will last for months!</li>
            <li> Love these!!!!! Perfect dupe for Red Cherry, just cheaper!! Wear them daily, they are gorgeous, I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lashes -  light weight, affordable, easy application. I wear them almost every day.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very beautiful and quite a bargain... HOWEVER, I would strongly suggest sanitizing these somehow before you use them. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with false lashes, and I used the same lash glue I always use, but when I put these lashes on, 3 hours later I got a wicked eye infection that lasted for about a week!!! Like I said, gorgeous lashes but please be careful!!!</li>

            <li> They are pretty much identical to red cherry lashes, but the price point for these is cheaper. All in all, I love them! Very fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li> These seem well made and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love them... just as soon as I practice enough to put them on in less than an hour! :P</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. I think this is my 2nd time writing a review on this style and brand. One of my all time favorite flirty lashes :) very quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I really loved them and they are really the same as red cherry 43...I will buy them again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you KolorizeMe</li>

            <li> Best lashes ever. Great price!</li>
            <li> My favorite eyelashes... EVER and for a great price. I&#x27;ve ordered them twice in the past year - If you take care of your lashes and clean them as you should, they can last so so so long. (Actually, even if you don&#x27;t take care of them they&#x27;ll last awhile... They&#x27;re THAT good.)</li>
