            <li>This is a &amp;#34;leave on conditioner&amp;#34; that leaves my hear shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>If I condition my hair before blow drying it, then I make sure it gets brushed through (but I use a teeeeny-tiny bit because I don&#x27;t want my hair to feel too heavy).</li>
            <li>I have dry coarse hair on the ends due to too much hair color, so I tried using this product and it really helped with my split ends.  </li>

            <li> I have a cabinet full of hair products that failed to live up to their hype.  </li>
            <li> but you only need a dab and will go a long way.</li>

            <li> a \\&quot;little\\&quot; goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> jar will last a long time if used daily you want me need a little bit</li>
            <li> hair is very long and uses one jar in four months</li>

            <li> My hair used to be dry and the hair root dehydrated.</li>
            <li> then brush through my hair &amp; let it dry.</li>
            <li> A little tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a godsend on days where conditioner doesn&#x27;t totally work and my hair is a tangly wet mess.</li>
            <li> perspective:the embarrassing amount spent on&lt;br /&gt;alternate products that didn&#x27;t come close in performance;&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of trying every new thing that comes along, but for the first time I&#x27;ve found a product that I&#x27;ve kept buying.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The product is a pomade that claims to prevent hair from environmental damages, to help detangle, prevent split ends and to nurture the hair with vitamin-E and other nutrients.    </li>
            <li> You only need a small dab and rub into the palm of your hands and rub into the end of your hair.  </li>
            <li> It only takes about a small amount (about the size of a quarter).</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I just apply a small amount in my hands &amp; rub on the outside...</li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scant amount does the trick:&lt;br /&gt;conspicuously unhealthy to soft &amp; shine.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;$40</li>
            <li> I swim almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Treatment #12 by my hairdresser a few years ago.</li>
            <li> My hair felt silky and had a bounce that had been missing.</li>
            <li> You dont need but a small amount, so it lasts me almost a year.</li>
            <li> USE A SMALL AMOUNT &amp; DISTRIBUTE THRU DAMP HAIR.</li>
            <li> so the jar lasts for at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I am so bummed that this product has become difficult to find and</li>
            <li> The only thing it does is to make hair oily and smells terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an amazing product. My hairdresser calls it hair crack.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product. SERIOUSLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should use it on damped hair. It will untangle all the craziness in your hair. It&#x27;s so soft and SILKY. I&#x27;m not exaggerating with my upper casing but I&#x27;m just telling you it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$35 is steep for me but you only need a dab and will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I swim almost everyday. This means i have dry hair. I also color treat my hair. I have tried so many products to alleviate dryness and protect my hair and who knows add some shine? this one is the best so far. I love it. My hair is silky feeling and looks well nourished.</li>
            <li> I started to use Chihtsai No. 12 Instant Treatment about two years ago. I use it control frizz on my hair and add shine. I find it to be better than the oil drops from other lines.    The product is a pomade that claims to prevent hair from environmental damages, to help detangle, prevent split ends and to nurture the hair with vitamin-E and other nutrients.    It has worked very well for me. I only use the equivalent of a couple of drops so the bottle lasts forever and it leaves my hair shiny and free of frizz and flyways. I think I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have dry coarse hair on the ends due to too much hair color, so I tried using this product and it really helped with my split ends.  You only need a small dab and rub into the palm of your hands and rub into the end of your hair.  This product is so easy to use and convenient, because you dont have to wash it out afterwards, and it keeps your hair soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money</li>
            <li> Second order for me, good product.</li>
            <li> chihtsai instant treatment #12,its very good for my hair.very silky,bouncing hair.treat splitends.easy to take care.smells good nice to touch. from susie nyc</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Treatment #12 by my hairdresser a few years ago. Between color treatments and curling irons, I was frying my hair, but the first time she used this after coloring, I noticed a difference. My hair felt silky and had a bounce that had been missing. With continued use, it protected my hair as it grew out so now, instead of masking damage, it prevents it. I have a bad habit of trying every new thing that comes along, but for the first time I&#x27;ve found a product that I&#x27;ve kept buying. I have medium-longish hair and a jar lasts me about a year, so don&#x27;t be put off by the price. It doesn&#x27;t take much but it makes such a difference.</li>
            <li> It works very well with my hair. Besides smell very nice, it makes my hair very smooth. Like it very much; even though a little bit pricey!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to protect my hair from becoming too dry from regular color treatment.  A little goes a long way so I had one jar almost a year and it has plenty more applications to go!  In addition, it has a pleasant scent to it, I&#x27;ve heard compliments from many that my hair smelled good.  I recently tested on my two daughters&#x27; hair which always seem to be tangled - it worked like a miracle!  I&#x27;ve used a number of detangling sprays on their hair, but nothing worked as well as this - definitely I&#x27;ll be coming back for this many times over.  It may seem pricey but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  Remember, a \\&quot;little\\&quot; goes a long way.  Just a tiny dab can be massaged into the ends of the hair and voila - you have a nice, silky hair that is manageable with a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> We call it Hair Magic because it is hands down the best product I have found for getting tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s very fine and baby soft hair. Everything else I have used leads lots of tears and occasionally a pair of scissors to remedy the tangles. I am so bummed that this product has become difficult to find and I am thrilled to find it here. I&#x27;m good for another year.</li>
            <li> it really work in my hair, soft and shine, not smell, no grease, it work as conditioner and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> the best product for hair</li>
            <li> My hair needs just the ends tamed after blow drying. You dont need but a small amount, so it lasts me almost a year. And it smells very nice.</li>
            <li> I have a cabinet full of hair products that failed to live up to their hype.  This product, however, I love.  I&#x27;m purchasing my second jar, so for me to use the entire jar means it actually did what it was supposed to.  A very little goes a long way so the jar lasts for at least 6 months.  It makes my hair soft, silky and shiny without weighing it down at all.  Plus it smells really nice.  I originally bought it from a local hair salon, but they stopped carrying it and tried to convince me to buy a Kerastase product instead.  Kerastase is more expensive, plus, as wonderful as Kerastase is, I didn&#x27;t want to switch when I found a product that worked perfectly.  Thank goodness for the internet!</li>
            <li> Like using it&lt;br /&gt;before and after flat ironing&lt;br /&gt;wear it all the time&lt;br /&gt;smells good&lt;br /&gt;does help with my spilt ends</li>

            <li> Love it.  Everyone should try this product.  It last a long time (well worth the money) and my hair has never felt better or looked healthier.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend hair treatment product. My hair used to be dry and the hair root dehydrated. Used this hair treatment about a week, my hair seems like to improve; shinier and softer. I used many other conditioners but this one is the most effective one.</li>
            <li> Wast of money. The only thing it does is to make hair oily and smells terrible.</li>
            <li> pricey, but the absolute best.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing. Im a fairly frugal person, but this is one of the few things I&#x27;ll splurge on. It detangles like a dream, and makes my color treated hair smooth and silky.

            <li> The scent is what first caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;Attractive. Appealing,really. \\&quot;What is that?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Scant amount does the trick:&lt;br /&gt;conspicuously unhealthy to soft &amp; shine.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;$40 for a year or more of product that works?&lt;br /&gt;Cost perspective:the embarrassing amount spent on&lt;br /&gt;alternate products that didn&#x27;t come close in performance;&lt;br /&gt;Give up 1 Starbucks a month &amp; you&#x27;ll come away with&lt;br /&gt;change,in your pocket.How much do you spend on a tank&lt;br /&gt;of gas? And how quickly is that used up?&lt;br /&gt;This is entirely do-able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000WJLHE2 Esuchen NPPE RD Chihtsai No. 12 Salon Use INSTANT Vitamin-E Hair TREATMENT CREAM *Promotion*]]</li>
            <li> Favorite product I&#x27;ve ever used 🙌  I bleached my hair &amp; it was completely fried, after I used a bit of this it looks great!</li>
            <li> It is the most wonderful product and nothing else tames my curly hair as this does.  I cannot be without it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  I am a hair product junkie and have tried just about everything to help smooth, condition and perserve the overall integrity of my dry, colored, damaged hair and this product makes my hair feel silky smooth!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;leave on conditioner&amp;#34; that leaves my hear shiny and soft.  It only takes about a small amount (about the size of a quarter).</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in hair treatment. A little tiny bit goes a long way. My former hairdresser introduced me to this product &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for about five years now. When she moved away, I didn&#x27;t know where to find it...so thanks again Amazon for selling me something that I couldn&#x27;t find locally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a tiny bit after I shampoo my hair. If I condition my hair before blow drying it, then I make sure it gets brushed through (but I use a teeeeny-tiny bit because I don&#x27;t want my hair to feel too heavy). Otherwise, I just apply a small amount in my hands &amp; rub on the outside...then brush through my hair &amp; let it dry. People always ask what I do to my hair to make it feel so nice &amp; look great (no split ends, no fly-aways, etc.) &amp; I always give props to this product.</li>
            <li> Received on time, products were well packaged and in perfect condition. Will be ordering again. Good job.</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  IT IS BEST BEFORE USING HEAT APPLIANCES.  USE A SMALL AMOUNT &amp; DISTRIBUTE THRU DAMP HAIR.</li>
