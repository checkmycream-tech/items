            <li>I was excited to receive this!  </li>
            <li>Some blushes look good in the package but don&#x27;t show up much on my face.</li>
            <li>Perfect color palet for dark hair</li>
            <li>so I do not have any idea of how much she liked it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty sheer great as a highlighter not a blush.</li>
            <li>The only good thing, was that customer service was super helpful and refunded my money.  </li>
            <li>My coloring is light- just a little darker then fair but does not tan and burns easily and has freckles.</li>
            <li>The colors are a little lighter than the pic and its sheer it would work perfectly on lighter skin but on darker skin</li>
            <li>A little bright going on, but fades a bit.</li>
            <li>I love the color of the blush,but It was smaller than I expected and had a sticky paste on the front of the product&#x27;s top.</li>
            <li>It is bright when you first put it on but fades a little and starts to look natural.</li>
            <li>I really like this blush.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item on the fifth and got it today.&lt;br /&gt;Looks exactly like the picture above.&lt;br /&gt;Did not break and arrived it like new conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>However, I should&#x27;ve paid more attention to the other reviews!!</li>
            <li>Natural looking rosy cheeks!</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast when I received it though the plastic plate with the name on it was loose</li>
            <li>They came completely destroyed, not even the lid was attached to the blush.</li>
            <li>Actually, it was completely smashed when I opened it.  </li>
            <li>Good product here and not to bad of a price I use it occasionally when I do my make up no issues here</li>

            <li> I like this shadow, my only problem it does not last long</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing though, because you would think that something like a packed blush would be shipped a bit more carefully.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I could see pink dust falling out of the medium sized packing box that all of my items arrived inZ.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer then any other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> This blush was a little chalkier than I expected it to be!</li>
            <li> As I expected!!!</li>

            <li> I was tired of looking pale by the afternoon, but this one lasts.</li>
            <li> I thought it was very small.</li>
            <li> I read others reviews about the blushes arriving broken...</li>
            <li> but it could have easily broken up.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I dropped it</li>

            <li> Natural looking rosy cheeks! My 3rd buy</li>
            <li> I really like this blush. The color shows up well without you looking like a clown. Some blushes look good in the package but don&#x27;t show up much on my face. My coloring is light- just a little darker then fair but does not tan and burns easily and has freckles. This is great color for me and blends wonderfully with a blush brush and stays on for hours. Didn&#x27;t hurt that the price was fantastic!</li>
            <li> It was a gift so I do not have any idea of how much she liked it. I thought it was very small.</li>

            <li> I read others reviews about the blushes arriving broken... But I ordered 2 anyway... They came completely destroyed, not even the lid was attached to the blush. Aweful!</li>
            <li> Love it ! It is bright when you first put it on but fades a little and starts to look natural. It lasts longer then any other brands I have tried. I was tired of looking pale by the afternoon, but this one lasts.</li>

            <li> It came pretty fast when I received it though the plastic plate with the name on it was loose I snapped it back in the blush was still intact but it could have easily broken up. The colors are a little lighter than the pic and its sheer it would work perfectly on lighter skin but on darker skin it&#x27;s pretty sheer great as a highlighter not a blush.</li>
            <li> This blush was a little chalkier than I expected it to be! It&#x27;s also not very pigmented.</li>
