            <li>Thank you for providing to me a vendor that was able to sell me the facial cleanser that I have been using and had been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I keep coming back to this cleanser, and I&#x27;m paying more for it now than I used to.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many others, but as I said I keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>I find i can only use this cleanser in the winter time,when its needed the most.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m thrilled I can still find it through other venders.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and supple and smooth rather than many others that leave my skin itchy and dry.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact it is creamy and won&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is great if and only if you have extremely DRY skin,you know mature skin,</li>
            <li>I really hope that the L&#x27;Oreal Paris company will continue making those products.     </li>
            <li>My wife asked me to write a review on this cleanser as she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I am using the whole line, just started and can see a change in my face already.</li>
            <li>It was gentle and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub,Natural Apricot Beads, 6-Fluid Ounce).</li>
            <li>This product does not dry out my face,it leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is no longer available, at least not at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It really helps keep my skin clear and feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>First I bought it from KMart for a much smaller price.</li>
            <li>Slightly better results than other L&#x27;Oreal skin products such as Revitalift.</li>
            <li>This year I will be 55 years old.</li>
            <li>It cleans her makeup off very well and cleans and softens her skin at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am 77 years old</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>so its never to early to start.</li>
            <li>Not only does my face feel moistened, it also is gently  exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I leaves my skin soft because it does not  strip the oils.</li>
            <li>It really cleans my face and live it very soft and it  doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I like the way this one goes on, it gently removes dirt and makeup, and leaves my skin feeling normal, instead of dry and crackling, or greasy before I even moisturize.  </li>
            <li>the product left a heavy oily feel to my skin and my face did not feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t harsh in the skin, just the right demabrasion.</li>
            <li>It gently conditions skin texture, exfoliates dead cells and protects and helps soften mature skin.  </li>
            <li>you have dry or fragile skin, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am age 49 and my skin is slightly oily with large pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I have mature dry skin</li>

            <li> you have dry or fragile skin, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am age 49 and my skin is slightly oily with large pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have mature dry skin</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores, it ships right away and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Oh - they come individually wrapped for long shelf life.</li>
            <li> Really, this is the answer to tired, dry, flaky skin that feels dry and taught no matter how much lotion you put on it.</li>
            <li> The cleanser made my elderly facial skin too dry.  </li>
            <li> but only if your skin is &#x27;that&#x27; dry.</li>
            <li> Does not exfolliate in the least, and if used every day is very drying.</li>
            <li> I will use it as long as I can purchase it.</li>
            <li> My skin is little dry and I am 30 years old.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think its for dry skin either.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I spent 30 plus years trying to find something to stop my face from being extremely oily</li>
            <li> I purchased the cleanser for winter months, when my skin is extra dry and delicate.</li>
            <li> It washes away makeup and the days dirt like soap but without the soap tight dry feel.</li>
            <li> it works well with the other products  that go with it</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy again due to greasiness and then putting foundation on can sometimes give me those streaks.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying using this product for quite some time now and am disappointed they have discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using this in the shower because it has an exfoliating factor to it, and the \\&quot;grains\\&quot; (its what they feel like) are very small, and hard to rinse off with just a washcloth and sink, much easier to rinse off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I can hardly find it in local stores anymore</li>
            <li> My face looks radiant and tight.</li>
            <li> The little dots massage my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I hated when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a cleanser that is not rough or drying.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and hate that L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued it!</li>
            <li> Between the cold and then the dryness of the indoor heat my face becomes extremely tight and my skin actually cracks.</li>
            <li> I am a die hard fan of \\&quot;cetaphil\\&quot;.but</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff but it&#x27;s very hard to find this product.  </li>
            <li> The beads are irritating.</li>
            <li> If your like me and tired of wasting money looking for &#x27;that&#x27; product try this..</li>
            <li> Oily base left behind.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it has been discontinued and the price being asked now is crazy.  </li>
            <li> STAY AWAY from any chemicals, artificial fragrances, SLSs \\&quot;no sulfates, parabens, phthalates or</li>
            <li> , I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> This cleanser has micro beads, which are terribly abrasive for your skin.</li>
            <li> say.most anit aging products are extremely harsh.&lt;br /&gt;SO BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> oh how i hate that word!</li>

            <li> I am grateful Amazon has this product. I cannot find it anywhere locally. This cleanser cleans without drying out my skin. I have not found anything as effective without spending three times as much.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect face product for me.  I can hardly find it in local stores anymore so thank you Amazon for having this product available.  Bottom line:  LOVE it - can live without it!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before from amazon and i love it it works well with the other products  that go with it iplan to&lt;br /&gt;order more</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and supple and smooth rather than many others that leave my skin itchy and dry.  I really love it and hope they just keep selling it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff but it&#x27;s very hard to find this product.  Most drug stores used to sell this stuff but not anymore - soooo - Amazon comes through again!  Oh - they come individually wrapped for long shelf life.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and was a little disappointed. I am age 49 and my skin is slightly oily with large pores and blackheads. the product left a heavy oily feel to my skin and my face did not feel clean after using it. I would not purchase it again. I found another cleanser on Amaazon made by Loreal that is 100 x&#x27;s better for oily skin (L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub,Natural Apricot Beads, 6-Fluid Ounce). If you have very dry skin the Age Perfect is probably what you need, for the rest of us with slightly oil skin and large pores, try the Loreal Go 360, I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year then all the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. My skin is little dry and I am 30 years old. I love the fact it is creamy and won&#x27;t dry my skin. The little dots massage my skin. I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is! well packed too. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great produce but unfortunately it has been discontinued and the price being asked now is crazy.  Will not be using this anymore.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has micro beads, which are terribly abrasive for your skin. I purchased the cleanser for winter months, when my skin is extra dry and delicate. The beads are irritating. Beware before you purchase because it&#x27;s not obvious from the product description.</li>
            <li> I always enjoy washing my face with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cream Cleanser, 5 ounce almost every day.  I always enjoy feeling the cream cleanser with my hands, and my face feels real nice, clean, and soft.  I love the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cream Cleanser. This year I will be 55 years old. I really hope that the L&#x27;Oreal Paris company will continue making those products.     Before I purchased that product, I read the advertising flyer about L&#x27;Oreal Paris Facial Cream Cleanser.  I decided that I should try that product.    Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It does not dry your skin at all and smells great. I need to find a cheaper seller. First I bought it from KMart for a much smaller price.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all.  The top broke off after about 3 uses.  The cleanser made my elderly facial skin too dry.  I do not get the \\&quot;age perfect\\&quot; part.  I suspect that is for advertising purposes only.  Use Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Facial Cleanser with royal jelly.  STAY AWAY from any chemicals, artificial fragrances, SLSs \\&quot;no sulfates, parabens, phthalates or petrochemicals\\&quot;.  Do use almond oil.  My skin has greatly improved since going natural.  You will thank me later.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to write a review on this cleanser as she really likes it.  She uses it daily to remove her makeup in the shower.  It cleans her makeup off very well and cleans and softens her skin at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washes off easily and it doesn&#x27;t leave her face greasy or oily.  She likes this product and has used it for about 5 years. She recommends it to you!</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing to me a vendor that was able to sell me the facial cleanser that I have been using and had been discontinued.  Your site is the best!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It really cleans my face and live it very soft and it  doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I use it in the shower three times a week. The best cleanser ever  !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this cleanser, and I&#x27;m paying more for it now than I used to.  I wonder why L&#x27;Oreal decided to remove it from their product line?  This is great for mature skin, emollient but also an exfoliant.  I have tried many others, but as I said I keep coming back to this one. Others are either too drying, too greasy, or too mask-y.  I like the way this one goes on, it gently removes dirt and makeup, and leaves my skin feeling normal, instead of dry and crackling, or greasy before I even moisturize.  It gently conditions skin texture, exfoliates dead cells and protects and helps soften mature skin.  I am definitely a FAN!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cream Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Have used L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cream Cleanser for years and when I could no longer find in the stores I found on line and made my order.  this product is wonderful i am 77 years old and i get complimants about my complextion all the time and no one can believe that i am of that age.  i also us Skin Geneses Multi Layer Cell Strenghening and Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to purchase this cream in the local drug stores, so glad that I was able to purchase it here!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great  Ilove and hope they never quit making it</li>
            <li> Nice creamy moisturizing feel. Leaves skin soft and moisturized. I prefer to use this in the morning when a light cleansing is all that is needed.  A bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what to think....leaves a greasy residue, sometimes doesn&#x27;t even get off all my make up, then again, my skin looks pretty darn good! Go figure, decide for yourself. I probably won&#x27;t buy again due to greasiness and then putting foundation on can sometimes give me those streaks.</li>
            <li> I am using the whole line, just started and can see a change in my face already. I would recommend using this in the shower because it has an exfoliating factor to it, and the \\&quot;grains\\&quot; (its what they feel like) are very small, and hard to rinse off with just a washcloth and sink, much easier to rinse off in the shower. I am only 34, but sun and aging have started to cause my face to lose its 20 something look. so its never to early to start.</li>
            <li> Over priced for the results. Slightly better results than other L&#x27;Oreal skin products such as Revitalift. Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face with \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Paris Age Perfect Cream Cleanser\\&quot;, my skin feels moist and renewed. Not only does my face feel moistened, it also is gently  exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry or fragile skin, I highly recommend this product. My face loves it, and my skin has a fresh, dewy glow when I&#x27;m done washing. Really, this is the answer to tired, dry, flaky skin that feels dry and taught no matter how much lotion you put on it. This leaves your skin feeling moist even before adding any moisturizer! What a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling clean and moist and flexible. IT&#x27;s the best that I have found.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and hate that L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued it! Happy I was able to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I leaves my skin soft because it does not  strip the oils. My skin feels very fresh every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I am a die hard fan of \\&quot;cetaphil\\&quot;.but this is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;the best for dry sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave your skin soft.not greasy.but moisturized.does not clog pores.all around perfect cleanser...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say.most anit aging products are extremely harsh.&lt;br /&gt;SO BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this cleanser! It was gentle and very moisturizing. Unfortunately, it is no longer available, at least not at a reasonable price. I believe it is no longer being made. Too bad!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I hated when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  It really helps keep my skin clear and feeling soft.  The cleanser arrived quickly and I would order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this excellent product which I&#x27;m using for a long time. Isn&#x27;t harsh in the skin, just the right demabrasion. Leave your fave clean an smooth. My face looks radiant and tight. Complements very well my Age Perfect Night cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my sensitive dry skin. It leaves a clean smooth feel on my skin. It washes away makeup and the days dirt like soap but without the soap tight dry feel. It is hard to find in stores, it ships right away and&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I will use it as long as I can purchase it. It is difficult to find a cleanser that is not rough or drying. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great if and only if you have extremely DRY skin,you know mature skin,oh how i hate that word! I spent 30 plus years trying to find something to stop my face from being extremely oily and here i am now wishing for a drop of oil! This product does not dry out my face,it leaves it soft and smooth. I find i can only use this cleanser in the winter time,when its needed the most.Between the cold and then the dryness of the indoor heat my face becomes extremely tight and my skin actually cracks.I found using this product helps to alleviate those problems.If your like me and tired of wasting money looking for &#x27;that&#x27; product try this..but only if your skin is &#x27;that&#x27; dry. I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying using this product for quite some time now and am disappointed they have discontinued it.  So, I&#x27;m thrilled I can still find it through other venders.</li>
            <li> El producto me llego en buen estado, estoy satisfecho con la compra lo recomiendo 100% no tengo quejas,&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias por el servicio.</li>
            <li> I have mature dry skin and I don&#x27;t think its for dry skin either. Oily base left behind. Does not exfolliate in the least, and if used every day is very drying.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and tried many products for mature skin.  It has these gentle micro beads that exfoliate dead skin cells.  My skin appears smoother, softer and brighter.  It also removes all traces of makeup and impurities.</li>
