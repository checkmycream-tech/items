            <li>The Aquis turban is just perfect, I love it.</li>
            <li>Surely one of my best purchases ever.</li>
            <li>I love my Microfiber Bath Towel, so I thought that the hair turban would be a perfect compliment to it!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good size</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for air drying their hair without frizzing out.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my twisty turban that had worn out, and decided to go with this one based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>love this hair towel!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE  IT!</li>
            <li>I love this turban!</li>
            <li>Much better than a towel- get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>Love these !</li>
            <li>and I will gladly repair those myself before going without!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying them!</li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these hair wraps!</li>
            <li>but I LOVE IT now!</li>
            <li>They are amazing</li>
            <li>I only get aquis because they fit the best and suck the water out of my hair the best.</li>
            <li>I was SO thrilled to find these that I ordered two.  </li>
            <li>but.. I felt kind of vain buying this (and infomercial-y)</li>
            <li>worth having!!!</li>
            <li>The loop size is great, and this works wonderfully to keep your hair up and out while finishing other make-up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I think the experiment with this hair turban was a great success.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most effective on my longer layers, the hair below my shoulders, the way I use it.</li>
            <li>But the good news is the hair towel is superb - and it wraps into a turban shape with no effort, and stays on my head for as long as I want it to.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t imagine it will \\&quot;dry\\&quot; it per se, but it does a great job of soaking up most of the residual wetness, the material dries by the time I take my next shower, and it is great for keeping my hair up while I do make up or get dressed.</li>
            <li>On that point it is very secure.</li>
            <li>this is nice as it stays on the head easily</li>
            <li>This one week experience made me appreciate this product even more.  </li>
            <li>Ok, now you&#x27;re picturing me as Medusa or some cartoon head person.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I have this hair turban in many colors.  </li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!  </li>
            <li>I love this hair towel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a couple more for traveling, my gym bag, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had a microfiber hair towel and wanted something that stayed on my head better while I got dressed and applied makeup.</li>
            <li>The absorbancy wasn&#x27;t better, and my hair wasn&#x27;t dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried putting my hair up in a rubberband and then putting a towel on top or a shower cap but neither works as well as this turban.</li>
            <li>I love using it to wash my face.</li>
            <li>On the head itself, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and I bought two more.</li>
            <li>Love these towels.</li>
            <li>, that is for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this...</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this is much better at drying my hair than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the elastic will stretch out more as I use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this towel when getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Had one for many years and the forgot it in a hotel.  </li>
            <li>Glad they still make it.</li>
            <li>If I am not in a hurry, it works better if I can wear it around the house for a while before drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this turban.</li>
            <li>I have been using one for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>Love my hair turban.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice fit.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I make sure that all my hair will be covered by the turban</li>
            <li>I twist 2-3 times and then flip the twist over the top of my head.</li>
            <li>The more twists, the tighter it will be.</li>
            <li>Might do better if the closure were velcro and not a button.</li>
            <li>so washing my hair is more convenient</li>
            <li>Really, very useful item!  </li>
            <li>I have ab older turban by this company and it was great.</li>
            <li>High quality and great for med-long hair.</li>
            <li>They are wonderful as long as the button and loop hold out</li>
            <li>It is more comfortable and absorbs better than this hair turban version.</li>
            <li>I rcvd one of these for xmas a couple of years ago &amp; loved it so much that I had to have more.  </li>
            <li>This wrap is super easy and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but Aquis is the best brand of hair turbans I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily stays put and dries the excess water from my hair well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have a fresh clean one if you want to wash yours - mine</li>
            <li>It is easy to twist your hair into and it stays secure.</li>
            <li>But this turban fits fine.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly too!  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this turban!</li>
            <li>I bought cheap hair turban made of cotton before, and while it fits great on my head, the towel just wasn&#x27;t drying my hair enough</li>
            <li>It has a button and a loop to secure it.</li>
            <li>Well, the Aquis DOES fit longer hair and doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>Soaks up water well, and has loop and button to secure around head.</li>
            <li>It is still in great shape a year later.</li>
            <li>available for those days</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit her either.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit mine</li>
            <li>The material *is* wonderfully absorbent, but that&#x27;s really the only pro for</li>
            <li>I guess getting white would be a good option if you want to be able to bleach out any hair coloring that might end up on it.</li>
            <li>I still have to spend a significant amount of time drying with the hairdryer (15+mins), which I don&#x27;t have to do with the towel (5-ish</li>
            <li>They are just perfect to wrap your hair in and by the time I have dried the rest of me and thrown some clothes on, it&#x27;s time to tackle my hair already!  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, I&#x27;ve had very long hair to shoulder-length hair, and it&#x27;s worked great for every length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading so many good reviews, I had high hopes for this hair turban, but when I got it and tried it on, it fit too tightly on my big head.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li>Now I love it and have decided that it makes me feel like a real lady</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also larger and more flexible, making it very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super absorbant.</li>
            <li>And it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>No dripping and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very lightweight, which is great, especially depending on my hair length at the time.</li>
            <li>the people who complain about the fit, I wonder if twisting it more or less would adjust the fit for your... more twisting</li>
            <li>I liked the other two better.</li>
            <li>I first bought an Aquis hair turban several years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>They stay up very well and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>It soaks up a lot of water, isn&#x27;t heavy, is a good size for lots of hair lengths/textures/etc, stays put, dries reasonably quickly after use, lasts a long time, packs well for travel, is soft, works perfectly for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li>haha, and I enjoy the ritual of wearing it while putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Nothing worse than staining a perfect towel</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth the price.</li>
            <li>Good turban for wet hair!</li>
            <li>The style is the same but the difference in the fabric is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would be great for women with less hair or a smaller head.</li>
            <li>This highly absorbent towel is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I guess this would be a great product if you have a small head.  </li>
            <li>I ordered my very first Aquis hair turban from a television shopping show several years ago, and I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>If I could have lasted more than a couple minutes with the tight elastic, I&#x27;m sure my hair would have been even drier.</li>
            <li>I tried a few different brands and this one seems to be the best.</li>
            <li>After use, it dries quickly and it washes very well.</li>
            <li>My hair naturally dries quickly, and with a true microfiber towel it dries super fast.</li>
            <li>It was great to have for my hair because we stayed in a vaction apartment, not a hotel, and only had one large bath towel each, and no extra towels for my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>I keep going back to Aquis because I&#x27;ve been so satisfied.</li>
            <li>You would probably spend more replacing the generic ones anyway.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I have ever had a turban...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using it and went back to the first one I had tried from target, which works much better.</li>
            <li>Much more absorbent than standard microfiber hair turbans.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this hair turban to be any more beneficial than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li>My first one I bought from Restoration Hardware.</li>
            <li>So many of the hair turbans are advertised as quick-drying microfiber when they are actually slow-drying cotton.  </li>
            <li>These are the real deal and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you have short hair and plan not to sleep in it :)</li>
            <li>In one day, I was back ordering 4 more.  </li>
            <li>Very Absorbent and stays on snug!</li>
            <li>First, I don&#x27;t notice my hair being any drier after taking this off, it doesn&#x27;t seem absorbent at all.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t my first wash after having it done.  </li>
            <li>Great for thick hair.  </li>
            <li>surprised at the comments from people who say that it doesn&#x27;t fit their heads.</li>
            <li>First I apply my makeup</li>
            <li>I wish the loop had a little stretch in order to fasten it more easily.</li>
            <li>your drying time in half and better than using big towel that doesn&#x27;t fit and stay in place!!</li>
            <li>(really, these things were like 15 years old) but a quick search on here and voila!</li>
            <li>I love these turbans so much, I have several, so I can rotate them to be washed.</li>
            <li>vacation and business trips etc- dries real fast even in high humitity.</li>
            <li>I take it with me on trips too because it is small and easy to pack &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Stays on head fine with button tie-down, but does not dry hair any faster than a cotton towel.</li>
            <li>My other hair turbans do not have the stretchy side, and it fits great on my big head.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long and thick hair and this hair towel/turban is awesome for drying hair.  </li>
            <li>It does hold up quite a bit of water, so make sure you hang it out to thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li>It easily stretches and I hook the loop around the button in the back.</li>
            <li>And allowing my hair to dry without all of the processing will leave it in better shape.</li>
            <li>I especially like them because they have the button which keeps them securely in place until you are ready to finish doing your hair!</li>
            <li>Aquis is my FAVORITE brand of hair turban to dry my waist length hair.</li>
            <li>Of course my hair doesn&#x27;t get dry, but I&#x27;m amazed at how much more water this hair turban can take out of my hair while still being lightweight itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very soft!!  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how I made it for almost 30 years not having this product.  </li>
            <li>I like the non-white ones so if you color your hair and you use the turban, it won&#x27;t show as much if the dye comes out in the material.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so compact that taking it with me when I went on vacation was very convenient, took up about the size a soda can takes up.</li>
            <li>just &#x27;cause I like it so much.</li>
            <li>real well.i</li>
            <li>The Aquis Microfiber towel secures your hair very well, but the material it&#x27;s made of leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>Very absorbant.</li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>I can get so much more done with wet hair than ever before.</li>
            <li>If it had longer elastic making the wrap much looser I would give the product five stars.</li>
            <li>only downside (and a problem with most turbans in my experience) is that there isn&#x27;t enough absorbent material for the back of the head to be better at drying in that area.</li>
            <li>and it dries really fast on your towel bar as well.</li>
            <li>It helps my hair &amp;#34;pre-dry&amp;#34; so that I don&#x27;t spend as much time with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The towel itself dries really fast, I bring it when I&#x27;m traveling and just stuff it in a plastic baggie when leaving the hotel.</li>
            <li>After readings the reviews for this turban, I was very unsure about ordering it.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs really, really well.  </li>
            <li>My microfiber hair turban makes getting ready a breeze.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I love Aquis products but this hair turban is my least favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It quick soaks the water out of my hair and is lightweight and quick to dry.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a good product it does absorb a lot if water because when I take it off the ycloth seems a lot wetter then my other regular towel turban.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super absorbent, gets all the water right out of my hair in the time it takes me to dry my bod and throw some clothes on, leaving it ready for blow drying or brushing (for those days I&#x27;m in a hurry).</li>
            <li>Love this towel because it stays put  unlike other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expansive than other brand</li>
            <li>However, it works well for keeping your hair secure and out of the way; the elastic that goes around your head is pretty tight (but not uncomfortably so), and the loop with the button work very well.  </li>
            <li>it stays in place, easy to use, and my hair is almost dry when I take it off...</li>
            <li>I had high hopes when I finally got a replacement, but despite the good reviews this turban let me down.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got long hair although hair any longer than mine (almost waist length) wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I have a truly large head for a woman, enough that my head rarely fits men&#x27;s hats or helmets, and I have to shop for large-sized glasses frames.</li>
            <li>It enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head.</li>
            <li>course I still have to do the remaining hair wrangling procedures, it just takes much less time in the mornings allowing me to either try to sleep longer or do something more productive.</li>
            <li>And it definitely pulls more water from my hair than a traditional towel.  </li>
            <li>When I put it on, the button is at the nape of my neck and even if I only twist it once, it pulls so that the hair by my hairline dries too quickly.  </li>
            <li>The Aquis fabric is thick and absorbent, really quite nice.</li>
            <li>This micro fiber hair towel is large, so if you have long thick hair, it works great.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Sometimes it leaves my hair flat on top if I&#x27;m not careful in the way I put it on, due to the fit (vs. the accordion effect I&#x27;d hoped for).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more useful to put it up when I am not ready to dry it yet.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>I do not think this dries faster than a normal towel, but I like the size for my head.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it is long enough.</li>
            <li>For 15+ years I&#x27;ve always used a full size towel to dry my hair..</li>
            <li>material is very good quality and the overall construction is very good, but the poor design mechanics make this a big disappointment for me.</li>
            <li>I woild get a new one.  </li>
            <li>Guess the new one doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>so I threw it away and ordered the new one.  </li>
            <li>and I suffered as I waited for the new hair towel to arrive.  </li>
            <li>and want new ones.</li>
            <li>I ordered this new one</li>
            <li>They dry quickly so you can subsist on one</li>
            <li>This has definitely helped get more water out of my hair to decrease drying time and also keeps wet hair off of my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that it isn&#x27;t as heavy as a towel on my head!  </li>
            <li>This one is definitely thicker and better made, but this one is also quite a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first one over ten years</li>
            <li>Like many of the reviews mention, this turban runs on the small side.</li>
            <li>had to replace my old one!</li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair very well at all.</li>
            <li>I used my Diva Darling way past its prime, but this is far better quality.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these in the future, as they stay in place and cut my drying time way down.</li>
            <li>My hair is so nice and evenly dry after just a few minutes in this guy, with no rubbing.</li>
            <li>I found the old one useful in keeping my hair out of my way as I was getting ready, and the material it was made of helped dry my hair faster than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair, very straight and lots of it</li>
            <li>I give this as a gift for nearly every shower I attend.  </li>
            <li>My old one was dying and I decided to splurge and buy a nicer one.</li>
            <li>The old one had anti-microbial properties and never got moldy.</li>
            <li>and I will have to keep using my yellowed old one.</li>
            <li>These are soft and work beautifully--you can feel the quality.</li>
            <li>It absorbs moisture in seconds and hair is ready to style instantly.  </li>
            <li>This microfiber version does seem to wick water faster than my old cotton one.</li>
            <li>I bought this a year ago to replace my old hair turban that had become worn out.</li>
            <li>As well made as they seem to be, they may very well last me the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>I get my hair colored professionally and with permanent color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to wear my hair naturally wavy and want to \\&quot;plop\\</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely cover my hair.</li>
            <li>Not because they&#x27;re poor quality and fall apart or anything of that sort, but because I love it so much that I keep them in my gym bag, in my luggage, in my home...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say buy this only if you want a better alternative to using a heavy bath towel on your head.</li>
            <li>: worth the extra money for a color as white tends to get dingy after a while.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on a tight budget the &amp;#34;Seen on TV&amp;#34; ones will work, but if you can afford this, it may last much longer and be better on your budget in the long run.</li>
            <li>It has just enough stretch and a bit of elastic around the edge, plus the loop and button, that it stays put and dries my hair more thoroughly and evenly than any other such item I have tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light-weight and comfortable to wear, no more neck pain from balancing a huge heavy towel that ultimately doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one just to have on hand and then recently lost my first one on a trip.</li>
            <li>I have long hair &amp; it covers very well</li>
            <li>It is so much nicer to get out of the shower and dry your hair with these than a towel.  </li>
            <li>The Aquis Microfiber Hair Turban just sucks all the water out of my hair, leaving it almost dry and definitely in good shape to blow dry and style.</li>
            <li>Use it all the time now, especially when I have to get up  very early</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and fine and wavy, and it reaches my lower back.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>This one is at the back of the closet for some imagined laundry emergency that would have me using all my old turbans (even the ones with the over-stretched elastic) and no way to wash them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but it definitely seems much more durable than my old one, so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this and purchased a second.  </li>
            <li>I have three different wet hair turbans, and tend to grab this one first.</li>
            <li>Is exactly what i wanted and helps cut down the frizz.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair much faster than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li>I air dry the hair turban, and it&#x27;s ready to use the next day</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s technically microfiber, it doesn&#x27;t feel as high quality as the Sephora brand (which is also more expensive).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d guess that if you had really long or thick hair you may want to just get a regular towel instead of a turban so you have more material to work with.</li>
            <li>As much as I try to squeeze water out of my hair before putting one on, my turbans are always sopping wet in the back and where the loop is and the wetness just makes its way through the rest of the turban.</li>
            <li>My other turban is getting old and I can&#x27;t find that one anymore so thought this would be close to the old towel.</li>
            <li>but apparently my head is too damn big.</li>
            <li>I got it delivered this morning, went to wash my hair a short while ago, and my hair was barely damp</li>
            <li>No question that I would replace it, does a fine job for thick long hair.  </li>
            <li>Even though I a,ways hang it to dry in the bathroom like the old one, it gets mold-like spores on it.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it does not really do much to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t, but greatly reduces the blow drying time, cutting down the damage to the hair.  </li>
            <li>This makes a huge difference in the time it takes to blow dry thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work well and, as stated in a previous review, doesn&#x27;t even work as well as a regular cotton towel.</li>
            <li>It is not long enough, not flexible enough, too bulky, and will not stay in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very long thick hair and this towel reduces drying time significantly.</li>
            <li>Its a real stretch to get the button into the awkward loop to secure it.</li>

            <li> Surely one of my best purchases ever.</li>
            <li> I love my Microfiber Bath Towel, so I thought that the hair turban would be a perfect compliment to it!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good size</li>

            <li> and I LOVE  IT!</li>
            <li> I love this turban!</li>
            <li> Much better than a towel- get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Love these !</li>
            <li> and I will gladly repair those myself before going without!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying them!</li>
            <li> love this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these hair wraps!</li>
            <li> but I LOVE IT now!</li>
            <li> They are amazing</li>
            <li> I only get aquis because they fit the best and suck the water out of my hair the best.</li>
            <li> I was SO thrilled to find these that I ordered two.  </li>
            <li> but.. I felt kind of vain buying this (and infomercial-y)</li>
            <li> worth having!!!</li>
            <li> The loop size is great, and this works wonderfully to keep your hair up and out while finishing other make-up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I think the experiment with this hair turban was a great success.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most effective on my longer layers, the hair below my shoulders, the way I use it.</li>
            <li> But the good news is the hair towel is superb - and it wraps into a turban shape with no effort, and stays on my head for as long as I want it to.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t imagine it will \\&quot;dry\\&quot; it per se, but it does a great job of soaking up most of the residual wetness, the material dries by the time I take my next shower, and it is great for keeping my hair up while I do make up or get dressed.</li>
            <li> On that point it is very secure.</li>
            <li> this is nice as it stays on the head easily</li>
            <li> This one week experience made me appreciate this product even more.  </li>
            <li> Ok, now you&#x27;re picturing me as Medusa or some cartoon head person.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I have this hair turban in many colors.  </li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!  </li>
            <li> I love this hair towel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a couple more for traveling, my gym bag, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a microfiber hair towel and wanted something that stayed on my head better while I got dressed and applied makeup.</li>
            <li> The absorbancy wasn&#x27;t better, and my hair wasn&#x27;t dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried putting my hair up in a rubberband and then putting a towel on top or a shower cap but neither works as well as this turban.</li>
            <li> I love using it to wash my face.</li>
            <li> On the head itself, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> and I bought two more.</li>
            <li> Love these towels.</li>
            <li> , that is for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this is much better at drying my hair than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the elastic will stretch out more as I use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this towel when getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Had one for many years and the forgot it in a hotel.  </li>
            <li> Glad they still make it.</li>
            <li> If I am not in a hurry, it works better if I can wear it around the house for a while before drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this turban.</li>
            <li> I have been using one for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li> Love my hair turban.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice fit.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I make sure that all my hair will be covered by the turban</li>
            <li> I twist 2-3 times and then flip the twist over the top of my head.</li>
            <li> The more twists, the tighter it will be.</li>
            <li> Might do better if the closure were velcro and not a button.</li>
            <li> so washing my hair is more convenient</li>
            <li> Really, very useful item!  </li>
            <li> I have ab older turban by this company and it was great.</li>
            <li> High quality and great for med-long hair.</li>
            <li> They are wonderful as long as the button and loop hold out</li>
            <li> It is more comfortable and absorbs better than this hair turban version.</li>
            <li> I rcvd one of these for xmas a couple of years ago &amp; loved it so much that I had to have more.  </li>
            <li> This wrap is super easy and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but Aquis is the best brand of hair turbans I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily stays put and dries the excess water from my hair well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have a fresh clean one if you want to wash yours - mine</li>
            <li> It is easy to twist your hair into and it stays secure.</li>
            <li> But this turban fits fine.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly too!  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this turban!</li>
            <li> I bought cheap hair turban made of cotton before, and while it fits great on my head, the towel just wasn&#x27;t drying my hair enough</li>
            <li> It has a button and a loop to secure it.</li>
            <li> Well, the Aquis DOES fit longer hair and doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> Soaks up water well, and has loop and button to secure around head.</li>
            <li> It is still in great shape a year later.</li>
            <li> available for those days</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fit her either.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit mine</li>
            <li> The material *is* wonderfully absorbent, but that&#x27;s really the only pro for</li>
            <li> I guess getting white would be a good option if you want to be able to bleach out any hair coloring that might end up on it.</li>
            <li> I still have to spend a significant amount of time drying with the hairdryer (15+mins), which I don&#x27;t have to do with the towel (5-ish</li>
            <li> They are just perfect to wrap your hair in and by the time I have dried the rest of me and thrown some clothes on, it&#x27;s time to tackle my hair already!  </li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, I&#x27;ve had very long hair to shoulder-length hair, and it&#x27;s worked great for every length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading so many good reviews, I had high hopes for this hair turban, but when I got it and tried it on, it fit too tightly on my big head.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I bought another one.</li>
            <li> Now I love it and have decided that it makes me feel like a real lady</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also larger and more flexible, making it very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super absorbant.</li>
            <li> And it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> No dripping and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very lightweight, which is great, especially depending on my hair length at the time.</li>
            <li> the people who complain about the fit, I wonder if twisting it more or less would adjust the fit for your... more twisting</li>
            <li> I liked the other two better.</li>
            <li> I first bought an Aquis hair turban several years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> They stay up very well and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> It soaks up a lot of water, isn&#x27;t heavy, is a good size for lots of hair lengths/textures/etc, stays put, dries reasonably quickly after use, lasts a long time, packs well for travel, is soft, works perfectly for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li> haha, and I enjoy the ritual of wearing it while putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worse than staining a perfect towel</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good turban for wet hair!</li>
            <li> The style is the same but the difference in the fabric is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would be great for women with less hair or a smaller head.</li>
            <li> This highly absorbent towel is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I guess this would be a great product if you have a small head.  </li>
            <li> I ordered my very first Aquis hair turban from a television shopping show several years ago, and I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If I could have lasted more than a couple minutes with the tight elastic, I&#x27;m sure my hair would have been even drier.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different brands and this one seems to be the best.</li>
            <li> After use, it dries quickly and it washes very well.</li>
            <li> My hair naturally dries quickly, and with a true microfiber towel it dries super fast.</li>
            <li> It was great to have for my hair because we stayed in a vaction apartment, not a hotel, and only had one large bath towel each, and no extra towels for my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I keep going back to Aquis because I&#x27;ve been so satisfied.</li>
            <li> You would probably spend more replacing the generic ones anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I have ever had a turban...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using it and went back to the first one I had tried from target, which works much better.</li>
            <li> Much more absorbent than standard microfiber hair turbans.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this hair turban to be any more beneficial than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li> My first one I bought from Restoration Hardware.</li>
            <li> So many of the hair turbans are advertised as quick-drying microfiber when they are actually slow-drying cotton.  </li>
            <li> These are the real deal and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I recommend it if you have short hair and plan not to sleep in it :)</li>
            <li> In one day, I was back ordering 4 more.  </li>
            <li> Very Absorbent and stays on snug!</li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t notice my hair being any drier after taking this off, it doesn&#x27;t seem absorbent at all.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t my first wash after having it done.  </li>
            <li> Great for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> surprised at the comments from people who say that it doesn&#x27;t fit their heads.</li>
            <li> First I apply my makeup</li>
            <li> I wish the loop had a little stretch in order to fasten it more easily.</li>
            <li> your drying time in half and better than using big towel that doesn&#x27;t fit and stay in place!!</li>
            <li> (really, these things were like 15 years old) but a quick search on here and voila!</li>
            <li> I love these turbans so much, I have several, so I can rotate them to be washed.</li>
            <li> vacation and business trips etc- dries real fast even in high humitity.</li>
            <li> I take it with me on trips too because it is small and easy to pack &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Stays on head fine with button tie-down, but does not dry hair any faster than a cotton towel.</li>
            <li> My other hair turbans do not have the stretchy side, and it fits great on my big head.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long and thick hair and this hair towel/turban is awesome for drying hair.  </li>
            <li> It does hold up quite a bit of water, so make sure you hang it out to thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li> It easily stretches and I hook the loop around the button in the back.</li>
            <li> And allowing my hair to dry without all of the processing will leave it in better shape.</li>
            <li> I especially like them because they have the button which keeps them securely in place until you are ready to finish doing your hair!</li>
            <li> Aquis is my FAVORITE brand of hair turban to dry my waist length hair.</li>
            <li> Of course my hair doesn&#x27;t get dry, but I&#x27;m amazed at how much more water this hair turban can take out of my hair while still being lightweight itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very soft!!  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how I made it for almost 30 years not having this product.  </li>
            <li> I like the non-white ones so if you color your hair and you use the turban, it won&#x27;t show as much if the dye comes out in the material.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so compact that taking it with me when I went on vacation was very convenient, took up about the size a soda can takes up.</li>
            <li> just &#x27;cause I like it so much.</li>
            <li> real well.i</li>
            <li> The Aquis Microfiber towel secures your hair very well, but the material it&#x27;s made of leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> Very absorbant.</li>
            <li> Really like this.</li>
            <li> I can get so much more done with wet hair than ever before.</li>
            <li> If it had longer elastic making the wrap much looser I would give the product five stars.</li>
            <li> only downside (and a problem with most turbans in my experience) is that there isn&#x27;t enough absorbent material for the back of the head to be better at drying in that area.</li>
            <li> and it dries really fast on your towel bar as well.</li>
            <li> It helps my hair &amp;#34;pre-dry&amp;#34; so that I don&#x27;t spend as much time with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The towel itself dries really fast, I bring it when I&#x27;m traveling and just stuff it in a plastic baggie when leaving the hotel.</li>
            <li> After readings the reviews for this turban, I was very unsure about ordering it.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs really, really well.  </li>
            <li> My microfiber hair turban makes getting ready a breeze.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love Aquis products but this hair turban is my least favorite so far.</li>
            <li> It quick soaks the water out of my hair and is lightweight and quick to dry.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a good product it does absorb a lot if water because when I take it off the ycloth seems a lot wetter then my other regular towel turban.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super absorbent, gets all the water right out of my hair in the time it takes me to dry my bod and throw some clothes on, leaving it ready for blow drying or brushing (for those days I&#x27;m in a hurry).</li>
            <li> Love this towel because it stays put  unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expansive than other brand</li>
            <li> However, it works well for keeping your hair secure and out of the way; the elastic that goes around your head is pretty tight (but not uncomfortably so), and the loop with the button work very well.  </li>
            <li> it stays in place, easy to use, and my hair is almost dry when I take it off...</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I finally got a replacement, but despite the good reviews this turban let me down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got long hair although hair any longer than mine (almost waist length) wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I have a truly large head for a woman, enough that my head rarely fits men&#x27;s hats or helmets, and I have to shop for large-sized glasses frames.</li>
            <li> It enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head.</li>
            <li> course I still have to do the remaining hair wrangling procedures, it just takes much less time in the mornings allowing me to either try to sleep longer or do something more productive.</li>
            <li> And it definitely pulls more water from my hair than a traditional towel.  </li>
            <li> When I put it on, the button is at the nape of my neck and even if I only twist it once, it pulls so that the hair by my hairline dries too quickly.  </li>
            <li> The Aquis fabric is thick and absorbent, really quite nice.</li>
            <li> This micro fiber hair towel is large, so if you have long thick hair, it works great.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Sometimes it leaves my hair flat on top if I&#x27;m not careful in the way I put it on, due to the fit (vs. the accordion effect I&#x27;d hoped for).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is more useful to put it up when I am not ready to dry it yet.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> I do not think this dries faster than a normal towel, but I like the size for my head.  </li>
            <li> I love it and it is long enough.</li>
            <li> For 15+ years I&#x27;ve always used a full size towel to dry my hair..</li>
            <li> material is very good quality and the overall construction is very good, but the poor design mechanics make this a big disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> I woild get a new one.  </li>
            <li> Guess the new one doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so I threw it away and ordered the new one.  </li>
            <li> and I suffered as I waited for the new hair towel to arrive.  </li>
            <li> and want new ones.</li>
            <li> I ordered this new one</li>
            <li> They dry quickly so you can subsist on one</li>
            <li> This has definitely helped get more water out of my hair to decrease drying time and also keeps wet hair off of my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE that it isn&#x27;t as heavy as a towel on my head!  </li>
            <li> This one is definitely thicker and better made, but this one is also quite a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first one over ten years</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviews mention, this turban runs on the small side.</li>
            <li> had to replace my old one!</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair very well at all.</li>
            <li> I used my Diva Darling way past its prime, but this is far better quality.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of these in the future, as they stay in place and cut my drying time way down.</li>
            <li> My hair is so nice and evenly dry after just a few minutes in this guy, with no rubbing.</li>
            <li> I found the old one useful in keeping my hair out of my way as I was getting ready, and the material it was made of helped dry my hair faster than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, very straight and lots of it</li>
            <li> I give this as a gift for nearly every shower I attend.  </li>
            <li> My old one was dying and I decided to splurge and buy a nicer one.</li>
            <li> The old one had anti-microbial properties and never got moldy.</li>
            <li> and I will have to keep using my yellowed old one.</li>
            <li> These are soft and work beautifully--you can feel the quality.</li>
            <li> It absorbs moisture in seconds and hair is ready to style instantly.  </li>
            <li> This microfiber version does seem to wick water faster than my old cotton one.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago to replace my old hair turban that had become worn out.</li>
            <li> As well made as they seem to be, they may very well last me the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> I get my hair colored professionally and with permanent color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to wear my hair naturally wavy and want to \\&quot;plop\\</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely cover my hair.</li>
            <li> Not because they&#x27;re poor quality and fall apart or anything of that sort, but because I love it so much that I keep them in my gym bag, in my luggage, in my home...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say buy this only if you want a better alternative to using a heavy bath towel on your head.</li>
            <li> : worth the extra money for a color as white tends to get dingy after a while.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a tight budget the &amp;#34;Seen on TV&amp;#34; ones will work, but if you can afford this, it may last much longer and be better on your budget in the long run.</li>
            <li> It has just enough stretch and a bit of elastic around the edge, plus the loop and button, that it stays put and dries my hair more thoroughly and evenly than any other such item I have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very light-weight and comfortable to wear, no more neck pain from balancing a huge heavy towel that ultimately doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one just to have on hand and then recently lost my first one on a trip.</li>
            <li> I have long hair &amp; it covers very well</li>
            <li> It is so much nicer to get out of the shower and dry your hair with these than a towel.  </li>
            <li> The Aquis Microfiber Hair Turban just sucks all the water out of my hair, leaving it almost dry and definitely in good shape to blow dry and style.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time now, especially when I have to get up  very early</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and fine and wavy, and it reaches my lower back.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> This one is at the back of the closet for some imagined laundry emergency that would have me using all my old turbans (even the ones with the over-stretched elastic) and no way to wash them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but it definitely seems much more durable than my old one, so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this and purchased a second.  </li>
            <li> I have three different wet hair turbans, and tend to grab this one first.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what i wanted and helps cut down the frizz.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair much faster than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li> I air dry the hair turban, and it&#x27;s ready to use the next day</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s technically microfiber, it doesn&#x27;t feel as high quality as the Sephora brand (which is also more expensive).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess that if you had really long or thick hair you may want to just get a regular towel instead of a turban so you have more material to work with.</li>
            <li> As much as I try to squeeze water out of my hair before putting one on, my turbans are always sopping wet in the back and where the loop is and the wetness just makes its way through the rest of the turban.</li>
            <li> My other turban is getting old and I can&#x27;t find that one anymore so thought this would be close to the old towel.</li>
            <li> but apparently my head is too damn big.</li>
            <li> I got it delivered this morning, went to wash my hair a short while ago, and my hair was barely damp</li>
            <li> No question that I would replace it, does a fine job for thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> Even though I a,ways hang it to dry in the bathroom like the old one, it gets mold-like spores on it.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it does not really do much to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t, but greatly reduces the blow drying time, cutting down the damage to the hair.  </li>
            <li> This makes a huge difference in the time it takes to blow dry thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work well and, as stated in a previous review, doesn&#x27;t even work as well as a regular cotton towel.</li>
            <li> It is not long enough, not flexible enough, too bulky, and will not stay in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and this towel reduces drying time significantly.</li>
            <li> Its a real stretch to get the button into the awkward loop to secure it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra money on something you will use daily, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Initially, I didn&#x27;t think this find much after I unwrapped my hair, but then I found it took significantly less time to blow dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li> lighter and less bulky than a normal towel.</li>
            <li> I do like how it wraps up my long, thick hair (with room to spare), but I don&#x27;t think it absorbs the moisture in my hair any more than a fluffy regular towel.</li>
            <li> After washing hair it absorbs the water so fast that you need half the time that takes to blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and short patience - regular towels are no longer acceptable if I have a choice.</li>
            <li> It is small so better for people with a smaller head size and not a lot of long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given this one five stars but the company seems to have reduced the amount of fabric in this version and it&#x27;s not as long or deep.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they last just as long.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve actually given these as gifts to long haired friends.</li>
            <li> This is great - it allows me to dry my hair without stressing it out (like towel-drying can do), walk around easily with my hair up without fear of the towel coming unwrapped and falling off my head and not catch a cold (as I always am afraid to do while I&#x27;m walking around with my hair wet!).  </li>
            <li> It seems silly to have a towel specifically for your hair, but this thing allows me to dry my hair in a nice tight package.  </li>
            <li> Before this I had only used the Turby Twist or some other generic type of hair wrap.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s dry enough and brush out  blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair &amp; this turban can handle this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must for drying long hair when you aren&#x27;t a blow-drying type of person...</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s thick, this hair turban not only holds my hair in place, it also absorbs moisture from my wet hair very well.</li>
            <li> It dried completely over night--even in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not nearly as absorbent as my microfiber towel.</li>
            <li> This does absorb a lot of water and if I don&#x27;t leave it on long, my hair doesn&#x27;t drip (my hair is 3-4\\&quot; below my shoulders), however</li>
            <li> My hair dries in no time and I am not constantly trying to get a soggy wet towel to stay on my head.</li>
            <li> When I took my whites down to wash them later that day I saw redish streaks on my towel - I have blond highlights with redish streaks mixed in.  </li>
            <li> My color was white - I do wish there were other options too.</li>
            <li> I have several other style turbans that I prefer.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it also helps to dry hair in order to avoid the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Keep my hair dry and humidity out</li>
            <li> I gentlty towel dry my hair, wrap it up, by the time I dress, brush my teeth, and do makeup</li>
            <li> (I needed another towel to dry my hair after I take off the turban).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair faster than anything else.</li>
            <li> After washing the hair, use the towel to dry super-wet hair.  </li>
            <li> A couple of reviews seemed to think this product would completely dry the hair.  </li>
            <li> It gets the drips out, but I still have to spend some time with the blow dryer to have dry hair.</li>
            <li> By the time I got it on my hair was alomost dry.</li>
            <li> and I can let it continue to air dry in the morning while I do my morning routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; so you won&#x27;t need to wash and dry it after every use.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace one I had previously and lost, and while it is almost identical and the microfiber fabric sucks water out of my very thick hair like magic, it&#x27;s much stiffer than my old one, especially the button loop, which is somewhat difficult to get around the button.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day</li>
            <li> It gets at least 2x dryer than with a normal towel.</li>
            <li> , it fits loose.</li>
            <li> Makes showering away from home a breeze as my hair is dry before the rest of me...and the turban itself dries in about ten minutes (even less when you put it in the bathing suit spinner at the gym].</li>
            <li> I recently highlighted my hair, and it has become a bit damaged, so I was looking for something that would help me cut down on the blow-drying time.  </li>
            <li> The hair turban does as it promises - forms a turban that prevents water from washed hair from drizzling down your back and which accelerates drying.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have bought - the other I have had for years and worn out!  </li>
            <li> Without the towel my hair is too wet and takes forever to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hair turban because a previous one I purchased from Sephora years ago finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> The item is as described but it is a bit tight on the head though I have short hair and a medium-sized head.</li>
            <li> The pattern is the correct shape and size but the elastic is too short and tight.  </li>
            <li> Only downfall, is it seems a little snug on the elastic.</li>
            <li> The twist and button system works great and it doesn&#x27;t look terribly nerdy.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a replacement since the one I owned (had it for four years) was packed wet the morning I was leaving Brazil (had no choice and didn&#x27;t want to leave it behind) and by the time I arrived back home in San Francisco it was totally stinky</li>
            <li> If your hair is sopping wet</li>
            <li> The loop is in the front center.</li>
            <li> Attempts to take a shower at night and go to bed with wet hair end up in horror.</li>
            <li> Second, due to the tight elastic, my hair has started breaking at the hair line due to wearing this.</li>
            <li> Actually, it gets extremely soaked after just a few minutes in the towel.</li>
            <li> Getting ready with a huge, heavy towel on my head was impossible and frustrating since the regular bath towel kept coming undone and it kept falling off.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, extremely curly (aka frizzy), but I was dying as my antique hair turbans (maker unknown) were fnally dying.  </li>
            <li> In other words, The Apocalypse.</li>
            <li> Other than it being lighter weight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and extremely absorbant.</li>
            <li> I have had other wraps before but didn&#x27;t like them.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never air-dried to anything remotely resembling a human head of hair and it takes at least a half an hour to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> If I leave it twisted up in the turban for 20mins, it&#x27;s only dry enough not to drip.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had a dark color (brown?)</li>
            <li> I have a big head and thick hair.</li>
            <li> Thick enough, but thin enough to easily dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself to cut down drying time at home and at the gym.</li>
            <li> I can run up and down the stairs to the laundry room, brush my teeth, put on my makeup, drink my coffee.</li>
            <li> It has cut down on the time I have to spend in the mornings on my hair.</li>
            <li> After drying with the towel, put the turban on for a few minutes while doing other routine tasks.  </li>
            <li> I can do other things with the turban on my head unlike a heavy towel which just flops an falls</li>
            <li> less bulky, and took out the elastic, I would say they had a winner.</li>
            <li> I bought this against the reviews that sited this towel does not work as well as previously owned microfiber turbans.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going to be tighter, less twisting</li>
            <li> Definatly not worth it for people with long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has worn elastic headbands will be familiar with this \\&quot;creeping up\\&quot; phenomenon that leaves you with a bunch of loose hair at the base of your head.</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick hair that takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> That is not true with this.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long and thick hair and there is plenty of room in this towel for all of it.</li>
            <li> I wraped my hair in the turban, did a few other things for about 15 minutes then dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Too tight</li>
            <li> - the elastic is really tight.</li>
            <li> I just like the way it stays on my head so tight.</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick, curly hair, the lack of weight prevents breakage (and I realize now that a towel pulled my hair and hurt a little).</li>
            <li> Does absorb water, but since it keeps falling in my face, it is of little value.</li>
            <li> I thought it would loosen up after a few washes but it is still strong, which is actually bad because it feels uncomfortable on my head and actually rides up as I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> but the worst was that it wasn&#x27;t enough material to fit longer hair.    </li>
            <li> I keep it on for a few hours and stays in place.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to have a few to rotate out  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; towel, regardless of size, balanced on my head, even some with buttons and loops that as far as I was concerned, where in the wrong place.  </li>
            <li> Girl\\&quot; a few weeks ago).  </li>
            <li> so it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars except that the button needed reattaching after a few wears.  </li>
            <li> for people with long hair it is much to complicated to get on and takes way to long.</li>
            <li> I find the turban a bit small and awkward to do the initial dry, plus it just gets too wet for the maximum benefit.  </li>
            <li> As I secured the loop on the button, I felt uncomfortable pull on my hair (especially on front half of my head).</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder length hair and it cuts my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> Now I have a bunch of little wisps of hair that stick up!</li>
            <li> and it was way too small for both me.  </li>
            <li> To small.</li>
            <li> very heavy than I thought...</li>
            <li> If I leave my hair twisted up in the towel for 20mins, it&#x27;s nearly dry when I take it out.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try, I cannot get this to look like a turban.</li>
            <li> I have thick waist length hair.  </li>
            <li> no more!</li>
            <li> this is way too expensive than other hair turbans from the discount store(ross, maxx)!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have small head and shorter thin hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wait so long to go out in the cold</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine-stranded, thick, curly hair (read: a naturally frizzy horrible mess) which requires a lot of work each day to wrangle into an acceptable layout.</li>
            <li> Feel like my hair always looked worse than if I hadn&#x27;t showered when I used this.</li>
            <li> It seems none the worse for wear.</li>
            <li> It is nasty and I got busy and missed the return window, but I wokld not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it picked up lots of lint and after one wash/dry, it stuck to itself and had all kinds of things stuck to it.</li>
            <li> Difficult to wrap.  </li>
            <li> So unfortunately, I had to return the turban.</li>
            <li> , it makes it difficult to latch to the button.</li>
            <li> (sorry to have doubted you)</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> So, I use a horrible imatation one on those infrequent days and save my Aquis Turbans for every other day of the year!  </li>
            <li> The cloth on this item is already lacking in stretch, which can be awkward and aggravating.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t carry them anymore :(.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t say there was elastic in the description :(</li>
            <li> And I truly hate myself if I go on a trip and forget to take one, so now, I have one packed in my suitcase, so I can&#x27;t goof up again!  </li>
            <li> Even with all of the tossing and turning I do at night, I always awaken with the cap still in place and my hair IS NOT FRIZZY AND HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have bought - the other I have had for years and worn out!  Am a big fan!</li>
            <li> Love this towel because it stays put  unlike other brands. It has a button and a loop to secure it. I wish the loop had a little stretch in order to fasten it more easily. I have a big head and thick hair. I keep it on for a few hours and stays in place.</li>
            <li> This hair towel is great. It&#x27;s very good quality and does the job. The one I just bought is my third. I keep going back to Aquis because I&#x27;ve been so satisfied. I&#x27;d have given this one five stars but the company seems to have reduced the amount of fabric in this version and it&#x27;s not as long or deep. I liked the other two better. Aside from that, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> My mother ordered a head towel years ago from a catalogue, and I used it until it was literally worn out. I had high hopes when I finally got a replacement, but despite the good reviews this turban let me down. The material *is* wonderfully absorbent, but that&#x27;s really the only pro for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too short - I have shoulder-length hair and this still left hair sticking out. I don&#x27;t know what it is about the design but it does not hold a lot of hair. I often can&#x27;t get the end to reach back to the button unless I wrap it *just* right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too tight - the elastic is really tight. I thought it would loosen up after a few washes but it is still strong, which is actually bad because it feels uncomfortable on my head and actually rides up as I&#x27;m wearing it. Anyone who has worn elastic headbands will be familiar with this \\&quot;creeping up\\&quot; phenomenon that leaves you with a bunch of loose hair at the base of your head. I think this elastic issue also contributes to the shortness mentioned above and the overall difficulty in getting the turban to wrap correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is very good quality and the overall construction is very good, but the poor design mechanics make this a big disappointment for me. It is not long enough, not flexible enough, too bulky, and will not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they lengthened the design, made the material a *tiny* bit thinner/less bulky, and took out the elastic, I would say they had a winner. As it is I won&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it to anyone because it is such a pain.</li>
            <li> IF the loop that goes over the button was elasticized. It isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used turbie-esque hair towels for over 10 years now, and am quite attached. I have long hair and short patience - regular towels are no longer acceptable if I have a choice. The cloth on this item is already lacking in stretch, which can be awkward and aggravating. But when the loop that goes over the button has NO give to it? I just go running back to my stick-the-point-through-the-loop models. This one is at the back of the closet for some imagined laundry emergency that would have me using all my old turbans (even the ones with the over-stretched elastic) and no way to wash them. In other words, The Apocalypse. I see neither event occurring in the foreseeable future, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, and do not use the one I have now.</li>
            <li> I give this as a gift for nearly every shower I attend.  The loop size is great, and this works wonderfully to keep your hair up and out while finishing other make-up in the morning.  As an added bonus, it also helps to dry hair in order to avoid the frizzies.  My color was white - I do wish there were other options too.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and high quality. I&#x27;ve been using mine for about two years and it works great. Keep my hair dry and humidity out and I have looong hair.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife to accompany a robe and she loves it - she uses it all the time. My mother in law got her a different brand and she prefers this one.</li>
            <li> I have this version and the non-elastic hair towel and I prefer the regular one to this.  It is more comfortable and absorbs better than this hair turban version.</li>
            <li> Before this I had only used the Turby Twist or some other generic type of hair wrap. My old one was dying and I decided to splurge and buy a nicer one. You get what you pay for! The Aquis Microfiber Hair Turban just sucks all the water out of my hair, leaving it almost dry and definitely in good shape to blow dry and style. It&#x27;s also larger and more flexible, making it very comfortable to wear. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but it definitely seems much more durable than my old one, so it should last a long time. If you don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra money on something you will use daily, I highly recommend it. You would probably spend more replacing the generic ones anyway.</li>
            <li> I rcvd one of these for xmas a couple of years ago &amp; loved it so much that I had to have more.  I have extremely long hair &amp; this turban can handle this.  It&#x27;s super absorbant.</li>
            <li> I have ab older turban by this company and it was great. It got dingy so I thouguht I woild get a new one.  Even though I a,ways hang it to dry in the bathroom like the old one, it gets mold-like spores on it. It is nasty and I got busy and missed the return window, but I wokld not buy this product again. The old one had anti-microbial properties and never got moldy. Guess the new one doesn&#x27;t and I will have to keep using my yellowed old one.</li>
            <li> I have a spare one too!</li>
            <li> Love it!  It has just enough stretch and a bit of elastic around the edge, plus the loop and button, that it stays put and dries my hair more thoroughly and evenly than any other such item I have tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this against the reviews that sited this towel does not work as well as previously owned microfiber turbans.  I wish I listened to them. It really doesn&#x27;t work well and, as stated in a previous review, doesn&#x27;t even work as well as a regular cotton towel. My hair naturally dries quickly, and with a true microfiber towel it dries super fast. That is not true with this. I will need to buy another product.</li>
            <li> I have had this for awhile.  It&#x27;s the first time I have ever had a turban...I&#x27;m still getting used to it.  I LOVE that it isn&#x27;t as heavy as a towel on my head!  Only downfall, is it seems a little snug on the elastic.</li>
            <li> This is the very best hair towel EVER!!!  I bought one at Bed Bath and Beyond about 3 years ago.  I went back six months  later and they didn&#x27;t carry them anymore :(.  I was so happy when I found them on Amazon I ordered two.  I have thick waist length hair.  Without the towel my hair is too wet and takes forever to blow dry.  I gentlty towel dry my hair, wrap it up, by the time I dress, brush my teeth, and do makeup , it&#x27;s dry enough and brush out  blow dry.  I take it everywhere on vacation and business trips etc- dries real fast even in high humitity.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how I made it for almost 30 years not having this product.  I bought one and have since amassed about 5.  Not because they&#x27;re poor quality and fall apart or anything of that sort, but because I love it so much that I keep them in my gym bag, in my luggage, in my home... Really, very useful item!  It soaks up a lot of water, isn&#x27;t heavy, is a good size for lots of hair lengths/textures/etc, stays put, dries reasonably quickly after use, lasts a long time, packs well for travel, is soft, works perfectly for curly hair.  Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper version of this somewhere and it was made of the material you use to pick up lint. Needless to say it picked up lots of lint and after one wash/dry, it stuck to itself and had all kinds of things stuck to it. I guess you could use your head to dust if you were wearing that...but the worst was that it wasn&#x27;t enough material to fit longer hair.    Well, the Aquis DOES fit longer hair and doesn&#x27;t fall off. It also has elastic on the edge to keep it on your head. And it dries quickly. It&#x27;s a must for drying long hair when you aren&#x27;t a blow-drying type of person...and you could use it to get excess water out before blow-drying.    The best thing is they sell them at Nordstrom Rack in SF for $10! I had only one for a year or so but I wanted to have a few to rotate out  so I could throw one in the laundry. They dry quickly so you can subsist on one but it&#x27;s nice to have a fresh clean one if you want to wash yours - mine get sorta saturated with conditioner after a while. I like the non-white ones so if you color your hair and you use the turban, it won&#x27;t show as much if the dye comes out in the material. I guess getting white would be a good option if you want to be able to bleach out any hair coloring that might end up on it.</li>
            <li> The Aquis turban is just perfect, I love it. I have long hair, very straight and lots of it and it works perfect for me. It&#x27;s super absorbent, gets all the water right out of my hair in the time it takes me to dry my bod and throw some clothes on, leaving it ready for blow drying or brushing (for those days I&#x27;m in a hurry). It&#x27;s also very light-weight and comfortable to wear, no more neck pain from balancing a huge heavy towel that ultimately doesn&#x27;t get the job done. I&#x27;d get another one if the craftsmanship of this one didn&#x27;t make me think it&#x27;s going to last a lifetime. Had it for about a year now. Also dries superfast after use. It&#x27;s so compact that taking it with me when I went on vacation was very convenient, took up about the size a soda can takes up. Now that I think about it I will get another one just &#x27;cause I like it so much. It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JANUARY 2012&lt;br /&gt;I still have the same turban and it&#x27;s still going strong. Surely one of my best purchases ever.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long and thick hair and this hair towel/turban is awesome for drying hair.  I recently ordered a replacement since the one I owned (had it for four years) was packed wet the morning I was leaving Brazil (had no choice and didn&#x27;t want to leave it behind) and by the time I arrived back home in San Francisco it was totally stinky so I threw it away and ordered the new one.  I selected regular shipping and I suffered as I waited for the new hair towel to arrive.  Getting ready with a huge, heavy towel on my head was impossible and frustrating since the regular bath towel kept coming undone and it kept falling off.  This one week experience made me appreciate this product even more.  I recommend ordering a second for travel.</li>
            <li> This is my third one from Aquis. It&#x27;s more expansive than other brand but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s thick, this hair turban not only holds my hair in place, it also absorbs moisture from my wet hair very well. I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper microfiber turban last time.  Didn&#x27;t last well at all.  These are soft and work beautifully--you can feel the quality.</li>
            <li> I love Aquis products but this hair turban is my least favorite so far. It absorbs great as do all their towels but apparently my head is too damn big. Its a real stretch to get the button into the awkward loop to secure it. The sides are also stretchy which I don&#x27;t care for.I have several other style turbans that I prefer. I&#x27;m sure this would be great for women with less hair or a smaller head.Ok, now you&#x27;re picturing me as Medusa or some cartoon head person. Just stop it.</li>
            <li> Initially, I didn&#x27;t think this find much after I unwrapped my hair, but then I found it took significantly less time to blow dry and style my hair.  I was pleasantly surprised by this and purchased a second.  I&#x27;ll likely buy a third at some point.</li>
            <li> Difficult to wrap.  No instructions and when I did figure it out, it fits loose.</li>
            <li> Love these- I only get aquis because they fit the best and suck the water out of my hair the best.</li>
            <li> love this hair towel!</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised. Stays on head fine with button tie-down, but does not dry hair any faster than a cotton towel.</li>
            <li> Good turban for wet hair! My other turban is getting old and I can&#x27;t find that one anymore so thought this would be close to the old towel. It is small so better for people with a smaller head size and not a lot of long thick hair. I have small head and shorter thin hair and it is a bit snug for me, the elastic is snug. Seems like a good product it does absorb a lot if water because when I take it off the ycloth seems a lot wetter then my other regular towel turban. I like the button and loop feature stays in place real well.i I just hope after time the elastic loosens a bit.I haven&#x27;t washed yet, need to remember do not use bleach or fabric softner on these.</li>
            <li> This turban lives up to its promises! It absorbs moisture in seconds and hair is ready to style instantly.  This is my second turban and I LOVE  IT!</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the Aquis hair towel (19x39). I really wanted to love this turban! I bought cheap hair turban made of cotton before, and while it fits great on my head, the towel just wasn&#x27;t drying my hair enough (I needed another towel to dry my hair after I take off the turban). After reading so many good reviews, I had high hopes for this hair turban, but when I got it and tried it on, it fit too tightly on my big head. As I secured the loop on the button, I felt uncomfortable pull on my hair (especially on front half of my head). So unfortunately, I had to return the turban. But the good news is the hair towel is superb - and it wraps into a turban shape with no effort, and stays on my head for as long as I want it to. I think the problem with the shape of this turban is that the side is also stretchy. My other hair turbans do not have the stretchy side, and it fits great on my big head. So.. if you have a big head like me, be warned. You may want to go with the towel.</li>
            <li> I love my Microfiber Bath Towel, so I thought that the hair turban would be a perfect compliment to it! I do like how it wraps up my long, thick hair (with room to spare), but I don&#x27;t think it absorbs the moisture in my hair any more than a fluffy regular towel. Actually, it gets extremely soaked after just a few minutes in the towel. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again. Instead, I would buy another bath towel and use a hair clip to keep it up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair turban because a previous one I purchased from Sephora years ago finally bit the dust.  I found the old one useful in keeping my hair out of my way as I was getting ready, and the material it was made of helped dry my hair faster than a regular towel.  The Aquis Microfiber towel secures your hair very well, but the material it&#x27;s made of leaves a lot to be desired. For some reason, it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair much faster than a regular towel.  While it&#x27;s technically microfiber, it doesn&#x27;t feel as high quality as the Sephora brand (which is also more expensive).  However, it works well for keeping your hair secure and out of the way; the elastic that goes around your head is pretty tight (but not uncomfortably so), and the loop with the button work very well.  I&#x27;d say buy this only if you want a better alternative to using a heavy bath towel on your head. If you want something that will speed up drying time, check out the microfiber turban from Sephora.  When this one wears out, I&#x27;ll probably go back to the Sephora brand.</li>
            <li> I have this hair turban in many colors.  I love them.  It is so much nicer to get out of the shower and dry your hair with these than a towel.  Very absorbant.</li>
            <li> This is close to a version I have had for years that I use wrapped in the opposite direction.  This microfiber version does seem to wick water faster than my old cotton one.</li>
            <li> I think the experiment with this hair turban was a great success.  I recently highlighted my hair, and it has become a bit damaged, so I was looking for something that would help me cut down on the blow-drying time.  This is great - it allows me to dry my hair without stressing it out (like towel-drying can do), walk around easily with my hair up without fear of the towel coming unwrapped and falling off my head and not catch a cold (as I always am afraid to do while I&#x27;m walking around with my hair wet!).  If you don&#x27;t pre-dry your hair the turban does get soaked.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!  Use it all the time now, especially when I have to get up  very early and I wash my hair at night.</li>
            <li> Second one I have purchased.  I have tried cheaper versions but they don&#x27;t compare.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I use this one, but I also have the one that is advertised as &amp;#34;Seen on TV&amp;#34;.  Both absorb water well after I wash my hair. This one is definitely thicker and better made, but this one is also quite a bit more expensive. If you&#x27;re on a tight budget the &amp;#34;Seen on TV&amp;#34; ones will work, but if you can afford this, it may last much longer and be better on your budget in the long run.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair turban for a trip to Europe, and I still use it every day now that I&#x27;m back home.  It wicks moisture from your hair but still leaves it damp enough to style.  It dried completely over night--even in a humid climate.  It was great to have for my hair because we stayed in a vaction apartment, not a hotel, and only had one large bath towel each, and no extra towels for my medium length hair.  If you are travelling on a budget, you definitely need to take one of these along!</li>
            <li> I love this hair towel.  It seems silly to have a towel specifically for your hair, but this thing allows me to dry my hair in a nice tight package.  And it definitely pulls more water from my hair than a traditional towel.  I&#x27;m buying a couple more for traveling, my gym bag, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the people who complain about the fit, I wonder if twisting it more or less would adjust the fit for your... more twisting and it&#x27;s going to be tighter, less twisting and it&#x27;s going to be looser.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a microfiber hair towel and wanted something that stayed on my head better while I got dressed and applied makeup. I think it&#x27;s a good size and it does stay on well, but it&#x27;s not nearly as absorbent as my microfiber towel. If I leave my hair twisted up in the towel for 20mins, it&#x27;s nearly dry when I take it out. If I leave it twisted up in the turban for 20mins, it&#x27;s only dry enough not to drip. I still have to spend a significant amount of time drying with the hairdryer (15+mins), which I don&#x27;t have to do with the towel (5-ish mins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search continues...</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair too much. Feel like my hair always looked worse than if I hadn&#x27;t showered when I used this. I&#x27;ve stopped using it and went back to the first one I had tried from target, which works much better.</li>
            <li> Much more absorbent than standard microfiber hair turbans.  Worth the extra cost.  I&#x27;ve had my first one over ten years and it&#x27;s still going stong.  Decided to get another for travel.  I have very long thick hair and this towel reduces drying time significantly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair faster than anything else. Got pilly and gross in the dryer.</li>
            <li> This highly absorbent towel is fantastic. I have thick, shoulder length hair and it cuts my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> This micro fiber hair towel is large, so if you have long thick hair, it works great. Soaks up water well, and has loop and button to secure around head.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace one I had previously and lost, and while it is almost identical and the microfiber fabric sucks water out of my very thick hair like magic, it&#x27;s much stiffer than my old one, especially the button loop, which is somewhat difficult to get around the button.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my wife. Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this hair turban to be any more beneficial than a regular towel.  Other than it being lighter weight.  The absorbancy wasn&#x27;t better, and my hair wasn&#x27;t dryer.</li>
            <li> Hair Turban vs Hair Towel: I already owned two hair towels, but left one at the hotel and needed a replacement.  After reading the reviews, I still couldn&#x27;t decided whether to go the turban or towel route. I decided to try the turban.  After using each product, what works best is both/combination.  After washing the hair, use the towel to dry super-wet hair.  I find the turban a bit small and awkward to do the initial dry, plus it just gets too wet for the maximum benefit.  After drying with the towel, put the turban on for a few minutes while doing other routine tasks.  This makes a huge difference in the time it takes to blow dry thick hair.  A couple of reviews seemed to think this product would completely dry the hair.  It doesn&#x27;t, but greatly reduces the blow drying time, cutting down the damage to the hair.  Regular towels just don&#x27;t get the job done.  Great for kids too.[[ASIN:B0000UTUS8 Aquis Microfiber Hair Turban, Lisse Crepe, Patented Design, White]][[ASIN:B000AM82GM Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel, Lisse Crepe, White (19 x 39-Inches)]]</li>
            <li> After washing hair it absorbs the water so fast that you need half the time that takes to blow dry your hair.I will order another one.</li>
            <li> It has elastic in it and I&#x27;m allergic.  It didn&#x27;t say there was elastic in the description :(</li>
            <li> An excellent product!</li>
            <li> I do not think this dries faster than a normal towel, but I like the size for my head.  lighter and less bulky than a normal towel.</li>
            <li> Buy it. High quality and great for med-long hair. Thick enough, but thin enough to easily dry. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this turban! I use it when I need to shower and I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair. I have tried putting my hair up in a rubberband and then putting a towel on top or a shower cap but neither works as well as this turban. The towel falls off because it&#x27;s too big. The rubberband leaves crease marks in my hair and I have to re-iron or curl my hair. This turban is of great quality and stays snugly on your head. I love using it to wash my face. My first one I bought from Restoration Hardware.</li>
            <li> No dripping and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> STURDY AND SO ABSORBENT!</li>
            <li> So many of the hair turbans are advertised as quick-drying microfiber when they are actually slow-drying cotton.  These are the real deal and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The item is as described but it is a bit tight on the head though I have short hair and a medium-sized head. If I took a shower at night, I cannot sleep in this turban because it causes reddish marks on my forehead and the friction against the ears is unbearable. I recommend it if you have short hair and plan not to sleep in it :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself to cut down drying time at home and at the gym. It&#x27;s most effective on my longer layers, the hair below my shoulders, the way I use it. On the head itself, it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ve got curly haired girls, and for their hair it&#x27;s good for air drying their hair without frizzing out. It does hold up quite a bit of water, so make sure you hang it out to thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago to replace my old hair turban that had become worn out. I use this every single day and I don&#x27;t know what I would do with out it. It is easy to twist your hair into and it stays secure. I have fairly long and thick hair and there is plenty of room in this towel for all of it. The only reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it does not really do much to dry my hair. It gets the drips out, but I still have to spend some time with the blow dryer to have dry hair. It is still in great shape a year later.</li>
            <li> Years and years ago my mom bought me two of these and I ran them into the ground. I had no idea where she got them (really, these things were like 15 years old) but a quick search on here and voila! They are amazing and I bought two more. Hopefully they last just as long.</li>
            <li> I have chest length hair and lots of it (though it&#x27;s medium-fine). For 15+ years I&#x27;ve always used a full size towel to dry my hair..no more! This wrap is super easy and effective. If your hair is sopping wet, I don&#x27;t imagine it will \\&quot;dry\\&quot; it per se, but it does a great job of soaking up most of the residual wetness, the material dries by the time I take my next shower, and it is great for keeping my hair up while I do make up or get dressed. The twist and button system works great and it doesn&#x27;t look terribly nerdy. Much better than a towel- get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Love these ! Great for travel</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does and I&#x27;ve got long hair although hair any longer than mine (almost waist length) wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Bought 12 of these several(9?) years ago for wife,daughter,sister,sisters-in-law,mother-in-law and nieces. &lt;br /&gt;I think 8 have survived. Everyone thinks I am Santa! and want new ones.</li>
            <li> Love these towels. They are the only towel I use on my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> Really like this. My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy as when I used a cotton towel.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this hair wrap. I don&#x27;t know if it actually reduces my hair drying time. I just like the way it stays on my head so tight. I can get so much more done with wet hair than ever before. I can run up and down the stairs to the laundry room, brush my teeth, put on my makeup, drink my coffee. Could not do that with a regular towel wrapped around my head, that is for sure. I squirt some of my leave in conditioner into my hair before I wrap it (if I remember) and I like the way it feels when I finally take off the wrap. I might have to make this my standard girlfriend gift this holiday season.</li>
            <li> The Aquis Microfiber Hair Turban just cannot be beat!  I have medium length hair, extremely curly (aka frizzy), but I was dying as my antique hair turbans (maker unknown) were fnally dying.  I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to do!  They are just perfect to wrap your hair in and by the time I have dried the rest of me and thrown some clothes on, it&#x27;s time to tackle my hair already!  I couldn&#x27;t keep a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; towel, regardless of size, balanced on my head, even some with buttons and loops that as far as I was concerned, where in the wrong place.  Not to mention the weight!  I was SO thrilled to find these that I ordered two.  In one day, I was back ordering 4 more.  As well made as they seem to be, they may very well last me the rest of my life.  I just wish they had a dark color (brown?) available for those days I need to color my hair.  Nothing worse than staining a perfect towel and since they are so absorbant, I doubt there would be any way to avoid it.  So, I use a horrible imatation one on those infrequent days and save my Aquis Turbans for every other day of the year!  And I truly hate myself if I go on a trip and forget to take one, so now, I have one packed in my suitcase, so I can&#x27;t goof up again!  They are wonderful as long as the button and loop hold out and I will gladly repair those myself before going without!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying them!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair towel  worth having!!! Very Absorbent and stays on snug!</li>
            <li> Best turban on the market.</li>
            <li> I use one of these every time I wash  my hair.  AWESOME!  It dries quickly too!  I highly recommend it and I&#x27;ve actually given these as gifts to long haired friends.</li>
            <li> This hair wrap needs some upgrading.  The pattern is the correct shape and size but the elastic is too short and tight.  The elastic is sewn to the casing so there is no way to loosen the elastic.  If it had longer elastic making the wrap much looser I would give the product five stars.</li>
            <li> I love this...it stays in place, easy to use, and my hair is almost dry when I take it off...I&#x27;m so happy I bought it!!</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviews mention, this turban runs on the small side. I have [[ASIN:B002LL57Z4 Eurow Microfiber Hair Turban]] as well and that fits my head without pulling at my hair like this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is much better at drying my hair than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I got it delivered this morning, went to wash my hair a short while ago, and my hair was barely damp a couple minutes after putting it on. If I could have lasted more than a couple minutes with the tight elastic, I&#x27;m sure my hair would have been even drier. Hopefully the elastic will stretch out more as I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (and a problem with most turbans in my experience) is that there isn&#x27;t enough absorbent material for the back of the head to be better at drying in that area. As much as I try to squeeze water out of my hair before putting one on, my turbans are always sopping wet in the back and where the loop is and the wetness just makes its way through the rest of the turban. I&#x27;d guess that if you had really long or thick hair you may want to just get a regular towel instead of a turban so you have more material to work with.</li>
            <li> I love this towel when getting out of the shower. The elastic band is perfect for attaching to the button on the towel. You don&#x27;t have a floppy towel falling off your head any longer...just use this and it dries really fast on your towel bar as well.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my twisty turban that had worn out, and decided to go with this one based on the good reviews. First, I don&#x27;t notice my hair being any drier after taking this off, it doesn&#x27;t seem absorbent at all. Second, due to the tight elastic, my hair has started breaking at the hair line due to wearing this. Now I have a bunch of little wisps of hair that stick up! Third, I don&#x27;t like that the loop is a rope instead of elastic, it makes it difficult to latch to the button.</li>
            <li> So - I read another review about this item lifting hair color prior to making this purchase and truly just figured she must have used temporary color on her hair (sorry to have doubted you) but I had the same problem!!  I get my hair colored professionally and with permanent color and it wasn&#x27;t my first wash after having it done.  I wraped my hair in the turban, did a few other things for about 15 minutes then dried my hair.  When I took my whites down to wash them later that day I saw redish streaks on my towel - I have blond highlights with redish streaks mixed in.  My red is now lighter then it was after 5 weeks between treatments last month.  Bummer!  I&#x27;m never using this turban again.  I don&#x27;t know how it did it but it lifted my color!</li>
            <li> Great hair wrap.  Had one for many years and the forgot it in a hotel.  No question that I would replace it, does a fine job for thick long hair.  Glad they still make it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. It&#x27;s so convenient when stepping out of the shower to wrap my hair in this towel, where it will stay put until I remove it. It helps my hair &amp;#34;pre-dry&amp;#34; so that I don&#x27;t spend as much time with the blow dryer. The towel itself dries really fast, I bring it when I&#x27;m traveling and just stuff it in a plastic baggie when leaving the hotel. It seems none the worse for wear.</li>
            <li> After readings the reviews for this turban, I was very unsure about ordering it.  I ordered it anyway and it was way too small for both me.  I gave it to my daughter to try (she has a smaller head than me) and it didn&#x27;t fit her either.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> all Aquis hair towels are excellent!  this is nice as it stays on the head easily so you can do your make-up or walk around.</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick hair that takes forever to dry.  This has definitely helped get more water out of my hair to decrease drying time and also keeps wet hair off of my shoulders.  If I am not in a hurry, it works better if I can wear it around the house for a while before drying my hair.  Otherwise I just squeeze my hair out with it and then go and that seems to help a lot.</li>
            <li> This is the best drying turban I have ever tried.  Ample sizing.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This towel is excellent at drying my hair. It gets at least 2x dryer than with a normal towel. The button closure also ensures it will not fall off my head while doing my makeup and moving around.</li>
            <li> I love this turban. It enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head. It&#x27;s lightweight and extremely absorbant. I have been using one for more than 5 years. I&#x27;ll never go back to usung a regular towel for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome... I just keep wondering how I got through drying my unmanageable hair before this. I will be purchasing more of these in the future, as they stay in place and cut my drying time way down. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try, I cannot get this to look like a turban. Does absorb water, but since it keeps falling in my face, it is of little value.</li>
            <li> Love my hair turban.  It quick soaks the water out of my hair and is lightweight and quick to dry.  It&#x27;s also very soft!!  Love it.  I take it with me on trips too because it is small and easy to pack &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair.  It is the second one I have gotten for my daughter!</li>
            <li> love this! had to replace my old one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to wear my hair naturally wavy and want to \\&quot;plop\\&quot; my hair (I read \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; a few weeks ago).  This does absorb a lot of water and if I don&#x27;t leave it on long, my hair doesn&#x27;t drip (my hair is 3-4\\&quot; below my shoulders), however, it&#x27;s tighter than I&#x27;d like.  Perhaps my head is also too big!  When I put it on, the button is at the nape of my neck and even if I only twist it once, it pulls so that the hair by my hairline dries too quickly.  Sometimes it leaves my hair flat on top if I&#x27;m not careful in the way I put it on, due to the fit (vs. the accordion effect I&#x27;d hoped for). I&#x27;ll work on refining my technique.</li>
            <li> To small. Next time I will buy the standard size.</li>
            <li> I have had other wraps before but didn&#x27;t like them.  This one is terrific.  It absorbs really, really well.  It is a nice fit.  I have bought it for all of my sister in laws.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best, I need to order more!!&lt;br /&gt;Cuts your drying time in half and better than using big towel that doesn&#x27;t fit and stay in place!!</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair very well at all. It is more useful to put it up when I am not ready to dry it yet. On that point it is very secure.</li>
            <li> I had a Diva Darling turban for a couple of years before I bought this Aquis Turban. The style is the same but the difference in the fabric is pretty amazing. The Aquis fabric is thick and absorbent, really quite nice. I used my Diva Darling way past its prime, but this is far better quality. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised at the comments from people who say that it doesn&#x27;t fit their heads. I have a truly large head for a woman, enough that my head rarely fits men&#x27;s hats or helmets, and I have to shop for large-sized glasses frames. But this turban fits fine. My hair is thick and fine and wavy, and it reaches my lower back.&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I use the turban: I lean over, gather my hair so that it all falls forward, and put the unbuttoned turban over my head with the button in the middle back. The loop is in the front center. I make sure that all my hair will be covered by the turban and then I use both hands to grasp hair &amp; fabric as I twist it, starting with the section closest to my head and twisting towards the loop. I twist 2-3 times and then flip the twist over the top of my head. It easily stretches and I hook the loop around the button in the back. The more twists, the tighter it will be. 2-3 twists is plenty.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will get a good deal of wear out of this turban!</li>
            <li> for people with long hair it is much to complicated to get on and takes way to long. By the time I got it on my hair was alomost dry. Definatly not worth it for people with long or thick hair. Would not buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I guess this would be a great product if you have a small head.  It doesn&#x27;t fit mine so it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what i wanted and helps cut down the frizz.  I would have given it 5 stars except that the button needed reattaching after a few wears.  Apart from that I can&#x27;t fault it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely cover my hair. Works well to keep hair out of shower or protect from dirt outside. Might do better if the closure were velcro and not a button.</li>
            <li> very heavy than I thought...this is way too expensive than other hair turbans from the discount store(ross, maxx)!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am not gonna return but this would be not used that often...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand hair towel for close to 10 years. It is absolutey the best absorbant hair towel out there. My sister-in-law loves  the towel too. I travel a lot and keep two towels at home and one in my overnight bag.</li>
            <li> I have used these microfiber turbans for years.  The last one I ordered seemed skimpy and was a struggle to &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; even on my short-short hair.  I ordered this new one and it&#x27;s perfection!</li>
            <li> This is a simple, well designed product. It has cut down on the time I have to spend in the mornings on my hair. I can do other things with the turban on my head unlike a heavy towel which just flops an falls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine-stranded, thick, curly hair (read: a naturally frizzy horrible mess) which requires a lot of work each day to wrangle into an acceptable layout. My hair has never air-dried to anything remotely resembling a human head of hair and it takes at least a half an hour to blow dry my hair. Attempts to take a shower at night and go to bed with wet hair end up in horror. This turban holds my hair in place and prevents the horror from occurring. Even with all of the tossing and turning I do at night, I always awaken with the cap still in place and my hair IS NOT FRIZZY AND HORRIBLE. My hair is still damp, but the waves have set and the frizz has been contained and I can let it continue to air dry in the morning while I do my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I still have to do the remaining hair wrangling procedures, it just takes much less time in the mornings allowing me to either try to sleep longer or do something more productive. And allowing my hair to dry without all of the processing will leave it in better shape.</li>
            <li> My microfiber hair turban makes getting ready a breeze. First I apply my makeup then I style my hair</li>
            <li> I have three different wet hair turbans, and tend to grab this one first.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different brands and this one seems to be the best.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time . I have long hair &amp; it covers very well</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these hair wraps! I order them for gifts all the time. I use mine every day getting out of the shower. I especially like them because they have the button which keeps them securely in place until you are ready to finish doing your hair!</li>
            <li> Finally something that stays on my head when I finish my shower! I love it and it is long enough.</li>
            <li> Aquis is my FAVORITE brand of hair turban to dry my waist length hair. I always have difficulty squeezing out the extra water from my hair with my hands after I shower, and this towel just drinks up the water. Of course my hair doesn&#x27;t get dry, but I&#x27;m amazed at how much more water this hair turban can take out of my hair while still being lightweight itself. I air dry the hair turban, and it&#x27;s ready to use the next day; so you won&#x27;t need to wash and dry it after every use. I ordered my very first Aquis hair turban from a television shopping show several years ago, and I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve found them on Amazon. I like to have several on hand since I have three daughters. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but Aquis is the best brand of hair turbans I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am about to order my sixth hair turban...this one for a cousin going off to college.  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a standard terry hair towel. My hair dries in no time and I am not constantly trying to get a soggy wet towel to stay on my head. This product works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now keep one in my suitcase and in m gym bag. Makes showering away from home a breeze as my hair is dry before the rest of me...and the turban itself dries in about ten minutes (even less when you put it in the bathing suit spinner at the gym]. Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: worth the extra money for a color as white tends to get dingy after a while.</li>
            <li> The hair turban does as it promises - forms a turban that prevents water from washed hair from drizzling down your back and which accelerates drying. Now, if you are a senior, you do have to bend over to get longer hair into the turban.  Hanging on to the shower door helps!!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I bought another one. Now I won&#x27;t use anything else after I wash my hair. It goes on easily stays put and dries the excess water from my hair well. After use, it dries quickly and it washes very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is course and curly. I find drying it with microfiber towels to help prevent frizziness. I first bought an Aquis hair turban several years ago and loved it. This is my third one - I bought a second one just to have on hand and then recently lost my first one on a trip. They&#x27;re worth the price. They stay up very well and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Sorry but.. I felt kind of vain buying this (and infomercial-y) but I LOVE IT now! I have really long, thick, curly hair, the lack of weight prevents breakage (and I realize now that a towel pulled my hair and hurt a little). My hair is so nice and evenly dry after just a few minutes in this guy, with no rubbing. I despise blow-drying so it&#x27;s great for the winter- I don&#x27;t have to wait so long to go out in the cold so washing my hair is more convenient (hair-washing has always been a commitment for me). Now I love it and have decided that it makes me feel like a real lady haha, and I enjoy the ritual of wearing it while putting on makeup. Now I just need a silk caftan.</li>
            <li> I love these turbans so much, I have several, so I can rotate them to be washed. This towel is super-absorbent and it secures well on my head. It&#x27;s also very lightweight, which is great, especially depending on my hair length at the time. Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, I&#x27;ve had very long hair to shoulder-length hair, and it&#x27;s worked great for every length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
