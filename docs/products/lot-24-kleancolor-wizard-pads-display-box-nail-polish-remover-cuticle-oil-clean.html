    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a very good value.  </li>
            <li>These are great for travel, keeping in your purse, and make excellent stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li>I got a great deal on these at amazon and used them as party favors.  </li>
            <li>Although it takes a lot of pads to remove the polish if removing the kleancolor polish otherwise works great.</li>
            <li>They are convenient (if they worked), portable, and have a pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li>Loved them.  </li>
            <li>Smell good too.  </li>
            <li>But, the good news is, they have zero solvent odor, so you&#x27;re not going to stink out your coworkers/housemates/husband</li>
            <li>We also tried as presoak to remove press-on/fake nails, it worked great, did have to lay pads on residue glue but also found that soaking in warm soapy water and then pad did just as well.</li>
            <li>Very healthy for the nails, no acetone.</li>
            <li>Love these pads!  </li>
            <li>the oil is nice for cuticles for sure</li>
            <li>These are great portable little pads for the purse or office, and as acetone-free removers go, these are the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>These are the best for removing standard nail polish!</li>
            <li>It keeps my cuticles healthy,</li>
            <li>okay, there is no acetone smell.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite way to take the polish off of her nails.</li>
            <li>and then 1-2 coats of Nubar Diamonte or Seche Vite top</li>
            <li>love these</li>
            <li>Leaves my nails in good condition and really keeps my cuticles nice.  </li>
            <li>(my normal method)&lt;br /&gt; - The cuticle oil is very nice.  </li>
            <li>It came very quickly and there are a lot in the box.  </li>
            <li>There is no bad smell to this product like most removers.</li>
            <li>Love these pads, smell is not too fruity and fades quick.  </li>
            <li>Bought this huge box and shared with friends.  </li>
            <li>Great product , I only want to use this product</li>
            <li>So I searched and found this odor free polish remover.  </li>
            <li>It is clean to use and eliminates the chance of spillage.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s moisturizing and so much healthier for your nails.</li>
            <li>Daughter love these, say they are better than regular wipes</li>
            <li>I will order some more in the future for sure</li>
            <li>With all of that moisture, it works tremendously well removing nail polish.</li>
            <li>Great to have a small party favor that isn&#x27;t just junk after the party is over - useful gift!</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it on Amazon, in a bulk package, at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your nails really well before applying new polish because of the oil in the product.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t effective, which is to be expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of polish the other reviewers use.  </li>
            <li>Even dark colors, I clean, then soak for just a bit in a warm water/soap solution and then one more wipe down and the staining is all gone.  </li>
            <li>They make your nails real moist and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient to not have to buy polish remover and cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>I had my doubt&#x27;s that it was possible to find odor free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like them so much.  </li>
            <li>The glycerine keeps the nails from drying out while removing the polish, too, which feels nice, though I usually wash that off afterwards.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s tried all other cleaners but this is the only one she&#x27;s liked.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to acetone though, they do take a little more time to remove polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt; - Smells a lot better than acetone on a cotton round</li>
            <li>I rely on reviews quite a bit when I make a purchase of something new.  </li>
            <li>Takes off even the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; as vinyl and the new hard as gel top coats, no problem.</li>
            <li>This is it, no odor, works like a charm and leaves  your hands feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>One pad will clean fingers and toes unless you use very dark polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These little rounds will ultimately get through all of it, but I have to hold it on, rub, scrub, scrape....and pretty much use 2-3 rounds per nail.  </li>
            <li>cuticles feeling dry like normal acetone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m the first one to leave a bad review.  </li>

            <li> Love these pads!  They make your nails real moist and not greasy.  Bought this huge box and shared with friends.  Doesn&#x27;t  dry up and are compact so you can carry them in your purse.  Love these.</li>
            <li> This is a very good value.  It came very quickly and there are a lot in the box.  I took some to work and shared.  It is very convenient to not have to buy polish remover and cotton balls.  There is no bad smell to this product like most removers. Be sure to wash your nails really well before applying new polish because of the oil in the product.</li>
            <li> Daughter love these, say they are better than regular wipes</li>
            <li> These are the best for removing standard nail polish! Never search out a bottle of acetone and a cotton ball again. These are great for travel, keeping in your purse, and make excellent stocking stuffers! Each color has a slightly different scent, and there&#x27;s no strong chemical solvent smell like you would get with drugstore nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried removing shelac/gel polish with these and it wasn&#x27;t effective, which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Great product , I only want to use this product It keeps my cuticles healthy,</li>
            <li> I got a great deal on these at amazon and used them as party favors.  I paired them with mini nail polishes in a small gift bag.  Great to have a small party favor that isn&#x27;t just junk after the party is over - useful gift!</li>
            <li> Very healthy for the nails, no acetone. Leaves nails looking shiney.</li>
            <li> These remove polish slowly and make my fingers sticky. I bought them to take in my purse to work, but they don&#x27;t work for that because they make my fingers so sticky that they left residue on my mouse and keyboard. I now give them away when my friends ask if I have polish remover they can use. They do smell okay, there is no acetone smell. That plus the price is why I give two stars instead of one.</li>
            <li> Loved them.  Smell good too.  Makes your nails hydrated and shiney!!  Would refer to a friend  for their kids or adults</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite way to take the polish off of her nails. She&#x27;s tried all other cleaners but this is the only one she&#x27;s liked. One pad will clean fingers and toes unless you use very dark polish. It is clean to use and eliminates the chance of spillage.</li>
            <li> My package just got here today nothing was messed up in the package I will be giving my mom some and my sister and I luv the smell of them and u get different fragrance of them I will order some more in the future for sure</li>
            <li> My manicurist introduced me to this product last year. I love it because it&#x27;s moisturizing and so much healthier for your nails. With all of that moisture, it works tremendously well removing nail polish. I was delighted to find it on Amazon, in a bulk package, at such a reasonable price. I plan to share it with friends and family. I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Plus-side is, these do not have acetone in them. The down-side also is... that they don&#x27;t have acetone.  These are great portable little pads for the purse or office, and as acetone-free removers go, these are the best I&#x27;ve used. If you&#x27;re used to acetone though, they do take a little more time to remove polish. But, the good news is, they have zero solvent odor, so you&#x27;re not going to stink out your coworkers/housemates/husband every time you take your polish off. The glycerine keeps the nails from drying out while removing the polish, too, which feels nice, though I usually wash that off afterwards.</li>
            <li> My husband complained about normal nail polish remover stinking up the house.  So I searched and found this odor free polish remover.  I had my doubt&#x27;s that it was possible to find odor free.  This is it, no odor, works like a charm and leaves  your hands feeling soft.  Although it takes a lot of pads to remove the polish if removing the kleancolor polish otherwise works great.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m the first one to leave a bad review.  I rely on reviews quite a bit when I make a purchase of something new.  (hence how I wound up with 2 cases of these things that will never be used).  So please read the details of my specific use of the products and take it into consideration if it sounds similar to yours:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Smells a lot better than acetone on a cotton round (my normal method)&lt;br /&gt; - The cuticle oil is very nice.  Does not leave my nails/cuticles feeling dry like normal acetone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Doesn&#x27;t take off nail polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it.  It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of polish the other reviewers use.  I use OPI, Nubar, or China Glaze.  I give myself a weekly manicure that consists of:  Nail Envy strengthener, sometimes (but not always) a base coat,&lt;br /&gt; 2 coats of polish/lacquer, sometimes (but not always) an embellishment (glitter, crackle, etc.) and then 1-2 coats of Nubar Diamonte or Seche Vite top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little rounds will ultimately get through all of it, but I have to hold it on, rub, scrub, scrape....and pretty much use 2-3 rounds per nail.  And as the kids say now &amp;#34;Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for dat!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like them so much.  They are convenient (if they worked), portable, and have a pleasant aroma.  Since they seem to work for others so well, I&#x27;ll probably give them to some of the ladies at work.</li>
            <li> love these but you do end up using a lot of the little circles at one time to get stubborn colors off. the oil is nice for cuticles for sure</li>
            <li> Love these pads, smell is not too fruity and fades quick.  Leaves my nails in good condition and really keeps my cuticles nice.  Takes off even the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; as vinyl and the new hard as gel top coats, no problem. Even dark colors, I clean, then soak for just a bit in a warm water/soap solution and then one more wipe down and the staining is all gone.  I don&#x27;t know how it will do in soaking off the  gel products (use LED/UV lights to cure) as I do not use any of those types of products.  Trying to see if I can convince one of my daughters who does get gel manicures to give this a shot as a presoak since the other stuff is so awful.  We also tried as presoak to remove press-on/fake nails, it worked great, did have to lay pads on residue glue but also found that soaking in warm soapy water and then pad did just as well.</li>
            <li> Terrible nail polish remover.  I have to add remover to each container or it takes a very long time to remove polish with each wipe.  1 container works for about 20 fingers.</li>
