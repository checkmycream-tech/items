            <li>Essential oils are one of my highest costs in the process so I am always looking for excellent quality oils at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is more money wise to buy it in larger quantities.  </li>
            <li>It smells so clean</li>
            <li>I did not notice a difference between this oil and another brand that supposed to be more pure.</li>
            <li>i love this oil and thank you for your fast shipping</li>
            <li>Simply the most lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff...stops a multitude of odors in elderly people&#x27;s homes, particularly in bedrooms where &amp;#34;old people&amp;#34; smell seems to take over.  </li>
            <li>Fast, easy, and quality product.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I HONESTLY WANT TO THROW THE ENTIRE BOTTLE OUT.  </li>
            <li>Clean pure aroma.</li>
            <li>It can also be put on light bulbs particularly in the bedroom because lavender encourages sleep.  </li>
            <li>VERY VERY VERY UPSET</li>
            <li>The lavender smells exactly like it should.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure lavender doesn&#x27;t smell like sagebrush mixed with turpentine.</li>
            <li>WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS</li>
            <li>The lavender is great fo creating a restful environment or for helping to lessen the  possible effects of a minor burn.</li>
            <li>I use this oil for many things, mixed with olive oil as a hand/face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was not pleased with the strength of the Lavender Oil; however, after using it for a while, I am loving the smell a lot more!</li>
            <li>Wonderfully clear true lavender scent.</li>
            <li>The best...just amazingly pure lavender aroma in my home.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT SMELL PURE.  </li>
            <li>It is very relaxing and soothing.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and we received the product as stated and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Great scent but the bottle cap was broken.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really concentrated stuff.</li>
            <li>I wish it was sold in bigger sizes, however, as I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li>This oil is fine and was cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It started undiluted as a perfume, then mixed it with jojoba to wear in summer or winter as moisturizer or self massaging oil-be careful where you use it, onto adding it in my conditioner where I receive many compliments,add to bath for calming effects, the use list goes on and on.</li>
            <li>Worth every single cent</li>
            <li>NOW products are always pure and therapeutic grade essential oils</li>
            <li>I was surprised it didn&#x27;t come with a dropper too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other lavender EO from other companies and Now&#x27;s oil remains my favorite for quality and price.</li>

            <li> Do not allow cats to come into contact with wet bedding or the mist of any essential oils.</li>
            <li> I guess the picture is misleading because it looks like there&#x27;s a white tube down the middle.</li>
            <li> this size last about six months with a capful in the tub and a little spray bottle for aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I only have to use very little.</li>
            <li> I also blend this oil with tea tree in my salves, or other floral scents for my soaps.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, strength, scent life, ability to mix with other scents, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the lavender in soap, lotions, and other body products.</li>
            <li> A small funnel would also be a help if you need to transfer to smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what people expect to smell when they give this essential oil a bad or mediocre rating.</li>
            <li> A Little Lavender in the tub before bed</li>
            <li> It smells bitter and is a little bit hard on the nose like molasses.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want the waste with the priciness of the product.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my bath and it seems to relieve tension and relax my muscles.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on teddy bears, rugs, silk flowers....lasts all day.</li>
            <li> She likes stuff like this, but the little tiny bottles get so terribly expensive.  </li>
            <li> not sure if I needed or would ever use up the 16oz.</li>
            <li> SMELLS SOOOOOOOOO BAD, SMELLED MY ENTIRE HOUSE UP, HAD TO SPRAY $.99 GLADE ALL OVER TO COVER IT AND REMOVE THAT PUTRID COOKING SMELL.  </li>
            <li> I EVEN TRIED IT IN A SPRITZER WITH JUST WATER, SAME STILL HORRIBLE ONIONY AFTER SMELL.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a four star because it was so expensive...</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> HAS HORRIBLE ONIONY AFTER SMELL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price and great product!</li>
            <li> Product appears to be just what was asked for, 16 oz. of Lavender Oil, and it arrived quite promptly. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent essential oil. The lavender smells exactly like it should. I like it especially because Now Foods tests for pesticides.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this lavender oil many times.  I have received many compliments when I use it in my oil burner.  It smells so clean and it&#x27;s just lovely.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  Now products are amongst the best.</li>
            <li> good value and good  e-tailing service.  But  the  spout on the top of the bottle is flimsy and when i went to pour oil  on my  aroma  stone,  the spout came lose and oil spilled everywhere!</li>
            <li> I like the quantity of oil for the price, but I would like to see a better way to transfer the contents.  I don&#x27;t want the waste with the priciness of the product.</li>
            <li> I use this lavender oil in my bath.  It is very relaxing and soothing.  I buy this product every time I use all of it.</li>
            <li> While some reviews talk about &amp;#34;real lavender&amp;#34; scent as if it&#x27;s something completely different from what on expects, I&#x27;m pretty sure lavender doesn&#x27;t smell like sagebrush mixed with turpentine. Total ripoff, never buying again.</li>
            <li> At local stores, lavender sells $8 for 1 oz, same brand, Now Foods. At $65 for 16oz, that&#x27;s $4.06 per oz.  and it is a very effective way to eliminate fleas. Do not allow cats to come into contact with wet bedding or the mist of any essential oils. But works great for dogs, carpet, bedding, ankles.</li>
            <li> She likes stuff like this, but the little tiny bottles get so terribly expensive.  She just told me this is great.  She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Great product. I love this oil. I add a few drops to my bath and it seems to relieve tension and relax my muscles.</li>
            <li> This oil smells great and works in our diffuser. The price was reasonable and we received the product as stated and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I make soap and salves. Essential oils are one of my highest costs in the process so I am always looking for excellent quality oils at a reasonable price. This lavender smells great. My soap made with this oil is my best seller. I also blend this oil with tea tree in my salves, or other floral scents for my soaps. It blends well with just about anything! I wish it was sold in bigger sizes, however, as I go through it quickly. I&#x27;ve tried other lavender EO from other companies and Now&#x27;s oil remains my favorite for quality and price.</li>
            <li> The best...just amazingly pure lavender aroma in my home. I put a few drops on teddy bears, rugs, silk flowers....lasts all day. Clean pure aroma. Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Great scent but the bottle cap was broken. The tape held it in place so the liquid did not spill</li>
            <li> Great price.  I&#x27;m using this in homemade fabreeze, cleaners and laundry soap. I only have to use very little. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was a better price to purchase the 16 oz instead of the 4 oz bottle of lavender oil by Now Foods.</li>
            <li> BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT.  DOES NOT SMELL PURE.  HAS HORRIBLE ONIONY AFTER SMELL. PUT IT IN A CANDLE OIL BURNER MIXED WITH WATER TO DIFFUSE THROUGH MY HOUSE, BIG MISTAKE...SMELLS SOOOOOOOOO BAD, SMELLED MY ENTIRE HOUSE UP, HAD TO SPRAY $.99 GLADE ALL OVER TO COVER IT AND REMOVE THAT PUTRID COOKING SMELL.  SMELLS LIKE BURNT ONIONS THAT HAVE BEEN COOKED AND SITTING FOR DAYS..  I HONESTLY WANT TO THROW THE ENTIRE BOTTLE OUT.  I EVEN TRIED IT IN A SPRITZER WITH JUST WATER, SAME STILL HORRIBLE ONIONY AFTER SMELL.  VERY VERY VERY UPSET AT THIS. I WISH I WOULD HAVE REALIZED IT SOONER, I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT.  I INHERITED A FAMILY MEMBERS MATTRESS WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS AND I THOUGHT WHAT A BETTER WAY TO &amp;#34;CLEAN&amp;#34; AND FRESHEN THE MATTRESS, I THOUGHT THE ONIONY SMELL WAS FROM THE MATTRESS BEING OLD AND MY FAMILY MEMBER BEING NASTY, LOL, AND COME TO FIND OUT MONTHS LATER IT WASN&#x27;T THE MATTRESS AT ALL!!!!!!, IT WAS THIS LAVENDER OIL!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality. Price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> NOW is a product line I know and trust. It has never let me down. The lavender is great fo creating a restful environment or for helping to lessen the  possible effects of a minor burn.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Our local organic store stopped selling it.  It is more money wise to buy it in larger quantities.  Excellent for aromatherapy.  Best after a good hot bath.</li>
            <li> Different essential oils serve different purposes but lavender is a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27;. It is calming, soothing, great for burns, soothes aches, etc. You can mist your pillow to sleep better. The list goes on and on :-) I like Now brand and the 16 oz size - much more economical. I&#x27;m on a second or third bottle now - this size last about six months with a capful in the tub and a little spray bottle for aches and pains. I use it conservatively. Great even as a scent. Ahh, lavender.</li>
            <li> This has a nice and mild scent to it. I gave it a four star because it was so expensive... not sure if I needed or would ever use up the 16oz. But for sure I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Now lavender oil for 7 years. I like the scent, strength, scent life, ability to mix with other scents, etc.&lt;br /&gt;It started undiluted as a perfume, then mixed it with jojoba to wear in summer or winter as moisturizer or self massaging oil-be careful where you use it, onto adding it in my conditioner where I receive many compliments,add to bath for calming effects, the use list goes on and on. Excellent product I will be using for years to come.</li>
            <li> I use this, of all things, to keep moths out of my clothes closet.  I dab some oil on the walls and door frames.  This is the first season I haven&#x27;t had to repair my cashmere, and the clothes smell great with just a hint of lavender.</li>
            <li> This is a best quality oil for cosmetic or medicinal use.  NOW products are always pure and therapeutic grade essential oils and I use all of them in my hand made soaps and lotions. I&#x27;ve never had a customer complain of rashes from using these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what people expect to smell when they give this essential oil a bad or mediocre rating. This lavender oil is spot on and a best seller for me. I even have customers who live very close to a lavender farm in California tell me this is the best lavender oil they&#x27;ve ever smelled. I use the lavender in soap, lotions, and other body products.</li>
            <li> I love this Now Lavender. It is pure and the best lavender I have ever used. I recommend it to anyone who loves lavender. I&#x27;m going to buy a bottle for my cousin in Florida.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for many things, mixed with olive oil as a hand/face moisturizer. Several drops in laundry soap makes for beautifully scented clothes. Since the bottle is so big, a dropper included would be helpful.  A small funnel would also be a help if you need to transfer to smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> Simply the most lovely fragrance.  I use it for nourishing my skin but the calming effects on my mind as well as soothing effects of my sinuses are an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully clear true lavender scent.</li>
            <li> This oil is fine and was cheaper than other brands. I did not notice a difference between this oil and another brand that supposed to be more pure.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...stops a multitude of odors in elderly people&#x27;s homes, particularly in bedrooms where &amp;#34;old people&amp;#34; smell seems to take over.  Sometimes I just sprinkle it on the carpet although I&#x27;d advise putting it in a spray bottle (perhaps mixed with water for lighter scent.  I soak a cotton ball or pad in this and use in my drawers and suitcases.  It can also be put on light bulbs particularly in the bedroom because lavender encourages sleep.  (I use Peppermint oil in my living room on carpet and lamps to freshen the place up because it is known for giving you energy)</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist, this is the best bargain I have found. Essential oil prices are through the roof, but then so is everything!</li>
            <li> Hugeee bottle. I put it in everything and have lots left! Worth every single cent</li>
            <li> Fast, easy, and quality product. Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! It&#x27;s great in the bath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a more than 6 months now and I have 90% of the bottle left. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll use the rest of it. It&#x27;s really concentrated stuff. I was surprised it didn&#x27;t come with a dropper too. I guess the picture is misleading because it looks like there&#x27;s a white tube down the middle. I had to go out an buy my own dropper. It doesn&#x27;t have that wonderful floral smell. It smells bitter and is a little bit hard on the nose like molasses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying lavender oil for years from NOW. I use it in baths and facial/sinus steams. It has always been a wonderful smelling product that I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> works great. I use all during the week, especially at night.</li>
            <li> I purchase multiple 4 ounce bottles at a time. Buying 1 larger bottle&lt;br /&gt;is so much more economical. A Little Lavender in the tub before bed&lt;br /&gt;makes me sleep so soundly. Love this product.</li>
            <li> i love this oil and thank you for your fast shipping</li>
            <li> Initially, I was not pleased with the strength of the Lavender Oil; however, after using it for a while, I am loving the smell a lot more!</li>
