            <li> This shampoo is wonderful. It&#x27;s the only shampoo that I&#x27;ve used that gets all the products out and leaves my hair clean. As far as the colour safe, it is! My stylist has been mixing special colors for me for a year now and it doesn&#x27;t fade at all. This shampoo really protects and cleans! I&#x27;m buying it here because the price went up in stores. A 33.8 oz bottle lasts for 6 months for me but I have short hair. Although, you don&#x27;t need much of the shampoo because it lathers really well and is thick. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone with colored hair!!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and much better price than salon.</li>
            <li> Nice Shampoo, smells great. Gentle for my chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> I was afraid a sulfate free shampoo would not lather well or leave my hair feeling like straw, but that is not the case! The shampoo lathers up really well and leaves my hair soft and clean. My only complaint is it leaves my hair a bit too soft for my liking so I have to amp up the product I put into it for texture and volume, but that said, it does what I want: it protects my color and with red hair color that is saying quite a lot! I would definitely recommend this shampoos.</li>
            <li> Good price, quick delivery on a product I use all the time!</li>
            <li> I came across AG Colour Savour shampoo when I was trying to find a paraben free shampoo due to developing a allergy to topical parabens. (Yes this was diagnosed and I would break out in blisters on my head and body with contact to any parabens.) I also wanted a great color care shampoo so I came across AG. I now can&#x27;t imagine using anything else! It is so excellent and lathers so creamy even though it is sulfate free. I can honestly say that my hair is in the best health it has ever been (and I get my hair colored blonde so it easily would get dried out and break.) I orginially bought this when my hair was dark and I thought it did an excellent job of keeping my color from fading and now I have lightened my hair and I still think its great. Just all around very gentle and good cleanser for your hair.</li>
            <li> This line was recommended to me by my stylist.  It is supposed to help maintain your color for those who color their hair.  The smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> Used for years. Great price.</li>
            <li> my loyal hairdresser got my hooked on AG products.  combined this with the sliver purple shampoo. When I interchange the both my color last a full 1 to 1 1/2 weeks long before salon coloring.</li>
            <li> Leaves film on my scalp.  Smells good though.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used AG products for years, but this one made my scalp itch so badly i thought i would scream. finally figured out it was the shampoo and conditioner i ordered here - not sure if it was substandard or what, but sadly it was a total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful. Last time I went to get my hair highlighted, my stylist gave me a free bottle of it. I tried it, just thinking it was just another shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t at all. Not only has it kept my color but my hair has always been frizzy and this is the only shampoo I have EVER used that has gotten the frizz out. It&#x27;s an awesome shampoo and I am so grateful to my stylist for giving it to me.</li>
            <li> I had heard such great things about this shampoo, and I really wanted to try it because it was sulfate-free and I highlight my hair.  This weighed down my hair and left it kind of greasy.  I will say that it smells good, and it may work for some people, but for some reason didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale and insanely cheap at Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;It works, it smells good and creates a nice lather but it isn&#x27;t special. I would never pay full price for it nor would I seek it out again.</li>
            <li> Lovely citrus scent and you don&#x27;t need to use much - lathers well. Too soon to tell how well it protects my colour but I&#x27;ve used AG products for years and loved them.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife and she told me that she likes it!</li>
            <li> Product is fine, except for the leaking bottle, which results in loss of product.</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Merchant was great - didnt care for product. Left hair dry and not soft.</li>
