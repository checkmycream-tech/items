            <li> It wasn&#x27;t just roses but some kind of creepy smell.  </li>
            <li> My hands are a little slippery right after applying the cream, but that is only noticeable if I want to open something and need a tight grip.  </li>
            <li> my overused dry hands (e.g., I&#x27;m a nurse who washes her hands a zillion times a day with harsh antibacterial soap that results in cracks in the skin and itching)--I like to apply it at night in conjunction with the &amp;#34;old-fashioned&amp;#34; cotton sleeping gloves used in the &amp;#34;days of yore&amp;#34; to REALLY soften the hands.  </li>
            <li> She has incredibly dry hands, and she loves this product.</li>
            <li> If you are a dry ash monster like me, pass.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have permanently dry hands</li>
            <li> Fanatastic product for rough hands</li>
            <li> Getting my hands slightly wet after applying the cream doesn&#x27;t wash it all off either</li>
            <li> no thanks.</li>
            <li> I was wary when I first tried it</li>
            <li> but, alas, it&#x27;s becoming difficult to purchase these days.  </li>
            <li> I always have trouble getting gifts for Grandma, but this year I struck gold with this lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and almost impossible to find locally - and we live in Raleigh, NC (the state capital!).  </li>
            <li> As it is, I have to constantly reapply it, which can drive me crazy.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and have to wash my hands constantly or use the alcohol foam hand cleaner that creates painful cracking after a while.</li>
            <li> but in the winter they can get bad sometimes.  </li>
            <li> too bad, parabens.</li>

            <li> Mama was right about rose water and glycerin. The scent is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I loved the cream.  The hand cream itself worked great.  But I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell.  It wasn&#x27;t just roses but some kind of creepy smell.  I gave it to someone who didn&#x27;t mind the smell because the hand cream was so good.</li>
            <li> Instantly softens my hands and absorbs quickly. Not at all greasy. Plus, it smells like fresh cut roses! Will continue ordering.</li>
            <li> This is a goldmine of soothing relief! Beautiful packaging and fragrant product. I am a nurse and have to wash my hands constantly or use the alcohol foam hand cleaner that creates painful cracking after a while. I get migraines from most scented things, even some organic candles. This hand cream smells like rosewater and does not give me a tinge of a headache. I was wary when I first tried it but since then I don&#x27;t leave home without a tube in my purse or bag. It&#x27;s a fabulous product I wish I could buy a box of.</li>
            <li> Fanatastic product for rough hands</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and how my hands feel post application. However, I wish the feeling would last through handwashing. As it is, I have to constantly reapply it, which can drive me crazy. I personally prefer Aveeno&#x27;s 24 hour hand cream, as it endures constant handwashing.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.  It has a wonderful light rosewater scent, isn&#x27;t greasy, rubs in nicely, and stays on for hours with just a quarter size amount.  My hands are a little slippery right after applying the cream, but that is only noticeable if I want to open something and need a tight grip.  Getting my hands slightly wet after applying the cream doesn&#x27;t wash it all off either so I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it.  My hands feel softer and I like how they feel.  One tube will last me about 6 months applying the quarter size amount of cream once and sometimes twice a day.</li>
            <li> I believe that this is a wonderful recipe from the past ! I it appears to be...Glycerine and Rosewater ! Goes on a bit sticky, but dries soft and silky, The aroma is redolent of the glycerine and rose water. Very masculine and pleasant. Try it , gentlemen, you will really like it !</li>
            <li> My grandmother used rosewater and glycerin lotion her entire life and people always commented on her gorgeous skin.  I searched and searched and finally found it.  My skin is so soft - like a child&#x27;s.  And the light rose fragrance reminds me of Grandma.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble getting gifts for Grandma, but this year I struck gold with this lotion. She has incredibly dry hands, and she loves this product. The packaging and the fragrance make her feel like it&#x27;s a luxurious treat.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is Luxury in a tube for sure!  It leaves hands so soft and supple, you will be hooked once you try it!</li>
            <li> I have used this hand creme for many years.  It goes on easily, leaves my hands soft with a pleasant scent that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> My favorite had cream! Combination of a nice creme texture and a wonderful rose aroma makes it a perfect product. I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> smells amazing, but not as hydrating as promised.  Still have to re-apply after an hour or so.  If you are a dry ash monster like me, pass.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product on the Caswell-Massey for many years but, alas, it&#x27;s becoming difficult to purchase these days.  It is one product that &amp;#34;baby&#x27;s&amp;#34; my overused dry hands (e.g., I&#x27;m a nurse who washes her hands a zillion times a day with harsh antibacterial soap that results in cracks in the skin and itching)--I like to apply it at night in conjunction with the &amp;#34;old-fashioned&amp;#34; cotton sleeping gloves used in the &amp;#34;days of yore&amp;#34; to REALLY soften the hands.  I also buy the set of three &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; tubes that I carry in my purse when I&#x27;m out with my boyfriend--smells lovely.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is a bit  strong  but  it helps in healing the skin</li>
            <li> I will definitely be re-ordering this hand cream when I run out.  Not only does it absorb quickly to smooth and soften my hands, but it has the lush fragrance of a rose garden!  I find myself holding my hands in front of my face just to drink in that lovely scent!  If you like to have soft, smooth hands and love the smell of roses, this wonderful hand cream is for you!</li>
            <li> exact product, good price</li>
            <li> Really good moisturizer. Helps to heal cracked skin and to prevent dryness.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasing rosewater aroma.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and they loved it</li>
            <li> Very nice book, exactly what I wanted, perfect transaction! Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! Moisturing and absorbs well. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;m 69 years young) that leaves my hands soft, but never greasy, and smells nice too.  It&#x27;s expensive and almost impossible to find locally - and we live in Raleigh, NC (the state capital!).  I never want to switch brands, since I&#x27;ve found a product I love.  Amazon offers the best price, plus fast delivery.  Thank you for making it possible for me to continue to enjoy one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> This got really good reviews so I was expecting to like it more. It&#x27;s okay....I find it not thick enough and a little greasy and it smells way too strong.</li>
            <li> Loved this hand creme! Even worked for my mother-in-law who is allergic to chemical fragrances. Keeps hands soft and smells WONDERFUL, just like tea rose.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I was taking a yoga class, and my instructor assisted me in adjusting my posture. I smelled this scent of something that reminded me of a Vermont bed and breakfast I went to with my family when I was very young. It just brought me back to a happy memory. I asked her what she had on after the class, and she directed me to Dr. Hunter&#x27;s hand creme. I love the scent of this- but you have to be okay with a semi-strong quaint smell. The creme itself is great-- my hands get so dry in the New York winters, and I find this to be a handy creme to carry around with me whenever I could use a little moisturizer. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> My grandmother introduced me to Glycerin and Rose Water hand cream more than 50 years ago.  I cleared up severely chappend hands (ie: bleeding!) overnight.  Literally.  This one smells GREAT, and everyone I know who&#x27;s tried it, loves it!  No greasy feeling lingers!  Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is way better than expected. It smells so pretty and it really keep your hands soft and smooth. I will definetly buy again.</li>
            <li> We purchased this hand crème for our daughter. She LOVES it!  She has always been drawn to the scent of roses, and she says this is the truest rose scent she&#x27;s ever smelled in a lotion/cream product. Caswell-Massey delivers!!!</li>
            <li> Smooth feel with a lovely rose aroma, which is more than I can say for the real roses they sell at the store nowadays.</li>
            <li> Purchased the product the second time. Great for hands, absorbs very fast. Faint aroma of roses which I love.</li>
            <li> This hand lotion is an absolute luxury. The rose smell is decadent and lasts a few hours after application. The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. This is so worth the money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak up as quickly as I want it to be but well, it has a great smell so i keep using it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I don&#x27;t have permanently dry hands but in the winter they can get bad sometimes.  I always buy a tube of this stuff for the winter and it&#x27;s amazing!  Smells great, absorbs quickly, and leaves hands feeling soft and moisturized.  It&#x27;s a go to product for me.</li>
            <li> too bad, parabens. no thanks.</li>
