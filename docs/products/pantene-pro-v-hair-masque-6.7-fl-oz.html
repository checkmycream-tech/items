    <ol>
            <li>and this is the line that is the best ever.</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>This is one of the very best hair products I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>Do you want shiny and beautiful hair?</li>
            <li>For now, it looks great.  </li>
            <li>Great conditioner for damaged hair.</li>
            <li>it works great, I see a improvement in my hair already.</li>
            <li>LOVE It !!</li>
            <li>It did NOT lift out the color, which would usually be a good thing for me.</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better results with Pantene Restore Beautiful Lengths Breakage Defense Conditioner and Pantene</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried and love this product that works so beautifully!</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it once a week!</li>
            <li>The good things I can say about it is the smell is pleasant, it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp, and the flip-top cap is easier to use than the screw-off top on most jar masks.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking I would kind of \\&quot;soak out\\</li>
            <li>Very good for my old hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Most of the ingredients are alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much better looking now</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the results.</li>
            <li>and I think the hair masque and the thickening spray are my 2 favorite products from it.</li>
            <li>love the item an will purchase again as soon as I need more before I run out..</li>
            <li>( make sure you don&#x27;t heat style while trying to fix your fried hair)</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks and feels after using this.</li>
            <li>I loved this conditioner the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>and I do like the kind of sweet smell of it.</li>
            <li>It made my hair color-treated, straw-like hair (lol) super soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for the price</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>The hair masque adds shine and bounce to the hair, which is important when the hair is thinning.  </li>
            <li>I use this every 2-3 days when I shampoo, and it helps much more than the conditioners that you rinse out right away.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Very good mask for my age easy to use and my hair looks younger and shine and soft</li>
            <li>If your hair is really damaged, you will need more than this masque.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months now, about every three or four days, and notice a good difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>Restore Beautiful Lengths Strengthening Therapy Mask, both of which cost much less than the Agedefy mask, and both of which I would recommend for damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Before the white hairs, I&#x27;ve always had very smooth, fine, straight hair that I didn&#x27;t need to do anything to or use any products on.</li>
            <li>I like the regular masque better because my hair is very dry, but this is a good quality, moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is bleached and very dry and course, but when i use this it&#x27;s silky soft and feels very healthy!</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>When I read other people&#x27;s reviews of the agedefy products, I thought it sounded too good to be true and just what I was looking for (I&#x27;m a sucker for reviews and good ad campaigns).</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I like this product very much and plan to order again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I have pretty wiry curly hair, and this helps it to just relax.</li>
            <li>This masque does more than your standard conditioner, but I don&#x27;t believe it quite lives up to all of the hype.  </li>
            <li>smells pretty.</li>
            <li>after first use my hair feels so silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shiny, soft, pretty !!  </li>
            <li>This worked exceptionally well on my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Really like this Pantene hair masque.</li>
            <li>Am ready to throw it out.  </li>
            <li>Not to much to say</li>
            <li>I bought the whole system</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through one whole conditioner, using it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>I have noticed this same thing happening with other brands of good shampoos and conditioners also.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes my fine hair amazingly soft and tangle free, without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem any better than any other hydrating mask.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much use it every day until my hair gets too soft</li>
            <li>Works better than some more expensive things I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice over the course of a couple of weeks, thinking maybe it would work better the second time, but it gave me the same non-results.  </li>
            <li>While my hair feels soft and smooth, I don&#x27;t know if it has tamed my white strands any more than the cheaper Aussie 3 minute miracle deep conditioner or Dove damage therapy daily conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 and my colored, fine textured hair is very dry.  </li>
            <li>High to lower price points</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 30, but I&#x27;ve already started getting a pretty significant amount of white hairs on my head</li>
            <li>However, these white hairs have a mind of their own and like to stick up and curl right out of all the other well-behaved slick smooth strands.</li>
            <li>It is lasting a long time, and I plan to buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>Ive actually used this without shampoooing my hair like 2 days after shamppoo and conditioning it...rinsed out well and left my hair soft and clean!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft and manageable</li>
            <li>This has really helped put my hair in much better condition after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>Hope others have the same positive</li>
            <li>(they are not gray, just completely absent of color).</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and fuller</li>
            <li>I can spray it near the roots and it makes the hair appear fuller temporarily.</li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner/mask for my frequently colored, delicate hair.</li>
            <li>We live in a very dry climate, and this adds softness to my fine hair without overly weighting it down.</li>
            <li>I give this 3 stars not because it&#x27;s not a good product, but on MY hair after a few uses my hair becomes full of static.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a month and it really helps during the summer dry weather.</li>
            <li>but it seems pretty average.</li>
            <li>I have used this only once so far (I plan to use this two times weekly)...</li>
            <li>I subscribed and saved to all the products, so I&#x27;m going to give them another month to really wow me, but not totally sure if I would call it age defying or worth the price.</li>
            <li>Noticed very little dropping after the very first use</li>
            <li>my hair was dry an frizzy, now its moisturized an very soft.</li>

            <li> my hair was dry an frizzy, now its moisturized an very soft.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, and a very small amount on wet hair goespecially a long way for daily use, and a little bit more left on for 20 minutes</li>
            <li> and then I switch to the regular conditioner until I get dry again.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair at medium texture.</li>
            <li> but it tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> I use a softening heat protector leave in conditioner and blow dry.</li>
            <li> this new combo has my dull dry hair...</li>
            <li> I tried numerous expensive products and Pantene, hands down, is the only one that&#x27;s not a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a deeper conditioner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, glossy, and thick.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be expensive elsewhere, but Amazon&#x27;s price makes this just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of smoothing serums as well as the Dove Damage therapy products, but they don&#x27;t seem to tame these white hairs as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> - I use it weekly - alternating with other masks.  </li>
            <li> I still use the other shampoos and conditioners by Pantene without this problem and they work well for MY hair.</li>
            <li> Product leaves my curly hair dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> but it is not worth the cose.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It dried to a glossy finish, and there is no stickiness.  </li>
            <li> Again, it dried as if there were nothing on my hair.  </li>
            <li> , all dried out from the alcohol?  </li>
            <li> I use just a small amount a couple of times a week.  </li>
            <li> No static</li>
            <li> The tub looks small, but lasts for well over a month for me.</li>
            <li> Difficult to comb through long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made a dramatic improvement in how thick it looks, how shiny and how manageable.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> Ill be using twice a week from now</li>
            <li> I got a bad hair color job and wanted to rinse out some of the color.</li>
            <li> This product has improved my hair on bad hair days!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it. Leaves hair very soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I got a bad hair color job and wanted to rinse out some of the color. I bought this product thinking I would kind of \\&quot;soak out\\&quot; the color, and I left it on my hair.  It dried to a glossy finish, and there is no stickiness.  I washed it out and used the product for a styling product.  Again, it dried as if there were nothing on my hair.  It&#x27;s soft, glossy, and thick.  The only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I have no idea whats in this that might be helping my hair.  Most of the ingredients are alcohol.  Will my hair start to break off soon, all dried out from the alcohol?  For now, it looks great.  It did NOT lift out the color, which would usually be a good thing for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it once a week!</li>
            <li> Works better than some more expensive things I have tried. I have pretty wiry curly hair, and this helps it to just relax.</li>
            <li> This masque does more than your standard conditioner, but I don&#x27;t believe it quite lives up to all of the hype.  If your hair is really damaged, you will need more than this masque.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for the price</li>
            <li> I saw this product recommended in a magazine and decided to try it.  I have fine hair but it tends to be dry.  This product makes my hair so soft and easy to manage.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I use just a small amount a couple of times a week.  I would recommend this to anyone who might need it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  There are just some times when my hair starts to feel like straw and this is the only thing that gives me the curl and conditioning that I want.  I pretty much use it every day until my hair gets too soft and then I switch to the regular conditioner until I get dry again.  It&#x27;s great stuff and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> smells pretty. I expected it to be a deeper conditioner but it seems pretty average.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for damaged hair. It was overkill in my case as I use the regular conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the agedefy products for about 6 months now and think my hair is healthier and a bit thicker.  This masque works well - I use it weekly - alternating with other masks.  My hair is curly and I color it so this seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Really like this Pantene hair masque. I use it with the Pantene Pro-V Expert COllection Age Defy Shampoo and Conditioner too. I use the masque twice a week. Makes my hair shiny and smooth and soft! LOVE it.</li>
            <li> After buying the expert line.. &amp;#34;enjoy&amp;#34; and hating it !! I thought I would give this line a try. I bought all three, shampoo, conditioner, and mask... LOVE It !! I also use trese em may ( spelling?) Heat protecter spray... this new combo has my dull dry hair... shiny, soft, pretty !!  My hair is so much better looking now</li>
            <li> The hair masque adds shine and bounce to the hair, which is important when the hair is thinning.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very good for my old hair.  I&#x27;m 67 and my colored, fine textured hair is very dry.  I use this every 2-3 days when I shampoo, and it helps much more than the conditioners that you rinse out right away.</li>
            <li> I like what it does for my hair. The entire pantene Pro-VExpert Collection Age etc work well for me. Hope others have the same positive</li>
            <li> This worked exceptionally well on my fine thin hair.  It&#x27;s made a dramatic improvement in how thick it looks, how shiny and how manageable.  No static whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> Do you want shiny and beautiful hair? I&#x27;ve tried everything out there. High to lower price points and this is the line that is the best ever.</li>
            <li> This mask did nothing for my damaged hair.  If anything, it made it duller.  I&#x27;ve used it twice over the course of a couple of weeks, thinking maybe it would work better the second time, but it gave me the same non-results.  Am ready to throw it out.  The good things I can say about it is the smell is pleasant, it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp, and the flip-top cap is easier to use than the screw-off top on most jar masks.  I&#x27;ve had much better results with Pantene Restore Beautiful Lengths Breakage Defense Conditioner and Pantene Restore Beautiful Lengths Strengthening Therapy Mask, both of which cost much less than the Agedefy mask, and both of which I would recommend for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.  It was no  different than the rest of the Hydration Hair Masque I have used.  Not to much to say but it is not worth the cose.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner/mask for my frequently colored, delicate hair. I have shoulder length hair, and a very small amount on wet hair goespecially a long way for daily use, and a little bit more left on for 20 minutes weekly has increased the strength and shine of my hair. The tub looks small, but lasts for well over a month for me. I found it to be expensive elsewhere, but Amazon&#x27;s price makes this just right.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a month and it really helps during the summer dry weather.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my fine hair amazingly soft and tangle free, without weighing it down.  Plus it smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel like silk. Like a mink&#x27;s fur. And that&#x27;s saying slot. I have long hair at medium texture. Difficult to comb through long hair lemme tell ya, but this stuff rocks. Love it. Love the smell and the results. I don&#x27;t get that from this brands regular conditioner though. Just the mask. So I use the mask here and there as a masque and as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 30, but I&#x27;ve already started getting a pretty significant amount of white hairs on my head (they are not gray, just completely absent of color). Before the white hairs, I&#x27;ve always had very smooth, fine, straight hair that I didn&#x27;t need to do anything to or use any products on. However, these white hairs have a mind of their own and like to stick up and curl right out of all the other well-behaved slick smooth strands. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of smoothing serums as well as the Dove Damage therapy products, but they don&#x27;t seem to tame these white hairs as well as I would like. When I read other people&#x27;s reviews of the agedefy products, I thought it sounded too good to be true and just what I was looking for (I&#x27;m a sucker for reviews and good ad campaigns). I bought the whole system and I think the hair masque and the thickening spray are my 2 favorite products from it. I loved this conditioner the first time I used it. My hair felt like silk and I do like the kind of sweet smell of it. I&#x27;ve gone through one whole conditioner, using it a couple times a week. While my hair feels soft and smooth, I don&#x27;t know if it has tamed my white strands any more than the cheaper Aussie 3 minute miracle deep conditioner or Dove damage therapy daily conditioner. I subscribed and saved to all the products, so I&#x27;m going to give them another month to really wow me, but not totally sure if I would call it age defying or worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works well.  My hair is so soft and fuller</li>
            <li> Very good mask for my age easy to use and my hair looks younger and shine and soft</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and plan to order again.</li>
            <li> I sleep with this on my hair at night with a plastic cap. I use a softening heat protector leave in conditioner and blow dry. My hair then looks like it did when I was 17 I am so glad I tried and love this product that works so beautifully!</li>
            <li> This has really helped put my hair in much better condition after only a few uses. I&#x27;m receiving compliments on how shiny my hair looks. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This product has improved my hair on bad hair days!  I can spray it near the roots and it makes the hair appear fuller temporarily.</li>
            <li> it works great, I see a improvement in my hair already. my hair was dry an frizzy, now its moisturized an very soft. love the item an will purchase again as soon as I need more before I run out..</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff worked well.  It made my hair color-treated, straw-like hair (lol) super soft! Will def buy it again!  Ill be using twice a week from now on!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- Ive actually used this without shampoooing my hair like 2 days after shamppoo and conditioning it...rinsed out well and left my hair soft and clean!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem any better than any other hydrating mask.  In fact, I think I prefer the conditioner to the mask.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very best hair products I&#x27;ve ever come across. My hair is bleached and very dry and course, but when i use this it&#x27;s silky soft and feels very healthy!</li>
            <li> If you are Caucasian and have truly fried or crispy hair, this is the ONLY product that will help. I tried numerous expensive products and Pantene, hands down, is the only one that&#x27;s not a waste of money!!! Finally found a winner ( make sure you don&#x27;t heat style while trying to fix your fried hair)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now, about every three or four days, and notice a good difference in the texture of my hair. We live in a very dry climate, and this adds softness to my fine hair without overly weighting it down. It is lasting a long time, and I plan to buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Noticed very little dropping after the very first use</li>
            <li> I give this 3 stars not because it&#x27;s not a good product, but on MY hair after a few uses my hair becomes full of static.  I have noticed this same thing happening with other brands of good shampoos and conditioners also.  I still use the other shampoos and conditioners by Pantene without this problem and they work well for MY hair.</li>
            <li> I like the regular masque better because my hair is very dry, but this is a good quality, moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Product leaves my curly hair dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks and feels after using this. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have used this only once so far (I plan to use this two times weekly)...after first use my hair feels so silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny and will purchase again!</li>
