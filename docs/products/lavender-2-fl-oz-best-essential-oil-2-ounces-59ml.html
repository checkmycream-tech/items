            <li>Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li>and my whole house is delightful for hours on end.</li>
            <li>and I found out that it kind of burns on my hands.</li>

            <li>It smells nice and works well in a warmer</li>
            <li>my review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>size is perfect since you don&#x27;t have to use too much as it is highly concentrated.  </li>
            <li>so it leaked and all of our mail that day smelled very strongly of the product.</li>

            <li>This is by far the best smelling lavender oil!  </li>

            <li>It has a very light scent.  </li>
            <li>not as strong as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>The bottle does not have a dropper top but it comes with a separate pipette.</li>
            <li>The oil is nice quality too, smells genuine and refreshing.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying more stuff with it.</li>

            <li>Many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>Maybe it smells better after you add water to it.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure which was the source.</li>
            <li>That means you will either need to have a spare dropper on hand or buy one, because otherwise you won&#x27;t be able to measure out the correct number of drops to use in your diffuser.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s ok for diffusion, but I wasn&#x27;t overly pleased by it&#x27;s fragrance</li>

            <li>Lavender can be used for SO many things.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love oil?  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it smells better after you add water to it.</li>
            <li>I believe that they could work a bit more in sealing the bottle a bit better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I wish that the bottle had a stopper at the top.</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>I have been putting a cotton ball soaked in it under my pillow at night and have been sleeping much better.</li>
            <li>Lavender is just one of those smells that most people love.</li>
            <li>I love to put a drop of this in my bath water to help me relax.</li>

            <li>So who dosen&#x27;t love lavender?  </li>

            <li>perfect product especially for the price.  </li>

            <li>Love this, it smells heavenly, although I got this free for reviewing I will be pruchasing more.</li>
            <li>I inject this oil into wool dryer balls...works great as a natural dryer sheet!</li>
            <li>I am happy so far.</li>
            <li>I received the bottle and it had leaked out even with the plastic still securely wrapped around the top.</li>
            <li>A good portion leaked out and it was very slippery to unpack.  </li>
            <li>But other than that the oil is perfect!!</li>
            <li>The shipping on this product was very quick.</li>
            <li>The scent did appear to dissipate very quickly so every 4 days I had to redo some drops.</li>
            <li>instead there is a sticker as organic which can be easily removed and it is not as part of the product label.</li>
            <li>The lavendar oil was just way too strong for my nose to handle.</li>
            <li>The bottle leaked all over the envelope, so before I even opened it, I got an overwhelmingly strong smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are strong yet not choke and gag you strength.</li>
            <li>The scent was so strong I could smell it for a couple days after I threw the shipping bag in the trash.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell - not too sweet, not too strong.</li>
            <li>I drifted off to sleep within a half hour and had a great nights sleep!</li>
            <li>Is very strong so doesnt take very much.</li>
            <li>When I first received this product it smelled like bug spray and was very strong.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with some Jojoba oil to use as a moisturizer and was very pleased!</li>
            <li>I found out about this usage from another oil-loving mom and it has been a life saver (not to mention a HUGE money saver.)</li>
            <li>The postman must have been really relaxed the whole drive, LOL.</li>
            <li>2oz of Lavender EO for $10.99 is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic product.</li>

            <li>I use it on my pillows and have noticed it is so much easier to relax and sleep at night!!!</li>

            <li>I also have put it in my wax melter &amp;amp; my whole house smells like a beautiful field of French Lavender!</li>
            <li>Will not purchase from you again as Piping Rock and Planet Therapy are selling a superior product which I had purchased last year and again this year.</li>
            <li>I hope the lable is true to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>The bottle was still sealed but leaked a bit from the top so the whole package smelled heavenly.</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t believe how fast it will heal and you won&#x27;t be able to tell where the sore was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just getting into using essential oils and this was a good one to start with.</li>
            <li>The first I got was leaking when it arrived, so I contacted them and they very quickly got another sent out to me.</li>
            <li>I like that the package was shipped to me quickly, but I do no like it.</li>
            <li>V.light n quickly</li>
            <li>I will be repurchasing this item and many more of their essential oils.  </li>
            <li>and I thought it produced a mild, not unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I thought it produced a mild, not unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a very lovely essential oil.</li>
            <li>I am also very interested in using it to make candles.</li>
            <li>I quickly discovered the culprit as soon as I opened the first padded envelope though!</li>
            <li>It does very well in an aromatherapy diffuser, and mixes fairly easily with distilled water if you are using it as a spray to freshen up a room.</li>
            <li>I am not an avid user or essential oils, but would love to use them more.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I&#x27;ve read that it helps calm the nerves.</li>
            <li>I have used it in distilled water to calm my temperamental child, in a diffuser to scent the house, homemade vinegar based cleaner, and in rice to make headache bags.  </li>
            <li>I also us it to help calm kitties who have anxiety.</li>
            <li>it WELL WORTH the price.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received it I put some in a spray bottle to use on my freshly cleaned bed linens.  </li>
            <li>Fresh lavender smell.</li>
            <li>Unlike many oils that use synthetic ingredients to produce what they believe lavender should smell like this company uses natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and well I didn&#x27;t get it at first, but I do sleep more sound not tossing and turning and waking in the middle of the night!</li>
            <li>but I find it to be just as good quality as other brands and would purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li>It is powerful when first</li>
            <li>I added a few drops to my carpet cleaner and my room smells amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does come in a dark amber bottle to protect the oil from oxidation, which is good.  </li>
            <li>Keeps a nice scent for a long time.</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;pure.&amp;#34; that&#x27;s fine if you are new to EOs and don&#x27;t understand dilutions, but for those looking for pure EOs, buy elsewhere!</li>
            <li>I really like these natural alternatives and plan on using more of their products.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of different bottles of Sun Essential Oils and they are made of great quality.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle of Lavender from Young Living and the smell is strong and concentrated.</li>
            <li>It had leaked during shipping but it was wrapped good so it didn&#x27;t make too much of a mess.  </li>
            <li>very high quality product!</li>
            <li>The product itself smells wonderful and you only have to use a very little.</li>
            <li>ordered this to help my teenage daughter relax so she could sleep better.</li>
            <li>It did not include any dropper, nor does it have a built in Euro dropper top, it has an open mouthed opening.</li>
            <li>I suspect it is not.include any dropper, nor does it have a built in Euro dropper top, it has an open mouthed opening.</li>
            <li>and I have found I can use it in so many different ways.</li>
            <li>I like this oil,  smells pretty.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty overpowering.</li>
            <li>First thing, the bottle was not packaged well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Essential oils have so many benefits that you can&#x27;t possibly run out of oil combinations or uses.</li>
            <li>I love lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>They smell pretty and it helps keep the fleas and ticks away.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to use this on my skin, but when I looked at the bottle, it said that the oil was too concentrated and was not recommended to be used on skin or for any internal purposes.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Lavender Essential Oils ranks as one of my favorite essential oils because of its many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Essentials is so confident with the quality of their essential oils that they offer a 100% guarantee.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I also put 6-7 drops on my air conditioner filter to make my entire house smell lovely.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this brand</li>
            <li>I used some in my daughters bath after having many nights in a row of waking in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>I love the lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>I love this French Lavender oil!</li>
            <li>I have to say I Love this essential oil.</li>
            <li>and I believe Sun Organic is the same quality or better.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops in my bath to help relax and get a good nights sleep.  </li>
            <li>We have 4 aromatherapy diffusers and French Lavender is my very favorite, so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase this Sun Essentials Lavender Essential Oil at a discounted price for evaluation and testing I quickly agreed.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty powerful for 1 drop, but now 2 hours later, it is a very mild scent.</li>
            <li>the cap was loose on the bottle and the contents saturated not only the bag it was shipped it but other important mail also...not happy!</li>
            <li>This essential oil has a wonderful &amp;#34;Spa Quality&amp;#34; smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I got this item through AllStar reviewers with a big discount which was a great way for me to try this new (to me) brand of essential oil.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>Worth mentioning is also, the nice smell &#x27;lingers&#x27; even a few hours after the diffuser is done and</li>
            <li>This product smells just as good as the way more expensive ones I have bought and it is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Well to start you want to buy good quality oils such as Sun Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to beginners with essential oil aromatherapy,  since you do get a good amount, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Will definitely keep them in mind the next time I need a good quality oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I would have preferred if they included a glass dropper built right into the lid of the bottle (like many other companies include).  </li>
            <li>It has a very pure lavender scent and seems much better than some of the other &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; oils I have bought.  </li>
            <li>Neither the bottle nor the description claim that this is organic, neither did I see anything in either the description or the bottle saying whether this is 100% pure Lavender EO or not.  </li>
            <li>Neither the bottle nor the description claim that this is organic, neither did I see anything in either the description or the bottle saying whether this is 100% pure Lavender EO or not.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend when using in a diffuser, I would use it in a large room.</li>
            <li>I like the large bottle and the plastic dropper</li>
            <li>I doubt this is pure and organic.</li>
            <li>I had a small burn and used it on the area where the hot water splashed and it kept it from blistering, many uses!</li>
            <li>Large amount for  a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Does not take much to cover the area.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much else about oils</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this, it is very relaxing</li>
            <li>I used it in my bath and was very relaxing.</li>
            <li>When i got the oil it had spilled out and the boytle was very slippery.</li>
            <li>I wish it came with a dropper to help control how much is used at one time.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy experimenting with different scents.</li>
            <li>You use this very sparingly, I dab some on a cotton ball to rid odors.</li>
            <li>This helps so much.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast reliable seller</li>
            <li>Does not smell light French lavender.</li>
            <li>and she slept really well too.</li>
            <li>I have started making my own baby wipes at home and add a few drops of this to them, I put a few drops of it in my kids bath water to help them calm down and relax for bed time, I have added it to coconut oil and used it as a healing ointment for my husbands aching feet and so many more things.</li>
            <li>It was shipped to Colorado where due to the altitude many liquid items tend to leak upon arrival.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands that are more pricey</li>
            <li>I own a very small diffuser and, with other products it pretty much works only on one room, but with this one, it makes my whole house smell nice.</li>
            <li>If you are less than satisfied you can request a refund, anytime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love to open the bottle and inhale deeply, mmmm!</li>
            <li>For this oil, I added a few drops in a spray bottle with some water and the good night essential oil.</li>
            <li>I love this French Lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>I noticed that other reviewers were saying is that that lavendar oil was not certified as organic and that is very true.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend</li>
            <li>Highly concentrated though</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This one is high quality and I will order again soon.</li>
            <li>ALSO I bought a set of wool Dryer Balls and love to put a few drops on them before drying clothes....</li>
            <li>The scent definitely does not make me smile anymore.</li>
            <li>I will continue to place a few drops on my pillow case once a week. :)</li>
            <li>I have found that it has helped me to get to sleep faster than I normally would.  </li>
            <li>I put a few drops on my pillow and it helped to relax me and get a better nights sleep.</li>
            <li>and I found it more oily than my other Lavender Oils, so I&#x27;m going to clean that diffuser tonight before switching back to the oil I brought back from France.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I found it more oily than my other Lavender Oils, so I&#x27;m going to clean that diffuser tonight before switching back to the oil I brought back from France.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product smells watered down and it takes more of it to make the product smell than thr Young living does.</li>
            <li>, I put a dab on the toilet paper cardboard, so every time you spin the toilet paper you get a refreshing lavender scent.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using this product and would like to try other oils.</li>
            <li>you live, you learn.</li>
            <li>I find new uses evryday and look forward to them.</li>
            <li>You only need to put a drop or two on each one and it makes your laundry smell amazing without having to use any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>love Sun Essentials French Lavender Essential Oil, and use it in my bedroom diffuser on a regular basis in the evening to promote relaxation and help me fall asleep.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with essential oils</li>
            <li>Also, I received this essential oil earlier than expected which was nice.</li>
            <li>This essential oil is true to the French lavender aroma.</li>
            <li>My burn healed quickly and peeling was minimal.</li>
            <li>if you spill it anywhere that will be a huge plus instead of a mess.  </li>
            <li>Usually a bottle this big costs a whole lot more... From what I know of.</li>
            <li>In the product i received there is no sentence as &amp;#34;100% pure and organic essential oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I had received was broken and they sent me a new one super fast.  </li>
            <li>he was complaining that it was burning, so I would warn others with any skin issues to take caution when using directly on skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have when making my natural hair products.</li>
            <li>I have not had much background with essential oils</li>
            <li>I had a pimple that was just starting, I applied this to it and it really took the pain away overnight.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend Sun Essentials French Lavender Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Placing a bit of this essential oil on my wrists has a very calming effect.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of lavender and I buy lavender essential oil every few months because I use it a lot.</li>
            <li>Normally I like Sun Essential Oils</li>
            <li>I have used it around the house to see if it would calm the pets down.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting with that pleasant lavender smell with slight undertones of the slightly woody smell the plant has.  </li>
            <li>Sun Organics provides a high quality long lasting essential oil at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I have not used essential oils in the past, but was given an opportunity to try this out for free</li>
            <li>I opened a new bottle of a different brand of Lavender Essential Oil that I bought here in the US to compare it to that brand --</li>
            <li>One of my sons has night terrors and they have lessened since beginning using Lavender, my other son we just switched him from a crib to a real bed</li>
            <li>This has SUCH a weak fragrance compared to the high quality fragrances that are available for similar prices.</li>
            <li>I suspect these oils have been diluted and are not pure 100% pure therapeutic organic essential oils in which ad states.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li>So needless to say i am thrilled i found essential oils.</li>
            <li>So far no major complaints this bottle should last forever.</li>
            <li>The scent still goes through the baggy, but it&#x27;s a whole lot less smell that escapes from it.</li>
            <li>In general I&#x27;m not a big fan of french anything - french vanilla,</li>

            <li> It smells nice and works well in a warmer</li>
            <li> my review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> size is perfect since you don&#x27;t have to use too much as it is highly concentrated.  </li>
            <li> so it leaked and all of our mail that day smelled very strongly of the product.</li>
            <li> It is very strong smelling</li>
            <li> Many uses and my fav is to add it tou floor cleaner and makes my house smell amazing and fresh!!!  </li>
            <li> Smells good not as strong as pure lavender but good for diffusing and soaps and lotions!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best smelling lavender oil!  </li>
            <li> I have a sleep disorder, so this has been awesome, thus far.</li>
            <li> We used it to help make the whole house smell good!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of essential oils, they smell great, work great, and are a great price with fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent.  </li>
            <li> not as strong as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> The bottle does not have a dropper top but it comes with a separate pipette.</li>
            <li> The oil is nice quality too, smells genuine and refreshing.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying more stuff with it.</li>
            <li> My entire house smells wonderful from this being used in just one room.</li>
            <li> Many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> Maybe it smells better after you add water to it.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure which was the source.</li>
            <li> That means you will either need to have a spare dropper on hand or buy one, because otherwise you won&#x27;t be able to measure out the correct number of drops to use in your diffuser.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s ok for diffusion, but I wasn&#x27;t overly pleased by it&#x27;s fragrance</li>

            <li> Lavender can be used for SO many things.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love oil?  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it smells better after you add water to it.</li>
            <li> I believe that they could work a bit more in sealing the bottle a bit better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I wish that the bottle had a stopper at the top.</li>
            <li> So many uses, where do you begin.</li>
            <li> I love to have a lavender mist and use it just before bedtime on my pillows.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my sheets and clothing smell.</li>
            <li> I love lavender.</li>
            <li> The packaging could be better.</li>
            <li> And it appears that they have a more restful sleep.  </li>
            <li> My favorite use for this oil is to mix it with tea tree and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I received this oil to review and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is refreshing when using that room.</li>

            <li> The top and safety seal are still in tact.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use this for making bath salts :)</li>
            <li> I have been putting a cotton ball soaked in it under my pillow at night and have been sleeping much better.</li>
            <li> Lavender is just one of those smells that most people love.</li>
            <li> I love to put a drop of this in my bath water to help me relax.</li>
            <li> But, at this great price I can&#x27;t complain too much :)</li>
            <li> I love the</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am able to put the oil in a warmer and or my humidifier</li>
            <li> I think it is a great deal but really wished the bottle had a dropper because pour it seemed to get everywhere .</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the 2oz</li>
            <li> is quite a bit more than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> So who dosen&#x27;t love lavender?  </li>
            <li> The 2oz size does not come with a dropper top.  </li>
            <li> Use it for so many things, relaxation, sunburns, and love to diffuse.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is like many others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> It did come with a separate plastic dropper that you insert into the bottle, squeeze the top</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this.</li>

            <li> Love the smell of the lavender and vanilla.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do wish there was a stopper in the top of the bottle to control amount.</li>
            <li> Please check out Liberty Naturals for the best quality essential oils.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love the smell of lavender and this oil did not disappoint.</li>

            <li> perfect product especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem potent to me</li>
            <li> Very potent and brings total relaxation at night Great for the bath</li>
            <li> It smells great, plus I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Love the benefits and when used in a diffuser the smell isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> Love this, it smells heavenly, although I got this free for reviewing I will be pruchasing more.</li>
            <li> I inject this oil into wool dryer balls...works great as a natural dryer sheet!</li>
            <li> I am happy so far.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle and it had leaked out even with the plastic still securely wrapped around the top.</li>
            <li> A good portion leaked out and it was very slippery to unpack.  </li>
            <li> But other than that the oil is perfect!!</li>
            <li> The shipping on this product was very quick.</li>
            <li> The scent did appear to dissipate very quickly so every 4 days I had to redo some drops.</li>
            <li> instead there is a sticker as organic which can be easily removed and it is not as part of the product label.</li>
            <li> The lavendar oil was just way too strong for my nose to handle.</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked all over the envelope, so before I even opened it, I got an overwhelmingly strong smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are strong yet not choke and gag you strength.</li>
            <li> The scent was so strong I could smell it for a couple days after I threw the shipping bag in the trash.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell - not too sweet, not too strong.</li>
            <li> I drifted off to sleep within a half hour and had a great nights sleep!</li>
            <li> Is very strong so doesnt take very much.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product it smelled like bug spray and was very strong.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with some Jojoba oil to use as a moisturizer and was very pleased!</li>
            <li> I found out about this usage from another oil-loving mom and it has been a life saver (not to mention a HUGE money saver.)</li>
            <li> The postman must have been really relaxed the whole drive, LOL.</li>
            <li> 2oz of Lavender EO for $10.99 is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I received this free to try out and give my review of it</li>

            <li> I even used it in a NOW defuser and a couple drops in the water filled the house.</li>

            <li> I received this oil for free to try and review.</li>
            <li> It was packaged securely and included a pipette.</li>
            <li> The bottle is at a good price and is larger than most of the oils I buy.</li>
            <li> I use it on my pillows and have noticed it is so much easier to relax and sleep at night!!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, &amp; the scent is so strong, I could smell it before I opened the mail box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a very high quality essential oil, with many great uses.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it relaxes your whole body!</li>

            <li> It is such a pleasant and relaxing scent.</li>

            <li> I also have put it in my wax melter &amp;amp; my whole house smells like a beautiful field of French Lavender!</li>
            <li> Will not purchase from you again as Piping Rock and Planet Therapy are selling a superior product which I had purchased last year and again this year.</li>
            <li> I hope the lable is true to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> The bottle was still sealed but leaked a bit from the top so the whole package smelled heavenly.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t believe how fast it will heal and you won&#x27;t be able to tell where the sore was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into using essential oils and this was a good one to start with.</li>
            <li> The first I got was leaking when it arrived, so I contacted them and they very quickly got another sent out to me.</li>
            <li> I like that the package was shipped to me quickly, but I do no like it.</li>
            <li> V.light n quickly</li>
            <li> I will be repurchasing this item and many more of their essential oils.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it produced a mild, not unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I thought it produced a mild, not unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a very lovely essential oil.</li>
            <li> I am also very interested in using it to make candles.</li>
            <li> I quickly discovered the culprit as soon as I opened the first padded envelope though!</li>
            <li> It does very well in an aromatherapy diffuser, and mixes fairly easily with distilled water if you are using it as a spray to freshen up a room.</li>
            <li> I am not an avid user or essential oils, but would love to use them more.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve read that it helps calm the nerves.</li>
            <li> I have used it in distilled water to calm my temperamental child, in a diffuser to scent the house, homemade vinegar based cleaner, and in rice to make headache bags.  </li>
            <li> I also us it to help calm kitties who have anxiety.</li>
            <li> it WELL WORTH the price.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received it I put some in a spray bottle to use on my freshly cleaned bed linens.  </li>
            <li> Fresh lavender smell.</li>
            <li> Unlike many oils that use synthetic ingredients to produce what they believe lavender should smell like this company uses natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and well I didn&#x27;t get it at first, but I do sleep more sound not tossing and turning and waking in the middle of the night!</li>
            <li> but I find it to be just as good quality as other brands and would purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> It is powerful when first</li>
            <li> I added a few drops to my carpet cleaner and my room smells amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does come in a dark amber bottle to protect the oil from oxidation, which is good.  </li>
            <li> Keeps a nice scent for a long time.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;pure.&amp;#34; that&#x27;s fine if you are new to EOs and don&#x27;t understand dilutions, but for those looking for pure EOs, buy elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I really like these natural alternatives and plan on using more of their products.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different bottles of Sun Essential Oils and they are made of great quality.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of Lavender from Young Living and the smell is strong and concentrated.</li>
            <li> It had leaked during shipping but it was wrapped good so it didn&#x27;t make too much of a mess.  </li>
            <li> very high quality product!</li>
            <li> The product itself smells wonderful and you only have to use a very little.</li>
            <li> ordered this to help my teenage daughter relax so she could sleep better.</li>
            <li> It did not include any dropper, nor does it have a built in Euro dropper top, it has an open mouthed opening.</li>
            <li> I suspect it is not.include any dropper, nor does it have a built in Euro dropper top, it has an open mouthed opening.</li>
            <li> and I have found I can use it in so many different ways.</li>
            <li> I like this oil,  smells pretty.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty overpowering.</li>
            <li> First thing, the bottle was not packaged well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Essential oils have so many benefits that you can&#x27;t possibly run out of oil combinations or uses.</li>
            <li> I love lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> They smell pretty and it helps keep the fleas and ticks away.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to use this on my skin, but when I looked at the bottle, it said that the oil was too concentrated and was not recommended to be used on skin or for any internal purposes.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Lavender Essential Oils ranks as one of my favorite essential oils because of its many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Essentials is so confident with the quality of their essential oils that they offer a 100% guarantee.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I also put 6-7 drops on my air conditioner filter to make my entire house smell lovely.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this brand</li>
            <li> I used some in my daughters bath after having many nights in a row of waking in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I love this French Lavender oil!</li>
            <li> I have to say I Love this essential oil.</li>
            <li> and I believe Sun Organic is the same quality or better.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my bath to help relax and get a good nights sleep.  </li>
            <li> We have 4 aromatherapy diffusers and French Lavender is my very favorite, so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase this Sun Essentials Lavender Essential Oil at a discounted price for evaluation and testing I quickly agreed.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty powerful for 1 drop, but now 2 hours later, it is a very mild scent.</li>
            <li> the cap was loose on the bottle and the contents saturated not only the bag it was shipped it but other important mail also...not happy!</li>
            <li> This essential oil has a wonderful &amp;#34;Spa Quality&amp;#34; smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I got this item through AllStar reviewers with a big discount which was a great way for me to try this new (to me) brand of essential oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Worth mentioning is also, the nice smell &#x27;lingers&#x27; even a few hours after the diffuser is done and</li>
            <li> This product smells just as good as the way more expensive ones I have bought and it is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Well to start you want to buy good quality oils such as Sun Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to beginners with essential oil aromatherapy,  since you do get a good amount, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Will definitely keep them in mind the next time I need a good quality oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I would have preferred if they included a glass dropper built right into the lid of the bottle (like many other companies include).  </li>
            <li> It has a very pure lavender scent and seems much better than some of the other &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; oils I have bought.  </li>
            <li> Neither the bottle nor the description claim that this is organic, neither did I see anything in either the description or the bottle saying whether this is 100% pure Lavender EO or not.  </li>
            <li> Neither the bottle nor the description claim that this is organic, neither did I see anything in either the description or the bottle saying whether this is 100% pure Lavender EO or not.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend when using in a diffuser, I would use it in a large room.</li>
            <li> I like the large bottle and the plastic dropper</li>
            <li> I doubt this is pure and organic.</li>
            <li> I had a small burn and used it on the area where the hot water splashed and it kept it from blistering, many uses!</li>
            <li> Large amount for  a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Does not take much to cover the area.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much else about oils</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this, it is very relaxing</li>
            <li> I used it in my bath and was very relaxing.</li>
            <li> When i got the oil it had spilled out and the boytle was very slippery.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a dropper to help control how much is used at one time.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy experimenting with different scents.</li>
            <li> You use this very sparingly, I dab some on a cotton ball to rid odors.</li>
            <li> This helps so much.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast reliable seller</li>
            <li> Does not smell light French lavender.</li>
            <li> and she slept really well too.</li>
            <li> I have started making my own baby wipes at home and add a few drops of this to them, I put a few drops of it in my kids bath water to help them calm down and relax for bed time, I have added it to coconut oil and used it as a healing ointment for my husbands aching feet and so many more things.</li>
            <li> It was shipped to Colorado where due to the altitude many liquid items tend to leak upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands that are more pricey</li>
            <li> I own a very small diffuser and, with other products it pretty much works only on one room, but with this one, it makes my whole house smell nice.</li>
            <li> If you are less than satisfied you can request a refund, anytime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love to open the bottle and inhale deeply, mmmm!</li>
            <li> For this oil, I added a few drops in a spray bottle with some water and the good night essential oil.</li>
            <li> I love this French Lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I noticed that other reviewers were saying is that that lavendar oil was not certified as organic and that is very true.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend</li>
            <li> Highly concentrated though</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This one is high quality and I will order again soon.</li>
            <li> ALSO I bought a set of wool Dryer Balls and love to put a few drops on them before drying clothes....</li>
            <li> The scent definitely does not make me smile anymore.</li>
            <li> I will continue to place a few drops on my pillow case once a week. :)</li>
            <li> I have found that it has helped me to get to sleep faster than I normally would.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my pillow and it helped to relax me and get a better nights sleep.</li>
            <li> and I found it more oily than my other Lavender Oils, so I&#x27;m going to clean that diffuser tonight before switching back to the oil I brought back from France.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I found it more oily than my other Lavender Oils, so I&#x27;m going to clean that diffuser tonight before switching back to the oil I brought back from France.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product smells watered down and it takes more of it to make the product smell than thr Young living does.</li>
            <li> , I put a dab on the toilet paper cardboard, so every time you spin the toilet paper you get a refreshing lavender scent.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using this product and would like to try other oils.</li>
            <li> you live, you learn.</li>
            <li> I find new uses evryday and look forward to them.</li>
            <li> You only need to put a drop or two on each one and it makes your laundry smell amazing without having to use any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> love Sun Essentials French Lavender Essential Oil, and use it in my bedroom diffuser on a regular basis in the evening to promote relaxation and help me fall asleep.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with essential oils</li>
            <li> Also, I received this essential oil earlier than expected which was nice.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is true to the French lavender aroma.</li>
            <li> My burn healed quickly and peeling was minimal.</li>
            <li> if you spill it anywhere that will be a huge plus instead of a mess.  </li>
            <li> Usually a bottle this big costs a whole lot more... From what I know of.</li>
            <li> In the product i received there is no sentence as &amp;#34;100% pure and organic essential oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I had received was broken and they sent me a new one super fast.  </li>
            <li> he was complaining that it was burning, so I would warn others with any skin issues to take caution when using directly on skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have when making my natural hair products.</li>
            <li> I have not had much background with essential oils</li>
            <li> I had a pimple that was just starting, I applied this to it and it really took the pain away overnight.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend Sun Essentials French Lavender Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Placing a bit of this essential oil on my wrists has a very calming effect.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of lavender and I buy lavender essential oil every few months because I use it a lot.</li>
            <li> Normally I like Sun Essential Oils</li>
            <li> I have used it around the house to see if it would calm the pets down.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting with that pleasant lavender smell with slight undertones of the slightly woody smell the plant has.  </li>
            <li> Sun Organics provides a high quality long lasting essential oil at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I have not used essential oils in the past, but was given an opportunity to try this out for free</li>
            <li> I opened a new bottle of a different brand of Lavender Essential Oil that I bought here in the US to compare it to that brand --</li>
            <li> One of my sons has night terrors and they have lessened since beginning using Lavender, my other son we just switched him from a crib to a real bed</li>
            <li> This has SUCH a weak fragrance compared to the high quality fragrances that are available for similar prices.</li>
            <li> I suspect these oils have been diluted and are not pure 100% pure therapeutic organic essential oils in which ad states.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li> So needless to say i am thrilled i found essential oils.</li>
            <li> So far no major complaints this bottle should last forever.</li>
            <li> The scent still goes through the baggy, but it&#x27;s a whole lot less smell that escapes from it.</li>
            <li> In general I&#x27;m not a big fan of french anything - french vanilla,</li>
            <li> Other products of similar quality are FAR more expensive...</li>
            <li> I have a Rainbow vacuum cleaner and room freshener, and I use it in those also.</li>
            <li> This product has a long lasting scent.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong but not too faint either.</li>
            <li> I used it on some sores and chapped skin areas and within a few days all was healed and skin felt very soft with no scarring.</li>
            <li> so its hard for me to be around certain scents.</li>
            <li> Definitely different than the French Lavender Essential Oil I brought back from my visit to Bayons, France a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased them myself, but it is the only brand she has used for years and all my other essential oils smell</li>
            <li> Then you slowly squeeze it out and it comes out in drops much like a orifice reducer does.</li>
            <li> I am also waiting my shipment of 2 other oils and we shall see if of similar quality.</li>
            <li> Also, I have some medicated lotion that smells horrible: I added a few drops in the lotion and it smells great now!</li>
            <li> The cap must not have been on tight enough</li>
            <li> I had a really bad sunburn and was able to make a mix of this oil, peppermint, aloe, and cetaphil lotion</li>
            <li> The bottle inside was wrapped in wet bubble wrap which I carefully removed in case</li>
            <li> This made it even harder to control the amount that I was pouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which I partially think that Lavender helped with.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Helps with relaxing and calming down after a long day.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but as a massage therapist, both this essential oil and the grapefruit one are of a low essential oil (therapeutic) grade (hardly any smell!) and seem to be diluted with an oily filler that doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin, VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle had a dropper on the top because it is very difficult to just put a few drops in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> for no reason other than mark up.</li>
            <li> I would probably try other brands of lavender oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but it wasn&#x27;t similar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but the French Lavender I bought from the other brand smelled darned close to the Lavender Oil I brought back from France, but this definitely did not.  </li>
            <li> I would probably try other brands of lavender oil</li>
            <li> I applied 1 drop without carrier oil (just like I do with my other Lavender EO)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now going to have to try other oils in hopes they work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I am guessing due to the size of the bottle it does not come with a orifice reducer.</li>
            <li> When it arrived the bottle had leaked but other</li>
            <li> Only issue was it leaked a small amount into the packaging.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they could prevent that but was a tiny inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I also apply small dabs to my temples and behind my ears right before I lay down to go to sleep.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve added some to cotton balls and left in a bathroom that gets poor ventilation and is hard to get that bathroom odor out of.</li>
            <li> I put it on satchels to put in drawers and down in my cellar.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, when I recieved the package, it seemed like some of the oil just spilt.</li>
            <li> just so bland in comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not true lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I am not an essential oil snob, but a lady I make soap with had a few other lavenders for me to smell for comparison and next to these, this product is just WEAK!!</li>
            <li> She rubs a little on the soles of her feet and some on her temples before bed.</li>
            <li> I might save a little money.</li>
            <li> I sprinkle a little on my pillow and it helps me to get to sleep.</li>
            <li> Some lavendar scented things smell amazing, but this was the worst.</li>
            <li> I have now bought a few oils from Sun Organics and will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I can only give it 3 stars because when I recieved the bottle the seal was broken and it had leaked all over.</li>
            <li> I could smell the lavender quite a few feet from my mailbox.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sun Essentials Lavender on my boys for a few weeks now during bed time.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t lose a lot of the product, but it was messy.</li>
            <li> I also like to add a few drops to my laundry during the rinse cycle, place a few drops in my clothing drawers, and drop a few drops on my pillow at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more purchase for this, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> However, it is not nearly as strong as some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Very weak, I compared this &amp;#34;100% essential oil&amp;#34; to  some that I already had.</li>
            <li> It arrived last evening, and I feel sorry for my mail carrier because he&#x27;s going to have some explaining to do to his wife when he gets home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not nearly as appealing and not as floral.  </li>
            <li> Put a few drops on my pillow case and slept like a baby!</li>
            <li> I thought is was way over powering when opened and poured, but with just a small amount, the scent is manageable.</li>
            <li> I place it in my diffuser in my office and no more agitated students, employees or parents.</li>
            <li> It is hard to pour just a small amount.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on using it, so that sucks.</li>
            <li> and it sucks up some oil into the dropper.</li>
            <li> next thing I noticed about the lavender oil was that it had a somewhat unpleasant medicinal smell that overwhelmed the floral notes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I lost a little money . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker and sometimes I smoke indoors, but with this product, I am never afraid that my house will have that nasty cigarette smell.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was shipped in a envelope package instead of a box, so the seal was broken &amp; the product leaked a little.</li>
            <li> there was a broken bottle inside,  but the bottle was intact and capped.</li>
            <li> The packaging was not great</li>
            <li> Not good for diffuser use!</li>
            <li> I also bought the ylang yang and it is also very weak.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical since I had never ordered oils online before.  </li>
            <li> I have even been making my household bathroom and window cleaners as I hate the smell of the chemicals that may found in everyday products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would give it a try, but I&#x27;m sad to say that I did not like it.</li>
            <li> As I used the product I got used to the smell and needless to say it worked wonders!</li>
            <li> Very faint scent.</li>
            <li> Very faint scent of lavender.</li>
            <li> I have extremely bad anxiety.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful!  </li>
            <li> The smell is awful!  </li>
            <li> I add it to our clothes, homemade room spray, bug repellent, everything!</li>
            <li> The smell is also worst it doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender.</li>

            <li> I inject this oil into wool dryer balls...works great as a natural dryer sheet!</li>
            <li> Diluted with a carrier oil. ( I make skin products.) Very faint scent. I have now bought a few oils from Sun Organics and will never buy again. Bogus.</li>
            <li> 2oz of Lavender EO for $10.99 is a fantastic deal. The bottle does not have a dropper top but it comes with a separate pipette. I use lavender oil for skin, hair care, and aromatherapy. So getting it in a 2oz bottle is great cause I won&#x27;t run out any time soon. The oil is nice quality too, smells genuine and refreshing. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Large amount for  a reasonable price. I&#x27;d recommend. Other products of similar quality are FAR more expensive...for no reason other than mark up.</li>
            <li> Not true lavender oil. I emailed about returning and did not receive a reply.</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but as a massage therapist, both this essential oil and the grapefruit one are of a low essential oil (therapeutic) grade (hardly any smell!) and seem to be diluted with an oily filler that doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin, VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the NOW oils as a cost effective alternative.</li>
            <li> This oil has almost no smell</li>
            <li> Not strong enough. I put it in my diffuser and could not smell it at all. Disapointed.</li>
            <li> Revised review.  This product smells great in the bottle but not when used to spray.  Cannot smell at all.  Also, lid broke the second time opened.  Will probably purchase different brand next time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet, but scent from bottle is very nice.</li>
            <li> I used this to make a bug spray. my husband said it worked well and smelled really good. :) Looking forward to trying more stuff with it.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product. My entire house smells wonderful from this being used in just one room. Many compliments. Does not take much to cover the area. Recommend</li>
            <li> Lovely smell - not too sweet, not too strong. Works great in my diffuser!</li>
            <li> Smells good not as strong as pure lavender but good for diffusing and soaps and lotions!</li>
            <li> When the oil was delivered, I left it in my basement by accident. The next morning when I went downstairs, my basement smelled HEAVENLY!! I have also used it in my diffuser and it was a very pleasant experience. I will definitely reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.. I have been putting a couple drops in batha, adding some to laundry.I love this oil</li>
            <li> Very weak, I compared this &amp;#34;100% essential oil&amp;#34; to  some that I already had. This oil is obviously diluted with something. I also bought the ylang yang and it is also very weak.</li>
            <li> My mailbox smelled heavenly when pulling out my mail.  I knew immediately that I got my lavender oil.  The 2 oz. size is perfect since you don&#x27;t have to use too much as it is highly concentrated.  No stopper to control amount, but if you spill it anywhere that will be a huge plus instead of a mess.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it everywhere!  But I would definitely diffuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, 2 weeks later.  The smell is awful!  It smells good when it&#x27;s on the bottle, but when you apply it. it smells like burnt wood.  Maybe it smells better after you add water to it. I would probably try other brands of lavender oil but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> very high quality product! The first I got was leaking when it arrived, so I contacted them and they very quickly got another sent out to me. Very nice scent, very pleasant and a good quality oil!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!  I will be purchasing this in the future.  I mixed it with some Jojoba oil to use as a moisturizer and was very pleased!</li>
            <li> I can only give it 3 stars because when I recieved the bottle the seal was broken and it had leaked all over. I could smell the lavender quite a few feet from my mailbox.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this to help my teenage daughter relax so she could sleep better. She has tried what was left of the bottle and it seems to be helping. She rubs a little on the soles of her feet and some on her temples before bed.</li>
            <li> We have 4 aromatherapy diffusers and French Lavender is my very favorite, so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase this Sun Essentials Lavender Essential Oil at a discounted price for evaluation and testing I quickly agreed.  It arrived last evening, and I feel sorry for my mail carrier because he&#x27;s going to have some explaining to do to his wife when he gets home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened my mail box I could smell Lavender, but I had two packaging envelopes and three boxes so I wasn&#x27;t sure which was the source. I quickly discovered the culprit as soon as I opened the first padded envelope though! Lavender oil spilled from the envelope all over my hands, counter and blouse. The bottle inside was wrapped in wet bubble wrap which I carefully removed in case there was a broken bottle inside,  but the bottle was intact and capped. The cap must not have been on tight enough I guess and about 1/3 of the liquid had spilled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed about the lavender oil was that it had a somewhat unpleasant medicinal smell that overwhelmed the floral notes. I washed my hands, the bottle, the counter, and changed my clothes and came back a bit later to sniff it again with my nostrils cleared.  Definitely different than the French Lavender Essential Oil I brought back from my visit to Bayons, France a few months ago. Not nearly as appealing and not as floral.  I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but it wasn&#x27;t similar.  I opened a new bottle of a different brand of Lavender Essential Oil that I bought here in the US to compare it to that brand -- I&#x27;m sorry, but the French Lavender I bought from the other brand smelled darned close to the Lavender Oil I brought back from France, but this definitely did not.  I realize that smell can be subjective,  so you may find this brand pleasing, but I can only tell you that in all honesty that I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come in a dark amber bottle to protect the oil from oxidation, which is good.  It did not include any dropper, nor does it have a built in Euro dropper top, it has an open mouthed opening. That means you will either need to have a spare dropper on hand or buy one, because otherwise you won&#x27;t be able to measure out the correct number of drops to use in your diffuser. If you try to pour it into your diffuser you&#x27;ll pour too much and waste product as well as probably clog up your diffuser, so please don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try three drops of this Lavender Essential Oil in one of my diffusers last night and I thought it produced a mild, not unpleasant fragrance. The bottle cautions that this product is for aromatherapy diffusers only so don&#x27;t use it for massage or to add to your bath water. I suppose it&#x27;s ok for diffusion, but I wasn&#x27;t overly pleased by it&#x27;s fragrance and I found it more oily than my other Lavender Oils, so I&#x27;m going to clean that diffuser tonight before switching back to the oil I brought back from France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company should improve the packaging to prevent spillage and include either a Euro dropper cap or a dropper to enable the consumer to dispense the product once they receive it. Neither the bottle nor the description claim that this is organic, neither did I see anything in either the description or the bottle saying whether this is 100% pure Lavender EO or not.  Based on the scent and oiliness I suspect it is not.include any dropper, nor does it have a built in Euro dropper top, it has an open mouthed opening.

            <li> Lavender can be used for SO many things. I received this free to try out and give my review of it and I have found I can use it in so many different ways. I have started making my own baby wipes at home and add a few drops of this to them, I put a few drops of it in my kids bath water to help them calm down and relax for bed time, I have added it to coconut oil and used it as a healing ointment for my husbands aching feet and so many more things. This stuff it WELL WORTH the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Put a few drops on my pillow case and slept like a baby!</li>
            <li> Excellent.... I have a defuse and It&#x27;s perfect.... ALSO I bought a set of wool Dryer Balls and love to put a few drops on them before drying clothes.... Highly reccomend</li>
            <li> I got this free from AllStar reviews , really happy with the product. Arrived on time , good packaging, lavender is in its best aroma.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love oil?  I absolutely love the smell.  The aroma instantly calms and soothes.  Highly concentrated though so I would diffuse it.  No stopper to control the amount.  But the 2 oz. bottle will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, 2 weeks later.  The smell is awful!  It smells good when it&#x27;s on the bottle, but when you apply it. it smells like burnt wood.  Maybe it smells better after you add water to it. I would probably try other brands of lavender oil but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again. The scent definitely does not make me smile anymore.</li>
            <li> I like this oil,  smells pretty.  I don&#x27;t know much else about oils but i like it.</li>
            <li> I got this item through AllStar reviewers with a big discount which was a great way for me to try this new (to me) brand of essential oil. In general I&#x27;m not a big fan of french anything - french vanilla, french lavender - but in this case I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I received it yesterday and it came packaged in an bubble envelope. Once I opened the envelope, I saw that it included a pipette dropper which was a big plus for me. The packaging was done properly but, once I removed the bottle from it&#x27;s bubble wrap, I noticed that it was oily on the outside. I believe that they could work a bit more in sealing the bottle a bit better. The product itself, I love it! I used it immediately in my oil diffuser and my house never smelled so good. I own a very small diffuser and, with other products it pretty much works only on one room, but with this one, it makes my whole house smell nice. I&#x27;m a smoker and sometimes I smoke indoors, but with this product, I am never afraid that my house will have that nasty cigarette smell. Worth mentioning is also, the nice smell &#x27;lingers&#x27; even a few hours after the diffuser is done and the windows are open. Again, another big plus.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Allstar Reviewers.  I was skeptical since I had never ordered oils online before.  However, I am impressed by the quality of this oil and the scent is amazing.  It has a very pure lavender scent and seems much better than some of the other &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; oils I have bought.  I am happy so far.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this, it is very relaxing BUT it did leak in the packaging alittle bit so all my mail smelled. It was pretty overpowering. Ater we cleaned up the bottle, it was great to dab on all of our bed pillows....such a great night sleep.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the same as the 4 oz bottle but somehow it does not have the same scent.  It has a very light scent.  Normally I like Sun Essential Oils but, this bottle is just okay.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided</li>
            <li> *i received this for reviewing purchase&lt;br /&gt;Great oil, perfect for diffusing around bedtime to get everyone to sleep</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in my difusser and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Great product at an even better price. This product smells just as good as the way more expensive ones I have bought and it is a fraction of the price. I have used it around the house to see if it would calm the pets down.  I even used it in a NOW defuser and a couple drops in the water filled the house. It has a calming effect and seems like it is going to last forever. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a while.. I used in my arm and pillow before I go to bed !&lt;br /&gt;Nice stuff</li>
            <li> I love this product.  As soon as I received it I put some in a spray bottle to use on my freshly cleaned bed linens.  It helps with a relaxing sleep.  I also use it in my bath.  We have been innundated with mosquitos this summer and I am spraying the areas where they might come into the house.  My understanding is that they don&#x27;t like the smell.  Many uses for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> First thing, the bottle was not packaged well. When I opened the package, there was oil all in the envelope. I did not care for the scent. I thought is was way over powering when opened and poured, but with just a small amount, the scent is manageable. I would recommend when using in a diffuser, I would use it in a large room. I wish that the bottle had a stopper at the top. It is hard to pour just a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have recently started introducing essential oils into my household. I use the oils in a diffuser, make my soaps and sugar scrubs. I have even been making my household bathroom and window cleaners as I hate the smell of the chemicals that may found in everyday products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils have so many benefits that you can&#x27;t possibly run out of oil combinations or uses. So many uses, where do you begin. Well to start you want to buy good quality oils such as Sun Essential Oils. Then you can pick whatever oils that work for you and whatever you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;French Lavender Essential Oil has been known to help with sleep support, brain and memory support, stress and mood management, digestive health and for use pre, during and post-pregnancy. I love to have a lavender mist and use it just before bedtime on my pillows. The smell of French Lavender is so relaxing that bedtime is a pleasure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a 2 oz bottle of Sun Essential French Lavender Oil and I was not monetarily compensated for my review.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent and soothing and calming loved it.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and has many uses. I have not used essential oils in the past, but was given an opportunity to try this out for free so I gave it a chance. The packaging was not great so it leaked and all of our mail that day smelled very strongly of the product. I used it in my bath and was very relaxing. However, my son wanted to try it in his bath and after about 5 minutes he was complaining that it was burning, so I would warn others with any skin issues to take caution when using directly on skin. It is very strong smelling and I have used it as an air freshener. Also, I have some medicated lotion that smells horrible: I added a few drops in the lotion and it smells great now! I would recommend the product, but again, take caution of any skin conditions, especially if you tend to have allergies!</li>
            <li> I love lavender essential oil. This brand has a beautiful fragrance. It&#x27;s a must have when making my natural hair products.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing I love it!</li>
            <li> When i got the oil it had spilled out and the boytle was very slippery. The scent was so overpowering that it gave me and my husband headaches</li>
            <li> This is a very lovely essential oil. Dropped some on  balled up sock and use it in  place of drier sheets. Love how it makes my sheets and clothing smell.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to test and give my honest opinion on.  I am not an avid user or essential oils, but would love to use them more.  The pros are...&lt;br /&gt;1) This product has a nice aroma.&lt;br /&gt;2) Created a nice smell throughout the room when used in a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons...&lt;br /&gt;1) The oil had leaked out during shipping, even with it being bubble wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;2) There was no stopper in the bottle to control the amount of liquid was being poured out.&lt;br /&gt;3) I did not receive a separate pipette as others claimed they had.  This made it even harder to control the amount that I was pouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the smell was nice and I enjoy using this product and would like to try other oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve read that it helps calm the nerves. I have always needed help sleeping. I have these panic attacks and need something to help me relax. I used this product by soaking it a cotton and putting it under my pillow. It has done wonders. I am also very interested in using it to make candles. That is my next project and I will let you know how it goes!!</li>
            <li> Smells great. I used it to spray in my daughters room. It works great</li>
            <li> I have used lavender oil for years and this is one of the best I have used. I use it for the bug bites my grandkids get and it worked great.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! I could smell it before I even opened the package. I love lavender. It&#x27;s works great for getting a good nights sleep. I also use it on my dogs. They smell pretty and it helps keep the fleas and ticks away. I wish it came with a dropper to help control how much is used at one time. The packaging could be better. When I received mine I found the reason I could smell it so well before opening the package was because the bottle had leaked. Overall I would definitely buy this lavender again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sun Essentials Lavender on my boys for a few weeks now during bed time.  And it appears that they have a more restful sleep.  One of my sons has night terrors and they have lessened since beginning using Lavender, my other son we just switched him from a crib to a real bed and I have had zero problem with him getting out of bed. Which I partially think that Lavender helped with.</li>
            <li> the cap was loose on the bottle and the contents saturated not only the bag it was shipped it but other important mail also...not happy!</li>
            <li> Alright, so I ordered this thinking I would give it a try, but I&#x27;m sad to say that I did not like it. For some odd reason, when I recieved the package, it seemed like some of the oil just spilt. The lavendar oil was just way too strong for my nose to handle. The scent gave me an instant headache and made me want to puke. Some lavendar scented things smell amazing, but this was the worst. I could not stand it, so I had to put it in a baggy. The scent still goes through the baggy, but it&#x27;s a whole lot less smell that escapes from it. I thought I would be able to use this on my skin, but when I looked at the bottle, it said that the oil was too concentrated and was not recommended to be used on skin or for any internal purposes. I like that the package was shipped to me quickly, but I do no like it. Something else I noticed that other reviewers were saying is that that lavendar oil was not certified as organic and that is very true. Some people got a bottle that had a sticker saying it was organic, but mine didn&#x27;t even have that. I don&#x27;t plan on using it, so that sucks. I only gave two stars because of shipping speed and the price for the amount of product that comes in he bottle. Usually a bottle this big costs a whole lot more... From what I know of.</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked all over the envelope, so before I even opened it, I got an overwhelmingly strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;It did smell good, but the over abundance was making me sick.&lt;br /&gt;Not really a fair review though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE lavender oils! My favorite use for this oil is to mix it with tea tree and coconut oil. This mixture helps take away my daughters diaper rash better than ANY cream I&#x27;ve ever used! I found out about this usage from another oil-loving mom and it has been a life saver (not to mention a HUGE money saver.) This is a MUST-HAVE for your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Received this product faster than was told. The product itself smells wonderful and you only have to use a very little. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I received this oil to review and I love the smell. My only concern was it was not packaged well and leaked a bit. So far I&#x27;ve added some to cotton balls and left in a bathroom that gets poor ventilation and is hard to get that bathroom odor out of. The lavender scent is refreshing when using that room. I would recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> This essential oil is true to the French lavender aroma. It does very well in an aromatherapy diffuser, and mixes fairly easily with distilled water if you are using it as a spray to freshen up a room. It does come with a plastic pipette in ml measurements, so that you can get precise amounts for your projects. I definitely recommend this to beginners with essential oil aromatherapy,  since you do get a good amount, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Do not like the smell at all! Doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender, perhaps that is why the price is so low. Will not purchase from you again as Piping Rock and Planet Therapy are selling a superior product which I had purchased last year and again this year. I only purchased this thinking I might save a little money. Unfortunately for me, I lost a little money . . . you live, you learn.</li>
            <li> I love this product however when I received it 1/4 of it had leaked out. The top and safety seal are still in tact.</li>
            <li> great value and quality for the price. will buy again</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Many uses and my fav is to add it tou floor cleaner and makes my house smell amazing and fresh!!!  Great for burns and many other uses!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It had leaked during shipping but it was wrapped good so it didn&#x27;t make too much of a mess.  I plan to use this for making bath salts :)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!! This product!! I add it to our clothes, homemade room spray, bug repellent, everything! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Spilled in the package.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotional item, for a fair feedback.  I have not had much background with essential oils so I did a bit of research on the uses for this. It said that it was good for acne, so I had a pimple that was just starting, I applied this to it and it really took the pain away overnight. I have been putting a cotton ball soaked in it under my pillow at night and have been sleeping much better. I really like these natural alternatives and plan on using more of their products.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best smelling lavender oil!  The first bottle I had received was broken and they sent me a new one super fast.  I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Lavender is just one of those smells that most people love. I have been using essential oils for a while now and I really enjoy experimenting with different scents. I have a lot of different bottles of Sun Essential Oils and they are made of great quality. I have not had any problem with any of the scents. You only have to use a couple of drops to get the effect that you are after. I received this for free for testing and unbiased opinion. This is my opinion and mine only. I love to put a drop of this in my bath water to help me relax.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I got this for free and iLove this stuff. It smells amazing. Is very strong so doesnt take very much. We used it to help make the whole house smell good!</li>
            <li> Lavender Essential Oils ranks as one of my favorite essential oils because of its many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender Essential Oil Provides Relief From:&lt;br /&gt;stress&lt;br /&gt;headaches&lt;br /&gt;sunburn&lt;br /&gt;insomnia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender Essential Oil Increases:&lt;br /&gt;relaxation&lt;br /&gt;calmness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Sun Essentials French Lavender Essential Oil, and use it in my bedroom diffuser on a regular basis in the evening to promote relaxation and help me fall asleep. I also like to add a few drops to my laundry during the rinse cycle, place a few drops in my clothing drawers, and drop a few drops on my pillow at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise against ingesting this oil in any way as Sun Essential Oils puts a warning on the bottle that indicates &amp;#34;not for internal use.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sun Essentials French Lavender Oil comes in a 2oz bottle with a plastic pipette.  I appreciate that the company included a pipette but I would have preferred if they included a glass dropper built right into the lid of the bottle (like many other companies include).  But, at this great price I can&#x27;t complain too much :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very high quality essential oil, with many great uses. I would absolutely recommend Sun Essentials French Lavender Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sun Essentials is so confident with the quality of their essential oils that they offer a 100% guarantee. If you are less than satisfied you can request a refund, anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Received for free for review smells incredible in my diffuser and i use in my soaps, scrubs i make, incredible oil love it.</li>
            <li> Are you into essential oils? Me too! I have several but did not have the French Lavender scent! Oh my goodness! It is such a pleasant and relaxing scent. I place it in my diffuser in my office and no more agitated students, employees or parents. Aromatherapy works folks! Try this scent! I definitely will be re-ordering! A+</li>
            <li> Love this brand of essential oils, they smell great, work great, and are a great price with fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great value essential oil. I love the was this smells. It works with my diffuser and as an additive to my carrier oil for massage. So far no major complaints this bottle should last forever.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described. The only problem was that the seal on the bottle leaked during transit. I didn&#x27;t lose a lot of the product, but it was messy.</li>
            <li> You use this very sparingly, I dab some on a cotton ball to rid odors. It has tons of medicinal uses I can&#x27;t wait to try. I add some to my potpourri to freshen it up and of course use it in the diffuser. I had a small burn and used it on the area where the hot water splashed and it kept it from blistering, many uses!</li>
            <li> I received this oil for free to review. I love it. It smells so good. I have asthma so its hard for me to be around certain scents. So needless to say i am thrilled i found essential oils. They are strong yet not choke and gag you strength. I am able to put the oil in a warmer and or my humidifier and my whole house is delightful for hours on end. I find new uses evryday and look forward to them.</li>
            <li> This product has a long lasting scent.  I have put in on my pillow cases to help me sleep at night, I put a dab on the toilet paper cardboard, so every time you spin the toilet paper you get a refreshing lavender scent. I&#x27;ve even rubbed on my sore back to help alleviate discomfort  I will order this awesome oil again from Sun Organic.  It was shipped quickly and wrapped securely.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this product was very quick. I got it within 3 days of ordering it. The bottle is at a good price and is larger than most of the oils I buy. It is not intended to use internally and I found out that it kind of burns on my hands. I spilled it when trying to put it in my infuser. The smell is great but I also noticed that it worked longer if dropped on paper rather than in an infuser. The scent did appear to dissipate very quickly so every 4 days I had to redo some drops. I think it is a great deal but really wished the bottle had a dropper because pour it seemed to get everywhere . I got this free to review from all star reviewers.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders! I love the smell and it relaxes your whole body!</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, and it has so many uses!  I put a few drops in my bath to help relax and get a good nights sleep.  I also put 6-7 drops on my air conditioner filter to make my entire house smell lovely. I have a Rainbow vacuum cleaner and room freshener, and I use it in those also.</li>
            <li> Great oil!  I love the scent and the 2oz is quite a bit more than I thought it would be.  It&#x27;s been great for baths and I used some on my pillow case to help me relax while in bed.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great oil, calming, soothing scent.</li>
            <li> O.K. So who dosen&#x27;t love lavender?  I like purchasing this 2 ounce bottle because I use a lot of lavender. I love to open the bottle and inhale deeply, mmmm! Smells so good! This brand is a test for me I hope the lable is true to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> It is an organic Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I my opinion, that company is the best</li>
            <li> Not good for diffuser use! No scent! Probably for skin use only.</li>
            <li> I have extremely bad anxiety. This helps so much. Extremely fast reliable seller</li>
            <li> I would recommend this.  I was expecting a miracle night of sleep and well I didn&#x27;t get it at first, but I do sleep more sound not tossing and turning and waking in the middle of the night! I will continue to place a few drops on my pillow case once a week. :)</li>
            <li> The 2oz size does not come with a dropper top.  There was no pipette as another customer received.  As I have used essential oils for years, I have extra bottles with dropper tops.  But this may be a big issue for some people!  The scent is great IMO.  Probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to help me relax so I can fall asleep faster.  I apply a small dab into a hot washcloth and breath it in at night after washing my face.  I also apply small dabs to my temples and behind my ears right before I lay down to go to sleep.  I have found that it has helped me to get to sleep faster than I normally would.  I have a sleep disorder, so this has been awesome, thus far.</li>
            <li> Can never have enough lavender!!!!  Use it for so many things, relaxation, sunburns, and love to diffuse.  A must have!!!</li>
            <li> Truely amazing it smells sooooo good, very pleasant fragrance! V.light n quickly observe!&lt;br /&gt;I got this in exchange of review this product but opinion is my own!</li>
            <li> I buy oils from several different places as i make Organic skin care products.  I have a bottle of Lavender from Young Living and the smell is strong and concentrated. This product smells watered down and it takes more of it to make the product smell than thr Young living does. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this! Fresh lavender smell. Helps with relaxing and calming down after a long day. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Placing a bit of this essential oil on my wrists has a very calming effect.  I also have put it in my wax melter &amp;amp; my whole house smells like a beautiful field of French Lavender!</li>
            <li> I received this lavender essential oil to review. It came wrapped, and in a plastic zip bag but the bottle had opened and some had leaked out. I could smell it in the mailbox. The scent was so strong I could smell it for a couple days after I threw the shipping bag in the trash. It is a good product and has a lovely scent that I use for relaxation. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> When I received the package the bottle had leaked everywhere. But I love the scent!! I put it on satchels to put in drawers and down in my cellar.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle as an AllStarReviews Team Member to try out.  The bottle is a generous size and the smell is perfect!  Unlike many oils that use synthetic ingredients to produce what they believe lavender should smell like this company uses natural ingredients.  Long lasting with that pleasant lavender smell with slight undertones of the slightly woody smell the plant has.  I have used it in distilled water to calm my temperamental child, in a diffuser to scent the house, homemade vinegar based cleaner, and in rice to make headache bags.  Sun Organics provides a high quality long lasting essential oil at a reasonable price.  I will be repurchasing this item and many more of their essential oils.  Although I was provided free product in return for a review, this review is my true and unbiased opinion of this product.</li>
            <li> This is NOT 100% essential oil! There is a carrier oil with essential oil added. It&#x27;s greasy!</li>
            <li> these &amp;#34;essential oils&amp;#34; are cut with a carrier oil. they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;pure.&amp;#34; that&#x27;s fine if you are new to EOs and don&#x27;t understand dilutions, but for those looking for pure EOs, buy elsewhere!</li>
            <li> Smells like lavender.</li>
            <li> for the price, it is a good deal. However, it is not nearly as strong as some I have used in the past. I had to use about double in the lotion I was scenting.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I&#x27;d hoped for . Not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, &amp; the scent is so strong, I could smell it before I opened the mail box. Unfortunately, it was shipped in a envelope package instead of a box, so the seal was broken &amp; the product leaked a little. It was not enough to complain though. It smells great, plus I love that it is all natural. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I received the French Lavender essential oil for $1.00 to write a review. The oil smells great and arrived just in time for the &amp;#34;sunburn&amp;#34; season. I like to use it for everything from fatigue to sunburn treatment. I like the large bottle and the plastic dropper it came with. This is the first time I have used this brand but I find it to be just as good quality as other brands and would purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> My package arrived with the bottle sealed with the tape on the cap, but it was leaking into the wrapping.  A good portion leaked out and it was very slippery to unpack.  I had to wash the bottle off to remove the slippery oil.  My entire house reeked from the Lavender smell.  It is powerful when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the smell dissipate in my house for 2 days before I applied some of the lavender to my wrist.  I applied 1 drop without carrier oil (just like I do with my other Lavender EO) this oil burns  but did not leave any redness.  Next time I will use a carrier oil to apply to my skin.  It was pretty powerful for 1 drop, but now 2 hours later, it is a very mild scent.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle and it had leaked out even with the plastic still securely wrapped around the top. This was my first experience with essential oils and I have to say I was not disappointed. I used some in my daughters bath after having many nights in a row of waking in the middle of the night. That night she slept all night! The smell is not too strong but not too faint either. It filled the room with lavender smell in about 30 minutes. I&#x27;m now going to have to try other oils in hopes they work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! The only reason that it wasn&#x27;t rated at 5 stars is because when I received it there seemed to be some leakage. But other than that the oil is perfect!!</li>
            <li> This essential oil has a wonderful &amp;#34;Spa Quality&amp;#34; smell and long lasting. The consistency is like many others I have purchased. I wish the bottle had a dropper on the top because it is very difficult to just put a few drops in the diffuser. I would definitely purchase this brand again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of lavender and I buy lavender essential oil every few months because I use it a lot. This lavender oil smells heavenly! It was shipped to Colorado where due to the altitude many liquid items tend to leak upon arrival. This was the case. The bottle was still sealed but leaked a bit from the top so the whole package smelled heavenly. The postman must have been really relaxed the whole drive, LOL. I am guessing due to the size of the bottle it does not come with a orifice reducer. It did come with a separate plastic dropper that you insert into the bottle, squeeze the top and it sucks up some oil into the dropper. Then you slowly squeeze it out and it comes out in drops much like a orifice reducer does. I would definitely buy form this seller again!</li>
            <li> Love this, it smells heavenly, although I got this free for reviewing I will be pruchasing more. Love this product !!! I got this product free for doing a review.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender essential oil. I find my self using it everywhere. I added a few drops to my carpet cleaner and my room smells amazing! I&#x27;ve put some in hand lotions and on a lightbulb ring. The scent is a perfect balance and isn&#x27;t to over powering.</li>
            <li> of course I love the smell!! I use it on my pillows and have noticed it is so much easier to relax and sleep at night!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful aroma and organic too! Great product and nice bottle. I will be buying again when I run out!</li>
            <li> No proper organic labels to be trusted.  Very faint scent of lavender. I am also waiting my shipment of 2 other oils and we shall see if of similar quality. I suspect these oils have been diluted and are not pure 100% pure therapeutic organic essential oils in which ad states.</li>
            <li> Excellent, fast shipping, as described!</li>
            <li> Came as described and smells great! Love the value and prime shipping</li>
            <li> very good and would buy again. thank you  5 stars</li>
            <li> Great just absolutely love it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love it will buy again..!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave only 1 star because of the amount of essential oil received.  Does not smell light French lavender.</li>
            <li> I love this French Lavender oil! It is so relaxing at night, helps me go to sleep faster. Great product!</li>
            <li> Amazing Lavendar oil.  I love to use it on my baby to calm her and for myself in my baths.  This is a very nice Lavendar oil, if you want a good Lavendar!</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my pillow and it helped to relax me and get a better nights sleep. I will definitely buy again in the near future. I recommend everyone to try it</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. Wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this oil but as soon as it arrived I knew it was a good one. Perfect smell of lavender. I&#x27;m looking forward to making my gifts with this and I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the lavender and vanilla. I put some in a spray bottle and use it as an air freshner. Keeps a nice scent for a long time.</li>
            <li> I received a discount on this item to try the product. I have to say I Love this essential oil. I put a couple drops in a dish and the whole room smells amazing. I&#x27;ve also used the lavender on my temples when I had a headache and I thought it helped. I&#x27;ve used other brands that are more pricey and I believe Sun Organic is the same quality or better. Also, I received this essential oil earlier than expected which was nice.</li>
            <li> When it arrived the bottle had leaked but other then that it works great in the baths to gives a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Love it! Excellent oil. Will buy from again.&lt;br /&gt;Do wish there was a stopper in the top of the bottle to control amount. Otherwise, really nice product.</li>
            <li> This has SUCH a weak fragrance compared to the high quality fragrances that are available for similar prices. I am not an essential oil snob, but a lady I make soap with had a few other lavenders for me to smell for comparison and next to these, this product is just WEAK!! Please check out Liberty Naturals for the best quality essential oils. I have not purchased them myself, but it is the only brand she has used for years and all my other essential oils smell just so bland in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;****If you do not have a trained nose for frangances then this lavender is just fine!!!! I am reviewing as someone who used them for business and not just personal use.</li>
            <li> I wish they had stated that it wasn&#x27;t for your body in the description. It smells nice and works well in a warmer but you cant put it on your skin</li>
            <li> Great essential oil! I use lavender for so many things around the house and in my skincare. This one is high quality and I will order again soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of lavender and this oil did not disappoint. I used this oil in conjunction with another good night oil. For this oil, I added a few drops in a spray bottle with some water and the good night essential oil. I sprayed the mixture on my sheets and pillow case. I was so relaxed and comfortable! I drifted off to sleep within a half hour and had a great nights sleep! I love this stuff! The smell is amazing. I even sprayed some onto my daughters crib and she slept really well too. In addition to using this on the bedding, I added some drops to my bath and my daughters bath one night. I loved it! I received this oil for free to try and review. my review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent of lavender but I use this in my diffuser to get rid of headaches and to help with stress. Love the benefits and when used in a diffuser the smell isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick, and it is a wonderful oil</li>
            <li> I loved the aroma and it lasts forever in my difuser</li>
            <li> When I first received this product it smelled like bug spray and was very strong. As I used the product I got used to the smell and needless to say it worked wonders! I used it on some sores and chapped skin areas and within a few days all was healed and skin felt very soft with no scarring. I recommend this product to all. If you have a sore that you don&#x27;t want to scar put this oil on it and you won&#x27;t believe how fast it will heal and you won&#x27;t be able to tell where the sore was. Its like a miracle oil!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent oil, wonderful aroma...I sprinkle a little on my pillow and it helps me to get to sleep. I also us it to help calm kitties who have anxiety. Also good price.. Would purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AWESOME&lt;br /&gt;good price for organic lavender too.</li>
            <li> perfect product especially for the price.  the smell is clean and it diffuses perfectly</li>
            <li> I love this French Lavender essential oil. I&#x27;m just getting into using essential oils and this was a good one to start with. I had a really bad sunburn and was able to make a mix of this oil, peppermint, aloe, and cetaphil lotion and it was amazing! My burn healed quickly and peeling was minimal. I have also used this oil on my wool dryer balls. You only need to put a drop or two on each one and it makes your laundry smell amazing without having to use any harsh chemicals. I&#x27;d buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Got my order the very next day. Nice smell - good quality product. Will definitely keep them in mind the next time I need a good quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best I have purchased from Amazon. Only issue was it leaked a small amount into the packaging. Not sure how they could prevent that but was a tiny inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Love this lavender oil! It&#x27;s working well in my homemade wool dryer balls.</li>
            <li> I wish this would work, I put in 10 drops in my diffusers can not even smell a things. It does not seem potent to me even I apply on the pillow. No more purchase for this, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> In the product i received there is no sentence as &amp;#34;100% pure and organic essential oil&amp;#34;. instead there is a sticker as organic which can be easily removed and it is not as part of the product label. The smell is also worst it doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender. I doubt this is pure and organic. I have attached the picture that was displayed in Amazon site and the picture of the product i received.</li>
            <li> Very potent and brings total relaxation at night Great for the bath</li>
            <li> Great quality, great price! It was packaged securely and included a pipette. Using in soap...Great buy; prompt service.</li>
            <li> not as strong as I would have liked.</li>
