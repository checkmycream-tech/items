            <li>Nice variations of neutrals.  </li>
            <li>The top row is also lacking a good highlight color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a lot of neutral palettes, but this is the one that stays out where it&#x27;s handy.</li>

            <li>/&gt;While searching these tutorials, I kept running across people who SWORE that this palette held dupes for 17 of the most popular shades in 1 &amp;2</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the best product that I&#x27;ve tried from Coastal scents!</li>

            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve heard and seen this palette is a great dupe for the Naked1 and Naked2 palettes but at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>Very comparable to the Naked palette, great value and the colors are wonderful...</li>
            <li>some of my most used shades.&lt;br /&gt;i think this is great for people who dont have the means to buy the naked palettes, but the quality of this is just not as good.</li>
            <li>okay</li>

            <li>They product also seemed a bit crumbly when you put some of the product on the brush, not creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The color selection is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Great colors that last!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great dupe for Naked 1 and 2.</li>
            <li>so this palette is such a great price.</li>
            <li>The shadows are creamy and smooth without being chalky.</li>
            <li>but if you want the naked palettes this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>The matt shades are a bit on the light side, but I use them on my brow bone for a highlight.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I chose this palette since I was debating between the Naked palettes</li>
            <li>I have a nice brush set that I use and used primer too, so those really aren&#x27;t the issues.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use all the colors yet, but used some of the light colors</li>
            <li>It has great colors with deep, long-lasting pigment.  </li>
            <li>With a great product and lightning-fast shipping, this is definitely the deal of the day</li>
            <li>This palette is very pigmented and the colors are amazing.</li>
            <li>Great colors for a price that cant be beat at the same level of quality.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of fallout, but since I don&#x27;t use foundation or concealer, it was easy for me to clean up after application.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow has great color pigmentation and with that you don&#x27;t have to load on a bunch of the product to actually see the color.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a great palette for the price.</li>
            <li>Great quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Great coverage overall</li>
            <li>great alternative to Naked for people who can&#x27;t afford it!</li>
            <li>They can be used as shadows or as liners and have great deep pigment for the colors.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t come across as cheap</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday neutral look and smokey eyes.</li>
            <li>No complaints here these have great dupes for the naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes!!!!</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s well worth the money :)</li>
            <li>Rose shades, Warm Metallics, Highlight colors, and Deep smoky shadows for drama.</li>
            <li>These colors are beautiful and they are long wearing!</li>
            <li>the colors are gorgeous and long-lasting, and complement each other nicely.</li>
            <li>This palette is absolutely GORG!!!</li>
            <li>I first sampled in my Birchbox and now I love that I own the whole palette.</li>
            <li>The shades are beautiful and very pigmented, if you love neutral colors and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on the UD Naked palettes, this is for you!</li>
            <li>I received the Revealed 1 in my Boxycharm and I was super impressed with the colors and the pigmentation with such a reasonable price tag for a palette of this</li>
            <li>It goes on super easy with the primer I got here too, and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>Most of these brands have such tacky bright colors that most people would never wear in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color payout is excellent, and there is very little fallout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy I did not shell out $55 for each of the UD Naked series palettes.</li>
            <li>After some significant research, I chose these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line -- absolutely worth purchasing the pallet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>well worth the price!</li>
            <li>It was applied at 10am and by 3am it still looked fresh!</li>
            <li>definitely worth every penny I paid for it !</li>
            <li>Very elegant natural glow.</li>
            <li>But other than that this palette was beautiful, it does not look cheap</li>
            <li>I was wanting a rich shimmer chocolate brown.</li>
            <li>Better than any higher brands.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, mostly frosts, berries and purples.  </li>
            <li>beautiful colors, wayyy better than my Naked Palette that I paid more than double for!  </li>
            <li>I honestly think the pigmentation of the Revealed is better than the Naked!!  </li>
            <li>Definitely better than expected and surprisingly good for a $15 pallet.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and smooth :) it lasts all day while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li>$20 is a complete steal for this palette comparatively speaking for sure!</li>
            <li>So far love it!</li>
            <li>Very blendable, perfect travel palette, I had just purchased the Lorac Pro and the Naked 3, and wanted a smaller palette with more typical &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; colors, and this is just perfect.</li>
            <li>- I really LOVE all of the colors in this palette, they&#x27;re so pretty and all super prefect colors.</li>
            <li>wow, what amazing shadows.</li>
            <li>So good, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Bought my daughter the UD NAKED palette couple years ago for gift and this is absolutely as good.</li>
            <li>it stayes good time use it with a primer and it will look just like the naked</li>
            <li>love this so much</li>
            <li>This is a wise investment for anyone starting out with makeup and experts alike.</li>
            <li>this set will last me awhile though which is definitely a good thing</li>
            <li>LOVE this eye shadow so much.</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t as good as urban decay</li>
            <li>but the colors weren&#x27;t true on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Very blend able</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still practicing to blend and match colors, but it works really well :)</li>
            <li>Very pigmented &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li>It was a  Smash-box Full Exposure eyeshadow pallete for $52.</li>
            <li>I got this after wanting the naked palette and seeing all the hype about it this one as a good dupe on youtube.</li>
            <li>Just use a good primer under the eyeshadow and it will last all day.</li>
            <li>I purchased this full size palette after receiving a sample in my monthly Birchbox shipment.  </li>
            <li>with it and try again as I just loved the overall color selection.  </li>
            <li>Recommend it to anyone who wants to create a nude look :)</li>
            <li>Almost as good as the Naked palette.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not all full of sparkly shades</li>
            <li>Good colors with an even mix of shimmers and mattes the only problem I had with this product was when I opened it</li>
            <li>The Coastal Scents Revealed Eye-Shadow is true to the description on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They are very pigmented,  and I love them.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors and not very expensive, especially if you&#x27;re just getting started in makeup.</li>
            <li>They have made a beautiful palette that one can actually easily afford instead of shelling out $100 for the two palettes we all know this is imitating, and they didn&#x27;t have to sacrifice much of anything other than the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting this pallets to be heavier for some reason but nonetheless, its the shades that are of importance; the colours are beautiful for my skin tone and I am of African decent.</li>
            <li>it has this nice fine solid powder when being picked up by the brush.</li>
            <li>It covers smoothly (which isn&#x27;t easy because of my brown skin tone and my slightly oily lids), blends beautifully and this is honestly the first time that I finally have makeup that lasts.</li>
            <li>I compared with my friends actual UD Naked 1&amp;2 palettes and even she is impressed at the matches.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, use it more than my urban decay.</li>
            <li>I compared with my friends actual UD Naked 1&amp;2 palettes and even she is impressed at the matches.</li>
            <li>so it was super lightweight</li>
            <li>This is a perfect dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes.</li>
            <li>The only way it could be better is if there were more matte options-</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s probably the best budget dupe of Naked 1/2.</li>
            <li>Perfect dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast and I think this palette is a great dupe for the naked 1&amp;2</li>
            <li>Better yet sign up for the costal scents newsletters and pick this and pick up the 2nd one too (my favorite all time pallette) when they are on a 50% off sale.  </li>
            <li>These are super high-quality colors.</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthy dupe.</li>
            <li>Awesome dupes for the urban decay naked palettes!</li>
            <li>Lots of fallout but still blend able with decent wear.  </li>
            <li>This is a great palette with quality colors that stay put, I am just now starting to learn how to really put effort into my makeup without paying an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice natural color palette and it has a very nice deep blue.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty light for my brown skin</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy UD Naked One, if you haven&#x27;t already done so, because this palette is just as good, has more colors, and is from a completely cruelty-free company.</li>
            <li>Has some pretty light nude colors.  </li>
            <li>I love how I can mix up the colors and bring out new looks every day.</li>
            <li>The black on this palette is a great alternative to eyeliner.</li>
            <li>pretty good pigmentation, but a lot of the colors looked very similar to me.</li>
            <li>I have never owned the Naked palettes, and have heard that these were are pretty a good dupe for them.</li>
            <li>I bought this pallet after hearing positive reviews on a YouTube video from a girl who did fantastic jobs on her makeup.</li>
            <li>Just like the Urban Decay eyeshadow pallet but with more colors!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a Naked user, you&#x27;ll definitely be satisfied with these!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s also pretty useful if you want to label the shades with the UD names!</li>
            <li>First time buying Coastal Scents product, but this palette is a must buy!</li>
            <li>I first saw the Revealed 2 palette, I knew I had to have it!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s also pretty useful if you want to label the shades with the UD names!</li>
            <li>To my amazement, it looked EXACTLY like the look I had been going for, in the tutorial!</li>
            <li>next so I can have even more colors to choose from!</li>
            <li>, they last all day and are stunning to wear!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this palette, the shadows are pigmented but requires a little more blending, which is fine..</li>
            <li>90% of the colors are very highly pigmented and buttery smooth.</li>
            <li>I really read all of the reviews out there on it, and got super excited as I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>an overall amazing palette.</li>
            <li>I still use this palette everyday, and the coverage is great.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s such a variety of amazing neutral colors in both shimmer and matte finishes.</li>
            <li>The colors are great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing palette for those of you looking for a cheaper option to the naked palette.  </li>
            <li>The colors are fantastic, very pigmented, and they stay on all day.</li>
            <li>Really glad there is a clear plastic sheet protecting the shadows</li>
            <li>Definitely a good alternative to the Naked palette and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Thinner than I expected although I am more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>The size of the shadows are really nice and should last you quite awhile!!</li>
            <li>The packaging was excellent, so nothing could have broken.</li>
            <li>Really glad there is a clear plastic sheet protecting the shadows</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that there were so many metallic/frosted shadows.</li>
            <li>Nice alternative for those who don&#x27;t wish to shell out $50 for the Naked pallets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely economical compared to the Naked2 or Naked3 palettes.  </li>
            <li>I paired this purchase with Lamora brand eye makeup brushes and love everything so far.</li>
            <li>To be completely honest, I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li>I spent a couple weeks using this palette to try a variety of looks and give all the colors a good try.</li>
            <li>Awesome palette, and really a dupe of the Urban Decay Naked&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the Naked palette because I would never shell out that kind of money for it, so I cannot compare.</li>
            <li>I love it, better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>All the colors go nicely together so you can mix and match different colors too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Next time I would like to try their warm shades.</li>
            <li>I think this will last quite a while as well, since the colors are nicely pigmented.</li>
            <li>I am happy that black is in the palette!</li>
            <li>its nice and easy to blend with other colors!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more budget friendly set that would last a longer time.</li>
            <li>Package came right on time, lots of protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get this while the price is right.</li>
            <li>I use both high end and drugstore makeup and this palette lasts longer and has much better application and pigment than several of my high end popular brands.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and nicely pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li>this eyeshadow are great and like the UD palette without the high price and the colors are with high cuality pigments that stick and last for hours.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly, blend easily and last all day.</li>
            <li>For the price, you get a high-quality, beautiful product that I have never had a complaint about.  </li>
            <li>I have numerous friends, who own Naked palettes, and like my eye shadow more.</li>
            <li>It has nice colors and wears for a long time.</li>
            <li>use a lid primer by habit, but the Coastal Scents Revealed colors stay on a long time on their own.</li>
            <li>They are all premade and are not as good as the revealed pallets or the other pallettes made from the costal scents hot pots.  </li>
            <li>The palette is absolutely beautiful and I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to try out something new or just a big neutral palette or looking for the perfect gift to a makeup obsessed lady out there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend using something like Smashbox Photo Finish primer or my favorite, Laura Gellar Spackle (both clear) to ensure their pure colors</li>
            <li>The colors are rich and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>For the price you can get better ones at a pharmacy or just a little more</li>
            <li>Would be an excellent palette choice for someone just starting out with makeup as there is little chance for error with the well coordinated colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would happily equate the colors of this palette to a mix of the colors in the Naked / Naked 2 palettes.</li>
            <li>Great dupe for the more expensive nude colored palettes out there.</li>
            <li>I received product super fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast, and palette came undamaged.</li>
            <li>It is a great dupe for urban decay naked pallets.</li>
            <li>A great dupe for the naked and naked 2 .</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast</li>
            <li>These colors are amazing , I would just just as good if not better than naked eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Helps if you&#x27;re following a tutorial, then you can be sure you&#x27;re using the right shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helps if you&#x27;re following a tutorial, then you can be sure you&#x27;re using the right shade.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try my new palette, but I found the colors to be highly pigmented compared to the drug store eye shadow I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>The quality of these shadows makes them worth far more than the cheap price they actually sell for.</li>
            <li>Lovely color payoff great for the price similar to my Urban Decay Naked Palette</li>
            <li>The shadows stay on all day, and they have a beautiful subtle shimmer to them.</li>
            <li>I like going for classy and pretty looks, as opposed to super bold colors.</li>
            <li>The shimmer is good for me but if you love high glitterly shimmer, you probably want a different palette or wet the brush beforehand.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wear your Eye Shadow primer and it will last all day.</li>
            <li>Love the colors - no smell like a different Coastal Scents palette I received</li>
            <li>Another thing I did not like most of the colors where all shimmer only around 4 matte&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I think this is better than Urban Decay&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>and I will probably try more items from this brand as well simply for the value in the price.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $54 for just one Naked palette.</li>
            <li>and i love the colors overall</li>
            <li>Not to mention i received it a whole week before the shipping said i would!</li>
            <li>VERY blendable!  </li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty and so pigmented.  </li>
            <li>definitely recommend this pallet :)</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty much an exact match.</li>
            <li>first but it on.</li>
            <li>Nice colors,easy to apply,better than i expected</li>
            <li>My first ever coastal scents palette.</li>
            <li>It is pigmented but overall it&#x27;s an ok palette.</li>
            <li>Has a bit of a funny smell, but nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li>It actually makes the palette lightweight, slim and compact- and better for travelling.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do justice to how pretty the shadows are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get this instead of the urban decay palettes.</li>
            <li>The colors are all so pretty and usable.</li>
            <li>This was my first eyeshadow palette to buy on amazon</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this product.</li>
            <li>pretty pigmented...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested, just get it.</li>
            <li>:) I wish they made another one with different colors.</li>
            <li>And not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred more matte colors that is why I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars.</li>
            <li>They are all so similar in shade, color, and too many shimmery colors.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this palette and its only been day 1</li>
            <li>Anyway, I suggest looking at the actual website before purchasing just to make sure there aren&#x27;t any sales going on for</li>
            <li>This is my first review I&#x27;ve ever written</li>
            <li>I really like this pallet!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I also have one of the naked pallets and this pallet is surprisingly better.</li>
            <li>fast delivery!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only things that would have made it better would be a mirror and some titles to the shadows.</li>
            <li>first time I used it was to go out in.</li>
            <li>Use a fluffy brush with a good primer.</li>
            <li>Very nice mix of neutrals, some matte, some shimmery, but workable for older eyes with a few lines.  </li>
            <li>I love all the colors and shipping was fast and not a single crack or break in any of the colors!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an easy, natural makeup look.</li>
            <li>but amazingly I have absolutely no issues with these shadows!</li>
            <li>I normally spend the big bucks on the Naked palettes, but I am so happy I came across this product before going to a nearby Ulta.</li>
            <li>These have decent pigment in the shimmers and are fun to wear.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this if you are looking for something similar to the NAKED palette as I think this is a good comparison.</li>
            <li>I love this palette so much that I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only 20$.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and light weight cardboard with no mirror, and there&#x27;s a good variety of shade types like shimmer, metallic, and matte.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, transfer is a little messy, but for the price this is really a quality product  - not too shimmery either, just lovely...</li>
            <li>and it came in super early !</li>
            <li>Might work best with a good primer as it tends to get a little cakey throughout the day, but the pigments aren&#x27;t disappointing.</li>
            <li>Good colors and decent intensity of the pigment, but a little chalky.</li>
            <li>She  liked them so much that she&#x27;s  now ordered the concealer palette and a professional set of brushes from the same company.</li>
            <li>and I could just imagine what it would look like on my skin, but when I received the palette and tried it on for the first time, it was much lighter than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t really know what to do with it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just as good, if not better in quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, not much fallout at all.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Color doesn&#x27;t last all day strong, it does fade.  </li>
            <li>The biggest difference between this and Urban Decay is that these shadows seem looser packed, but it&#x27;s not crumbling loose-- just more easily loosened when you run a brush over it.</li>
            <li>so I have to be careful to use one light and quick swipe</li>
            <li>I bought it because I love the Naked palettes by UD and wanted to add more colors to my collection, for less than 1/2 the price of UD.  </li>
            <li>Dupes for the urban decay naked palettes and can get so many looks with it!</li>
            <li>All the colors are so vibrant on the skin!</li>
            <li>This pallette will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need as much of the product compared to other brands because the color is a great payoff!</li>
            <li>but this is a great look alike and some of the colors are almost dead on for the naked palette.</li>
            <li>Really inexpensive&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great alternative for the naked pallet  if you are looking to save some cash for the same quality and colors as the naked pallets.</li>
            <li>I have really been getting a lot of use out of mine.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are not as pigmented as the others, but I find that they are still workable without much fuss.</li>
            <li>and I feel these colors work very well on me</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it blends as well.</li>
            <li>I really like these colors and the product.  </li>
            <li>Smooth application and last forever .</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>(vain, much?</li>
            <li>and you can really see the color.  </li>
            <li>I have even given this as a present to a friend because I enjoy it a lot.</li>
            <li>It swatches really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>It came in the mail fast.</li>
            <li>None of the shadows were broken, and the colors looked great, in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Using one of the tutorial charts I had copied, I tried out the Revealed colors.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to like this one.</li>
            <li>advice is to save your money and get the real thing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend too much money on this product.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented with no fallout issues for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really top-quality.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>She REALLY likes this set.  </li>
            <li>but there are mistly shimmer shades with much overlap/similar colours.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you are getting a high quality product!</li>
            <li>Also very blendable.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation of the shadow is deep and the texture is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented for women of all colors!</li>
            <li>but just didn&#x27;t wanna spend that much.</li>
            <li>The picture does not do this pallette justice it really truly deserves.</li>
            <li>Colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors stay on all day and are very pigmented</li>
            <li>She loves the fact that she can blend the colors to the look she wants.</li>
            <li>they are creamy and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>also a lot of ladies here are saying that some of the colors are so sparkly or too shiny, I did put on one color that had too much glimmer.</li>
            <li>I was really worried to spend money on eye shadows at all because I have never had much luck with them...</li>
            <li>it stays really</li>
            <li>I really like this palette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got just about all the colors I want, although I would have liked a few for matte colors, but I can do a lot with this.</li>
            <li>This is an okay naked dupe but the shadows really aren&#x27;t nearly as pigmented and don&#x27;t wear as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t agree with the popular comparison of this palette to the Naked palettes by Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>It has a nice selection of eyeshadows similar to the Naked 1 and 2 pallette.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m completely and utterly satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>, the colors look beautiful, there was a plastic that covered the eye shadows, there was only a small smudge on one of my colors (I&#x27;m guessing from packaging)</li>
            <li>I love the way the shimmering ones look I am planning to purchase the other palettes with burgundy color.</li>
            <li>however be sure to use a primer as in the summer they have a tendency to crease due to increased sweating and oil in the face</li>
            <li>They have amazing color pay off and last all day long.</li>
            <li>The colors were pretty but much too shimmery for my 50 year old eyes.</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented and very creamy.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely blown away by the pigmentation and how gorgeous these shadows apply.. Definitely comparable to the naked one and naked two palettes..</li>
            <li>Packaging was great, I was worried about receiving a broken palette but there were no problems &amp; it literally got here a week &amp; 2 days early!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care if it doesn&#x27;t exactly have all the colors of the Naked palettes because the colors are pretty anyways.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft &amp; pretty pigment.</li>
            <li>Almost all of the colors are dark and better suited for the lid and crease.  </li>
            <li>Not bad enough to return but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>I had looked over all the tutorials, and even jotted down my favorite combinations, in hopes that I would (someday) get one of the palettes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>$20 for 20 shades was still a bit high, for my available budget, but I could justify it... as long as they worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a broke college student it is not very easy for me to afford MAC, but honestly, I am so glad I found got this.</li>
            <li>, half baked is passable which is my FAVORITE color of them, there&#x27;s no dupe for snakebite, no dupe for chopper, and no dupe for smog.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been wanting to try out the NAKED Palettes by Urban Decay but just haven&#x27;t had the money or want more bang for your buck, THIS IS IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Urban Decay Naked pallets, and I got these to compare.</li>
            <li>However, my sister in law said she actually likes these BETTER than her naked pallets..</li>
            <li>Even without the Fix+ though, it makes the shadows more wearable as they aren&#x27;t too intense or harsh in color.</li>
            <li>I do prime with this mainly out of habit, and it lasts literally all day.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li>A Much better price than the more expensive eye palette s..</li>
            <li>so many people in the reviews compare this to naked and naked 2, i wonder whether or not they have them.</li>
            <li>Because i&#x27;v only tried a few colors but good deal and price compared to paying $50 ..</li>
            <li>Highly Pigmented, Buttery shades&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>And I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product ❤</li>
            <li>High pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>On par with high end shadows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shadows are highly pigmented, they are creamy and glide onto your lids.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Color payoff and texture are fantastic, shades work very well with each other, and they stay all day without creasing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about ordering revealed 2 in the future due to the amazing quality.</li>
            <li>a little :)</li>
            <li>Comparatively, these are a little more flakey and not as velvety when applying..</li>
            <li>but I was expecting a little more of color</li>
            <li>Wish the colors showed up a little better.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a DUPE for the Urban Decay Naked 1 and 2 palette if you are looking for something more affordable!</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many matte shades, however, so I won&#x27;t be using this for everyday makeup because i don&#x27;t use shimmery colors except during formals or parties.</li>
            <li>Such pretty colors and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Would have liked at least a couple more&lt;</li>
            <li>Not only that, my eyeshadow STILL looked freshly applied when I took it off...</li>
            <li>I struggled finding a good eyeshadow palate that wasn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive, and this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday, I love the gold shadow.</li>
            <li>I will use it most everyday.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I felt as though the colors performed more like Wet N&#x27; Wild (of my youth) or ELF (the latest to take over cheap over-the-counter eye shadows!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the money, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>and I travel with this pallette all the time as it can give a great all around day, or night, casual, or formal look.  </li>
            <li>The colors are all the same rectangular shape but some of the colors are packed to the top and some were filled only half way.</li>
            <li>I have never had this reaction with any other shadow--super cheap ones or high end.</li>
            <li>I guess no longer worked right so some of the eyeshadow on that side had leaked out since it couldn&#x27;t shut properly.</li>
            <li>Great color selection, not chalky at all, a bit of fallout but no more than any other eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin, but I use a cheap primer and they stay on all day without budging).</li>
            <li>and these are my new favorites.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always wear makeup, but this palette makes me want to try new things every day.</li>
            <li>Because of that I had doubts whether the product was new or used.</li>
            <li>Not only did I save a load of cash, but this palette has a dupe for every single shade in the original naked palette, and most shades in the naked 2.</li>
            <li>So one day i came upon this and looked at it for a long time and pretty much raved over it.</li>
            <li>They are also very soft</li>
            <li>hi, so i was pretty new to makeup, but i wanted to get a naked one or two palette</li>
            <li>so far!</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty close to UD Naked palette.</li>
            <li>I tried it once and was completely sold!</li>
            <li>As others have said, it&#x27;s a combination of the first two Naked palettes put together.</li>
            <li>This is an EXACT Dupe for all the colors from NAKED 1 &amp; 2 except for two colors!  </li>
            <li>daily i really recommend this!</li>
            <li>I had enough warning that I did my primer and eyes, first...</li>
            <li>This is the first big palette I have ever bought</li>
            <li>I bought this as a dupe for the Naked palette and though they are obviously not exact matches, I&#x27;m pleased with the colors.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I tried it several times and the first time I noticed sore lids after I removed it (7 hours or so)--the</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t find a broad enough range of deep to light brown colors in this pallet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half the price of the more well-known palettes (i.e. Urban Decay ect.)</li>
            <li>the black is deep and lovely.</li>
            <li>Much more colors than the naked palettes, for half the cost.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to both naked one and two.</li>
            <li>I had a professional makeup artist who uses the inspiration of this</li>
            <li>I originally really wanted the Naked 2, but upon coming across this palette, I decided to give it a go after I did my research.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t look like an 11 year old or a dancer.</li>
            <li>This palette far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I only apply this once a day and it lasts the whole</li>
            <li>39 yrs old.</li>
            <li>My daughter had this one on  her &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; so I surprised her with it, and sent it to her for &amp;#34;no reason&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>Very comparable to the Naked Palettes by UD.</li>
            <li>You can keep it looking natural and thats the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and they last all day with primer.</li>
            <li>I think nearly every color except</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my 22 yr old w/sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I really want to get the second palette they have.</li>
            <li>Came fast too (with in 3 days with regular shipping)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I still like the natural look it gives.</li>
            <li>Easy for work, casual, or special occasions.</li>
            <li>Starting from left to right like reading a book.&lt;br /&gt;Matte: 1,4,5, and 7.&lt;br /&gt;Shimmer</li>
            <li>I mean more pigmentation?</li>
            <li>Colors are a very very close match to both the UD Naked and UD Naked 2 palettes together.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a primer but the only colors you may need one for are the matte ones, especially the first shade.</li>
            <li>I only have to reapply if it is hot and sweaty outside.</li>
            <li>, they said, so you were ACTUALLY duping 20 shades, and getting three extra &amp;#34;near-shades&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>These show up on me better than the Naked palettes for a small fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powdery compared to Naked, I barely have to touch it with my brush.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a dupe of the naked and naked 2 palettes from Urban Decay and this is better than I ever expected it to be.</li>
            <li>The shadows are highly pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li>amazing wraping not a single shade was broken.</li>
            <li>There is a little bit of extra fallout but if you blow your brush before applying it you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>SO much that I ordered Revealed 2 not too long after.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty not much fallout.</li>
            <li>I compared this side by side with my daughter&#x27;s Urban Decay Naked palettes and, if there is a difference in the color or pigmentation, I certainly couldn&#x27;t detect it.  </li>
            <li>The shadows are pigmented, soft, and wear just as long as some of my high end eyeshadows with primer.</li>
            <li>(Naked had duped a couple of shades from 1, and gave them new names in 2</li>
            <li>The colors are not as intense as the Naked palettes, but adding a bit of Mac Fix+ on the brush before application makes the colors identical as I compared with my cousin&#x27;s Naked palette.</li>
            <li>but I really do recommend that people buy this item if theyre looking for something similar to the Naked palette</li>
            <li>Some are bold and you need not to apply heavily and others are translucent without a primer.</li>
            <li>i have had as much fall out from more expensive pallets.</li>
            <li>always problems with fallout, major creasing, fading, pigmentation..etc.</li>
            <li>a primer, the eye shadow is a bit loose, but still very pigmented.</li>
            <li>and im very much into makeup but for the average user and someone who just needs some neutral essentials this is for you, if you wanna pay for the quality buy the nakeds.</li>
            <li>I just wish that a few of them didn&#x27;t go on as dark as they do as I have had to blend them more with lighter shadows</li>
            <li>power/color payoff were just so-so compared to other products available from other brands at lower price points (</li>
            <li>While 20 dollars (plus shipping) doesn&#x27;t seem like much, I wish that I would of spent the money on quality brands.</li>
            <li>Barely pigmented.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I feel there are not enough highlighting colors you would use on the top of the eyelid.  </li>
            <li>These colors are all very pigmented and there&#x27;s a wide range so you can do a look for any occasion.</li>
            <li>It contains similar colors to the Naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes by Urban Decay, but is obviously much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I just barely dip my brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this palette for about 4 months and it looks like it&#x27;s barely been used.  </li>
            <li>No regrets on this purchase.</li>
            <li>This was basically the first eyeshadow pallete I&#x27;ve ever bought, and being a bit inexperienced, opted for the cheaper version of Naked palettes.</li>
            <li>To verify for those of you who can&#x27;t tell by the photo (like me), the pot on the second from the right, bottom row is a gunmetal grey - it is not blue (I always thought this and the pot on the Naket palette were blue!).</li>
            <li>It came pretty quickly, no damage or anything.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using all my other high end eye shadows because I have everything I need in this one palette!</li>
            <li>the eye-shadow was not broken, I will be ordering the other shades</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;used forever, and I had a problem with applying too much color, so when I tried to remove some with a tissue it just smudged all&lt;br /&gt;over, and then I tried washing it off with soap and water and it just smudged more, so I used cold cream to get it off.  </li>
            <li>A little heads up do not buy the 88,120, and higher pallets.  </li>
            <li>You only get a few matte shades but the ones you get are just the right ones.</li>
            <li>This pallet is a major dupe for the Urban Decay Naked Pallets.</li>
            <li>The palette is thin and sleek so it would be easy to throw into a bag for travel.</li>
            <li>Great product, fallout&#x27;s not too bad, and it lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li>Somewhat pigmented, NOT long lasting.</li>
            <li>got it in, nothing was broken and everything looked fine.</li>
            <li>Each color has not too much but not too little amount of eye shadow.</li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than the nakeds but MUCH cheaper.</li>

            <li> Nice variations of neutrals.  </li>
            <li> The top row is also lacking a good highlight color.</li>

            <li> /&gt;While searching these tutorials, I kept running across people who SWORE that this palette held dupes for 17 of the most popular shades in 1 &amp;2</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the best product that I&#x27;ve tried from Coastal scents!</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE this pallet.</li>

            <li> Just fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this pallette.</li>
            <li> I will stick to my nude tude palette which is way better alike and give this one away.</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this palette.</li>
            <li> and it sure is pigmented and blends</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it will still do okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Just as with any eyeshadows, make sure you wear a primer on the lid before applying them.</li>
            <li> When I swatched the shadows I realized how amazingly buttery and smooth they are.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Significantly better than e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.  </li>
            <li> Too many shimmer shadows and staying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll probably order the REVEALED II</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve heard and seen this palette is a great dupe for the Naked1 and Naked2 palettes but at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my eye makeup since buying these colors.  </li>

            <li> I love matte colors and even though it has with shimmery and shear shadows, it</li>
            <li> OK..</li>
            <li> and I love this palette</li>
            <li> even my sister (who&#x27;s a makeup artist) fell in love with it after letting her use it on me.</li>
            <li> I could never bring myself to shell out 50 dollars for the Naked palettes and this seems to be a perfect compromise-</li>

            <li> This pallete is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Although the colors were OK I guess I must be allergic to the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Might be an ongoing problem but overall great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the description stated more matte shades.....</li>
            <li> love this palette.  </li>
            <li> Very comparable to the Naked palette, great value and the colors are wonderful...</li>
            <li> some of my most used shades.&lt;br /&gt;i think this is great for people who dont have the means to buy the naked palettes, but the quality of this is just not as good.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> you get so much more.</li>
            <li> but i used more than one</li>

            <li> The colors are very pigmented also colors are very amazing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but from swatching it, some of the colours, particularly the shimmers, have a nice buttery consistency and good colour payoff.</li>
            <li> Will be buying Revealed 2 very soon!!!!</li>
            <li> Really beautiful, buttery soft shades of lovely neutral colors.</li>
            <li> good staying power on the shadows, minimal creasing, and beautiful shimmer shades.</li>
            <li> so they go on very smoothly and are easily blendable.</li>

            <li> Also, the item got to my house VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> Good quality eyeshadows that blend together nicely and can be mixed and matched!</li>
            <li> I wanted a more natural and nude look and I loved it.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> These are just as good, highly pigmented and stay put through the day and into the evening.</li>
            <li> Awesome dupe for UD Naked palette, I love the colors, very pigmented and easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are very pigmented, easy to blend and go on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice how some of the colors are matte, most have sparkle, and they all allow you to make your own custom look in multiple shades to compliment your skin.</li>
            <li> It applies nicely and is pretty pigmented.</li>
            <li> They all blend together beautifully and allow for countless looks.  </li>
            <li> Lots of beautiful colors in comparison to the Urban Decay palette except at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I liked this one so much I will be purchasing the Revealed 2 Palette. !</li>
            <li> If you like to use any kind of makeup on your face, I would recommend doing your eyes first, or holding a tissue under them while applying.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff the color looks great and stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> The colors are very nice but the powder doesn&#x27;t stick well when I am applying it and some of the powder color ends up under my eyes if I am not careful</li>
            <li> Love this pallett  pretty colors fast shipment good packaging</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty, pigmented, &amp; creamy!</li>
            <li> Rich colors, apply easily and stays put.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a HUGE UD fan.  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t have huge sparkles in them (my biggest pet peeve for eyeshadows).</li>
            <li> but the pigmentation is nice and doesn&#x27;t look chalky or have much fallout.</li>
            <li> Great dupe of the UD Naked palettes but at the fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> They product also seemed a bit crumbly when you put some of the product on the brush, not creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The color selection is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great colors that last!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great dupe for Naked 1 and 2.</li>
            <li> so this palette is such a great price.</li>
            <li> The shadows are creamy and smooth without being chalky.</li>
            <li> but if you want the naked palettes this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> The matt shades are a bit on the light side, but I use them on my brow bone for a highlight.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I chose this palette since I was debating between the Naked palettes</li>
            <li> I have a nice brush set that I use and used primer too, so those really aren&#x27;t the issues.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use all the colors yet, but used some of the light colors</li>
            <li> It has great colors with deep, long-lasting pigment.  </li>
            <li> With a great product and lightning-fast shipping, this is definitely the deal of the day</li>
            <li> This palette is very pigmented and the colors are amazing.</li>
            <li> Great colors for a price that cant be beat at the same level of quality.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of fallout, but since I don&#x27;t use foundation or concealer, it was easy for me to clean up after application.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow has great color pigmentation and with that you don&#x27;t have to load on a bunch of the product to actually see the color.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it&#x27;s a great palette for the price.</li>
            <li> Great quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Great coverage overall</li>
            <li> great alternative to Naked for people who can&#x27;t afford it!</li>
            <li> They can be used as shadows or as liners and have great deep pigment for the colors.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t come across as cheap</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday neutral look and smokey eyes.</li>
            <li> No complaints here these have great dupes for the naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes!!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s well worth the money :)</li>
            <li> Rose shades, Warm Metallics, Highlight colors, and Deep smoky shadows for drama.</li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful and they are long wearing!</li>
            <li> the colors are gorgeous and long-lasting, and complement each other nicely.</li>
            <li> This palette is absolutely GORG!!!</li>
            <li> I first sampled in my Birchbox and now I love that I own the whole palette.</li>
            <li> The shades are beautiful and very pigmented, if you love neutral colors and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on the UD Naked palettes, this is for you!</li>
            <li> I received the Revealed 1 in my Boxycharm and I was super impressed with the colors and the pigmentation with such a reasonable price tag for a palette of this</li>
            <li> It goes on super easy with the primer I got here too, and stays all day.  </li>
            <li> Most of these brands have such tacky bright colors that most people would never wear in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color payout is excellent, and there is very little fallout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy I did not shell out $55 for each of the UD Naked series palettes.</li>
            <li> After some significant research, I chose these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line -- absolutely worth purchasing the pallet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> well worth the price!</li>
            <li> It was applied at 10am and by 3am it still looked fresh!</li>
            <li> definitely worth every penny I paid for it !</li>
            <li> Very elegant natural glow.</li>
            <li> But other than that this palette was beautiful, it does not look cheap</li>
            <li> I was wanting a rich shimmer chocolate brown.</li>
            <li> Better than any higher brands.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, mostly frosts, berries and purples.  </li>
            <li> beautiful colors, wayyy better than my Naked Palette that I paid more than double for!  </li>
            <li> I honestly think the pigmentation of the Revealed is better than the Naked!!  </li>
            <li> Definitely better than expected and surprisingly good for a $15 pallet.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and smooth :) it lasts all day while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li> $20 is a complete steal for this palette comparatively speaking for sure!</li>
            <li> So far love it!</li>
            <li> Very blendable, perfect travel palette, I had just purchased the Lorac Pro and the Naked 3, and wanted a smaller palette with more typical &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; colors, and this is just perfect.</li>
            <li> - I really LOVE all of the colors in this palette, they&#x27;re so pretty and all super prefect colors.</li>
            <li> wow, what amazing shadows.</li>
            <li> So good, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Bought my daughter the UD NAKED palette couple years ago for gift and this is absolutely as good.</li>
            <li> it stayes good time use it with a primer and it will look just like the naked</li>
            <li> love this so much</li>
            <li> This is a wise investment for anyone starting out with makeup and experts alike.</li>
            <li> this set will last me awhile though which is definitely a good thing</li>
            <li> LOVE this eye shadow so much.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t as good as urban decay</li>
            <li> but the colors weren&#x27;t true on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Very blend able</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still practicing to blend and match colors, but it works really well :)</li>
            <li> Very pigmented &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li> It was a  Smash-box Full Exposure eyeshadow pallete for $52.</li>
            <li> I got this after wanting the naked palette and seeing all the hype about it this one as a good dupe on youtube.</li>
            <li> Just use a good primer under the eyeshadow and it will last all day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this full size palette after receiving a sample in my monthly Birchbox shipment.  </li>
            <li> with it and try again as I just loved the overall color selection.  </li>
            <li> Recommend it to anyone who wants to create a nude look :)</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the Naked palette.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not all full of sparkly shades</li>
            <li> Good colors with an even mix of shimmers and mattes the only problem I had with this product was when I opened it</li>
            <li> The Coastal Scents Revealed Eye-Shadow is true to the description on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They are very pigmented,  and I love them.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and not very expensive, especially if you&#x27;re just getting started in makeup.</li>
            <li> They have made a beautiful palette that one can actually easily afford instead of shelling out $100 for the two palettes we all know this is imitating, and they didn&#x27;t have to sacrifice much of anything other than the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting this pallets to be heavier for some reason but nonetheless, its the shades that are of importance; the colours are beautiful for my skin tone and I am of African decent.</li>
            <li> it has this nice fine solid powder when being picked up by the brush.</li>
            <li> It covers smoothly (which isn&#x27;t easy because of my brown skin tone and my slightly oily lids), blends beautifully and this is honestly the first time that I finally have makeup that lasts.</li>
            <li> I compared with my friends actual UD Naked 1&amp;2 palettes and even she is impressed at the matches.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, use it more than my urban decay.</li>
            <li> I compared with my friends actual UD Naked 1&amp;2 palettes and even she is impressed at the matches.</li>
            <li> so it was super lightweight</li>
            <li> This is a perfect dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes.</li>
            <li> The only way it could be better is if there were more matte options-</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s probably the best budget dupe of Naked 1/2.</li>
            <li> Perfect dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast and I think this palette is a great dupe for the naked 1&amp;2</li>
            <li> Better yet sign up for the costal scents newsletters and pick this and pick up the 2nd one too (my favorite all time pallette) when they are on a 50% off sale.  </li>
            <li> These are super high-quality colors.</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthy dupe.</li>
            <li> Awesome dupes for the urban decay naked palettes!</li>
            <li> Lots of fallout but still blend able with decent wear.  </li>
            <li> This is a great palette with quality colors that stay put, I am just now starting to learn how to really put effort into my makeup without paying an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice natural color palette and it has a very nice deep blue.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty light for my brown skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy UD Naked One, if you haven&#x27;t already done so, because this palette is just as good, has more colors, and is from a completely cruelty-free company.</li>
            <li> Has some pretty light nude colors.  </li>
            <li> I love how I can mix up the colors and bring out new looks every day.</li>
            <li> The black on this palette is a great alternative to eyeliner.</li>
            <li> pretty good pigmentation, but a lot of the colors looked very similar to me.</li>
            <li> I have never owned the Naked palettes, and have heard that these were are pretty a good dupe for them.</li>
            <li> I bought this pallet after hearing positive reviews on a YouTube video from a girl who did fantastic jobs on her makeup.</li>
            <li> Just like the Urban Decay eyeshadow pallet but with more colors!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a Naked user, you&#x27;ll definitely be satisfied with these!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s also pretty useful if you want to label the shades with the UD names!</li>
            <li> First time buying Coastal Scents product, but this palette is a must buy!</li>
            <li> I first saw the Revealed 2 palette, I knew I had to have it!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s also pretty useful if you want to label the shades with the UD names!</li>
            <li> To my amazement, it looked EXACTLY like the look I had been going for, in the tutorial!</li>
            <li> next so I can have even more colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> , they last all day and are stunning to wear!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette, the shadows are pigmented but requires a little more blending, which is fine..</li>
            <li> 90% of the colors are very highly pigmented and buttery smooth.</li>
            <li> I really read all of the reviews out there on it, and got super excited as I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> an overall amazing palette.</li>
            <li> I still use this palette everyday, and the coverage is great.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s such a variety of amazing neutral colors in both shimmer and matte finishes.</li>
            <li> The colors are great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing palette for those of you looking for a cheaper option to the naked palette.  </li>
            <li> The colors are fantastic, very pigmented, and they stay on all day.</li>
            <li> Really glad there is a clear plastic sheet protecting the shadows</li>
            <li> Definitely a good alternative to the Naked palette and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Thinner than I expected although I am more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> The size of the shadows are really nice and should last you quite awhile!!</li>
            <li> The packaging was excellent, so nothing could have broken.</li>
            <li> Really glad there is a clear plastic sheet protecting the shadows</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that there were so many metallic/frosted shadows.</li>
            <li> Nice alternative for those who don&#x27;t wish to shell out $50 for the Naked pallets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely economical compared to the Naked2 or Naked3 palettes.  </li>
            <li> I paired this purchase with Lamora brand eye makeup brushes and love everything so far.</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> I spent a couple weeks using this palette to try a variety of looks and give all the colors a good try.</li>
            <li> Awesome palette, and really a dupe of the Urban Decay Naked&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Naked palette because I would never shell out that kind of money for it, so I cannot compare.</li>
            <li> I love it, better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> All the colors go nicely together so you can mix and match different colors too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Next time I would like to try their warm shades.</li>
            <li> I think this will last quite a while as well, since the colors are nicely pigmented.</li>
            <li> I am happy that black is in the palette!</li>
            <li> its nice and easy to blend with other colors!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more budget friendly set that would last a longer time.</li>
            <li> Package came right on time, lots of protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get this while the price is right.</li>
            <li> I use both high end and drugstore makeup and this palette lasts longer and has much better application and pigment than several of my high end popular brands.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and nicely pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li> this eyeshadow are great and like the UD palette without the high price and the colors are with high cuality pigments that stick and last for hours.</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly, blend easily and last all day.</li>
            <li> For the price, you get a high-quality, beautiful product that I have never had a complaint about.  </li>
            <li> I have numerous friends, who own Naked palettes, and like my eye shadow more.</li>
            <li> It has nice colors and wears for a long time.</li>
            <li> use a lid primer by habit, but the Coastal Scents Revealed colors stay on a long time on their own.</li>
            <li> They are all premade and are not as good as the revealed pallets or the other pallettes made from the costal scents hot pots.  </li>
            <li> The palette is absolutely beautiful and I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to try out something new or just a big neutral palette or looking for the perfect gift to a makeup obsessed lady out there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend using something like Smashbox Photo Finish primer or my favorite, Laura Gellar Spackle (both clear) to ensure their pure colors</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> For the price you can get better ones at a pharmacy or just a little more</li>
            <li> Would be an excellent palette choice for someone just starting out with makeup as there is little chance for error with the well coordinated colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would happily equate the colors of this palette to a mix of the colors in the Naked / Naked 2 palettes.</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the more expensive nude colored palettes out there.</li>
            <li> I received product super fast.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast, and palette came undamaged.</li>
            <li> It is a great dupe for urban decay naked pallets.</li>
            <li> A great dupe for the naked and naked 2 .</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing , I would just just as good if not better than naked eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Helps if you&#x27;re following a tutorial, then you can be sure you&#x27;re using the right shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps if you&#x27;re following a tutorial, then you can be sure you&#x27;re using the right shade.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try my new palette, but I found the colors to be highly pigmented compared to the drug store eye shadow I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The quality of these shadows makes them worth far more than the cheap price they actually sell for.</li>
            <li> Lovely color payoff great for the price similar to my Urban Decay Naked Palette</li>
            <li> The shadows stay on all day, and they have a beautiful subtle shimmer to them.</li>
            <li> I like going for classy and pretty looks, as opposed to super bold colors.</li>
            <li> The shimmer is good for me but if you love high glitterly shimmer, you probably want a different palette or wet the brush beforehand.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wear your Eye Shadow primer and it will last all day.</li>
            <li> Love the colors - no smell like a different Coastal Scents palette I received</li>
            <li> Another thing I did not like most of the colors where all shimmer only around 4 matte&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I think this is better than Urban Decay&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> and I will probably try more items from this brand as well simply for the value in the price.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $54 for just one Naked palette.</li>
            <li> and i love the colors overall</li>
            <li> Not to mention i received it a whole week before the shipping said i would!</li>
            <li> VERY blendable!  </li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty and so pigmented.  </li>
            <li> definitely recommend this pallet :)</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty much an exact match.</li>
            <li> first but it on.</li>
            <li> Nice colors,easy to apply,better than i expected</li>
            <li> My first ever coastal scents palette.</li>
            <li> It is pigmented but overall it&#x27;s an ok palette.</li>
            <li> Has a bit of a funny smell, but nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li> It actually makes the palette lightweight, slim and compact- and better for travelling.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do justice to how pretty the shadows are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get this instead of the urban decay palettes.</li>
            <li> The colors are all so pretty and usable.</li>
            <li> This was my first eyeshadow palette to buy on amazon</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product.</li>
            <li> pretty pigmented...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested, just get it.</li>
            <li> :) I wish they made another one with different colors.</li>
            <li> And not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred more matte colors that is why I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars.</li>
            <li> They are all so similar in shade, color, and too many shimmery colors.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this palette and its only been day 1</li>
            <li> Anyway, I suggest looking at the actual website before purchasing just to make sure there aren&#x27;t any sales going on for</li>
            <li> This is my first review I&#x27;ve ever written</li>
            <li> I really like this pallet!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I also have one of the naked pallets and this pallet is surprisingly better.</li>
            <li> fast delivery!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only things that would have made it better would be a mirror and some titles to the shadows.</li>
            <li> first time I used it was to go out in.</li>
            <li> Use a fluffy brush with a good primer.</li>
            <li> Very nice mix of neutrals, some matte, some shimmery, but workable for older eyes with a few lines.  </li>
            <li> I love all the colors and shipping was fast and not a single crack or break in any of the colors!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an easy, natural makeup look.</li>
            <li> but amazingly I have absolutely no issues with these shadows!</li>
            <li> I normally spend the big bucks on the Naked palettes, but I am so happy I came across this product before going to a nearby Ulta.</li>
            <li> These have decent pigment in the shimmers and are fun to wear.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you are looking for something similar to the NAKED palette as I think this is a good comparison.</li>
            <li> I love this palette so much that I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only 20$.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and light weight cardboard with no mirror, and there&#x27;s a good variety of shade types like shimmer, metallic, and matte.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, transfer is a little messy, but for the price this is really a quality product  - not too shimmery either, just lovely...</li>
            <li> and it came in super early !</li>
            <li> Might work best with a good primer as it tends to get a little cakey throughout the day, but the pigments aren&#x27;t disappointing.</li>
            <li> Good colors and decent intensity of the pigment, but a little chalky.</li>
            <li> She  liked them so much that she&#x27;s  now ordered the concealer palette and a professional set of brushes from the same company.</li>
            <li> and I could just imagine what it would look like on my skin, but when I received the palette and tried it on for the first time, it was much lighter than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really know what to do with it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just as good, if not better in quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, not much fallout at all.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last all day strong, it does fade.  </li>
            <li> The biggest difference between this and Urban Decay is that these shadows seem looser packed, but it&#x27;s not crumbling loose-- just more easily loosened when you run a brush over it.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful to use one light and quick swipe</li>
            <li> I bought it because I love the Naked palettes by UD and wanted to add more colors to my collection, for less than 1/2 the price of UD.  </li>
            <li> Dupes for the urban decay naked palettes and can get so many looks with it!</li>
            <li> All the colors are so vibrant on the skin!</li>
            <li> This pallette will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need as much of the product compared to other brands because the color is a great payoff!</li>
            <li> but this is a great look alike and some of the colors are almost dead on for the naked palette.</li>
            <li> Really inexpensive&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great alternative for the naked pallet  if you are looking to save some cash for the same quality and colors as the naked pallets.</li>
            <li> I have really been getting a lot of use out of mine.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are not as pigmented as the others, but I find that they are still workable without much fuss.</li>
            <li> and I feel these colors work very well on me</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it blends as well.</li>
            <li> I really like these colors and the product.  </li>
            <li> Smooth application and last forever .</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> (vain, much?</li>
            <li> and you can really see the color.  </li>
            <li> I have even given this as a present to a friend because I enjoy it a lot.</li>
            <li> It swatches really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> It came in the mail fast.</li>
            <li> None of the shadows were broken, and the colors looked great, in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Using one of the tutorial charts I had copied, I tried out the Revealed colors.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to like this one.</li>
            <li> advice is to save your money and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend too much money on this product.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented with no fallout issues for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really top-quality.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy.</li>
            <li> She REALLY likes this set.  </li>
            <li> but there are mistly shimmer shades with much overlap/similar colours.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you are getting a high quality product!</li>
            <li> Also very blendable.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation of the shadow is deep and the texture is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented for women of all colors!</li>
            <li> but just didn&#x27;t wanna spend that much.</li>
            <li> The picture does not do this pallette justice it really truly deserves.</li>
            <li> Colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors stay on all day and are very pigmented</li>
            <li> She loves the fact that she can blend the colors to the look she wants.</li>
            <li> they are creamy and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> also a lot of ladies here are saying that some of the colors are so sparkly or too shiny, I did put on one color that had too much glimmer.</li>
            <li> I was really worried to spend money on eye shadows at all because I have never had much luck with them...</li>
            <li> it stays really</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got just about all the colors I want, although I would have liked a few for matte colors, but I can do a lot with this.</li>
            <li> This is an okay naked dupe but the shadows really aren&#x27;t nearly as pigmented and don&#x27;t wear as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with the popular comparison of this palette to the Naked palettes by Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> It has a nice selection of eyeshadows similar to the Naked 1 and 2 pallette.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m completely and utterly satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> , the colors look beautiful, there was a plastic that covered the eye shadows, there was only a small smudge on one of my colors (I&#x27;m guessing from packaging)</li>
            <li> I love the way the shimmering ones look I am planning to purchase the other palettes with burgundy color.</li>
            <li> however be sure to use a primer as in the summer they have a tendency to crease due to increased sweating and oil in the face</li>
            <li> They have amazing color pay off and last all day long.</li>
            <li> The colors were pretty but much too shimmery for my 50 year old eyes.</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and very creamy.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely blown away by the pigmentation and how gorgeous these shadows apply.. Definitely comparable to the naked one and naked two palettes..</li>
            <li> Packaging was great, I was worried about receiving a broken palette but there were no problems &amp; it literally got here a week &amp; 2 days early!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care if it doesn&#x27;t exactly have all the colors of the Naked palettes because the colors are pretty anyways.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft &amp; pretty pigment.</li>
            <li> Almost all of the colors are dark and better suited for the lid and crease.  </li>
            <li> Not bad enough to return but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I had looked over all the tutorials, and even jotted down my favorite combinations, in hopes that I would (someday) get one of the palettes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> $20 for 20 shades was still a bit high, for my available budget, but I could justify it... as long as they worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a broke college student it is not very easy for me to afford MAC, but honestly, I am so glad I found got this.</li>
            <li> , half baked is passable which is my FAVORITE color of them, there&#x27;s no dupe for snakebite, no dupe for chopper, and no dupe for smog.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been wanting to try out the NAKED Palettes by Urban Decay but just haven&#x27;t had the money or want more bang for your buck, THIS IS IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the Urban Decay Naked pallets, and I got these to compare.</li>
            <li> However, my sister in law said she actually likes these BETTER than her naked pallets..</li>
            <li> Even without the Fix+ though, it makes the shadows more wearable as they aren&#x27;t too intense or harsh in color.</li>
            <li> I do prime with this mainly out of habit, and it lasts literally all day.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li> A Much better price than the more expensive eye palette s..</li>
            <li> so many people in the reviews compare this to naked and naked 2, i wonder whether or not they have them.</li>
            <li> Because i&#x27;v only tried a few colors but good deal and price compared to paying $50 ..</li>
            <li> Highly Pigmented, Buttery shades&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> And I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product ❤</li>
            <li> High pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> On par with high end shadows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shadows are highly pigmented, they are creamy and glide onto your lids.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Color payoff and texture are fantastic, shades work very well with each other, and they stay all day without creasing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about ordering revealed 2 in the future due to the amazing quality.</li>
            <li> a little :)</li>
            <li> Comparatively, these are a little more flakey and not as velvety when applying..</li>
            <li> but I was expecting a little more of color</li>
            <li> Wish the colors showed up a little better.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a DUPE for the Urban Decay Naked 1 and 2 palette if you are looking for something more affordable!</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many matte shades, however, so I won&#x27;t be using this for everyday makeup because i don&#x27;t use shimmery colors except during formals or parties.</li>
            <li> Such pretty colors and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Would have liked at least a couple more&lt;</li>
            <li> Not only that, my eyeshadow STILL looked freshly applied when I took it off...</li>
            <li> I struggled finding a good eyeshadow palate that wasn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive, and this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, I love the gold shadow.</li>
            <li> I will use it most everyday.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I felt as though the colors performed more like Wet N&#x27; Wild (of my youth) or ELF (the latest to take over cheap over-the-counter eye shadows!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the money, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> and I travel with this pallette all the time as it can give a great all around day, or night, casual, or formal look.  </li>
            <li> The colors are all the same rectangular shape but some of the colors are packed to the top and some were filled only half way.</li>
            <li> I have never had this reaction with any other shadow--super cheap ones or high end.</li>
            <li> I guess no longer worked right so some of the eyeshadow on that side had leaked out since it couldn&#x27;t shut properly.</li>
            <li> Great color selection, not chalky at all, a bit of fallout but no more than any other eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, but I use a cheap primer and they stay on all day without budging).</li>
            <li> and these are my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always wear makeup, but this palette makes me want to try new things every day.</li>
            <li> Because of that I had doubts whether the product was new or used.</li>
            <li> Not only did I save a load of cash, but this palette has a dupe for every single shade in the original naked palette, and most shades in the naked 2.</li>
            <li> So one day i came upon this and looked at it for a long time and pretty much raved over it.</li>
            <li> They are also very soft</li>
            <li> hi, so i was pretty new to makeup, but i wanted to get a naked one or two palette</li>
            <li> so far!</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty close to UD Naked palette.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and was completely sold!</li>
            <li> As others have said, it&#x27;s a combination of the first two Naked palettes put together.</li>
            <li> This is an EXACT Dupe for all the colors from NAKED 1 &amp; 2 except for two colors!  </li>
            <li> daily i really recommend this!</li>
            <li> I had enough warning that I did my primer and eyes, first...</li>
            <li> This is the first big palette I have ever bought</li>
            <li> I bought this as a dupe for the Naked palette and though they are obviously not exact matches, I&#x27;m pleased with the colors.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I tried it several times and the first time I noticed sore lids after I removed it (7 hours or so)--the</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t find a broad enough range of deep to light brown colors in this pallet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the price of the more well-known palettes (i.e. Urban Decay ect.)</li>
            <li> the black is deep and lovely.</li>
            <li> Much more colors than the naked palettes, for half the cost.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to both naked one and two.</li>
            <li> I had a professional makeup artist who uses the inspiration of this</li>
            <li> I originally really wanted the Naked 2, but upon coming across this palette, I decided to give it a go after I did my research.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t look like an 11 year old or a dancer.</li>
            <li> This palette far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I only apply this once a day and it lasts the whole</li>
            <li> 39 yrs old.</li>
            <li> My daughter had this one on  her &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; so I surprised her with it, and sent it to her for &amp;#34;no reason&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> Very comparable to the Naked Palettes by UD.</li>
            <li> You can keep it looking natural and thats the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and they last all day with primer.</li>
            <li> I think nearly every color except</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my 22 yr old w/sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I really want to get the second palette they have.</li>
            <li> Came fast too (with in 3 days with regular shipping)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I still like the natural look it gives.</li>
            <li> Easy for work, casual, or special occasions.</li>
            <li> Starting from left to right like reading a book.&lt;br /&gt;Matte: 1,4,5, and 7.&lt;br /&gt;Shimmer</li>
            <li> I mean more pigmentation?</li>
            <li> Colors are a very very close match to both the UD Naked and UD Naked 2 palettes together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a primer but the only colors you may need one for are the matte ones, especially the first shade.</li>
            <li> I only have to reapply if it is hot and sweaty outside.</li>
            <li> , they said, so you were ACTUALLY duping 20 shades, and getting three extra &amp;#34;near-shades&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> These show up on me better than the Naked palettes for a small fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powdery compared to Naked, I barely have to touch it with my brush.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dupe of the naked and naked 2 palettes from Urban Decay and this is better than I ever expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The shadows are highly pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li> amazing wraping not a single shade was broken.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of extra fallout but if you blow your brush before applying it you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> SO much that I ordered Revealed 2 not too long after.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty not much fallout.</li>
            <li> I compared this side by side with my daughter&#x27;s Urban Decay Naked palettes and, if there is a difference in the color or pigmentation, I certainly couldn&#x27;t detect it.  </li>
            <li> The shadows are pigmented, soft, and wear just as long as some of my high end eyeshadows with primer.</li>
            <li> (Naked had duped a couple of shades from 1, and gave them new names in 2</li>
            <li> The colors are not as intense as the Naked palettes, but adding a bit of Mac Fix+ on the brush before application makes the colors identical as I compared with my cousin&#x27;s Naked palette.</li>
            <li> but I really do recommend that people buy this item if theyre looking for something similar to the Naked palette</li>
            <li> Some are bold and you need not to apply heavily and others are translucent without a primer.</li>
            <li> i have had as much fall out from more expensive pallets.</li>
            <li> always problems with fallout, major creasing, fading, pigmentation..etc.</li>
            <li> a primer, the eye shadow is a bit loose, but still very pigmented.</li>
            <li> and im very much into makeup but for the average user and someone who just needs some neutral essentials this is for you, if you wanna pay for the quality buy the nakeds.</li>
            <li> I just wish that a few of them didn&#x27;t go on as dark as they do as I have had to blend them more with lighter shadows</li>
            <li> power/color payoff were just so-so compared to other products available from other brands at lower price points (</li>
            <li> While 20 dollars (plus shipping) doesn&#x27;t seem like much, I wish that I would of spent the money on quality brands.</li>
            <li> Barely pigmented.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I feel there are not enough highlighting colors you would use on the top of the eyelid.  </li>
            <li> These colors are all very pigmented and there&#x27;s a wide range so you can do a look for any occasion.</li>
            <li> It contains similar colors to the Naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes by Urban Decay, but is obviously much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I just barely dip my brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this palette for about 4 months and it looks like it&#x27;s barely been used.  </li>
            <li> No regrets on this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was basically the first eyeshadow pallete I&#x27;ve ever bought, and being a bit inexperienced, opted for the cheaper version of Naked palettes.</li>
            <li> To verify for those of you who can&#x27;t tell by the photo (like me), the pot on the second from the right, bottom row is a gunmetal grey - it is not blue (I always thought this and the pot on the Naket palette were blue!).</li>
            <li> It came pretty quickly, no damage or anything.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using all my other high end eye shadows because I have everything I need in this one palette!</li>
            <li> the eye-shadow was not broken, I will be ordering the other shades</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;used forever, and I had a problem with applying too much color, so when I tried to remove some with a tissue it just smudged all&lt;br /&gt;over, and then I tried washing it off with soap and water and it just smudged more, so I used cold cream to get it off.  </li>
            <li> A little heads up do not buy the 88,120, and higher pallets.  </li>
            <li> You only get a few matte shades but the ones you get are just the right ones.</li>
            <li> This pallet is a major dupe for the Urban Decay Naked Pallets.</li>
            <li> The palette is thin and sleek so it would be easy to throw into a bag for travel.</li>
            <li> Great product, fallout&#x27;s not too bad, and it lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> Somewhat pigmented, NOT long lasting.</li>
            <li> got it in, nothing was broken and everything looked fine.</li>
            <li> Each color has not too much but not too little amount of eye shadow.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than the nakeds but MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> As a previous owner of a Naked Palette, I have to say expectations ran high for this product (since everybody seemed to purchase this palette as a less-expensive substitute).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to fit into my purse but big enough to where I can use it everyday for a year and not hit pan.</li>
            <li> Very little fallout and a much cheaper option than urban decay&#x27;s naked line.</li>
            <li> could seriously almost this is an exact dupe, with extra shades and a smaller price to pay.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I waited so long to buy this.</li>
            <li> I use a wide variety of products like Bare Minerals, Too Faced, Smashbox etc.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again but that may be a long time since it is lasting forever.</li>
            <li> Colors last a long time if you use a primer before hand as with any eyeshadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe 4 of the colors are flat colors</li>
            <li> the pigmentation is very similar &amp; it also lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I have barely touched my other palettes since I got this palette seven months ago.</li>
            <li> Some of the mattes are a little powdery with less colour payoff, but overall I really like the palette.</li>
            <li> I love the Naked palettes, but was looking for a less expensive version to travel with.</li>
            <li> The palettes are bigger than I would have expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> As long as I dab off the excess powder before I apply, I never have fallout.</li>
            <li> They stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Received a day earlier than expected and the product is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;Picture</li>
            <li> It shipped earlier than expected as well.</li>
            <li> i am not a professional makeup artist</li>
            <li> A few of the eyeshadows have a little fall out but easy to look past that..</li>
            <li> The other downside is that they&#x27;ve changed in consistency over time, especially the glittery ones.</li>
            <li> i wore naked on one eye and revealed on the other.</li>
            <li> Shipment was very fast, and the pallet was wrapped in bubble wrap with no shadows broken.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a single one I haven&#x27;t used - and mind you</li>
            <li> I think I will use every single shade in this palette.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eyeshadow colors can get really loose</li>
            <li> Why spend the money on an Urban Decay palette when you can buy two of them for less than the price of one?</li>
            <li> For less than $20 you get the majority of the colors in the Urban Decay Naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes, which would cost $108 typically.  </li>
            <li> next time it started bothering me sooner and today within a half an hour I had to remove the shadow.  </li>
            <li> This is a really SERIOUS dupe of Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 1 and Naked 2 palettes all baked into one.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to reapply about every four hours, but it&#x27;s not a big deal!</li>
            <li> Wide range of neutrals&lt;</li>
            <li> I actually returned it as there was no color showing after trying a few of the colors.</li>
            <li> I can choose a different color everyday and still have options.</li>
            <li> found a few complaints, but the same complaints were posted about &amp;#34;Naked...</li>
            <li> fall-out was minimal, upon application.</li>
            <li> so I really do not have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s packaging was not as expected.</li>
            <li> The colors were just as she expected.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> For this price you can not really pass it up.  </li>
            <li> Personally if your looking for neutral eye pallet for everyday and evening wear LORAC Pro is the way Togo.</li>
            <li> Product is what I expected</li>
            <li> By no means, do I wear makeup daily, but this palette has forced me to for the last couple of days.</li>
            <li> The pigment is not good, you have to keep dipping your brush to build and the chalkiness is such a big problem-</li>
            <li> My daughter seems to like the colors, but wow the shipping charge was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> With this stuff, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly wasted A LOT of money with different eyeshadow products and being very disappointed because the color looks good when you buy it</li>
            <li> Very little fall out and the color last over 8 hours.</li>
            <li> but other than that, it was alright.</li>
            <li> Some of my other shadows I have to cake on to see the color.  </li>
            <li> I received a small sample quad in one of my monthly beauty subscriptions and on the back it says desert bloom....</li>
            <li> not sure what that means in relation to this specific palette...</li>
            <li> Like Naked but less than half the price!</li>
            <li> I have taken the three (smaller) palettes that I USUALLY pack, and I will be taking &amp;#34;Revealed,&amp;#34; instead.</li>
            <li> and you can get some other type of palettes at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> the irritation left and I had no more problems.  </li>
            <li> Its so affordable compared to other palettes in the market.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken; my palette was wrapped in plastic, new and everything.</li>
            <li> I use the black with a wet angled brush to do my liner, but I never though the rest of the colors.</li>
            <li> I have UD, Max, Benifit, The Balm, Ben Nye, and half a dozen other brands in my case.  </li>
            <li> and I was wearing the copper, a medium brown and dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I am not an expert but its not as dark as another shadows.</li>
            <li> The colors are really dark when applied.</li>
            <li> I ordered late Tuesday night, with the estimated delivery being the next Monday-Wednesday but received it this Friday afternoon just in time for the weekend!</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the matte colors sometimes get chalky and can leave a lot of fallout when you apply them.</li>
            <li> Eye shadows last for at least 8 hours</li>
            <li> Came early, non of the shadows broken.</li>
            <li> Took all my other eyeshadows out of my makeup kit!  </li>
            <li> I would also equate their quality to those palettes, and at half the price, you are getting a ton of bang for your buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am black and some of the colors didn&#x27;t work well for me</li>
            <li> The strength of the pigment may be less than the inspiration product, but I find that since I use a primer, that is not an issue.</li>
            <li> I previously had an otterbox</li>
            <li> Knock you brush slightly to get rid of excess and reduce fall off.  </li>
            <li> (yes, even the black has mica flecks in it).</li>
            <li> Color payoff isn&#x27;t good--to get an idea I have to pack it on about three times to get less saturation than one time with my mac eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> but at half the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette from the coastal scents website on black friday for $9.95</li>
            <li> /metallic: 2 (slight shimmer), 3,</li>
            <li> This is really not a good dupe for naked</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> I like the colors, and there seems to be little fall out,</li>
            <li> There is little fallout and the color stays all day</li>
            <li> What can I say mattes by their nature are just a little chalky.  </li>
            <li> maybe a little fall out but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use a shimmer color on my crease and these colors are very dark for an everyday eyelid</li>
            <li> Not too bad, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I find that the shimmery shades are redundant.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday</li>
            <li> These will wear off or just disappear after a few hours.</li>
            <li> But missing the mark.</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for that pallet everyday.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of shimmery eyeshadows and a few matte.</li>
            <li> I even used a few of the purple tones with a butterfly costume.</li>
            <li> twice the colors for half the price!</li>
            <li> but no this palette is turning out to be even worse than even the less expensive drugstore brands like wet n wild or elf.</li>
            <li> I use this palette everyday and can pull off a lot of different looks with little chance of going wrong.</li>
            <li> The biggest disappointment is that even when I used these shadows with a potted primers and other brand long-wearing potted cream shadows as bases these don&#x27;t last!!</li>
            <li> Some colors do have a little fallout but that is common with any glittery shadows.  </li>
            <li> You need very little product and get very little to no fall out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste  your money!</li>
            <li> pigmented and i use it everyday!</li>
            <li> but i ordered the wrong one i wanted the revealed two, but the oddest thing is the box shiws a picture of the revealed 2 on the back instead of what comes inside?</li>
            <li> Reviews said this was a UD Naked pallette dupe, sorry not even close.  </li>
            <li> Also, when apply,there is a bit of fall off but nothing excessive.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> It is really hard to explain which colors I used to my friends.</li>
            <li> Lots of fallout and some colors hardly show at all.</li>
            <li> the price point made it hard to justify buying.  </li>
            <li> The colors look different depending on your lighting (natural or artificial) but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this eye-shadow.  </li>
            <li> I am an not a make up artist but know ones who do not own a quarter of the amount of make up I do.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this item, because I did not want to pay the crazy amount just like others for the naked palette, I wore two of the colors today for work and not a smudge was on my face when I looked in the mirror tonight</li>
            <li> I guess this is a dupe for the UD Naked2 palette which is like 60 bucks (seriously)</li>
            <li> Seriously..</li>
            <li> AND the fall out after tapping excess off while applying whether with a brush or sponge applicator is crazy and just not appreciated.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t fade in the least bit!</li>
            <li> it was a very late night).  </li>
            <li> really not that bad</li>
            <li> Some of the shadows in the palette were broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> and I wanted another case to look at because I was tired of the otterbox</li>
            <li> To keep this short, the case was a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> otherwise the eyeshadow gets dusty all over the palette.</li>
            <li> I received it and one of the color palettes are already broken.</li>
            <li> The few bad ones made me iffy though.</li>
            <li> (browns sometimes make me look ill).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I spilled a glass of tea on my laptop, I decided $54 was too steep for a makeup palette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so Sad</li>
            <li> There are shimmery, and matte options, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Pallette is very thin.</li>
            <li> Bad and poor</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I was unhappy with an expensive purchase I made and returned.</li>
            <li> I like that the colors aren&#x27;t crazy and I will wear them all at one point or another.</li>
            <li> The browns are disappointing.</li>
            <li> Tons of colors to choose from, never get bored!</li>
            <li> quality was really bad.</li>
            <li> I have NOTHING bad to say about this..</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was in no way disappointed.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed by the pigmentation of these.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with any Coastal Scents product.</li>
            <li> I was not at all disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this palette.</li>
            <li> I use NYX milk as a base and put these on.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I put on a base and layered and layered them it would work.  </li>
            <li> of the positives is the matte shades - I like to use these to get a base shadow/s on the eye and then use the shimmery shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am not at all disappointed!</li>
            <li> When applying it though, the fallout is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great pigmented palette! Has good staying power when used with a primer. Only drawback is the lack of a mirror but for the price this can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Without a eye shadow primer, my husband couldn&#x27;t even tell I had eyeshadow on and I was wearing the copper, a medium brown and dark brown.  With e.l.f. Mineral Eyeshadow Primer this palette is great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> So good, especially for the price! If you&#x27;re looking for the &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; without the Urban Decay price, this is it!</li>
            <li> Just like the Urban Decay eyeshadow pallet but with more colors! Good quality eyeshadows that blend together nicely and can be mixed and matched!</li>
            <li> So happy with this palette! I use the eyeshadows with a primer and they go on so easily and the colors are amazing! I normally spend the big bucks on the Naked palettes, but I am so happy I came across this product before going to a nearby Ulta. I would recommend this palette in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Great colors, go on smoothly, and blend easily.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  These are quality eye shadows, and the packaging is great.  It is paper based, and has a magnetic closure.  The only thing I would like to see added is a mirror.</li>
            <li> Some of the shadows in the palette were broken when I received it. I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. This is such a great eyeshadow palette at an awesome value. Very comparable to both naked one and two. I always recommend this to anyone about to cough up 50+ bucks on the more expensive option.</li>
            <li> My fiancee loved it. I recommend to anyone pondering on whether to purchase</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been wanting to try out the NAKED Palettes by Urban Decay but just haven&#x27;t had the money or want more bang for your buck, THIS IS IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could seriously almost this is an exact dupe, with extra shades and a smaller price to pay. The palette is absolutely beautiful and I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to try out something new or just a big neutral palette or looking for the perfect gift to a makeup obsessed lady out there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem, for me, is that this does not have a mirror. But that&#x27;s easy to overlook!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Really inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- Wide range of neutrals&lt;br /&gt;- Highly Pigmented, Buttery shades&lt;br /&gt;- Absolutely beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- No mirror (if that matters)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*PICTURES INCLUDED FOR REFERENCE*</li>
            <li> These colors are absolutely beautiful. They go on smoothly, blend easily and last all day. With some of the cheaper shadows they will flake and get into your eyes, but these do not.&lt;br /&gt;I use an all over prime before doing my foundation and do not use a shadow primer after, but these still go on with amazing pigment that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Naked palettes from UD and I can&#x27;t tell a difference in quality between those and the Revealed palettes. I just hope Coastal Scents doesn&#x27;t jack up the prices like UD.&lt;br /&gt;And I am also very happy with the quantity. The palettes are bigger than I would have expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a Naked user, you&#x27;ll definitely be satisfied with these!</li>
            <li> Very nice color palette and good quality product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who is in a dance performing group. She wanted The Naked 2 palette but I had second thoughts about spending $54.00 on eye shadows.  After some significant research, I chose these.  Don&#x27;t regret it.  They a fantastic and great quality.  She  liked them so much that she&#x27;s  now ordered the concealer palette and a professional set of brushes from the same company.</li>
            <li> Got the best shades of eye makeup. so far!</li>
            <li> I purchased both Revealed and Revealed 2 and wow, what amazing shadows. I use NYX milk as a base and put these on. They have amazing color pay off and last all day long. Beautiful eyeshadows, I will repurchase. And I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can not express how amazing this color pay of is. You need very little product and get very little to no fall out. They have some satin, shimmer, and matte. Amazing colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an overall amazing palette.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful colors in this pallet. Great alternative for the naked pallet  if you are looking to save some cash for the same quality and colors as the naked pallets.</li>
            <li> I love these shades. The quality is nice. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I got this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money for the UD Naked/ Naked 2 palettes. It applies nicely and is pretty pigmented. I wouldn&#x27;t say its just as pigmented as UD, MAC or Lorac shadows but the pigmentation is nice and doesn&#x27;t look chalky or have much fallout. As long as I dab off the excess powder before I apply, I never have fallout. Has staying power too</li>
            <li> This product has good variety of colors. Each color has not too much but not too little amount of eye shadow. I love how I can mix up the colors and bring out new looks every day. One thing I do not like about this eye shadow palette is that the colors don&#x27;t have name. It is really hard to explain which colors I used to my friends. Other than that, the colors are great, price is affordable, and size is perfect. I would buy it again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I bought this palette cause the colors looked amazing and I could just imagine what it would look like on my skin, but when I received the palette and tried it on for the first time, it was much lighter than I anticipated. I couldn&#x27;t even see some of the colors, and another thing was that bits and pieces would fall off, so you may have to apply more on throughout the day. The great thing about this palette is that it was affordable and the if you apply a good enough amount onto your face, you will be able to see the colors, and it looks really nice. I would recommend this if you are looking for something similar to the NAKED palette as I think this is a good comparison.</li>
            <li> I love the Naked palettes, but was looking for a less expensive version to travel with. This has a fantastic variety of colors for a great price. The biggest difference between this and Urban Decay is that these shadows seem looser packed, but it&#x27;s not crumbling loose-- just more easily loosened when you run a brush over it. I have super sensitive eyes and these sometimes make my eyes water, but that&#x27;s not out of the norm for me. I just wish they were all sparkly!</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and show up wonderfully. Pleased with this palette.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. The shinners shades are the reason I bought it and they are beautiful. Price was awsome too. Will buy again if I go threw it.</li>
            <li> i love it it works so good</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.  I love every color, it goes on easily and stays on.</li>
            <li> A good starter palette for getting the hang of smokey eyes or nudes. Might work best with a good primer as it tends to get a little cakey throughout the day, but the pigments aren&#x27;t disappointing.</li>
            <li> LOVE this palette. Bought my daughter the UD NAKED palette couple years ago for gift and this is absolutely as good. Same colors and quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Great value and good quality</li>
            <li> Love the palette. Very nice colors.</li>
            <li> Lots of fallout and some colors hardly show at all. Don&#x27;t waste  your money!</li>
            <li> This palette is gorgeous. The colors are so beautiful and the shadows are really pigmented. It&#x27;s half the price of the more well-known palettes (i.e. Urban Decay ect.) but it&#x27;s just as good, if not better in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The shadows stay on all day, and they have a beautiful subtle shimmer to them. Great bargain for great colors. Pigment lasts, and the fallout is similar to my UD Naked 3 so I can&#x27;t complain. I compared with my friends actual UD Naked 1&amp;2 palettes and even she is impressed at the matches. Really glad there is a clear plastic sheet protecting the shadows, it&#x27;s also pretty useful if you want to label the shades with the UD names! Helps if you&#x27;re following a tutorial, then you can be sure you&#x27;re using the right shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I included a photo of my labeled palette!I don&#x27;t think that I can say anything that hasn&#x27;t already been said about this palette. I have really been getting a lot of use out of mine. Some of the colors are not as pigmented as the others, but I find that they are still workable without much fuss. The color selection really is beautiful and I think that most anyone who likes pinks and berry tones would enjoy this palette.</li>
            <li> There have been lots of reviews saying that it&#x27;s a dupe for the Naked 1 and 2. I wouldn&#x27;t know because I don&#x27;t own those palettes. I don&#x27;t really care if it doesn&#x27;t exactly have all the colors of the Naked palettes because the colors are pretty anyways. They&#x27;re so pigmented and easy to put on. There aren&#x27;t many matte shades, however, so I won&#x27;t be using this for everyday makeup because i don&#x27;t use shimmery colors except during formals or parties. This is a great price for good quality shadows. The Naked palettes are about $55 each and this is just $20. You might even get a bigger discount if you&#x27;re signed up to get emails from Coastal Scents because they&#x27;re constantly having sales and promotions. I think I might buy the Revealed 2 soon too.</li>
            <li> Love this palette!  The colors are rich and vibrant.  Goes on very smoothly.  Some colors do have a little fallout but that is common with any glittery shadows.  Will purchase again for sure!</li>
            <li> Bought this palette as a dupe for the Naked palette. I love it! The colors are beautiful and highly pigmented. This product stays put all day. I get a ton of compliments when I wear looks with the colors from this palette. I would definitely recommend. What a steal for quality makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a great dupe for the famous Naked palette! The shadows are pigmented, soft, and wear just as long as some of my high end eyeshadows with primer. The packaging looks sort of flimsy in the photos but it&#x27;s actually quite sturdy and my palette arrived in perfect condition. I am fair with very cool toned skin and I feel these colors work very well on me (browns sometimes make me look ill). If you&#x27;re on the fence, I encourage you to check out the many blogs who have swatched this palette to get an idea of the quality. My only regret is that I waited so long to buy this.</li>
            <li> I love it! I love all the colors and shipping was fast and not a single crack or break in any of the colors! This is perfect for nude looks!</li>
            <li> Definitely a good alternative to the Naked palette and much cheaper. Very similar colors. I first sampled in my Birchbox and now I love that I own the whole palette.</li>
            <li> I like this set. Beautiful colors and not very expensive, especially if you&#x27;re just getting started in makeup.</li>
            <li> So much better than spending $60 +  on an Urban Decay pallet. Coastal Scents never disappoints. Just make sure you wear your Eye Shadow primer and it will last all day. By all day I&#x27;m talking application at 6:30 am and on when I got home at 6 pm</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I am so in love with the palette! Super pigmented colors and beautiful packaging. First time buying Coastal Scents product, but this palette is a must buy! Nothing was broken; my palette was wrapped in plastic, new and everything. Thinner than I expected although I am more than satisfied. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would prefer matte colors in the palette</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this palette. SO much that I ordered Revealed 2 not too long after. It&#x27;s fantastic &amp; my shipment came in perfectly with everything in tact.</li>
            <li> I have always been Leary of brands like Cpastal Scents and BH Cosmetics.  Most of these brands have such tacky bright colors that most people would never wear in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw the Revealed 2 palette, I knew I had to have it!  The colors were perfect and such a great mix of mattes and shimmer!  I received the Revealed 1 in my Boxycharm and I was super impressed with the colors and the pigmentation with such a reasonable price tag for a palette of this size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have the bug pocket book for purchasing UD Naked line, this is the perfect affordable option!  I actually prefer these Revealed palettes over the Naked series and I&#x27;m a HUGE UD fan.  I honestly think the pigmentation of the Revealed is better than the Naked!!  The size of the shadows are really nice and should last you quite awhile!!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints with the Revealed palette. It has nice colors and wears for a long time. It lasts through my hectic work day. I really like the way it blends as well.</li>
            <li> I love the colors! The quality was great, stayed on we&#x27;ll all day.  The packaging was excellent, so nothing could have broken.</li>
            <li> pigmented and i use it everyday!</li>
            <li> im in love the colors are great it stayes good time use it with a primer and it will look just like the naked</li>
            <li> This is one of the best palettes I own! The colors are gorgeous and highly pigmented. They are also very soft so they go on very smoothly and are easily blendable. Not a lot of fallout under eyes is a plus as well.</li>
            <li> Not too bad, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I love how pigmented the colors are, except for maybe like 3 of them. Colors are pretty close to UD Naked palette. Packaging was great, I was worried about receiving a broken palette but there were no problems &amp; it literally got here a week &amp; 2 days early! (:</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette. The colors are pretty and nicely pigmented and last all day. Great dupe of the UD Naked palettes but at the fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> LOVE this palette. I use both high end and drugstore makeup and this palette lasts longer and has much better application and pigment than several of my high end popular brands. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I like it but there are a lot of shimmers, which can be great but I was hoping for more transition/natural crease colors. There&#x27;s one matte that I like but it&#x27;s pretty light for my brown skin</li>
            <li> The shadows are really nice but i ordered the wrong one i wanted the revealed two, but the oddest thing is the box shiws a picture of the revealed 2 on the back instead of what comes inside?</li>
            <li> I really like these colors and the product.  Applies easily, what more can you say!</li>
            <li> Such pretty colors and very pigmented. Goes on smooth. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> So pigmented!! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love all the colors!!!</li>
            <li> Love this palette!  Just like Naked!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It provides color to eyelids without being extravagent or gaudy.  It is easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.  It came on time, and was packaged well.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an easy, natural makeup look.</li>
            <li> Love the colors - no smell like a different Coastal Scents palette I received</li>
            <li> I love this!  So many options to choose from.  It goes on super easy with the primer I got here too, and stays all day.  I like the colors, and there seems to be little fall out, if any.  (I always wait until after my eyes to do under eyes just in case).  I will probably buy these as presents....I recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing palette! Everything arrived perfectly!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors! Compare to the Urban Decay Naked Palette! Great dupe!</li>
            <li> Love love love ! Smooth application and last forever . Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE these eye shadows!! So happy I bought them. I use a wide variety of products like Bare Minerals, Too Faced, Smashbox etc. and these are my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, use it more than my urban decay.</li>
            <li> cant complain.. i love it</li>
            <li> There is no reason to pay a bunch of money for the naked palatte. I completely love this one so much more. It has all the perfect neutral colors. I will be purchasing it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> My sister received a sample palette in her birch box and she gave it to me. I tried it once and was completely sold! It&#x27;s very smooth and lasts all day without reapplication. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or cause the lid crease line. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I like this palette but wish it had more matte colors. I still use this palette everyday, and the coverage is great. I do not use the pink-ish colors so I may grab another palette from this company.</li>
            <li> Reviews said this was a UD Naked pallette dupe, sorry not even close.  I actually returned it as there was no color showing after trying a few of the colors. Maybe if I put on a base and layered and layered them it would work.  They product also seemed a bit crumbly when you put some of the product on the brush, not creamy and smooth.  Another thing I did not like most of the colors where all shimmer only around 4 matte&#x27;s.  I really wanted to like this but it was not to be.</li>
            <li> Great bargain for great colors. Pigment lasts, and the fallout is similar to my UD Naked 3 so I can&#x27;t complain. I compared with my friends actual UD Naked 1&amp;2 palettes and even she is impressed at the matches. Really glad there is a clear plastic sheet protecting the shadows, it&#x27;s also pretty useful if you want to label the shades with the UD names! Helps if you&#x27;re following a tutorial, then you can be sure you&#x27;re using the right shade. I included a photo of my labeled palette!</li>
            <li> By no means, do I wear makeup daily, but this palette has forced me to for the last couple of days. It is BEAUTIFUL. The pigmentation in each pot is outstanding, and the shimmer of some of the shades is enticing. Once applied, I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at myself in the mirror (vain, much? a little :) ).The matte colors are stunning, and all colors blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a lid primer by habit, but the Coastal Scents Revealed colors stay on a long time on their own. I would recommend using something like Smashbox Photo Finish primer or my favorite, Laura Gellar Spackle (both clear) to ensure their pure colors show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would happily equate the colors of this palette to a mix of the colors in the Naked / Naked 2 palettes. To verify for those of you who can&#x27;t tell by the photo (like me), the pot on the second from the right, bottom row is a gunmetal grey - it is not blue (I always thought this and the pot on the Naket palette were blue!). I would also equate their quality to those palettes, and at half the price, you are getting a ton of bang for your buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this so much, I&#x27;m purchasing the Revealed 2 Palette as we speak. This is a wise investment for anyone starting out with makeup and experts alike. Simply gorgeous!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff the color looks great and stays on a long time. its nice and easy to blend with other colors! i would recommend this is anyone especially for this price</li>
            <li> Very nice palette with good price</li>
            <li> The colors are lovely I must say. Somewhat pigmented, NOT long lasting. Only one shade does not have any shimmer at all. They all have LOTS of shimmer. Would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> I love this set. I was looking for a more budget friendly set that would last a longer time. These do just that. I really liked the colors. I am black and some of the colors didn&#x27;t work well for me but the rest looked amazing.</li>
            <li> This pallet is amazing. My step mom got this for me for my birthday and I was pleased. This is all I use now, and absolutely in love with the gold&#x27;ish color ! Also has a great color to highlight the bottom of your eyebrows!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! everything I wanted is in this palette!</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palette</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to the naked palettes, this is definitely what you&#x27;re looking for. I love this palette! The colors are great and very pigmented. There is little fallout and the color stays all day (I also use eye shadow primer - recommended).</li>
            <li> The shadow goes on great and stays on all day.  The color selection is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great colors that last!</li>
            <li> just recently got this in the mail. you can tell it cheap by the packaging, but I thought the colors were pretty good. pretty good pigmentation, but a lot of the colors looked very similar to me. but other than that, it was alright.</li>
            <li> I wore eyeshadows from this palette to prom. This, with ELF eyeshadow primer, stayed on all night and didn&#x27;t smudge. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this pallet for 8 months and I can 100% say this is a good product for a good price. I&#x27;ve used this more than my UD pallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the positives is the matte shades - I like to use these to get a base shadow/s on the eye and then use the shimmery shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the negatives ... I find that the shimmery shades are redundant. The medium shimmery browns are basically the same. The other downside is that they&#x27;ve changed in consistency over time, especially the glittery ones. They feel  dryer and have a lot of fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line -- absolutely worth purchasing the pallet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I think this is better than Urban Decay&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love, love LOVE this palette!!!!! All the colors are so vibrant on the skin! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a cheaper option to some of the more expensive brands of eyeshadow. I like that the colors aren&#x27;t crazy and I will wear them all at one point or another. I just wish that a few of them didn&#x27;t go on as dark as they do as I have had to blend them more with lighter shadows so they aren&#x27;t as drastic. I have a feeling this set will last me awhile though which is definitely a good thing and I will probably try more items from this brand as well simply for the value in the price.</li>
            <li> I received the eyeshadow palette on Thursday and they are awesome. I love the way the shimmering ones look I am planning to purchase the other palettes with burgundy color. I definitely recommend them!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this. I had a professional makeup artist who uses the inspiration of this see it and they were very impressed with the quality and colors. Perfect combination of all the natural and neutral colors you want. The strength of the pigment may be less than the inspiration product, but I find that since I use a primer, that is not an issue. I will purchase again but that may be a long time since it is lasting forever.</li>
            <li> I just LIKE it.. Don&#x27;t love it. I love the Urban Decay Naked pallets, and I got these to compare. Comparatively, these are a little more flakey and not as velvety when applying.. However, my sister in law said she actually likes these BETTER than her naked pallets.. So its a matter of preference I suppose.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors, wayyy better than my Naked Palette that I paid more than double for!  Tons of colors to choose from, never get bored!</li>
            <li> these last all day on my eyes. Compares to UD. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> Like many others, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $54 for just one Naked palette. I originally really wanted the Naked 2, but upon coming across this palette, I decided to give it a go after I did my research. As others have said, it&#x27;s a combination of the first two Naked palettes put together. Every color can be duped from both Naked palettes in this palette, except for one which is Chopper from the Naked 2. The color pay off is excellent, the texture is very smooth and silky, and blends like a dream. The colors are not as intense as the Naked palettes, but adding a bit of Mac Fix+ on the brush before application makes the colors identical as I compared with my cousin&#x27;s Naked palette. Even without the Fix+ though, it makes the shadows more wearable as they aren&#x27;t too intense or harsh in color. I own the Lorac Pro palette in addition to this,  and I would say the texture is just as comparable.</li>
            <li> Awesome dupe for UD Naked palette, I love the colors, very pigmented and easy to blend.</li>
            <li> I love the Coastal Scents Revealed palettes.  For the price, you get a high-quality, beautiful product that I have never had a complaint about.  Excellent colour, smooth application, minimal fallout and the size of the palettes is perfect.  Not a perfect dupe for prestige palettes like Urban Decay Naked, but an excellent option for those of us unwilling or unable to shell out over $50 for each Naked palette</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the more expensive nude colored palettes out there. This is a really great value for $20 (what I originally paid). All the shimmery shades are buttery and creamy. I don&#x27;t use a primer but the only colors you may need one for are the matte ones, especially the first shade. This is my go-to eyeshadow palette! It&#x27;s small enough to fit into my purse but big enough to where I can use it everyday for a year and not hit pan. The color pay off is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> Cute beginners palette.</li>
            <li> love this palette came a good condition ! and i love the colors overall id say it was a good purchase .</li>
            <li> I already had Coastal Scents Revealed 2, so I knew what to expect and I was in no way disappointed. Why spend the money on an Urban Decay palette when you can buy two of them for less than the price of one? Very little fall out and the color last over 8 hours. The colors in the palette are BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li> OMG Im in love! I did my homework and this is the best pallet for the price! Not to mention i received it a whole week before the shipping said i would! Great great great!!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors! Very similar to my Urban Decay Naked2 pallete</li>
            <li> I was expecting this pallets to be heavier for some reason but nonetheless, its the shades that are of importance; the colours are beautiful for my skin tone and I am of African decent.</li>
            <li> I like this eye shadow.  It goes on well and you can really see the color.  Some of my other shadows I have to cake on to see the color.  Not so with this.  With this stuff, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply!!!!!!! Last all day!!!!!</li>
            <li> This has lasted me forever. I can choose a different color everyday and still have options. I love to mix the colors and this shadow stays on throughout my day. I only have to reapply if it is hot and sweaty outside. Very nice set. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the revealed pallet. For less than $20 you get the majority of the colors in the Urban Decay Naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes, which would cost $108 typically.  The colors in this palette are great, and the shadow quality is very nice though a few shades have a bit of fall out. I would definitely recommend that you try this out!</li>
            <li> Love love love this eyeshadow! This is my favorite pallet to date, the shadows are awesome and glide on easily.</li>
            <li> LOVE this eye shadow so much. I&#x27;ve used MAC eyeshadow before, and I have to say, the pigmentation is very similar &amp; it also lasts a long time! The colors are very easy to work with. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase &amp; I&#x27;m planning on buying Revealed 2 as soon as I can(:</li>
            <li> This is an EXACT Dupe for all the colors from NAKED 1 &amp; 2 except for two colors!  Same creamy texture.  GREAT staying power.  VERY blendable!  I love this plaette!</li>
            <li> I own a ton of makeup and this is a really great palette. The quality isn&#x27;t as good as urban decay but it&#x27;s close. I have even given this as a present to a friend because I enjoy it a lot. If you don&#x27;t want to splurge on eyeshadow that is 30 dollars more than this then this is the palette for you. If you&#x27;re just a beginner or you wear neutrals daily i really recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love this palette so mucha great buy :) Very very happy with it! Its like the knock off of the Naked palletes!</li>
            <li> I always use primer before the eyeshadow.  But this eyeshadow looks great, lasts a while and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed by the pigmentation of these. Some are bold and you need not to apply heavily and others are translucent without a primer. I&#x27;d pass.</li>
            <li> Bad and poor you stole my money</li>
            <li> They are perfect an exciting colors.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is a little smaller than the nakeds but MUCH cheaper. Love the color selection and the quality.</li>
            <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
            <li> I love the colors. I have the Revealed 2 palette as well and just like that one, when you using brush to pick up the eyeshadow from palette, there is some fall off. Also, when apply,there is a bit of fall off but nothing excessive. Great pigmentation! The shimmer is good for me but if you love high glitterly shimmer, you probably want a different palette or wet the brush beforehand. Definitely use a primer on your eyes to bring out the colors in this palette. It&#x27;s a great dupe for Naked 1 and 2. In fact, I kept the plastic cover over the shadows and labeled them with the Naked color dupe names.</li>
            <li> Pigmentation and wear exceeded my expectations. Colors are a very very close match to both the UD Naked and UD Naked 2 palettes together. All neutrals.I am happy that black is in the palette! Pigmentation is en pointe both  with and without primer. I never had to reapply. packaging is made of cardboard so it was super lightweight but i don&#x27;t mind that. I&#x27;m super happy I did not shell out $55 for each of the UD Naked series palettes. So glad I found this alternative!</li>
            <li> Shoutout to Coastal Scents for being absolutely amazing and saving my life. They have made a beautiful palette that one can actually easily afford instead of shelling out $100 for the two palettes we all know this is imitating, and they didn&#x27;t have to sacrifice much of anything other than the packaging.  The quality of these shadows makes them worth far more than the cheap price they actually sell for. I wear colors from this palette every day and for every occasion. I have barely touched my other palettes since I got this palette seven months ago. The shadows are excellent dupes of Naked 1 and 2, and they are of amazing quality. They feel great, and they stay on all day (with a primer--I have extremely oily skin, but I use a cheap primer and they stay on all day without budging). They all blend together beautifully and allow for countless looks.  I have no complaints about this product whatsoever. They are gorgeous. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again, and I recommend it to people all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this palette. Very little fallout and a much cheaper option than urban decay&#x27;s naked line. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! The colors are so pretty and so pigmented.  I don&#x27;t always wear makeup, but this palette makes me want to try new things every day. Seriously, love it. I guess this is a dupe for the UD Naked2 palette which is like 60 bucks (seriously) so this palette is such a great price. Definitely satisfied!!</li>
            <li> For some reason the colors are chalky and ashy like. I used a primer but the colors weren&#x27;t true on my eyelids. I will try it again with a different primer and see how it does.</li>
            <li> Lots of nice neutral colors that look great. Much better quality than drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> Really good value. I was surprised that there were so many metallic/frosted shadows. Would have liked at least a couple more&lt;br /&gt;matte shades...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> Good overall colors and fairly durable for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my son&#x27;s girlfriend and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Great neutral colors and good blending quality. Nice alternative for those who don&#x27;t wish to shell out $50 for the Naked pallets.</li>
            <li> The shadows are creamy and smooth without being chalky. The colors look different depending on your lighting (natural or artificial) but not in a bad way. It&#x27;s really nice how some of the colors are matte, most have sparkle, and they all allow you to make your own custom look in multiple shades to compliment your skin. Ex: Rose shades, Warm Metallics, Highlight colors, and Deep smoky shadows for drama. Seller is amazing as well. Please check her out if you can.</li>
            <li> Love !! They&#x27;re soft &amp; pretty pigment. They&#x27;re easy to blend and look beautiful in the eyes. If you don&#x27;t have or don&#x27;t want to spend money on Urban Decay Naked &amp; Naked 2 definitely recommend this pallet :)</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow palette. There&#x27;s such a variety of amazing neutral colors in both shimmer and matte finishes. Definitely happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I think its a beautiful palette for women of color also.</li>
            <li> This palette is so pigmented, I&#x27;m a make up artist and it blends so perfectly. I was looking for a dupe of the naked and naked 2 palettes from Urban Decay and this is better than I ever expected it to be. I use it on all of my clients! I have stopped using all my other high end eye shadows because I have everything I need in this one palette! You are getting the quality of a $60 eye shadow palette for a quarter of the price. It is definitely worth buying! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I previously had an otterbox and I wanted another case to look at because I was tired of the otterbox so I bought this one. To keep this short, the case was a piece of crap. I took it off and now I&#x27;m selling it.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Great product but I was expecting a little more of color I mean more pigmentation? I am not an expert but its not as dark as another shadows. Too much &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; shadows and just a few matte.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. It&#x27;s beautiful and the price is great! I have never been disappointed with any Coastal Scents product.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific palette!  At first I didn&#x27;t really know what to do with it so I watched some YouTube videos on smokey eyes and it worked nicely. I love this palette!</li>
            <li> Its a good pallet. The colors are pretty not much fallout. Matte and shimmery shadows are awesome. Very blend able and they do stay on for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I received a small sample quad in one of my monthly beauty subscriptions and on the back it says desert bloom....not sure what that means in relation to this specific palette...I love both the shimmery two and the more matte two I got. They look beautiful when put together and blended. The shimmer is just enough. You can see it but I don&#x27;t look like an 11 year old or a dancer. By default, I always use an eyeshadow primer anyway...so the colors pop and they do last.</li>
            <li> pros: the shadows are so soft and silky and have excellent pigmentation. also  i received this in 1 day i ordered it friday it got here saturday.&lt;br /&gt;cons:NONE&lt;br /&gt;would i recommend : YES! its not a must have but if you want the naked palettes this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Best investment ever!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have the naked palettes but they are running out so I got this as a replacement. Colors are pretty much an exact match. There is a little bit of extra fallout but if you blow your brush before applying it you&#x27;ll be fine. It&#x27;s not enough fallout to be a nuisance. Colors last a long time if you use a primer before hand as with any eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy for the price and to replace or try the naked palette colors!</li>
            <li> It swatches really well. Very good dupe for naked 3... It&#x27;s not going to be as good as naked, but it&#x27;s really really good for the price. Would definitely big again. Might have to bc my friends keep borrowing it!</li>
            <li> I have to say I was really impressed with this palette. I have never owned the Naked palettes, and have heard that these were are pretty a good dupe for them. I was not at all disappointed. The color payout is excellent, and there is very little fallout. To be fair I have yet to come across a shadow that has no fallout at all, if you find one please let me know! I do prime with this mainly out of habit, and it lasts literally all day. It stays in place and looks just as flawless when I&#x27;m about to remove it as it did when I first but it on. I really do love the colors too. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes. There are three colors that it doesn&#x27;t dupe, but for the money, it&#x27;s a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
            <li> Great palette! Like Naked but less than half the price!</li>
            <li> Nice colors,easy to apply,better than i expected</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful palette!!! So comparable to the UD that it is remarkable. The packaging isn&#x27;t as luxurious but the quality of the shadows themself are equal in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and snatch this up!</li>
            <li> My first ever coastal scents palette. The colors are really dark when applied. I&#x27;m still practicing to blend and match colors, but it works really well :)</li>
            <li> Very pigmented &amp; smooth! Definitely getting the 2nd one!!</li>
            <li> This palette far exceeded my expectations.  :)  There are 20 shades that are rich and beautiful.  They are very pigmented.  The matt shades are a bit on the light side, but I use them on my brow bone for a highlight.  It&#x27;s extremely economical compared to the Naked2 or Naked3 palettes.  I could not bring myself to spend the money on those, so this Revealed Palette was the perfect compromise!</li>
            <li> Perfect naked palette dupe</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this pallet. I have watched many of my favorite beauty bloggers on you tube and decided to purchase it. 90% of the colors are very highly pigmented and buttery smooth. I will be purchasing more of the coastal scents products</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase but it is not as good as NAKED2. The price fits though, the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I was unhappy with an expensive purchase I made and returned. It was a  Smash-box Full Exposure eyeshadow pallete for $52. The shadow wasn&#x27;t pigmented and bled all over my face. So i returned it and bought this Revealed palette and have used it twice and am very happy so far. It&#x27;s got just about all the colors I want, although I would have liked a few for matte colors, but I can do a lot with this. I paired this purchase with Lamora brand eye makeup brushes and love everything so far. I would recommend this palette to anyone looking for a great product that&#x27;s affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached a pic of my makeup for the day. The only thing I forgot was to apply a primer. Had I done that the eyeshadow would have looked even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> It came in the mail fast. I love the pigments, there are some shimmery and the rest are matte. Great deal for a great product</li>
            <li> I like this palette ، nice color easy to apply it ،I recommend this palette and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I had been longing for the Naked palette trio, for some time. I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend around $50-$62 for ten eyeshadows. I had looked over all the tutorials, and even jotted down my favorite combinations, in hopes that I would (someday) get one of the palettes.&lt;br /&gt;While searching these tutorials, I kept running across people who SWORE that this palette held dupes for 17 of the most popular shades in 1 &amp;2 (Naked had duped a couple of shades from 1, and gave them new names in 2, they said, so you were ACTUALLY duping 20 shades, and getting three extra &amp;#34;near-shades&amp;#34;). So, I began researching &amp;#34;Revealed.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I found a few complaints, but the same complaints were posted about &amp;#34;Naked...&amp;#34; namely, fall-out.&lt;br /&gt;Last weekend, I decided to go for it. $20 for 20 shades was still a bit high, for my available budget, but I could justify it... as long as they worked.&lt;br /&gt;I received my palette, yesterday... THREE DAYS (counting Sunday) after ordering. None of the shadows were broken, and the colors looked great, in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Using one of the tutorial charts I had copied, I tried out the Revealed colors. To my amazement, it looked EXACTLY like the look I had been going for, in the tutorial! Not only that, my eyeshadow STILL looked freshly applied when I took it off... 14 HOURS LATER!&lt;br /&gt;Today, I tried a second &amp;#34;look.&amp;#34; The results were equally gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;The fall-out was minimal, upon application. I had enough warning that I did my primer and eyes, first... then, if there WAS any fall-out, I could remove it before doing the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, we are preparing to head out to cover 10 races, within the next 12 days. I have taken the three (smaller) palettes that I USUALLY pack, and I will be taking &amp;#34;Revealed,&amp;#34; instead. Whether you are going for a dailywear, a smokey, or a glamourous look, this palette has you COVERED!</li>
            <li> nice shades with a good price.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness where do I begin, the colors are beautiful, the pigmentation is awesome, and it lasts ALL DAY LONG! It arrived in perfect condition and I started using it right away. I loved it so much that I decided to buy the revealed 2 and 3 pallets as well. Just fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I chose this palette since I was debating between the Naked palettes but this one combines a lot of the colors and I have already used almost all the colors in just one month. Very happy</li>
            <li> very happy with the quality of this eye shadow pallet. It is a duplicate to the Urban Decay Naked 1 &amp; 2 for a fraction of the price! Amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this pallette. Wish there were more matte colors but still great colors. Use this everyday</li>
            <li> Not as good as it is made to seem. I got this after wanting the naked palette and seeing all the hype about it this one as a good dupe on youtube. I realized that these girls on youtube might have more of an inclination to say good things about it because they got their palettes for free while I paid for it. The pigment is not good, you have to keep dipping your brush to build and the chalkiness is such a big problem- I read this before I got it but I figured its just makeup snobs who want perfection but no this palette is turning out to be even worse than even the less expensive drugstore brands like wet n wild or elf. I will stick to my nude tude palette which is way better alike and give this one away. This is really not a good dupe for naked don&#x27;t be fooled like I was. For the price you can get better ones at a pharmacy or just a little more and you can get some other type of palettes at Sephora.</li>
            <li> I received product super fast. The colors are very pigmented also colors are very amazing. You get the look of the Urban Decay Nake1 and Nake2 but at the fraction of the cost. I would highly recommend this product ❤️</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, I wish I could get my money back. While 20 dollars (plus shipping) doesn&#x27;t seem like much, I wish that I would of spent the money on quality brands. I was really hoping to like this one. I really read all of the reviews out there on it, and got super excited as I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it in, nothing was broken and everything looked fine. When applying it though, the fallout is awful. I have a nice brush set that I use and used primer too, so those really aren&#x27;t the issues. I tried tapping some of the excess off, but then it takes forever for it to build up any color and there is still some fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to save your money and get the real thing. Or buy a brand that you know you already love.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich color that lasts all day - love this shadow set!</li>
            <li> The colors are great for everyday wear. I like that they glide on easily and keep their shimmer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Barely pigmented. I use the black with a wet angled brush to do my liner, but I never though the rest of the colors. They&#x27;re practically transparent, and they don&#x27;t blend at all.</li>
            <li> Would recommend. Just use a good primer under the eyeshadow and it will last all day. This is a very nice natural color palette and it has a very nice deep blue. I love it. Use it daily- with different color combinations.</li>
            <li> Great purchase! Beautifully pigmented colors</li>
            <li> Great set of colors! They go on really well and have a great neutral selection.</li>
            <li> For the price, this palette is excellent- with blendable, highly-pigmented colors. The only way it could be better is if there were more matte options- most of the shades included are iridescent- but I am still able to wear most of these colors in the daytime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok palette, it is better than elf products and has very pretty neutral colors. It is pigmented but overall it&#x27;s an ok palette. Don&#x27;t spend too much money on this product. I paid twenty but it should be retail at 16.99.</li>
            <li> Very blendable, perfect travel palette, I had just purchased the Lorac Pro and the Naked 3, and wanted a smaller palette with more typical &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; colors, and this is just perfect. Has a bit of a funny smell, but nothing to worry about.  Had it for about 3 months now and I still love it!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of four of these colors in my birchbox and I was hooked. I never used eye shadow before but now I am a convert. The colors are really great and natural looking. They stay on for a long time. Absolutely love this palette.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching a lot of review/tutorials on Youtube. They say it&#x27;s a dupe for the much more expensive Naked 1 and 2, which are neutral palettes. I already owned the Revealed 2, which I loved, so I decided to get this too. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but from swatching it, some of the colours, particularly the shimmers, have a nice buttery consistency and good colour payoff. Some of the mattes are a little powdery with less colour payoff, but overall I really like the palette. There is no mirror in the palette, which isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, though some might call that a drawback. It actually makes the palette lightweight, slim and compact- and better for travelling.</li>
            <li> nice palette. Wish the colors showed up a little better. This is the first big palette I have ever bought so I really do not have anything to compare it to. I would recommend I guess.</li>
            <li> Lots of beautiful colors in comparison to the Urban Decay palette except at a fraction of the price. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use all the colors yet, but used some of the light colors and it sure is pigmented and blends well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadow colors can get really loose so I have to be careful to use one light and quick swipe otherwise the eyeshadow gets dusty all over the palette.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s packaging was not as expected. I thought it was going to be sealed in a Saran-like plastic but instead it came as is. Because of that I had doubts whether the product was new or used. Nevertheless, it will still do okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a mixture of naked palette 1 and 2. Very pigmented. Just as with any eyeshadows, make sure you wear a primer on the lid before applying them. But overall, the cheapest and closest you&#x27;ll get to the naked palettes.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Very pigmented with no fallout issues for me. I also don&#x27;t use an eyeshadow primer and these shadows still standout and stay put all day. Overall, it&#x27;s probably the best budget dupe of Naked 1/2. I use this palette everyday and can pull off a lot of different looks with little chance of going wrong. Would be an excellent palette choice for someone just starting out with makeup as there is little chance for error with the well coordinated colors.</li>
            <li> amazing pallet! Came early, non of the shadows broken. This pallet is a major dupe for the Urban Decay Naked Pallets. When I swatched the shadows I realized how amazingly buttery and smooth they are. Pigmentation is great and so is the color range. Definitely better than expected and surprisingly good for a $15 pallet.</li>
            <li> Awesome palette. Rich colors, apply easily and stays put. I honestly did not expect it to be so great. I want to apply makeup multiple times a day, just to play with this palette.</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked. I only apply this once a day and it lasts the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like (hence the 4/5 rating) is the fallout.</li>
            <li> I purchased this full size palette after receiving a sample in my monthly Birchbox shipment.  It has great colors with deep, long-lasting pigment.  It&#x27;s really top-quality.  My only complaint is I feel there are not enough highlighting colors you would use on the top of the eyelid.  Almost all of the colors are dark and better suited for the lid and crease.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great product and well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have swatched my local Ulta&#x27;s Naked palette a hundred times, and I was planning on getting myself one as a birthday gift. Unfortunately, when I spilled a glass of tea on my laptop, I decided $54 was too steep for a makeup palette. The Revealed palette, however, has plenty of similar/identical shades, and the quality of the shadows is awesome! I&#x27;m glad that I found this!</li>
            <li> Color payoff and texture are fantastic, shades work very well with each other, and they stay all day without creasing.  These show up on me better than the Naked palettes for a small fraction of the price.  Significantly better than e.l.f. if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> AMAZING deal and an AMAZING product.  I compared this side by side with my daughter&#x27;s Urban Decay Naked palettes and, if there is a difference in the color or pigmentation, I certainly couldn&#x27;t detect it.  With a great product and lightning-fast shipping, this is definitely the deal of the day, ladies...Grab yours now!</li>
            <li> Received a day earlier than expected and the product is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;Picture doesn&#x27;t do justice to how pretty the shadows are. You only get a few matte shades but the ones you get are just the right ones. These colors are all very pigmented and there&#x27;s a wide range so you can do a look for any occasion. $20 is a complete steal for this palette comparatively speaking for sure!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing palette for those of you looking for a cheaper option to the naked palette.  Very creamy. High pigmentation.  Lasts all day. Pallette is very thin. Travels easily. The black on this palette is a great alternative to eyeliner. I am a Caucasian female. 39 yrs old. I love this palette.  If you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend, try this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product!!...My daughter had this one on  her &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; so I surprised her with it, and sent it to her for &amp;#34;no reason&amp;#34;....She LOVES it!!..colors are beautiful, and stay put!! she can be pretty picky about her make up, so if she is happy , that&#x27;s a good review in itself!!...&lt;br /&gt;Shipped very quickly!! 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my daughter. She REALLY likes this set.  She loves the variety of colors to choose from and says the stuff stays on almost the entire day. She says should would want this again and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is absolutely beautiful. My go to palette. Very comparable to the Naked Palettes by UD.</li>
            <li> Nice colors and good dupe.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this eye-shadow set. The colors were just as she expected. Very happy daughter.</li>
            <li> Nice variations of neutrals.  Staying powerIif these shadows are used with a primer.  Knock you brush slightly to get rid of excess and reduce fall off.  I would have given this 5 stars but there are mistly shimmer shades with much overlap/similar colours.  Over all..wonderful ptoduct and great price point.</li>
            <li> The colors were pretty but much too shimmery for my 50 year old eyes.</li>
            <li> Too many shimmer shadows and staying power/color payoff were just so-so compared to other products available from other brands at lower price points (e.g. e.l.f. geo quads). There are NO MATTE colors on the bottom row (yes, even the black has mica flecks in it). I don&#x27;t like to use a shimmer color on my crease and these colors are very dark for an everyday eyelid so 99% of the time I can&#x27;t use anything on the bottom row. The top row is also lacking a good highlight color. The one on the upper left is darker than the photo and is the color of my skin tone--I wear medium beige foundation so for you lighter ladies this will not be a highlight shade. Color payoff isn&#x27;t good--to get an idea I have to pack it on about three times to get less saturation than one time with my mac eyeshadow. Not bad enough to return but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Great colors and good pigmentation..the shipping was fast and I think this palette is a great dupe for the naked 1&amp;2</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying one of the REVEALED eyeshadow kits and so far, I&#x27;m very impressed with it. The colors are beautiful and go on smooth and silky and stay all day. I like the kit itself too with the magnetic closure to protect your eyeshadows from damage. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll probably order the REVEALED II next so I can have even more colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> Dupe for &amp;#34;NAKED&amp;#34; by Urban Decay with similar quality. Love it :) The only shade that doesn&#x27;t have a dupe is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think &amp;#34;Revealed 2&amp;#34; is a dupe for NAKED2 and NAKED3... look it up on google images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the price for double the product..... hmmmm..</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I had been wanting to try it and ended up receiving it as a gift. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it! The colors are fantastic, very pigmented, and they stay on all day. The palette is thin and sleek so it would be easy to throw into a bag for travel. From what I&#x27;ve heard and seen this palette is a great dupe for the Naked1 and Naked2 palettes but at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish they would have added on to the palette is a mirror. Over all though, this is a great buy, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a neutral eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> LOVE this palette! I bought it because I love the Naked palettes by UD and wanted to add more colors to my collection, for less than 1/2 the price of UD.  These colors are beautiful and they are long wearing! I use a primer and honestly, even after going to the gym right after work, these colors still look great! I have gotten so many compliments on my eye makeup since buying these colors.  Anyone can wear these colors! For the price, you are getting a high quality product! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very, very pleased with this purchase!  I&#x27;ve been stalking the UD version but the price point made it hard to justify buying.  This is a great alternative and the colors are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy UD Naked One, if you haven&#x27;t already done so, because this palette is just as good, has more colors, and is from a completely cruelty-free company. And the price? Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Not enough variety in colors. Most r earthy tones. Lasts all day but wud have like a Burgundy or reddish tone...</li>
            <li> These have decent pigment in the shimmers and are fun to wear.  Unbeatable for the price point.  I liked this one so much I will be purchasing the Revealed 2 Palette. !</li>
            <li> This is an okay naked dupe but the shadows really aren&#x27;t nearly as pigmented and don&#x27;t wear as well. I bought this as a replacement for my nearly empty naked pallet but this just wasn&#x27;t nearly the same quality in my opinion so I ended up buying another naked palette anyway</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected. I need more muted tones</li>
            <li> Love neutral colors and this palette is a perfect starter palette for someone who enjoys a smokey to neutral eye. They are gorgeous and very pigmented. Also very blendable.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, the container was broke but the eye-shadow was not broken, I will be ordering the other shades</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try my new palette, but I found the colors to be highly pigmented compared to the drug store eye shadow I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;used forever, and I had a problem with applying too much color, so when I tried to remove some with a tissue it just smudged all&lt;br /&gt;over, and then I tried washing it off with soap and water and it just smudged more, so I used cold cream to get it off.  I&#x27;m going to&lt;br /&gt;stick with it and try again as I just loved the overall color selection.  It&#x27;s not the palette....it&#x27;s me.Need</li>
            <li> This is the BEST palette I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a broke college student it is not very easy for me to afford MAC, but honestly, I am so glad I found got this. It covers smoothly (which isn&#x27;t easy because of my brown skin tone and my slightly oily lids), blends beautifully and this is honestly the first time that I finally have makeup that lasts. Really encourages me too look good.</li>
            <li> Affordable product with great colors. I can create many looks with this palette!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, transfer is a little messy, but for the price this is really a quality product  - not too shimmery either, just lovely...</li>
            <li> Thanks this pallete and the seller  specialized beautiful store&amp;#34; are the best  recommended</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this palette. The colors are chalky and go on muddy, not matter what combination you put them in. I don&#x27;t agree with the popular comparison of this palette to the Naked palettes by Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I spent a couple weeks using this palette to try a variety of looks and give all the colors a good try. I&#x27;m so Sad - I really LOVE all of the colors in this palette, they&#x27;re so pretty and all super prefect colors. The biggest disappointment is that even when I used these shadows with a potted primers and other brand long-wearing potted cream shadows as bases these don&#x27;t last!! These will wear off or just disappear after a few hours. AND the fall out after tapping excess off while applying whether with a brush or sponge applicator is crazy and just not appreciated. I had to hold a tissue under my lower lashes to avoid all the shadow dust on my cheeks and nose!</li>
            <li> This was a great dub palette, reminds me of the smashboxx or too-faced palettes you can buy, for a lot cheaper. There are shimmery, and matte options, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Love this pallett  pretty colors fast shipment good packaging</li>
            <li> I had the Urban Decay 1 and 2 but both got destroyed. I couldn&#x27;t justify spending over 100 dollars for eye shadow no matter how much I loved it so when I saw this i figured i&#x27;d give it a try...I am not at all disappointed! These are just as good, highly pigmented and stay put through the day and into the evening. Didnt even need a primer! I&#x27;ve been wearing some of the shadow from 6am and its now 6pm and no smudges and none has come off...Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Shipment was very fast, and the pallet was wrapped in bubble wrap with no shadows broken. Very happy customer here!</li>
            <li> Very nice mix of neutrals, some matte, some shimmery, but workable for older eyes with a few lines.  I&#x27;ve got a lot of neutral palettes, but this is the one that stays out where it&#x27;s handy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a beginner. I love matte colors and even though it has with shimmery and shear shadows, it not as shimmery so you can wear it without that sparky look. You can keep it looking natural and thats the reason I bought it. Recommend it to anyone who wants to create a nude look :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this palette! The pigmentation of the shadow is deep and the texture is fantastic. It shipped earlier than expected as well.</li>
            <li> OK.. Kinda cakey looking</li>
            <li> this eyeshadow are great and like the UD palette without the high price and the colors are with high cuality pigments that stick and last for hours.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> colors were not as pictured. Also, the one I received had been used.</li>
            <li> Came BEFORE the estimated time which is great and I love this palette</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and is just perfect!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Absolutely love coastal scents! This palette is very pigmented and the colors are amazing. Can&#x27;t wait to buy the revealed 2 pallete next!</li>
            <li> Best eye shadow palette I own. It is definitely a dupe for the naked palettes. Quality is beyond amazing. I can&#x27;t wait to buy the Revealed 2</li>
            <li> Pigmentation was good&lt;br /&gt;But quality was really bad.</li>
            <li> really great. pigmented creamy blend-able</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this eye-shadow.  The colors are very nice but the powder doesn&#x27;t stick well when I am applying it and some of the powder color ends up under my eyes if I am not careful</li>
            <li> This palette is absolutely GORG!!! I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it yet. It looks so nice unused it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t want to use it at all!! LOL!! It is definitely a DUPE for the Urban Decay Naked 1 and 2 palette if you are looking for something more affordable! And it Arrived in a timely manner as well..</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the Naked palette. Very good value for the price and good range of colors.</li>
            <li> This pallette was a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it. She praised the strength of the pigments and I plan to purchase the Revealed 2 pallette for her as well. Great colors for a price that cant be beat at the same level of quality.</li>
            <li> I struggled finding a good eyeshadow palate that wasn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive, and this is exactly what I was looking for. even my sister (who&#x27;s a makeup artist) fell in love with it after letting her use it on me. the colors are gorgeous and long-lasting, and complement each other nicely. awesome for day and night wear!</li>
            <li> It is good and awesome</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think the colors look llike the ones on the picture, didn&#x27;t like the pigmentation</li>
            <li> These are great! They are pigmented and application is smooth and looks great. My only complaint is that I have to reapply about every four hours, but it&#x27;s not a big deal!</li>
            <li> Awesome!! I ordered late Tuesday night, with the estimated delivery being the next Monday-Wednesday but received it this Friday afternoon just in time for the weekend! So many versatile shades that are really nicely pigmented and blend able. The mattes could be a but better but are great for the price!! I I could never bring myself to shell out 50 dollars for the Naked palettes and this seems to be a perfect compromise- twice the colors for half the price!</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this palette! Smooth + huge color payoff!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this eyeshadow palette. A few of the eyeshadows have a little fall out but easy to look past that.. Add an eyeshadow base/primer it will prolong the staying power and intensify the pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money. i love all the colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get this instead of the urban decay palettes. The colors are very pigmented and they last all day with primer.</li>
            <li> Love this color pallet and will be ordering more pallets from this company. ❤️</li>
            <li> Nice colors. Wish it had more matte though.</li>
            <li> Great seller, super fast shipping. Love this palette. The shadows are highly pigmented and last all day. On par with high end shadows.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Palette! The colors are vibrant. Shipping was super fast, and palette came undamaged. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering revealed 2 in the future due to the amazing quality.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing palette! The price is spot on! I would dare to say that this is as good as its high end counter-part!</li>
            <li> Perfect for evening or smoky eyes (:</li>
            <li> Love it! Comparable to &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> best makeup pallette I&#x27;ve ever had. Love the intensity and blending. Definitely would consider a MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried them  yet but looks very pigmented and good colours</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift. The person loved it. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not a makeup expert by any means, I was really pleased with the quality and amount of the eyeshadows for the price. It contains similar colors to the Naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes by Urban Decay, but is obviously much cheaper. There is a bit of fallout, but since I don&#x27;t use foundation or concealer, it was easy for me to clean up after application. If you like to use any kind of makeup on your face, I would recommend doing your eyes first, or holding a tissue under them while applying. Really beautiful, buttery soft shades of lovely neutral colors. I&#x27;m totally smitten.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve bought from Coastal Scents and I have to say I&#x27;m very very satisfied!  I love doing makeup and I&#x27;ve been trying to find great eyeshadow products at a good price. The eyeshadow has great color pigmentation and with that you don&#x27;t have to load on a bunch of the product to actually see the color. I&#x27;ve honestly wasted A LOT of money with different eyeshadow products and being very disappointed because the color looks good when you buy it but when you go to apply you can&#x27;t even see the color. With this eyeshadow pallette that&#x27;s not the case. This pallette will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need as much of the product compared to other brands because the color is a great payoff! Another thing I love about this pallette is the texture is great and very blend able.  I would compare this to urban decay naked pallette but at half the cost. The colors in this pallette are great for every day wear or night wear. I will use every color in this pallette!  This is a must have!!!!</li>
            <li> You know, I really love this. This was basically the first eyeshadow pallete I&#x27;ve ever bought, and being a bit inexperienced, opted for the cheaper version of Naked palettes. And boy was that a good decision! The colors are all so pretty and usable. There isn&#x27;t a single one I haven&#x27;t used - and mind you I like going for classy and pretty looks, as opposed to super bold colors. Perfect for all types of color pallets youre going for that day- be it pink and silvers or golds and browns, it is so perfect. Super easy to use, not much fallout at all. I like that it&#x27;s not all full of sparkly shades either.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great palette for both new and experienced. I&#x27;ve become pretty good! Haha.</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last all day strong, it does fade.  Also what it doesn&#x27;t say or what I missed is that the colors are shimmery.  Maybe 4 of the colors are flat colors all the rest a shimmer that has the product look slightly different in color.  Can&#x27;t say I will buy the product again, but I will use it for a bit until finding another eye shadow to purchase</li>
            <li> Loved it. Great quality and the eye shadows are very pigmented I am one happy customer.</li>
            <li> Beautiful matte and shimmer shades. Highly pigmented for women of all colors!</li>
            <li> hi, so i was pretty new to makeup, but i wanted to get a naked one or two palette but just didn&#x27;t wanna spend that much. So one day i came upon this and looked at it for a long time and pretty much raved over it. I ordered it and got it and was so happy with the results. Very good applying. They do apply well without primer but the results are so much better with so,e!  I would recommend if you can, to buy this from a store because u can use coupons and what not and i ended up paying more than a lot of people who bought it in stores! But i do recommend this product to all happy shopping!</li>
            <li> Gift for a friend and she couldn&#x27;t be happier! She fell in love with them..</li>
            <li> As a user of many high-end eye shadow brands, I am extremely impressed by this palette. The colors are highly pigmented and very creamy.  They blend well and create a wonderful look.</li>
            <li> Perfect match for Naked Palette.</li>
            <li> I bought this pallet after hearing positive reviews on a YouTube video from a girl who did fantastic jobs on her makeup. It is a great dupe for urban decay naked pallets. The colors are very pigmented and smooth :) it lasts all day while I&#x27;m at work. I put primer on underneath all of my makeup.. So that May have some effect. I love this pallet. It came in perfect condition, on time, and I even received a thank you note from the sender. Would buy again!!</li>
            <li> Awesome palette, and really a dupe of the Urban Decay Naked&#x27;s. I use this everyday, I love the gold shadow. Has a lot of shimmer and no fall out.</li>
            <li> Excelent product and seller!!</li>
            <li> I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS!!! Seriously.. for 1/3 of the price of another palette you get the same quality and consistensy. I have NOTHING bad to say about this.. I just barely dip my brush and it&#x27;s plenty enough. Thank you Coastal Scents for this.. I will use it most everyday. I also don&#x27;t mind paying $20.00 for a palette without a mirror.. a $30.00 mirror is not needed.. lol ;)</li>
            <li> My daughter seems to like the colors, but wow the shipping charge was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. I ordered this for my friend as a birthday present and she is a vegetarian and is agains animal testing so this was perfect for her since Coastal Scents does not text on animals. The price was fair and the colors are very pretty and natural, perfect for those who are just getting into makeup.</li>
            <li> This was my first eyeshadow palette to buy on amazon and I really liked it but a lot of the shadows are a bit similar in color but they show up great. There are matte and shimmery shadows</li>
            <li> great product- lots of color choices and they blend well!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will do business with again.</li>
            <li> I am an not a make up artist but know ones who do not own a quarter of the amount of make up I do.  I have UD, Max, Benifit, The Balm, Ben Nye, and half a dozen other brands in my case.  This is the pallete I reach for OVER my 4 UD palletts.  It has a nice selection of eyeshadows similar to the Naked 1 and 2 pallette.  I like these better because I find they wear and blend well and the shimmery shades have a great payoff but without the chunky glitter that can irritate my eyes like the UD brands can.  They shadows go on buttery and with a good primer I have actually fallen asleep with shadow on and woke up with it still in place (I do not recommend this it was a very late night).  The picture does not do this pallette justice it really truly deserves. I took off one star for the packaging not having a mirror!  The case is slim enough for travel and I travel with this pallette all the time as it can give a great all around day, or night, casual, or formal look.  For this price you can not really pass it up.  Better yet sign up for the costal scents newsletters and pick this and pick up the 2nd one too (my favorite all time pallette) when they are on a 50% off sale.  A little heads up do not buy the 88,120, and higher pallets.  They are all premade and are not as good as the revealed pallets or the other pallettes made from the costal scents hot pots.  Thease also have a gew nice mattes in each pallette.  The mattes are about the same quality and consistancy as UD.  What can I say mattes by their nature are just a little chalky.  Good luck and I sincerely hope you buy and love this pallette the way I do!</li>
            <li> Way exceeded my expectation. So creamy and pigmented!</li>
            <li> Iam soo happy thanks :)</li>
            <li> Very good Naked dupe.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a dupe for the Naked palette and though they are obviously not exact matches, I&#x27;m pleased with the colors. It&#x27;s very powdery compared to Naked, I barely have to touch it with my brush. Overall I think it&#x27;s a great palette for the price. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product. I was using urban decay before and for the price difference, I would recommend this to anybody! I love all the colors, and it stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend.  She loves it. A great dupe for the naked and naked 2 . My girlfriend said she will buy from them again.  Wasn&#x27;t damage at all.</li>
            <li> It came pretty quickly, no damage or anything. And its pretty good quality for the price. :D</li>
            <li> it was a great product. the colors blend very nicely. Would buy again</li>
            <li> good staying power on the shadows, minimal creasing, and beautiful shimmer shades. the black is deep and lovely. only complaint is that the matte colors sometimes get chalky and can leave a lot of fallout when you apply them. use a primer with this palette and you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too happy about the pigmentation with this after reading the reviews everyone was saying the eyeshadow was very pigmented. Not true.</li>
            <li> Colors go on well..pretty pigmented...they have  alot shimmer to them if ur looking for that effect. Great palette for all ur warm colors.</li>
            <li> I love this palette so much that I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only 20$. The shades are beautiful and very pigmented, if you love neutral colors and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on the UD Naked palettes, this is for you!</li>
            <li> Wow! This pallete is fabulous! The quality is pretty darn good! I have never bought eyeshadows online before, but this product is great!! Sooo many combos you can make!</li>
            <li> Although the colors were OK I guess I must be allergic to the ingredients.  I tried it several times and the first time I noticed sore lids after I removed it (7 hours or so)--the next time it started bothering me sooner and today within a half an hour I had to remove the shadow.  As soon as I took it off and put on something else the irritation left and I had no more problems.  I have never had this reaction with any other shadow--super cheap ones or high end.</li>
            <li> This palette has excellent pigmentation and blend very well however be sure to use a primer as in the summer they have a tendency to crease due to increased sweating and oil in the face</li>
            <li> As a previous owner of a Naked Palette, I have to say expectations ran high for this product (since everybody seemed to purchase this palette as a less-expensive substitute). Unfortunately, I felt as though the colors performed more like Wet N&#x27; Wild (of my youth) or ELF (the latest to take over cheap over-the-counter eye shadows!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TAKE NOTE!!! THIS IS NOTHING LIKE A NAKED PALETTE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this product promptly (but not after going out looking like a 2-cent hooker).</li>
            <li> Good colors with an even mix of shimmers and mattes the only problem I had with this product was when I opened it I noticed there were some smudges of eyeshadow on the outside of the case and upon further investigation I realized the case is magnetized for you to open and close and one side of mine I guess no longer worked right so some of the eyeshadow on that side had leaked out since it couldn&#x27;t shut properly. Might be an ongoing problem but overall great product!</li>
            <li> This is a really SERIOUS dupe of Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 1 and Naked 2 palettes all baked into one. I think nearly every color except maybe Chopper is recreated here, and while the pigmentation might not be as incredible, when paired with a primer the difference is minute at best. This palette is a no brainer even if you&#x27;re only looking to try it. Naked 1 and 2 will set you back over a hundred dollars. Revealed does the job for a fifth of the price. If you&#x27;re interested, just get it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Great quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the description stated more matte shades..... There are three.  Great coverage overall but as I&#x27;m not into sparkling glitter eye shadow I would not order again.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from my birchbox, and I had to have it. These are super high-quality colors. Nice and shimmery but they don&#x27;t have huge sparkles in them (my biggest pet peeve for eyeshadows). I haven&#x27;t tried the Naked palette because I would never shell out that kind of money for it, so I cannot compare. But given what everyone says, this seems like a wonderful alternative.</li>
            <li> Put this and the Urban Decay Naked/Naked 2 palettes side by side. This is the best dupe for them that I have found. No need to spend $50 per UD palette.</li>
            <li> I love it, better than I expected.  :) I wish they made another one with different colors. And not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are very pigmented, easy to blend and go on nice and smooth. They aren&#x27;t chalky. I use eye primer (nothing pricey) and the shadow lasts all day without creasing. It is a great price for what it is. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  great alternative to Naked for people who can&#x27;t afford it!</li>
            <li> I bought this palette from the coastal scents website on black friday for $9.95 and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows are highly pigmented, they are creamy and glide onto your lids. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product to get a beautiful color which is great because I think it will last me quite a while. I&#x27;ve been using this palette for about 4 months and it looks like it&#x27;s barely been used.  If you&#x27;re like me and love neutral colors, this palette is for you! There are 5 matte colors and 15 shimmery colors. All the colors go nicely together so you can mix and match different colors too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tiny thing I didn&#x27;t like about the palette was that the amount of the shadows I received are different. The colors are all the same rectangular shape but some of the colors are packed to the top and some were filled only half way. It makes me feel like I was jipped. BUT the quality and price of this product are so incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best product that I&#x27;ve tried from Coastal scents! If you are going to try anything from this company you should definitely try this one! When I run out, I will be purchasing this again but from amazon to save on shipping.</li>
            <li> Some of the best neutrals I have and so versatile.  They can be used as shadows or as liners and have great deep pigment for the colors.</li>
            <li> Trying to be a Total knock off of urban decay naked pallet. But missing the mark. It&#x27;s Good quality eye shadow.. Creamy, blend-able, and pigmented With that being said. There are only 4 matte shades of color the rest are all shimmery. I would have preferred more matte colors that is why I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars. I also don&#x27;t find a broad enough range of deep to light brown colors in this pallet. They are all so similar in shade, color, and too many shimmery colors. Personally if your looking for neutral eye pallet for everyday and evening wear LORAC Pro is the way Togo. I find myself reaching for that pallet everyday.</li>
            <li> Good colors and decent intensity of the pigment, but a little chalky. Good dupe for the Naked2 palette.</li>
            <li> Great pigment and love the different shades.  Eye shadows last for at least 8 hours</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding makeup and it did not disappoint! You definitely need a primer but it didn&#x27;t fade in the least bit! It was applied at 10am and by 3am it still looked fresh!</li>
            <li> I bought this palette in place of spending a million dollars on the Naked palette and I am pleasantly suprised at how much I love it!  The ONLY downside is that the colors are a lot smaller in person than it looks like in the picture but overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> The shadows are very creamy, good quality .they last all day and don&#x27;t crease, love this palette.  A Much better price than the more expensive eye palette s..</li>
            <li> Amazing quality and great colours... Dupes for the urban decay naked palettes and can get so many looks with it!</li>
            <li> Product is what I expected</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my fiance, so these comments are hers (and not mine)... Very comparable to the Naked palette, great value and the colors are wonderful... These don&#x27;t come across as cheap, they last all day and are stunning to wear!</li>
            <li> Lovely color payoff great for the price similar to my Urban Decay Naked Palette</li>
            <li> Colors are very pigmented. Good quality for a good price Some colors are not that pigmented, but still good. I have tried it without primer and it stays on wonderful too. With primer the colors are beautiful and stay on. Even amount of matte and shimmer color. Perfect for everyday neutral look and smokey eyes.</li>
            <li> so many people in the reviews compare this to naked and naked 2, i wonder whether or not they have them. WELL i have them, there are good dupes for many colors, half baked is passable which is my FAVORITE color of them, there&#x27;s no dupe for snakebite, no dupe for chopper, and no dupe for smog. these are some of my most used shades.&lt;br /&gt;i think this is great for people who dont have the means to buy the naked palettes, but the quality of this is just not as good. i wore naked on one eye and revealed on the other. naked wore a 5/5 and the revealed was like a 4/5. UD has great quality and worth it for the money. and im very much into makeup but for the average user and someone who just needs some neutral essentials this is for you, if you wanna pay for the quality buy the nakeds.</li>
            <li> This pallette is wonderful !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this palette and its only been day 1 okay so there is a tiny bit a fall out but nothing to get bent out of shape it gets the job done and for 25 bucks!?!? No complaints here these have great dupes for the naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes!!!! Will be buying Revealed 2 very soon!!!!</li>
            <li> These colors are so bright and the best part they are very affordable. After watching the reviews on YouTube I had to try them and for the price I paid you get so much more. If you have any doubts about buying this palette buy it you will love it!! This product has been compare to the naked palettes 2 and 3 I have never it used it because of the price but this is a great look alike and some of the colors are almost dead on for the naked palette.</li>
            <li> Package came right on time, lots of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con: I paid 20 bucks for this pallet and after purchasing looked on Coastal Scents website and well what-do-ha-know!? SALE 12.95 each lol! Just my luck.  Anyway, I suggest looking at the actual website before purchasing just to make sure there aren&#x27;t any sales going on for the item(s) you&#x27;re considering buying on Amazon!  Other than that I&#x27;m completely and utterly satisfied with this product! 10 thumbs up (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buttery, creamy: just glides onto my eyelids! Great color selection, not chalky at all, a bit of fallout but no more than any other eyeshadow.  Completely recommend this product.  Excited to get the Revealed 2 pallet!</li>
            <li> i am not a professional makeup artist but i did not care for this eye shadow palette, when i put on my eyes a lot of the colors look similar that it looked like i used one color on my eyes but i used more than one</li>
            <li> I had looked up urban decay. I thought that is what I was getting. I like the colors, but it is kind of flakey.</li>
            <li> Great product. Beautiful colors/quality.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Packaging perfect, colors super nice.</li>
            <li> Great eyeshadow. The colors stay on all day and are very pigmented</li>
            <li> love these for the price.  they are great.  maybe a little fall out but really not that bad i have had as much fall out from more expensive pallets.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 22 yr old w/sensitive skin.  She loves it and the shadow lasts all day.  She loves the fact that she can blend the colors to the look she wants.</li>
            <li> The Coastal Scents Revealed Eye-Shadow is true to the description on Amazon.  Next time I would like to try their warm shades.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeshadow set because of the great reviews that I had read. I was not disspointed. It is a great set, so good in fact that after my daughter borrowed mine, she requested a set for her birthday! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Much more colors than the naked palettes, for half the cost. Great company, some awesome stuff on their web page too.</li>
            <li> im in love with this pallet ! they are creamy and very pigmented. amazing wraping not a single shade was broken. and it came in super early ! definitely worth every penny I paid for it !</li>
            <li> I got it delivered I was happy! On time and it&#x27;s very cute! The make up isn&#x27;t that great but for the price I guess it&#x27;s ok :).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette, the shadows are pigmented but requires a little more blending, which is fine.. It is a great eyeshadow palette for the price!!!! It came in great condition and was super fast shipping!!!!!</li>
            <li> Prettier and sparklier than predicted. Very elegant natural glow. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first review I&#x27;ve ever written and I use AMAZON a lot . These colors are amazing , I would just just as good if not better than naked eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> So far love it! Many compliments!!❤️ give it a 4... Because i&#x27;v only tried a few colors but good deal and price compared to paying $50 .. For the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> Beautifullllllll colours ! Absolutely blown away by the pigmentation and how gorgeous these shadows apply.. Definitely comparable to the naked one and naked two palettes.. This is a great buy ;)</li>
            <li> Best pallete I have purchased on Amazon colors are so pigmented and rich LOVE.</li>
            <li> The revealed is our most favorite eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item, because I did not want to pay the crazy amount just like others for the naked palette, I wore two of the colors today for work and not a smudge was on my face when I looked in the mirror tonight (I worked for 6 hrs), also a lot of ladies here are saying that some of the colors are so sparkly or too shiny, I did put on one color that had too much glimmer. But other than that this palette was beautiful, it does not look cheap, the colors look beautiful, there was a plastic that covered the eye shadows, there was only a small smudge on one of my colors (I&#x27;m guessing from packaging) but I really do recommend that people buy this item if theyre looking for something similar to the Naked palette (you will not be unsatisfied). I really want to get the second palette they have. Also, the item got to my house VERY QUICKLY. I would say it took about 4 days... I AM IN LOVE WITH IT THOUGH. No regrets on this purchase.</li>
            <li> I always read reviews before I buy a something online, and there were mostly good reviews on this product. The few bad ones made me iffy though. Let me just say: I LOVE this eye-shadow! Great product, fallout&#x27;s not too bad, and it lasts a really long time! Worth the money, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the color pay off but the colors is lighter then shown in the pic</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthy dupe. Pigment and consistency are great. Good selection of colors and matte/shimmery.</li>
            <li> I really like this pallet! The colors are very pretty, pigmented, &amp; creamy! I feel like it&#x27;s well worth the money :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s wedding. I wanted a more natural and nude look and I loved it. I love the colors. I am very happy with the quality and price, better than paying for a fortune for the naked palettes.</li>
            <li> I received it and one of the color palettes are already broken.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love... Blends amazingly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m yet to use this palettes but it came in great condition, I&#x27;ve heard many great review about the quality of these eyeshadow pigments, but I&#x27;ll give it try and update this!</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow. I was considering buying the Naked palettes, but decided to buy this cheaper version. I am so happy with my purchase. I have numerous friends, who own Naked palettes, and like my eye shadow more. I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome dupes for the urban decay naked palettes!</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are great. The colors are perfect. Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> seriously SERIOUSLY love my make up!!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and supersaturated color!  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good price and great colors.</li>
            <li> I brought this because I heard it was a dupe for the naked 1 and 2 by urban decay- and I was not disappointed! Not only did I save a load of cash, but this palette has a dupe for every single shade in the original naked palette, and most shades in the naked 2. I was really worried to spend money on eye shadows at all because I have never had much luck with them...always problems with fallout, major creasing, fading, pigmentation..etc. but amazingly I have absolutely no issues with these shadows! I&#x27;ve worn them all day in the heat with sweat, rain...and they stay put perfectly. I don&#x27;t use a primer, but I do wear the covergirl 3 in 1 foundation that claims to have primer built in. The palette arrived undamaged and wrapped in celephane. It&#x27;s thin and light weight cardboard with no mirror, and there&#x27;s a good variety of shade types like shimmer, metallic, and matte.  I&#x27;m very happy with this :)</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed with this product! I also have one of the naked pallets and this pallet is surprisingly better. I love the colors and it is very good quality!</li>
            <li> love the colors!! fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Gosh ! The colors are so gorgeous !! Its so affordable compared to other palettes in the market. I am so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> You tubers showed swatches in comparison to the naked palettes.  They were so similar I couldn&#x27;t resist. Every shade is opaque. Starting from left to right like reading a book.&lt;br /&gt;Matte: 1,4,5, and 7.&lt;br /&gt;Shimmer/metallic: 2 (slight shimmer), 3, 6,8-19, 20 (matte but with glitter as opposed to shimmer).&lt;br /&gt;Without a primer, the eye shadow is a bit loose, but still very pigmented. With a primer it stays really well.&lt;br /&gt;I kept the plastic sheet it came with to the protect the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;The only things that would have made it better would be a mirror and some titles to the shadows.</li>
            <li> These colors last a while. They are very pigmented,  and I love them.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette. It has great colors and really easy to apply. It has a lot of shimmery eyeshadows and a few matte. I use this everyday! The combinations are great and versatile! Easy for work, casual, or special occasions.</li>
            <li> Took all my other eyeshadows out of my makeup kit!  This one is all you need.  Brushes on effortlessly.</li>
            <li> This pallet is ok. I was wanting a rich shimmer chocolate brown. It does not have that or anything close. The browns are disappointing. Has some pretty light nude colors.  But nothing to make brown eyes pop. Won&#x27;t purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; pop.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this palette. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast the palette is gorgeous I could not be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really impressed. Good creamy and not chalky. Better than any higher brands.</li>
            <li> I think I will use every single shade in this palette. Great colors for work or going out... I even used a few of the purple tones with a butterfly costume. I think this will last quite a while as well, since the colors are nicely pigmented. Get this while the price is right.</li>
            <li> i gave them away too oily</li>
            <li> Best eye shadow I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, mostly frosts, berries and purples.  Lots of fallout but still blend able with decent wear.  Use a fluffy brush with a good primer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it. Came in a nice package. Wasn&#x27;t damaged at all. Came fast too (with in 3 days with regular shipping)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it was to go out in. It looked flawless. Stayed on all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s such a great product with a great price</li>
            <li> The material isn&#x27;t chalky at all it has this nice fine solid powder when being picked up by the brush. The colors are just a bit lighter when applied but I still like the natural look it gives. I definitely will purchase this as a gift for a friend of mine.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette with quality colors that stay put, I am just now starting to learn how to really put effort into my makeup without paying an arm and a leg. This is my go to palette for sure!</li>
