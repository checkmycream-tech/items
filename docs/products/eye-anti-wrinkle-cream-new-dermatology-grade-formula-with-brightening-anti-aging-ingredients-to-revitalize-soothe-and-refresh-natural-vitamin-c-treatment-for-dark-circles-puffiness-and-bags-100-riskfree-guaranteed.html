            <li>and it soaked right into my skin with no greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>and I really like the cool gel like cream that you apply under your eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m allergic or what, but each time I&#x27;ve used it, i&#x27;ve experienced eye pain.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>

            <li>I really like this vitamin c face cream.</li>

            <li>Next, it has a very pleasant smell to it that is not necessarily the case with other similar products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Anti-Aging cream and the Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>Just a little seem to go a long way, my skin already feels better!</li>
            <li>So far I have noticed, it makes the area around my eyes feel firmer.</li>
            <li>It makes your hands and face feel unusually soft.</li>
            <li>This cream is so silky and makes the skin around my eyes so soft.</li>
            <li>If you want to look younger around your eyes, then I highly recommend this product!</li>

            <li>It goes on smooth and feels refreshing and doesnt leave any greasy feeling, which i hate feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and absorbs quickly so you can apply make-up almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have dark circles, and this stuff really helps.</li>

            <li> Love this eye gel, very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Great product. I actually got it for my grandma and she loves it. It also smells good. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this! seriously it feels so good when i put it on in the morning and night time.</li>
            <li> Love this! I think I see results only after a week!</li>
            <li> Good eye cream to compliment the Vitamin C serum.  I use both the eye cream and serum and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> No smell, doesn&#x27;t take much product. Was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this vitamin c face cream. The minute I used it I could tell it was a quality product. This is one of the smoothest anti wrinkle face creams I have ever used and it soaked right into my skin with no greasy feeling afterwards. Just a little seem to go a long way, my skin already feels better!</li>
            <li> I got the Anti-Aging Cream and the Eye Gel for my wife. She loves this product and she uses it every day so I had to try it myself. The texture of the cream is VERY smooth and comes out of the bottle very consistently and evenly. My wife says it feels like silk and I promise you will agree. It makes your hands and face feel unusually soft. I personally have been using Cetaphil lotion for years and it looks like I will not be buying it anymore. I just put this Vitamin C cream all over my face twice daily and it feels just as good as the Cetaphil but with the Vitamin C stuff in it. One squirt is enough to put in my hands and cover my entire face and eyes. I put the Eye Gel on as well after the Anti-Aging Cream but I am not sure if I even need the Eye Gel. I use them both because I really like the texture and smell so I figure why not. There is a great Orange fruit smell that lets me know it is the real thing but the smell is very mild and not overwhelming at all. The single bottle will last a while because, like I said, one dab will do ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are close to our 40’s now so we are starting to try these products more and more often. I will likely buy the spot corrector next for my wife. I cannot recommend it yet but if it is as good as these other creams then I would definitely give it a try. I highly recommend the Anti-Aging cream and the Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My mom loves it! Will definitely purchase &amp; recommend to friends/family!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It was delivered fast, and so far, I&#x27;ve liked it. The gel texture allows you to use it sparingly and it spreads well and my undereye area looks better. Well, I think!</li>
            <li> This cream is so silky and makes the skin around my eyes so soft. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good a eye cream.</li>
            <li> Seen improvement in the smoothness of my skin. Also wrinkles aren&#x27;t as visible</li>
            <li> Skin is soft have not noticed an other difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this gel. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m allergic or what, but each time I&#x27;ve used it, i&#x27;ve experienced eye pain. Haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of swelling or anything</li>
            <li> This is OK, but my skin must be super sensitive because it makes me breakout. but it does feel nice when using it.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is great - I would buy again.  Makes under the eyes look smoother - less lines</li>
            <li> Getting older is never easy, but this product definitely helps the aging process to be less noticable.  I have tried several eye creams to minimize the lines around my eyes.  This product made a visible difference with the first few uses.  A little goes a long way and absorbs quickly so you can apply make-up almost immediately.  If you want to look younger around your eyes, then I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works great. It takes a while to see results but it does work</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good thing about this serum. I purchased it with its twin product, Vitamin C Serum for face, they both are wonderful. They are so easy to rub in and absorbs fast. My face feels so smooth and glowing after using it for a week. This eye serum is light but very hydrating. It helps with my puffy eyes. My eyes look/feel so resting the next day.  I can&#x27;t tell about the wrinkle appearance since I don&#x27;t have much. I do love this product and will keep using it. Great company as well, they stand behind their products.    I received a discount in exchange for an hones, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Must go to item for me!</li>
