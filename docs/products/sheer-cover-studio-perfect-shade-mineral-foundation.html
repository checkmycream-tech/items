            <li>Thanks for making this affordable for people like me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>the customer service associated with it was absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li>She told me that if I didn&#x27;t want the package they sent I would have to pay for completely secure shipping so as to guarantee the tracking and it getting back to them.</li>
            <li>I compared it to another recently purchased full product</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>However, - I was very bothered by auto shipping especially after reading the first 2 reviews.  </li>
            <li>It cost me $20.00 to send it back to get back my $100.00 worth of product they should have never sent me in the first place.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks later, I receive a huge monthly package from Sheer Cover...</li>
            <li>Then, the mascara itself was super dry too...</li>
            <li>natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;natural ivory\\&quot; shades</li>
            <li>not heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>If they do, I would be surprised and would stop using it.</li>

            <li>I prefer this product over Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>the product arrived quickly, but the size of the container was extrememly small:  </li>
            <li>Colors are a bit difficult to match completely, might need to mix different colors, but overall, love this product.</li>

            <li> Colors are a bit difficult to match completely, might need to mix different colors, but overall, love this product.</li>
            <li> There was some; he offered some reasonable options like ordering less often, reminded me that the auto-ship program gave 40% less cost, etc.  </li>
            <li> It is also long wearing.</li>
            <li> Also, the mascara, and eyelash extender were dry, so they couldn&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> It also gave my skin a dry, cakey look, which has never happened to me before.  </li>
            <li> The lady on the phone from Sheer Cover told me that there was no record of me cancelling my account and that it was still active.</li>
            <li> He backed off after listening to my fears and said a confirmation would be sent to me in 24 hrs and welcomed me to call if I want to place a single order.  </li>
            <li> and it still isn&#x27;t quite dark enough.</li>
            <li> I expected to have a long argument.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product from Sheer Cover, hoping that I could replace my heavy, oil-based make-up.  </li>
            <li> I had used Sheer Cover in the past</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I spent</li>
            <li> but since several months past I probably cannot.</li>
            <li> I orginially tried out the starter package and after trying it a few times a few different ways I called to cancel my subscription that had AUTOMATICALLY started when I ordered the starter package.</li>
            <li> Sheer cover customer service was rude.</li>
            <li> This item appears to have been previously opened.  </li>
            <li> , so I thought it was odd that out of the two medium shades (buff and latte)</li>
            <li> I initially subscribed from the Sheer Cover company, however I must say that this is less expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coverage was not good, sheer or anything described in the ads</li>
            <li> I have never ordered from a TV paid program before and was a little leery</li>
            <li> Make up looks caked on and feels heavy.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with the packaging-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like those other powders that rub off or the foundations that feel thick on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was confused because I had CANCELLED it long before this.</li>
            <li> There is no better product in my book.</li>
            <li> I was an avid bare minerals user, but it was a little expensive and my pores started getting clogged really badly when I switched to the matte minerals- terrible white heads and acne also.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied!</li>
            <li> Totally not as advertised and terrible customer service from Sheer Cover.</li>
            <li> was just plain weird.</li>
            <li> company has the absolute worst customer service and return procedure, and I would NEVER purchase anything from this company.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover</li>
            <li> Not only was this make-up worthless (the amount you get is pathetic)but</li>
            <li> every 2 or 3 weeks is out of hand expensive.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> All in all, I would say that they may have cleaned up their act and learned from unhappy customers.  </li>
            <li> I told him the auto-shipping still made me feel very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in the amount of makeup that came in the container.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be so mad!</li>
            <li> and I have to say Im sort of disgusted that I paid 20 bucks for this mineral powder and when I opened it</li>
            <li> The concealer was a terrible match --</li>
            <li> So, I still would rather have the freedom of ordering from amazon and not worry about some outrageous bill being sent to me.</li>
            <li> am so disgusted and sickened by this company.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. The size was the larger one so I was very happy</li>
            <li> I had used Sheer Cover in the past but I was disappointed in the amount of makeup that came in the container.  The product itself was fine but it barely lasted me a month.  I assume the ones I have before were a larger size but this size was the biggest I could find.  I will be going back to the drugstore brand of mineral power that last longer.</li>
            <li> Great product, just wish for the price it had more in it.</li>
            <li> I have just started wearing this foundation and I really like it! I&#x27;m 28 and when I wear this foundation I have compliments about my skin saying that I look like a teenager! I love how it&#x27;s lightweight and stays on all day. Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This product is great and I can&#x27;t live without it. It is light and stays all day flawless. I helped me with my acne problems aswell.</li>
            <li> Love Sheer Cover products, this is one of my favorites, goes on evenly, great coverage.  Colors are a bit difficult to match completely, might need to mix different colors, but overall, love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE sheercover, but I cannot pay what they want for the makeup. Thanks for making this affordable for people like me.  I love this makeup and great shipping too.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I  am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> There is no better product in my book.</li>
            <li> Just got my shipment and I have to say Im sort of disgusted that I paid 20 bucks for this mineral powder and when I opened it it&#x27;s like the smallest amount of powder I&#x27;ve ever seen- its enough for about 2 or 3 weeks- I wear make up every day but I certainly don&#x27;t cake it on at all. 20 bucks every 2 or 3 weeks is out of hand expensive. Not to mention I think the container is used! It came sealed of course, but the lid had scratches all over it and the lettering was wearing off. What is the deal? I was an avid bare minerals user, but it was a little expensive and my pores started getting clogged really badly when I switched to the matte minerals- terrible white heads and acne also. So I was excited to try this because of the price and good reviews...I&#x27;ll give it a shot to see if it works well, but in 2 weeks when I run out and have to buy more makeup I know I&#x27;ll be so mad!</li>
            <li> I bought Sheer Cover Mineral Foundation.  This item appears to have been previously opened.  It looks like they tried to reseal it with a label that held together the orginal packaging.  It was not as full as it should have been.  I compared it to another recently purchased full product and it did not measure up.  Not satisfied!</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Sheer Cover, hoping that I could replace my heavy, oil-based make-up.  The concealer was a terrible match -- both color options that were guaranteed to match my skin tone were too light/yellow.  The &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t provide even coverage and it had a tendency to wear off after only a couple of hours.  Tried the mascara once and ended up with &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; after an hour of wearing it.  Didn&#x27;t both trying the bronzer or the &amp;#34;lash fibers.&amp;#34;  Tried to cancel my account before 30 days were up, only to be told that Sheer Cover bills on a 29-day cycle, so my 90 day shipment has already been sent out.  When I tried to cancel the account anyway, I was told I had to wait until the shipment arrived, pay to ship it back to them, and then wait 6 weeks for a refund!  NO WAY.  I&#x27;m sticking with a reputable company from here on out!</li>
            <li> This make-up is amazing. It&#x27;s light and has such good coverage. However, two things to note: even with the use of the primer, this make-up does not last all day. It doesn&#x27;t on me anyway. I do have oily skin, though. Also, in most make-ups I wear the \\&quot;creamy natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;natural ivory\\&quot; shades, so I thought it was odd that out of the two medium shades (buff and latte) I had to use the darker one and it still isn&#x27;t quite dark enough. I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s all about. ANYWAY-  buy this make-up, you won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li> the product arrived quickly, but the size of the container was extrememly small:  probably about 3/4 teaspoon....I just can&#x27;t afford that,  but the powder is very nice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on as nice as the one I ordered directly from sheer cover. Won&#x27;t be buying this again. Not worth the money I spent</li>
            <li> Happy that I can buy just the color that works with me instead of the whole set as seen on TV.</li>
            <li> I gave this away as a gift.  I initially subscribed from the Sheer Cover company, however I must say that this is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have never ordered from a TV paid program before and was a little leery but it sounded so good.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality, nicely packaged. good condition and it was a real treat to receive all the goodies! I have just retired and am giving my skin attention that I never had time to do before.  Liked the foundation, best concealer I&#x27;ve ever had and also the bronze makeup was very nice and all kinds of great brushes!  However, - I was very bothered by auto shipping especially after reading the first 2 reviews.  After seeing what amazon could provide, I called Sheer Cover to cancel the auto-shipping which would occur in 2 weeks.  I was also bothered that there is no catalog from which to choose by sight and price.  I guess they just tell you over the phone what they offer--strange.  I expected to have a long argument.  There was some; he offered some reasonable options like ordering less often, reminded me that the auto-ship program gave 40% less cost, etc.  I told him the auto-shipping still made me feel very uncomfortable.  He backed off after listening to my fears and said a confirmation would be sent to me in 24 hrs and welcomed me to call if I want to place a single order.  Confirmation was sent.  All in all, I would say that they may have cleaned up their act and learned from unhappy customers.  So, I still would rather have the freedom of ordering from amazon and not worry about some outrageous bill being sent to me.</li>
            <li> Totally not as advertised and terrible customer service from Sheer Cover. Called to cancel and Sheer cover customer service was rude. Also they automatically sign you up to receive monthly shipments and do not want to cancel when requested. Make up looks caked on and feels heavy.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sheer cover trial package, realized it didn&#x27;t cover my spots as I wanted it to. Also, the mascara, and eyelash extender were dry, so they couldn&#x27;t be used. I called sheer cover to return the product, and was told that they would send me a different mascara and concealer to try. I figured what did I have to lose, since I was looking for good makeup.&lt;br /&gt;They sent me the same color I had before, so I called to return the products and was told I&#x27;d recieve an email confirming my expressed desire. I didn&#x27;t recieve a response so I returned their products anyway, expecting a response, I received none. When I called I was told that I needed to fax my post office receipt to the billing specialist to recieve a refund.&lt;br /&gt;This company has the absolute worst customer service and return procedure, and I would NEVER purchase anything from this company.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I would never recommend them to anyone I know, and if I even hear about someone considering their product I will do my utmost to discourage them.&lt;br /&gt;I am so disgusted and sickened by this company.</li>
            <li> This make-up is the best there is! It has excellent coverage and is unbelievably light weight. It&#x27;s not like those other powders that rub off or the foundations that feel thick on your skin. Highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Sheer cover works well with the Sheer cover concealer. I recommend this product. I prefer this product over Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for almost a year.  it hides the imperfection of my skin like blemishes.  It is also long wearing. not heavy on my skin.  i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from this supplier.  How upset I am that I discovered this product appears to be made in China.  Since I ordered this product several months ago to restock my makeup drawer and just now opening and reviewing the label to discover has Chinese writing on the label.  I do not trust products made in China and do not purchase items from there.  The seller should indicate the product they are selling was made/produced in China.  I would send this back to them but since several months past I probably cannot. I don&#x27;t believe Sheer Cover produces their fine product in China.  If they do, I would be surprised and would stop using it.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with the packaging- cheap!&lt;br /&gt;Coverage was not good, sheer or anything described in the ads&lt;br /&gt;Brushes were flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Mascara was just plain weird. The primer is quite literally cotton. Yes, cotton stuffed into a mascara tube. You know what happens when you rub cotton all over your eyes?? Your eyes get irritated! Then, the mascara itself was super dry too... like it had been sitting in a warehouse for 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy into the hype- like I did. It&#x27;s garbage!!</li>
            <li> I love sheer cover. I find it to be better than bare minerals. Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to cover my melasma spots.  It did not work, and it wore off after an 8-hour work day!  It also gave my skin a dry, cakey look, which has never happened to me before.  So I returned my 2nd shipment.  By the way--all you have to do is write &amp;#34;refused&amp;#34; on the box and send it back, no payment necessary.  They had told me on the phone that I would have to pay shipping to return it, but I have returned products before by refusing them.  Now, 6 months later, I still have not received my money back, and have spoken with customer service about 6 times.  My product was returned to them--but no money returned to me.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This products offers light wieght coverage for age spots and acne belmishes..been using for 3 years! will never allow myself to run out!</li>
            <li> I will never buy another foundation product ever again this one was so good. It doesn&#x27;t break your face out and gives the ultimate amount of coverage. Thank you sheer cover!!</li>
            <li> real good .i had one box before .real naturally look</li>
            <li> Not only was this make-up worthless (the amount you get is pathetic)but the customer service associated with it was absolutely horrendous. I orginially tried out the starter package and after trying it a few times a few different ways I called to cancel my subscription that had AUTOMATICALLY started when I ordered the starter package. I spoke to a lady that tried to convince me again and agian that I was just not using it correctly and I needed to watch more videos about it. I eventually persuaded her to cancel my account and I thought it was all over. A couple weeks later, I receive a huge monthly package from Sheer Cover... I was confused because I had CANCELLED it long before this. Then I recieve a credit card charge of almost $100.00. I was upset by this (yet still reasonable, not angry) so I called, it must have been a mistake. The lady on the phone from Sheer Cover told me that there was no record of me cancelling my account and that it was still active. She told me that if I didn&#x27;t want the package they sent I would have to pay for completely secure shipping so as to guarantee the tracking and it getting back to them. It cost me $20.00 to send it back to get back my $100.00 worth of product they should have never sent me in the first place. Its a total scheme to get money, to try and intice you to keep the product. BUYERS BEWARE. Try out Pur minerals instead- that stuff is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I love sheer cover. However, it worked better with latte or buff instead of the change to medium.</li>
            <li> Sheer Cover Mineral Foundation has worked so well to get rid of blemishes.  This is a fantastic product and I recommend it for anyone who has concerns about their complection.</li>
