    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>John Frieda makes the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is the best price anywhere</li>
            <li>, my hair came out the perfect color-</li>
            <li>Best brown hair dye I have ever used!</li>
            <li>The conditioner did not do a very good job</li>
            <li>Great price for a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great color and great texture</li>
            <li>The color was perfect, the whites were gone, and it was extremely easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Good quality hair dye at a good price.</li>
            <li>applied a good 1/3 of the conditioner for a timed 10 minutes since my hair dries out</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the novelty of it, but can&#x27;t say it worked incredibly well after the experience I described above.  </li>
            <li>For now, I am in love!</li>
            <li>everything that everyone else said about this being easy to use, being mess-free, leaving your hair in great condition, and having great coverage and a pleasant fragrance is true.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more convenient than running out to the pharmacy and paying top dollar.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim, thinking foam color might be better and John Frieda is a reputable brand.  </li>
            <li>john frieda&#x27;s precision foam got a bit better ratings, so i gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I am using this hair color for many years and mostly I get it from amazon</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love the color and the conditioner which is included</li>
            <li>Excellent grey coverage.</li>
            <li>This is shiny and a very pretty brown with nice dimensions.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product after the first use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade and it&#x27;s easy and convenient.  </li>
            <li>The foam type is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and results in even color.</li>
            <li>I have a hair coloring smock and while this did not seem to drip, from the one time I allowed my hand to brush against the smock with coloring product on it, there&#x27;s a huge brown mark from the dye.  </li>
            <li>and I followed the instructions precisely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely going to this product next time, but one shade lighter, for the ease of use and great gray coverage.</li>
            <li>My test patch came out a bit light at the 10 minute mark.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>but normally I don&#x27;t get this kind of coverage even after 40 min.  </li>
            <li>, I use it every 3 months to cover the grey that is growing in and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>i purchased a nice &amp; easy root touch-up kit today, which usually gives me about 2-3 weeks of good color.  </li>
            <li>This foam hair color is very easy to use and comes with a decent set of gloves and easy-to-follow instructions.  </li>
            <li>My last highlights were done about 9 months ago, so my hair is fairly &#x27;virgin.</li>
            <li>a nice natural brown with a hint of cool tones to match my skin color.</li>
            <li>It feels healthy and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I have colored since around 20 for fun, and I love this color because it looks very very natural looking.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and I finally used my own conditioner which helped.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product for it&#x27;s high reviews and easy of application.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to apply and the directions were easy to follow, especially after watching the tutorials.</li>
            <li>the color BARELY took to my stubborn gray areas, in spite of leaving the color on a little longer and massaging as the instructions said to do for best results.  </li>
            <li>This gave me the dark color I wanted with out going too dark, and without drying out my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;-- rinsed in warm water for a good 3-5 minutes to get all of the color out.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>My hair texture is very, very fine and tends to dry out very easily with daily shampooing or heat application.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and trouble free.</li>
            <li>i have been coloring my hair at home for about 8 years, and i used this product in medium chocolate brown for the first time one week ago.  </li>
            <li>and they are so pretty.  </li>
            <li>do have to say, the color is really pretty, and it covered all my grays.</li>
            <li>product first of all is a foam color</li>
            <li>My hair is terribly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dry &amp; brittle now and it was pretty healthy PRIOR to using this crap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Colors are exact as well.</li>
            <li>i know i can count on creme color to give me 4-5 weeks of good gray coverage, even if it is a little more messy and not as easy to apply.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming feature worked very well for me, exactly as pictured in the accompanying diagrams.  </li>
            <li>Save so much $$ with it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want to color my whole head again so soon.  </li>
            <li>Very shiny.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not so much that I notice.</li>
            <li>The color was much darker than on the box.  </li>
            <li>I really, really want to like it.</li>
            <li>I really dislike coloring my hair</li>
            <li>Since the test patch was a touch lighter than I wanted, when I applied the foam for the full application, I left it in for 15 minutes instead of the recommended 20.</li>
            <li>I really should have known better, I forgot how much I disliked john frieda products years&lt;</li>
            <li>As long as my hair stays in the range of light brown to very dark brown, and the small patch of greying at my right temple isn&#x27;t noticeable, I am happy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>He says my old stuff - mabye Ferria - used to stink the whole house</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be a great alternative - WRONG.  </li>
            <li>hair looks exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought I might not have been rinsing it out enough.</li>
            <li>I bought it because my usual product was out and being the most expensive at the store and with a good name</li>
            <li>My hair is a teeny bit dry, but not nearly what I have experienced compared to the highlights I have gotten in the past-</li>
            <li>Even level 4 turns out a tad darker than my natural shade.  </li>
            <li>But, to my surprise, it covered my grays completely.</li>
            <li>Salon color will last so much longer</li>
            <li>Bought John Frieda Pecision Foam Color, Medium Natural Brown 5N</li>
            <li>selected Medium Natural Brown 5N for the neutral tones.</li>
            <li>No mess or dripping because of the foam.</li>
            <li>The grey at my temple is very slightly darker and more brown, but I can already see that it has faded after TWO washings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair is not seen in natural circumstances, It really looks like a cheap box hair color, I mean the back is waaay darker then</li>
            <li>watched all of the video&#x27;s on John Frieda&#x27;s website to get the general idea since I am a complete newbie.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>So I  usually mix level 5 and level 4, and get partial gray coverage and a color that is more natural looking, one shade lighter than my natural hair which I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With most brands only level 3 or lower will completely cover my grays, but then on my naturally dark hair it turns out so dark that it&#x27;s almost goth.  </li>
            <li>My original hair color is a very light brown (what others may call a very dark, dirty blonde.)</li>
            <li>It did not come out medium brown at all - it was very close to BLACK in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with dark brown hair (level 3, maybe a bit lighter) and some gray hairs that are very resistant.</li>
            <li>Not only did it barely foam up despite following the directions...</li>
            <li>My hair has rarely been treated, if I do get something done, it is minimal highlighting less than once/year.</li>

            <li> With most brands only level 3 or lower will completely cover my grays, but then on my naturally dark hair it turns out so dark that it&#x27;s almost goth.  </li>
            <li> My original hair color is a very light brown (what others may call a very dark, dirty blonde.)</li>
            <li> It did not come out medium brown at all - it was very close to BLACK in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with dark brown hair (level 3, maybe a bit lighter) and some gray hairs that are very resistant.</li>
            <li> Not only did it barely foam up despite following the directions...</li>
            <li> My hair has rarely been treated, if I do get something done, it is minimal highlighting less than once/year.</li>
            <li> I chose Dark Natural Brown 5N and there are red tones in my hair that were NOT present before coloring.  </li>
            <li> This product is the only one that I have found that totally covers my grey hair and also it lasts on my hair up to 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> however as with all boxed color, it just does not last on grey hair.  </li>
            <li> I followed instructions but the color is so flat and dull..wouldnt use again.</li>
            <li> The color was flat with no highlights.  </li>
            <li> &gt; later pull through to ends as you normally would because the foam is all over the place and runs down your face into your&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ears and back of your neck, its a big mess and forget coloring greys, it just don&#x27;t work with this product.</li>
            <li> I tend to condition it daily and only shampoo minimally as needed</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair for a long time, but even with that- when my hair dries, and I try to flat iron it</li>
            <li> my grays looked like very pale blonde highlights which would have been bearable, except that one week later, the color has completely faded from my gray areas.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s really dark and the color seems a bit flat at first.</li>
            <li> , I usually just do my roots, I haven&#x27;t figured out how they get it to leave high lights</li>
            <li> For the price point this product does what it says and holds up as long or longer than competitors at this price.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 yr old woman, and I use this to cover a few gray hairs I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> My roots grow out that fast and since the root color and this color are approximately the same price I just recolor my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice color,best brand for my hair and doesnt smell as bad as loreal or other.</li>
            <li> the front and sides of my hair are ugly shades of light brown mixed with the untouched grey.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this issue with other products</li>
            <li> did notice the post-coloring conditioner worked extremely well and my hair looks quite a bit shinier, but I did not have that 2-3 days of feeling</li>
            <li> John Frieda foam color in 5N came out darker than 4N in all the other brands I tried.</li>
            <li> the color was SOOOO dark.  </li>
            <li> mixed the product as directed, which achieved a thick foam, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> like there was excess coloring product weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the only foam hair dye that doesn&#x27;t make a mess (well, at least for me it is).</li>
            <li> I will update my review after a few shampoos to see if the color holds or rinses out like other reviewers have posted.</li>
            <li> The gloves with this product are black and almost rubbery.  </li>
            <li> but when I used them the foam came out very watery and start dripping from my head after 5 minutes which was very messy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not impressed, especially when the price was nearly double of the usual brands</li>
            <li> Will update this review of that changes after a few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does fade, after a few months</li>
            <li> In the past, brown colors I have used come out looking very dark.</li>
            <li> so therefore it is NOT PRECISE in the least.</li>
            <li> your hair healthy again and don&#x27;t use this horrible product.</li>
            <li> I am honestly not all that picky about haircolor.  </li>

            <li> Good quality hair dye at a good price. I use amazon now and then so I always have one on hand and it&#x27;s more convenient than running out to the pharmacy and paying top dollar. For the price point this product does what it says and holds up as long or longer than competitors at this price.</li>
            <li> As close to salon quality you&#x27;ll ever get. Save so much $$ with it.</li>
            <li> I am honestly not all that picky about haircolor.  As long as my hair stays in the range of light brown to very dark brown, and the small patch of greying at my right temple isn&#x27;t noticeable, I am happy.  No reddish or brassy tones and I&#x27;m ecstatic.  I tried this on a whim, thinking foam color might be better and John Frieda is a reputable brand.  I&#x27;m honestly not impressed, especially when the price was nearly double of the usual brands I choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks exactly the same.  It&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t even color it.  The grey at my temple is very slightly darker and more brown, but I can already see that it has faded after TWO washings. I don&#x27;t have this issue with other products and I followed the instructions precisely.  I chose Dark Natural Brown 5N and there are red tones in my hair that were NOT present before coloring.  That is unacceptable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the post-coloring conditioner worked extremely well and my hair looks quite a bit shinier, but I did not have that 2-3 days of feeling like there was excess coloring product weighing down my hair.  That&#x27;s how this product got 2 stars from me instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming feature worked very well for me, exactly as pictured in the accompanying diagrams.  I was impressed with the novelty of it, but can&#x27;t say it worked incredibly well after the experience I described above.  I will probably return to traditional/creme color in the future.  I have a hair coloring smock and while this did not seem to drip, from the one time I allowed my hand to brush against the smock with coloring product on it, there&#x27;s a huge brown mark from the dye.  The gloves with this product are black and almost rubbery.  They were awkward to remove once covered in dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with dark brown hair (level 3, maybe a bit lighter) and some gray hairs that are very resistant. With most brands only level 3 or lower will completely cover my grays, but then on my naturally dark hair it turns out so dark that it&#x27;s almost goth.  Even level 4 turns out a tad darker than my natural shade.  So I  usually mix level 5 and level 4, and get partial gray coverage and a color that is more natural looking, one shade lighter than my natural hair which I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The John Frieda foam color in 5N came out darker than 4N in all the other brands I tried. But, to my surprise, it covered my grays completely. I did leave it in for a total of 30 minutes (per the instructions for resistant grays),  but normally I don&#x27;t get this kind of coverage even after 40 min.  Hair did not feel damaged either. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s really dark and the color seems a bit flat at first. Will update this review of that changes after a few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to this product next time, but one shade lighter, for the ease of use and great gray coverage.</li>
            <li> John Frieda makes the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t fade and it&#x27;s easy and convenient.  This is the best price anywhere and I can have it delivered to my door regularly.  I&#x27;m now using Amazon for all my cosmetic purchases.</li>
            <li> i have been coloring my hair at home for about 8 years, and i used this product in medium chocolate brown for the first time one week ago.  i tried l&#x27;oreal sublime mousse 3 weeks ago with disappointing gray coverage results.  john frieda&#x27;s precision foam got a bit better ratings, so i gave it a try.  everything that everyone else said about this being easy to use, being mess-free, leaving your hair in great condition, and having great coverage and a pleasant fragrance is true.  however, being about 30% gray, i was disappointed immediately after washing it out.  the color BARELY took to my stubborn gray areas, in spite of leaving the color on a little longer and massaging as the instructions said to do for best results.  my grays looked like very pale blonde highlights which would have been bearable, except that one week later, the color has completely faded from my gray areas.  i purchased a nice &amp; easy root touch-up kit today, which usually gives me about 2-3 weeks of good color.  don&#x27;t want to color my whole head again so soon.  i will go back to my trusty creme color after trying 2 foams with disappointing results...i know i can count on creme color to give me 4-5 weeks of good gray coverage, even if it is a little more messy and not as easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Nice color,best brand for my hair and doesnt smell as bad as loreal or other.</li>
            <li> The color was perfect, the whites were gone, and it was extremely easy to apply. It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.  Excellent grey coverage.</li>
            <li> Great color and great texture however as with all boxed color, it just does not last on grey hair.  Salon color will last so much longer</li>
            <li> I am using this hair color for many years and mostly I get it from amazon and I had never any problem with that. However I think this item is fake, I ordered 3 of them and they arrived in very bad shape, boxes were all deformed and squished but I thought its just because of the shipping. but when I used them the foam came out very watery and start dripping from my head after 5 minutes which was very messy and uncomfortable. It still worked and changed my hair color but I wont order from this seller anymore.</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that I have found that totally covers my grey hair and also it lasts on my hair up to 3 weeks.  My roots grow out that fast and since the root color and this color are approximately the same price I just recolor my hair. I would recommend this color to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 yr old woman, and I use this to cover a few gray hairs I&#x27;ve noticed. I really love it. I have colored since around 20 for fun, and I love this color because it looks very very natural looking. In the past, brown colors I have used come out looking very dark. This one doesn&#x27;t. This is shiny and a very pretty brown with nice dimensions. Very shiny. My husband also says it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. He says my old stuff - mabye Ferria - used to stink the whole house and this doesn&#x27;t. My hair also doesn&#x27;t feel stressed or damaged after using it. It feels healthy and vibrant. It does fade, after a few months I think - but everything does to an extent and it&#x27;s not so much that I notice.</li>
            <li> I get this on subscribe and save, my beautician wanted to know who was coloring my hair.  I love this stuff, I use it every 3 months to cover the grey that is growing in and it does a great job. I leave it on a total of 30 minutes, I usually just do my roots, I haven&#x27;t figured out how they get it to leave high lights but it does and they are so pretty.  I won&#x27;t go back to 135.00 dollars for a hair cut and color!</li>
            <li> I thought foam color would be easier than traditional ..I followed instructions but the color is so flat and dull..wouldnt use again.</li>
            <li> The foam type is so easy to use. I love the color and the conditioner which is included makes the hair silky. I use it between salon appointments.</li>
            <li> This foam hair color is very easy to use and comes with a decent set of gloves and easy-to-follow instructions.  They come in lots of colors.  I think I&#x27;ll try a different one next time.</li>
            <li> Awful.  The color was much darker than on the box.  The conditioner did not do a very good job and I finally used my own conditioner which helped.  The color was flat with no highlights.  I would never buy this again.  Awful.....</li>
            <li> This is so unfortunate! This is the only foam hair dye that doesn&#x27;t make a mess (well, at least for me it is). I really, really want to like it. But, it makes my hair feel like straw. At first, I thought I might not have been rinsing it out enough. So, I bought another one and tried it again. I rinsed my hair for a long time, but even with that- when my hair dries, and I try to flat iron it, it feels so dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different brands, and they never make my hair feel like that.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, the color is really pretty, and it covered all my grays. But, I will not be using it ever again.</li>
            <li> Bought John Frieda Pecision Foam Color, Medium Natural Brown 5N&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst hair color I have ever used, Learn from my mistake and dont Buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product first of all is a foam color so therefore it is NOT PRECISE in the least. You can not apply to roots and then&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; later pull through to ends as you normally would because the foam is all over the place and runs down your face into your&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ears and back of your neck, its a big mess and forget coloring greys, it just don&#x27;t work with this product. I have used this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2 1/2 weeks ago and my hair is hideous now, OMG! I hate it, the color is faded, blotchy, uneven all over. The color of my&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair is not seen in natural circumstances, It really looks like a cheap box hair color, I mean the back is waaay darker then&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the front and streaky and the front and sides of my hair are ugly shades of light brown mixed with the untouched grey. In the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; sun it looks like I am losing my hair. I can just cry at what a horrible job this dye did to my hair. My hair is terribly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dry &amp; brittle now and it was pretty healthy PRIOR to using this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now spending a small fortune to revive the health of my hair and get back the moisture that this terrible excuse for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair color stole from my head. I really should have known better, I forgot how much I disliked john frieda products years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ago when I used them and didn&#x27;t buy again, then my memory kicked in as I looked at my hair and I questioned my decision to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy this. Wish I could rate this product NEGATIVE 5 stars..(-5*) Save yourself the heartache and extra expense of trying to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get your hair healthy again and don&#x27;t use this horrible product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product after the first use. For starters:&lt;br /&gt;-- My original hair color is a very light brown (what others may call a very dark, dirty blonde.) It is just above shoulder length so I only used one box of product.&lt;br /&gt;-- My hair has rarely been treated, if I do get something done, it is minimal highlighting less than once/year. My last highlights were done about 9 months ago, so my hair is fairly &#x27;virgin.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;-- My hair texture is very, very fine and tends to dry out very easily with daily shampooing or heat application. I tend to condition it daily and only shampoo minimally as needed every 3-4 washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected Medium Natural Brown 5N for the neutral tones. I chose this product for it&#x27;s high reviews and easy of application. I have never fully colored my hair at home, so I was quite nervous about the application and timing portions of the program. Here&#x27;s what I did:&lt;br /&gt;-- watched all of the video&#x27;s on John Frieda&#x27;s website to get the general idea since I am a complete newbie.&lt;br /&gt;-- read the directions start to finish TWICE before opening the product.&lt;br /&gt;-- mixed the product as directed, which achieved a thick foam, just as advertised. It was not runny and stayed in place during application.&lt;br /&gt;-- applied vaseline around my hair line and to my ears to prevent staining.&lt;br /&gt;-- tested a small patch of hair behind my ear for 10 minutes (the recommended time is 20). My test patch came out a bit light at the 10 minute mark.&lt;br /&gt;-- Since the test patch was a touch lighter than I wanted, when I applied the foam for the full application, I left it in for 15 minutes instead of the recommended 20. This gave me the dark color I wanted with out going too dark, and without drying out my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;-- rinsed in warm water for a good 3-5 minutes to get all of the color out.&lt;br /&gt;-- applied a good 1/3 of the conditioner for a timed 10 minutes since my hair dries out so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, my hair came out the perfect color- a nice natural brown with a hint of cool tones to match my skin color. The product was easy to apply and the directions were easy to follow, especially after watching the tutorials. My hair is a teeny bit dry, but not nearly what I have experienced compared to the highlights I have gotten in the past- I think rinsing the dye out sooner and leaving the conditioner on longer definitely helped this. I plan to care for it as gingerly as possible and to not over wash and shampoo it. I will update my review after a few shampoos to see if the color holds or rinses out like other reviewers have posted. For now, I am in love!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and trouble free. No mess or dripping because of the foam. Colors are exact as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I truly hate this hair color kit.  Not only did it barely foam up despite following the directions...the color was SOOOO dark.  It did not come out medium brown at all - it was very close to BLACK in my opinion.  It also did not cover all of my grays.  I bought it because my usual product was out and being the most expensive at the store and with a good name I thought it&#x27;d be a great alternative - WRONG.  Very disappointed and will never try it again.</li>
            <li> easy to use. I really dislike coloring my hair but this make it easier, no dripping. and they do not test on animals</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and results in even color. Best brown hair dye I have ever used!</li>
