            <li>the olay body ultra moisture body wash was a very satisfying purchase.</li>

            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  \\&quot;Online Price</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love the ease of ordering and receiving!</li>
            <li>Gotta love it!</li>
            <li>The scent is very clean, pleasant, and gender neutral.  </li>
            <li>texture of the Olay body is just amazing</li>
            <li>skin never felt so amazing</li>
            <li>This body wash is amazing.</li>
            <li>I just add some warm water and shake it up.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it does maintain the moisture and the scent smells really really good.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the scent, and she&#x27;s fussy about that kind of thing.</li>
            <li>This is very nice flavor and produces rich lather.</li>
            <li>You will find great reviews of this product but look closely and see that if they were written before August/Sept. of 2012, they were for the old formula which was great.</li>
            <li>I wanted a shower soap that would moisturize me better - and this is kind of slimy.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it has a nice scent which isn&#x27;t overpowering. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy it on line at a better price and without leaving the house</li>
            <li>After one week of washing with it I can tell that my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>If you search on \\&quot;online price alert\\&quot; in Google it will be come up at the top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the product and recommend it.</li>
            <li>I prefer more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products and things that smell most</li>
            <li>It does do the trick and keeps me from itching all night, but I sure like to bubble-up in the shower.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it away to my mother who was able to stand the smell.</li>
            <li>and I thought that was my favorite, but this is better.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasing scent that I love.  </li>
            <li>I with they had more fragrance options to choose from.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to buy multipacks of this at Costco for better prices than here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love to pamper myself in the shower and bath</li>
            <li>and I really love this Body</li>
            <li>Have tried many body washes..dove, aveeno..etc.  </li>
            <li>I ranked Aveeno Daily Mositurizing the best, until I tried Olay.  </li>
            <li>I love them all....</li>
            <li>I probably enjoy this product more than the gels from Bath &amp; Body Works. :)</li>
            <li>so it lasts a good time - certainly longer than the generics I&#x27;ve used from Target, etc.  </li>
            <li>I get nice and clean but also get smooth skin</li>
            <li>I love being able to purchase the name brand of this soap on Amazon at such a great price, and have it delivered on a set schedule</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years - it really does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my early forties living in a humid region of Florida, and this product is the perfect combo of moisturizing while leaving your skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>:) Makes me think of hot tea and fireplaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt very strongly that I will ever use anything else.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter makes this work and scent is very mild and does not compete with colognes or perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Like the product, but the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li>Hands down best body wash on the market!</li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant smell, the bottle is easy to open, the content pours out easily.  </li>
            <li>why you so smooth.</li>
            <li>I took my shower 12 hours ago and my skin still feels silky smooth as if I had put lotion on it just 10 minutes ago.</li>
            <li>This one manages to be silky smooth while moisturizing without leaving a film on your skin or in your shower.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy this</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; but it is darned comfortable.</li>
            <li>Wash.  Not only is it great for the skin</li>
            <li>Olay advanced healing lotion AND Olay&#x27;s ultra moisture body wash w</li>
            <li>Smells good, and keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>at first glance it looks cheap and you think \\&quot;ehhh this will probably suck\\&quot; uhhh boy was I corrected!</li>
            <li>This wash and the moisturizer with shea butter has made my legs nice and smooth, no flaky skin, and my elbows are sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure my opinion won&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li>this smells ammmaazzing its the perfect combination not too light or strong but stays on for a very long time and it leaves your skin sooo soft</li>
            <li>IMO this regular routine makes the rich shea butter formula work even more effectively.</li>
            <li>I have used about 6 to 8 different brands of body wash, and this by far, has been the best.</li>
            <li>Costco offers the best pricing for a 3 pack of 23.6 ounce jars for about fourteen dollars although with occasional Costco coupons they are about twelve dollars for a three pack.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and it does help with the itching.</li>
            <li>It has a strong flowery smell and I prefer a refreshing citrus or classic clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Only a drop about the size of a quarter is needed and it lathers up quite nicely and is able to be used all over the body.</li>
            <li>I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  </li>
            <li>The Shea Butter in this makes your skin soooooo soft I love it!  </li>
            <li>This product contains both petrolatum and shea butter, so as expected, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>whatever it&#x27;s called I just use a face towel and go in the shower it is full of that Olay moisturizer</li>
            <li>I like Olay products even better than Dove, and I used Dove my whole life.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for my fair, slightly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The soap is thick, foams quickly with my loofah (the puff kind), and it smells amazing - almost like fresh laundry in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>So happy to have found this and highly recommend to anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Just tried this for the first time recently, and it&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li>The three pack is a pretty economical way to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Within a week I knew I&#x27;d finally found the right body cleanser; my skin looked and felt smoother, softer and more moisturized than it ever had before.</li>
            <li>I began using this body wash when it first came out.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Olay!</li>
            <li>this moisturizing body wash is exactly as claimed.  </li>
            <li>I alternate between this and anti-aging version, but I find this one gives more moisture.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes better and the lather is practically double.  </li>
            <li>Price is the same as in the store but the size is better for the money.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I definitely like the Olay Ultra Moisture Body Wash with Shea Butter better than the Aveeno.  </li>
            <li>My thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Point blank if ypu have sensitive skin, try this you will love it!.</li>
            <li>I agree with Laura that the previous formula was way better because the new formula has too strong of a floral scent.</li>
            <li>Am disabled and this was quick and easy to order bath wash!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and also lathers pretty well.</li>
            <li>this was the first thing I could find that had a reasonable scent to it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pure gold.  </li>
            <li>Add a little Nivea Smooth Sensation and I (the dry skin one) am good to go.  </li>
            <li>I find this tool to be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After trying just about every body wash available at my local drug stores, I found this one to leave my skin feeling the softest.</li>
            <li>your a Costco member, save your money and go there where they are currently available in the same 3 pack for $8.97!!!!!</li>
            <li>I do like this body wash... but not as much as my husband does.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward to now: I still won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dont go out and buy the cheap brands with shea butter and think you will get the same results.</li>
            <li>It works well for shaving as much as for cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I got it free at a conference last year</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than soap.</li>
            <li>This is very creamy and very moisturing.</li>
            <li>and it works very well</li>
            <li>so it is very econimical.</li>
            <li>now very rarely on amazon you will find a product with only 4 and 5 stars review</li>
            <li>Really like this particular Olay product.  </li>
            <li>this product, less is more.</li>
            <li>Have tried many different kinds of body wash, but always come back to Olay.</li>
            <li>Feels really good on my skin, only needs a few drops and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>Olay products are always high quality.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product _sincerely_bob bennett</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The formula is THICK and the lather is just spectacular.  </li>
            <li>a year later I am still buying this body wash, and haven&#x27;t had dry skin since :)</li>
            <li>It had a light pleasing scent and truly moisturized my dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is soothing, with a light scent that does not compete with other products.  </li>
            <li>- Live in sandy and salty area</li>
            <li>it helped my dry skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>I was desperate to find safe, effective and inexpensive products that would help soothe dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li>even my boyfriend tells me how soft my skin is..</li>
            <li>It leaves skin soft without residue</li>
            <li>but by far this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes she&#x27;s appropriately soft.</li>
            <li>In Shower Body Lotion&amp;#34; Leaves your skin hydrated, moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a positive because it&#x27;ll last much longer than the other body washes I buy, which also can be attributed to the fact that it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle to begin</li>
            <li>they changed the formula and now the scent is so strong it is unbearable... very heavily floral scented and twice the chemicals of the old formula.  </li>
            <li>Other body washes didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough and left a few dry patches but this perfect and its only 5 bucks at walmart</li>
            <li>They seem to changed the formula, it is not anymore that long lasting smell and the skin does not feel anymore that long smooth after you used it.</li>
            <li>My skin gets really dry during winter and this really helped.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few lotions that properly moisturizes, the fact that it can be purchased in quantity at a very competitive price is very helpful</li>
            <li>PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA.  </li>
            <li>If you or your kids are allergic or has sensitive skin, try on a small portion before trying the soap on a large scale.</li>
            <li>ordered the product, which is difficult to find in stores anymore, received it very quickly!</li>
            <li>The smell is also very pleasing, slightly floral, possibly lilly flower but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I got so tired of looking at my scaly legs that I began looking at products that could help bring some moisture back in an easy way.</li>
            <li>wow leaves your skin super soft and no neeed to buy expensive creams that contain alcohol or cramp that can irritate your skin..</li>

            <li> so it lasts a good time - certainly longer than the generics I&#x27;ve used from Target, etc.  </li>
            <li> I get nice and clean but also get smooth skin</li>
            <li> I love being able to purchase the name brand of this soap on Amazon at such a great price, and have it delivered on a set schedule</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years - it really does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my early forties living in a humid region of Florida, and this product is the perfect combo of moisturizing while leaving your skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> :) Makes me think of hot tea and fireplaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt very strongly that I will ever use anything else.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter makes this work and scent is very mild and does not compete with colognes or perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Like the product, but the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> Hands down best body wash on the market!</li>
            <li> It has a light pleasant smell, the bottle is easy to open, the content pours out easily.  </li>
            <li> why you so smooth.</li>
            <li> I took my shower 12 hours ago and my skin still feels silky smooth as if I had put lotion on it just 10 minutes ago.</li>
            <li> This one manages to be silky smooth while moisturizing without leaving a film on your skin or in your shower.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy this</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; but it is darned comfortable.</li>
            <li> Wash.  Not only is it great for the skin</li>
            <li> Olay advanced healing lotion AND Olay&#x27;s ultra moisture body wash w</li>
            <li> Smells good, and keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> at first glance it looks cheap and you think \\&quot;ehhh this will probably suck\\&quot; uhhh boy was I corrected!</li>
            <li> This wash and the moisturizer with shea butter has made my legs nice and smooth, no flaky skin, and my elbows are sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure my opinion won&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> this smells ammmaazzing its the perfect combination not too light or strong but stays on for a very long time and it leaves your skin sooo soft</li>
            <li> IMO this regular routine makes the rich shea butter formula work even more effectively.</li>
            <li> I have used about 6 to 8 different brands of body wash, and this by far, has been the best.</li>
            <li> Costco offers the best pricing for a 3 pack of 23.6 ounce jars for about fourteen dollars although with occasional Costco coupons they are about twelve dollars for a three pack.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and it does help with the itching.</li>
            <li> It has a strong flowery smell and I prefer a refreshing citrus or classic clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Only a drop about the size of a quarter is needed and it lathers up quite nicely and is able to be used all over the body.</li>
            <li> I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  </li>
            <li> The Shea Butter in this makes your skin soooooo soft I love it!  </li>
            <li> This product contains both petrolatum and shea butter, so as expected, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> whatever it&#x27;s called I just use a face towel and go in the shower it is full of that Olay moisturizer</li>
            <li> I like Olay products even better than Dove, and I used Dove my whole life.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for my fair, slightly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The soap is thick, foams quickly with my loofah (the puff kind), and it smells amazing - almost like fresh laundry in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this and highly recommend to anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time recently, and it&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li> The three pack is a pretty economical way to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Within a week I knew I&#x27;d finally found the right body cleanser; my skin looked and felt smoother, softer and more moisturized than it ever had before.</li>
            <li> I began using this body wash when it first came out.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Olay!</li>
            <li> this moisturizing body wash is exactly as claimed.  </li>
            <li> I alternate between this and anti-aging version, but I find this one gives more moisture.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes better and the lather is practically double.  </li>
            <li> Price is the same as in the store but the size is better for the money.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I definitely like the Olay Ultra Moisture Body Wash with Shea Butter better than the Aveeno.  </li>
            <li> My thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Point blank if ypu have sensitive skin, try this you will love it!.</li>
            <li> I agree with Laura that the previous formula was way better because the new formula has too strong of a floral scent.</li>
            <li> Am disabled and this was quick and easy to order bath wash!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and also lathers pretty well.</li>
            <li> this was the first thing I could find that had a reasonable scent to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure gold.  </li>
            <li> Add a little Nivea Smooth Sensation and I (the dry skin one) am good to go.  </li>
            <li> I find this tool to be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After trying just about every body wash available at my local drug stores, I found this one to leave my skin feeling the softest.</li>
            <li> your a Costco member, save your money and go there where they are currently available in the same 3 pack for $8.97!!!!!</li>
            <li> I do like this body wash... but not as much as my husband does.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward to now: I still won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dont go out and buy the cheap brands with shea butter and think you will get the same results.</li>
            <li> It works well for shaving as much as for cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I got it free at a conference last year</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than soap.</li>
            <li> This is very creamy and very moisturing.</li>
            <li> and it works very well</li>
            <li> so it is very econimical.</li>
            <li> now very rarely on amazon you will find a product with only 4 and 5 stars review</li>
            <li> Really like this particular Olay product.  </li>
            <li> this product, less is more.</li>
            <li> Have tried many different kinds of body wash, but always come back to Olay.</li>
            <li> Feels really good on my skin, only needs a few drops and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Olay products are always high quality.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product _sincerely_bob bennett</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The formula is THICK and the lather is just spectacular.  </li>
            <li> a year later I am still buying this body wash, and haven&#x27;t had dry skin since :)</li>
            <li> It had a light pleasing scent and truly moisturized my dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is soothing, with a light scent that does not compete with other products.  </li>
            <li> - Live in sandy and salty area</li>
            <li> it helped my dry skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find safe, effective and inexpensive products that would help soothe dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> even my boyfriend tells me how soft my skin is..</li>
            <li> It leaves skin soft without residue</li>
            <li> but by far this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes she&#x27;s appropriately soft.</li>
            <li> In Shower Body Lotion&amp;#34; Leaves your skin hydrated, moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a positive because it&#x27;ll last much longer than the other body washes I buy, which also can be attributed to the fact that it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle to begin</li>
            <li> they changed the formula and now the scent is so strong it is unbearable... very heavily floral scented and twice the chemicals of the old formula.  </li>
            <li> Other body washes didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough and left a few dry patches but this perfect and its only 5 bucks at walmart</li>
            <li> They seem to changed the formula, it is not anymore that long lasting smell and the skin does not feel anymore that long smooth after you used it.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry during winter and this really helped.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few lotions that properly moisturizes, the fact that it can be purchased in quantity at a very competitive price is very helpful</li>
            <li> PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA.  </li>
            <li> If you or your kids are allergic or has sensitive skin, try on a small portion before trying the soap on a large scale.</li>
            <li> ordered the product, which is difficult to find in stores anymore, received it very quickly!</li>
            <li> The smell is also very pleasing, slightly floral, possibly lilly flower but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I got so tired of looking at my scaly legs that I began looking at products that could help bring some moisture back in an easy way.</li>
            <li> wow leaves your skin super soft and no neeed to buy expensive creams that contain alcohol or cramp that can irritate your skin..</li>
            <li> Worth every penny as you will find a very small amount</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, almost all of the men body wash made my skin dry &amp; uncomfortable (although they smell great), so I keep coming back to Olay Extra Dry because after using it for certain period of time, I found out that I don&#x27;t need to apply lotion as often as I used to.</li>
            <li> I always just thought \\&quot;body wash was body wash\\&quot;, until my last one started giving me dry skin in different places on my body</li>
            <li> all the time, seriously, ask the guy i&#x27;m seeing right now.</li>
            <li> since then ive tries other brands evrn the moroccan oil one (blue bottle) and didn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft..</li>
            <li> I have tried various types of body washes from cheap to expensive and this one is my all time</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;ll use, everything makes my skin feel dry in comparison.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts for a long time will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This could be either a positive or a negative.</li>
            <li> We live in remote Michigan and are having a difficult winter right now.  </li>
            <li> goes a long way.</li>
            <li> During the winter months my legs are flaky and my elbows are so dry that they snag my bed sheets and boy</li>
            <li> ..let me say I&#x27;ve never had dry skin anywhere besides my face, so I was hoping after changing body washes the problem would go away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years to prevent winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin was smoother and softer and it calmed the dry, itchy skin on my legs.</li>
            <li> /shea butter has got to have a part in showing me signs of healing my problematic dry skin areas.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why my dry skin areas are waking up, no longer ?</li>
            <li> Take my word for it, I have dry skin areas that are showing signs of workable life.</li>

            <li> Typically my skin gets dry and somewhat itchy in the winter, but  since I started using this, I&#x27;ve had no problems.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products that contain shea butter</li>
            <li> it only takes a small amount</li>
            <li> and I have tried Bath and Body and all the other upscale stores</li>
            <li> Other body washes were too floraly and perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the product tend to be expensive, otherwise it&#x27;s a solid product that might help with extra dry skin situation.</li>
            <li> occasion, I&#x27;ve grabbed other (cheaper) bottles of soap at the store and I find myself missing Olay&#x27;s shea butter body wash by the time I&#x27;m done with it.  </li>
            <li> And it provides that moisture without ever feeling heavy or clogging  pores.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got so tired of looking at my scaly legs that I began looking at products that could help bring some moisture back in an easy way. Olay Body Wash is a good solution.  After one week of washing with it I can tell that my skin is looking better. And the body was is pleasant to use.  It has a light pleasant smell, the bottle is easy to open, the content pours out easily.  The three pack is a pretty economical way to buy this product.  The bottle is 23.6 oz and is 10 inches tall.  I am attaching a photo of the bottle next to the ruler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  \\&quot;Online Price Alert\\&quot;.  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on \\&quot;online price alert\\&quot; in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash I&#x27;ve come across for performance and price.  Smells good, and keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  Typically my skin gets dry and somewhat itchy in the winter, but  since I started using this, I&#x27;ve had no problems.  When it&#x27;s almost gone, I leave the last bit in there and use it to wash my dogs.  I just add some warm water and shake it up.  They smell great for days.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Shea butter makes this work and scent is very mild and does not compete with colognes or perfumes.  Leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> This product contains both petrolatum and shea butter, so as expected, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. And it provides that moisture without ever feeling heavy or clogging  pores.  The scent is very clean, pleasant, and gender neutral.  I think this is the best moisturizing body wash available.</li>
            <li> all the time, seriously, ask the guy i&#x27;m seeing right now. he is like dayum girl. why you so smooth. and i&#x27;m like, olay bitch.</li>
            <li> After trying just about every body wash available at my local drug stores, I found this one to leave my skin feeling the softest. The smell is also very pleasing, slightly floral, possibly lilly flower but not overpowering. I took off one star for the OUTRAGEOUS price here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;If your a Costco member, save your money and go there where they are currently available in the same 3 pack for $8.97!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried various types of body washes from cheap to expensive and this one is my all time fav... I was visiting my mom in Chicago and had forgotten my body wash back home and this is the only thing she had.. at first glance it looks cheap and you think \\&quot;ehhh this will probably suck\\&quot; uhhh boy was I corrected! this smells ammmaazzing its the perfect combination not too light or strong but stays on for a very long time and it leaves your skin sooo soft even my boyfriend tells me how soft my skin is.. Other body washes didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough and left a few dry patches but this perfect and its only 5 bucks at walmart so you can&#x27;t go wrong... Trust me you will become addicted to this..since then ive tries other brands evrn the moroccan oil one (blue bottle) and didn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft.. After the shower I don&#x27;t use body lotion all I use is baby oil (gel form) and mix it in with some almond oil and wow leaves your skin super soft and no neeed to buy expensive creams that contain alcohol or cramp that can irritate your skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point blank if ypu have sensitive skin, try this you will love it!.</li>
            <li> Well, I have terrible dry skin condition that requires a lot of moisturizing agent, especially if I use another body wash/shower gel. Unfortunately, almost all of the men body wash made my skin dry &amp; uncomfortable (although they smell great), so I keep coming back to Olay Extra Dry because after using it for certain period of time, I found out that I don&#x27;t need to apply lotion as often as I used to. I gave it 4 stars because the product tend to be expensive, otherwise it&#x27;s a solid product that might help with extra dry skin situation.</li>
            <li> Am disabled and this was quick and easy to order bath wash!  Will do this again.</li>
            <li> I do like this body wash... but not as much as my husband does.  It&#x27;s the ONLY thing he will use.  His skin gets a little dry especially in winter months and he says Olay Ultra with Shea Butter is the ONLY one for him... I prefer more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products and things that smell most musky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note about this body wash is that it&#x27;s so moisturizing that the stuff doesn&#x27;t rinse out of washcloths well.  It actually has changed the texture of every washcloth he uses... Hmmm.</li>
            <li> I began using this body wash when it first came out. I was desperate to find safe, effective and inexpensive products that would help soothe dry flaky skin. Within a week I knew I&#x27;d finally found the right body cleanser; my skin looked and felt smoother, softer and more moisturized than it ever had before. Fast forward to now: I still won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use this product with a pair of exfoliating complexion gloves in the shower. IMO this regular routine makes the rich shea butter formula work even more effectively. My skin actually glows. No kidding. Thanks, Olay!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few lotions that properly moisturizes, the fact that it can be purchased in quantity at a very competitive price is very helpful</li>
            <li> This body wash along with the matching moisturizer is what I have been looking for for over 20 years now. I have some of the driest skin. During the winter months my legs are flaky and my elbows are so dry that they snag my bed sheets and boy does that hurt! Not anymore! This wash and the moisturizer with shea butter has made my legs nice and smooth, no flaky skin, and my elbows are sooooo soft! I LOVE IT! I will never buy anything else EVER!!!! I have used other products that contain shea butter but nothing compares to Olay! Dont go out and buy the cheap brands with shea butter and think you will get the same results. Not gonna happen! Buy OLAY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> now very rarely on amazon you will find a product with only 4 and 5 stars review so when you do i will guarantee you it is a great buy and i must admit i have the dryest skin ever...my boyfriend always teases me about the bottom of my feet and he can no longer do so after i used this product and will continue to do so</li>
            <li> I love being able to purchase the name brand of this soap on Amazon at such a great price, and have it delivered on a set schedule so we never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is soothing, with a light scent that does not compete with other products.  It&#x27;s creamy, and only a little is needed so it lasts a good time - certainly longer than the generics I&#x27;ve used from Target, etc.  It works well for shaving as much as for cleansing.  No sticky or oily residue.  We use this for adults &amp; children without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001F51TVI Olay Body Ultra Moisture Body Wash, Shea Butter, Packaging May Vary, 23.6 Ounce (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> This product works really well for my fair, slightly sensitive skin.  Now that I&#x27;m in my early forties living in a humid region of Florida, and this product is the perfect combo of moisturizing while leaving your skin clean and fresh. Great scent too! Mine arrived quickly in excellent condition, and this multiple-pack is a value compared to drugstore pricing. No brainer ... Order today!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be hooked on this body wash until they stop making it. I always just thought \\&quot;body wash was body wash\\&quot;, until my last one started giving me dry skin in different places on my body..let me say I&#x27;ve never had dry skin anywhere besides my face, so I was hoping after changing body washes the problem would go away. Not only did my dry skin go away after a few days of using Olay Ultra Moisture, my skin also feels softer than it ever has! I took my shower 12 hours ago and my skin still feels silky smooth as if I had put lotion on it just 10 minutes ago. I never use lotion on my body and with this body wash, I&#x27;ll probably never have to. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks but I&#x27;m pretty sure my opinion won&#x27;t change. Get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/15/13 - over a year later I am still buying this body wash, and haven&#x27;t had dry skin since :)</li>
            <li> They seem to changed the formula, it is not anymore that long lasting smell and the skin does not feel anymore that long smooth after you used it.</li>
            <li> I have used about 6 to 8 different brands of body wash, and this by far, has been the best. The Dove Deep Moisture body wash, for instance, doesn&#x27;t even come anywhere close to this Olay body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the Olay body is just amazing and it feels great over my skin. Costco offers the best pricing for a 3 pack of 23.6 ounce jars for about fourteen dollars although with occasional Costco coupons they are about twelve dollars for a three pack.</li>
            <li> this moisturizing body wash is exactly as claimed.  It leaves skin soft without residue and I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A lot of these body washes are oily or leave residue. This one manages to be silky smooth while moisturizing without leaving a film on your skin or in your shower. I got it free at a conference last year and I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s great for my skin, which as I age needs moisture replenishment. I alternate between this and anti-aging version, but I find this one gives more moisture. Recommend</li>
            <li> We live in remote Michigan and are having a difficult winter right now.  I wanted a shower soap that would moisturize me better - and this is kind of slimy.  Doesn&#x27;t bubble up real good.  It does do the trick and keeps me from itching all night, but I sure like to bubble-up in the shower.</li>
            <li> Like the product, but the scent is too strong. I ended up giving it away to my mother who was able to stand the smell.</li>
            <li> Been using this with some coa coa butter and it&#x27;s wonderfull I don&#x27;t have a loofa or whatever it&#x27;s called I just use a face towel and go in the shower it is full of that Olay moisturizer and I enjoy this it&#x27;s nice!</li>
            <li> Oil of Olay is a great product.  I love this product because it does maintain the moisture and the scent smells really really good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Much easier to use than soap.</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time recently, and it&#x27;s really nice.  The formula is THICK and the lather is just spectacular.  I used to use the Siken Berry by Olay and I thought that was my favorite, but this is better.  Moisturizes better and the lather is practically double.  Great, great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no need to moisturize and I&#x27;m over 40.  It has a pleasing scent that I love.  I wear the Warm Vanilla Sugar scent with it and the result is a sea of butter vanilla cookie batter-ness!  No, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; but it is darned comfortable. :) Makes me think of hot tea and fireplaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt very strongly that I will ever use anything else.  I like Olay products even better than Dove, and I used Dove my whole life.</li>
            <li> This body of mine has very dry skin and I was constantly battling that prickly itchy feeling even after putting on lotion. A friend suggested this to me as her daughter has the same problem. This is very creamy and very moisturing. You do not have to use a lot, in fact be careful if you do or your shower will become slippery as it leaves a slick coating on the tile floor of my shower. It smells clean and it does help with the itching.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years to prevent winter dry skin.  Pleasant scent, but not too heavy.  Olay products are always high quality.</li>
            <li> Product keeps our bodies from drying while cleansing our pores - we keep one container at all shower and bath points - Live in sandy and salty area and it works very well</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter in this makes your skin soooooo soft I love it!  You don&#x27;t feel dried out several hours after you have gotten out of the shower.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the fragrance. It has a strong flowery smell and I prefer a refreshing citrus or classic clean smell.  I with they had more fragrance options to choose from.</li>
            <li> Works great by cleaning your skin but doesn&#x27;t strip it of moisture.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure gold.  I hate using body moisturizers, especially in winter.  This product thoroughly hydrates your skin in the shower and the scent lingers.  So happy to have found this and highly recommend to anyone with dry skin.  It does not leave any residue so anyone can use it.  Worth every penny as you will find a very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Wonderful body wash. Would not change for anything. Cannot match up. Price is the same as in the store but the size is better for the money.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this body wash for years.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy it on line at a better price and without leaving the house</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry during winter and this really helped. I ordered the one with shea butter and after using it for just one week, I noticed a big difference. My skin was smoother and softer and it calmed the dry, itchy skin on my legs. It&#x27;s very creamy and also lathers pretty well. I also like that it has a nice scent which isn&#x27;t overpowering. :)</li>
            <li> the olay body ultra moisture body wash was a very satisfying purchase. it helped my dry skin tremendously. it only takes a small amount so it is very econimical. i would highly recommend this product _sincerely_bob bennett</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;ll use, everything makes my skin feel dry in comparison.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to use lotion, because doing that always left me feeling too greasy.  This product offered  a great compromise... I get nice and clean but also get smooth skin like I also applied lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to buy multipacks of this at Costco for better prices than here on Amazon.  At the time of this update (July 2013), they&#x27;re selling 4 packs of the 23.6oz bottles for $11.99!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this Olay product from Amazon for years. Love the ease of ordering and receiving!</li>
            <li> This is very nice flavor and produces rich lather. The scent lasts for a long time will last for a long time. If you or your kids are allergic or has sensitive skin, try on a small portion before trying the soap on a large scale. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I have been using it for quit some time.  My granddaughter also loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin never felt so amazing and I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to pamper myself in the shower and bath and I have tried Bath and Body and all the other upscale stores but by far this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with a puff and it makes lots of bubbles.</li>
            <li> I agree with Laura that the previous formula was way better because the new formula has too strong of a floral scent.</li>
            <li> Only bath gel that moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t set off allergies!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. I ordered it twice! !</li>
            <li> ordered the product, which is difficult to find in stores anymore, received it very quickly! Amazon does a great job, and I love this product</li>
            <li> My college age daughter and I really love this Body Wash.  Not only is it great for the skin it is a great shaving aid.  I shave during every shower and I have the smoothest skin ever.  Skip expensive Brazilian treatments.....Use the Olay Body Wash!</li>
            <li> Olay advanced healing lotion AND Olay&#x27;s ultra moisture body wash w/shea butter has got to have a part in showing me signs of healing my problematic dry skin areas. This regimen started in March also leaving the Dove soap bar. Olay&#x27;s body wash actually c-l-e-a-n-s your skin. When I started this body wash, my shower suds were dusty but No More. Maybe that&#x27;s why my dry skin areas are waking up, no longer ?clogged?  That dermatologist never queried how I washed my body!?! On-line viewings prompted my departure from soap bars. Definitely move away from soap bars! Take my word for it, I have dry skin areas that are showing signs of workable life. I knew I was wasting money with that dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim one day because I was running low on another body wash and this was the first thing I could find that had a reasonable scent to it. Other body washes were too floraly and perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;With this product, less is more. Only a drop about the size of a quarter is needed and it lathers up quite nicely and is able to be used all over the body. This is definitely a positive because it&#x27;ll last much longer than the other body washes I buy, which also can be attributed to the fact that it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. If you&#x27;re looking for something to leave you smelling good, this product could use improvement in that department. I can hardly smell it after using it. This could be either a positive or a negative. On the positive side it allows you to wear perfumes or other scented sprays without horrible mixing results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay&#x27;s shea butter body wash for years now.  It&#x27;s by far my favorite.  The soap is thick, foams quickly with my loofah (the puff kind), and it smells amazing - almost like fresh laundry in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On occasion, I&#x27;ve grabbed other (cheaper) bottles of soap at the store and I find myself missing Olay&#x27;s shea butter body wash by the time I&#x27;m done with it.  I probably enjoy this product more than the gels from Bath &amp; Body Works. :)</li>
            <li> Have tried many body washes..dove, aveeno..etc.  I ranked Aveeno Daily Mositurizing the best, until I tried Olay.  I definitely like the Olay Ultra Moisture Body Wash with Shea Butter better than the Aveeno.  Add a little Nivea Smooth Sensation and I (the dry skin one) am good to go.  Skin has \\&quot;never\\&quot; felt so good.  Purchased a 3 pack at Costco for around $12.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it. Yes she&#x27;s appropriately soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years - it really does a good job.  I started, for a short while, to use another product but it made my skin itch and I did not like the smell so did not repeat the use.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price. I am very satisfied. My thanks!</li>
            <li> Really like this particular Olay product.  Prompt arrival too.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Luxurious body wash, it feels so good! I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  The price for this in the stores is around $5.</li>
            <li> The Oil Of Play combination of &amp;#34; Body wash and In Shower Body Lotion&amp;#34; Leaves your skin hydrated, moisturized and soft. Great Product that&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Have tried many different kinds of body wash, but always come back to Olay. Feels really good on my skin, only needs a few drops and moisturizes my skin. Gotta love it!</li>
            <li> Hands down best body wash on the market!</li>
            <li> Good price for product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! And smells delicious :)</li>
            <li> I used this product for years.  It had a light pleasing scent and truly moisturized my dry and sensitive skin.  The fall of 2012 they changed the formula and now the scent is so strong it is unbearable... very heavily floral scented and twice the chemicals of the old formula.  I will not be buying this product again.  PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA.  You will find great reviews of this product but look closely and see that if they were written before August/Sept. of 2012, they were for the old formula which was great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay since I was a younger person and I have never had a bad situation while using any of their products. I will always use their products. I love them all....</li>
            <li> This body wash is amazing. I won&#x27;t ever go back. I have healthier, softer skin because of olay. And I noticed results in a week. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent, and she&#x27;s fussy about that kind of thing.</li>
