            <li>Fantastic Item!!</li>
            <li>Really effective, light, not greasy but a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>That said, Palmer does a good job on most of their products.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what Rose hips are</li>
            <li>It feels really nice going on nonetheless.</li>
            <li>If you like an aldehydic (powdery) rose fragrance, I guess you&#x27;ll like it.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent, it&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, mild rosey fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I like rose and it could smell more rosy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this oil since I was pregnant because besides being very good and effective, does not have the smell of coconut original!</li>
            <li>Not even 6 months have passed and there is a huge difference already!</li>
            <li>Too many chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Lovely results all over.</li>

            <li>I love the smell and texture of this oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and still love it.</li>
            <li>I find it takes longer for it to sink in and stop looking and feeling greasy when it&#x27;s more humid out, so I tend not to use it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I love the smell and although is oil it won&#x27;t leave you the oily sensation</li>
            <li>I love the way way feel on the skin after working out a massage as well.</li>

            <li>It soaks right in, smells good and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>absorbs fast, simply love it!!</li>

            <li>My skin is great, soft and zero marks</li>

            <li>I scar easily from bug bites</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs more quickly than the moisturizing body oil.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and not oily or greasy.  </li>

            <li>Offer fragrance free or cocoa butter fragrance PLEASE</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I love all the Palmer&#x27;s products I have used, and this is the first I&#x27;m trying this one.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, makes you skin so happy (especially in the dry climate or winter) and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean, hydrated, &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t detect any special fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I also love the dewey glow I get after using this and foundation goes on and looks much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin like my 60 year old skin too</li>
            <li>I am 8 month pregnant</li>
            <li>the smell of coconut is not bearable for a pregnant woman</li>
            <li>And it absorbs quickly and well.</li>
            <li>I use it after showering on my arms and legs and if you use the appropriate amount, it absorbs quickly, leaving skin soft and not oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>Only I do not care for the rose scent.</li>
            <li>and how quickly it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Even though it can be  used on the face, the scent is overwhelming if applied anywhere near your nose.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that will not itch my sensitive skin when I apply it, and I think so far this oil is doing a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>well, right after money, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>Good for dry skin in the winter!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my dry KP skin happy, and helps clear my pores.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those rare, affordable beauty products that just straight up works!</li>
            <li>Thought it would be more rose scented - it is a mixture of rose hip and cocoa butter - so smells a little odd.  </li>
            <li>No irritation, it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>I really like the way the oil gets quickly absorbed with out leaving sticky skin.</li>
            <li>First tried this product as a sampler in a sachet and was blown away by the feel and scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon!</li>
            <li>Oily at first application</li>
            <li>It has helped her diminish scars and it definitely makes her skin smoother and more supple.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and leaves skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>Makes your face super soft!</li>
            <li>The bottle / dispenser is also very convenient.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, which I apply to my face after it is cleansed and still moist with opened pores.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and supple and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s ripping when I smile anymore.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s available in a larger size with the Rosehips scent.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much.  </li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s absorbed my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>sometimes where I can&#x27;t smell it as much.</li>
            <li>it is more oily than I expected.  </li>
            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>Heavy rose scent.</li>
            <li>While it initially feels a tad oily, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could have liked this, but my sensitive skin did not - it made me extremely itchy and created a rash.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel and look great, and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Oh, sweet mystery of life, at last I&#x27;ve found you!  </li>
            <li>Too much will leave you slippery and in hot weather, oil in general will leave you slippery as well.</li>
            <li>The plain one is good for male.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>I went from having red, dry skin on my face to having skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li>one con I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li>Product leaves you soft but not greasy</li>
            <li>, i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so silky soft without that greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Putting oil on your face might sound scary, but I found that my skin adjusted and generally feels more hydrated when using this on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I use this mainly for facial use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This works on dry skin very well and help keep my skin balanced</li>
            <li>Really helps dry skin</li>
            <li>I rarely finish ANY bath/body product &amp; I&#x27;m almost done with my 1st bottle (had is less than 4 months).</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li>Just know that if you have sensitive skin (I am a natural blonde with very light and thin skin...), it may irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>Putting make-up on afterwards is a breeze and no dry flakey skin peaking through!  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to get rid of scars on my body that I had from scratching my eczema so hard.</li>
            <li>I only suggest being careful how much oil you use.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking to compare this to the non-rosehip formula, the rosehip formula feels a little thicker and absorbs into your facial skin a little better then the regular formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is incredibly sensitive and dry and for years I have searched in vain for a moisturizer that does what this oil has done in 2 short days.  </li>

            <li> it is more oily than I expected.  </li>
            <li> works really well.</li>
            <li> Heavy rose scent.</li>
            <li> While it initially feels a tad oily, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could have liked this, but my sensitive skin did not - it made me extremely itchy and created a rash.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel and look great, and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Oh, sweet mystery of life, at last I&#x27;ve found you!  </li>
            <li> Too much will leave you slippery and in hot weather, oil in general will leave you slippery as well.</li>
            <li> The plain one is good for male.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I went from having red, dry skin on my face to having skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  </li>
            <li> one con I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li> Product leaves you soft but not greasy</li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so silky soft without that greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Putting oil on your face might sound scary, but I found that my skin adjusted and generally feels more hydrated when using this on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I use this mainly for facial use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This works on dry skin very well and help keep my skin balanced</li>
            <li> Really helps dry skin</li>
            <li> I rarely finish ANY bath/body product &amp; I&#x27;m almost done with my 1st bottle (had is less than 4 months).</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> Just know that if you have sensitive skin (I am a natural blonde with very light and thin skin...), it may irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> Putting make-up on afterwards is a breeze and no dry flakey skin peaking through!  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to get rid of scars on my body that I had from scratching my eczema so hard.</li>
            <li> I only suggest being careful how much oil you use.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to compare this to the non-rosehip formula, the rosehip formula feels a little thicker and absorbs into your facial skin a little better then the regular formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly sensitive and dry and for years I have searched in vain for a moisturizer that does what this oil has done in 2 short days.  </li>
            <li> so I expect this bottle to last a long time.</li>
            <li> , I have been in and out of different dermatologists, have been prescribed different pills and creams and have spent too much money on other different thick eczema creams.</li>
            <li> price is unbeatable when comparing this to other facial oils.  </li>
            <li> My husband took over this bottle for his dry arms, and he also likes the way it works.</li>
            <li> and I also have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I got this to apply to my very dry skin, and on my face.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, but I can&#x27;t use this oil without painful red bumps popping up everywhere.</li>
            <li> The bottle will probably last me at least a year if not longer since I usually only use it on my face.</li>
            <li> if it works, though, so not much help there.  </li>
            <li> Definitely I prefer this one than the plain one.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and remember to RUB IT IN and MASSAGE it into your problem</li>
            <li> Somehow I thought this was was for the face, and the other for the body.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would mix it with my other lotion before applying onto my skin, and it works well, too.  </li>
            <li> after I put a toner on, then I put on my usual moisturizer (neutrogena aha daily spf 15 moisturizer).  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a heavier oil, disappointed in that, however it has a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> It eliminated all my little dry spots.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well without a heavy feel and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> We keep at least a couple of bottles for back up now.</li>
            <li> i ended up dumping in down the drain,  i guess its my fault for not reading the ingredients before i used it</li>
            <li> My skin will look a little oily for a few minutes until this sinks in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed less blemishes since using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also noticing my scars/stretch marks are fading gradually and slightly after continued use.</li>
            <li> In the summer, I&#x27;ll use this at night a few times a week or on weekends.</li>
            <li> Using this as a plain skin oil it works.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands, elbows, feet, arms, legs and even my face, it just made my skin silky - no more dryness.  </li>
            <li> when I receive the item,it&#x27;s a little broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with lotion irritating the skin on my face after a shower.</li>
            <li> Thick oil.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Hate the heavy scent</li>
            <li> It was either this, or the expensive Mederma.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find a moisturizer that was cutting it on</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Too many chemicals.  Smells good though.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, great product.  Scent is somewhat heavier than preferred, but dissipates.</li>
            <li> Really effective, light, not greasy but a great moisturizer. I highly recommend it. Don&#x27;t need much, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Makes your face super soft! Smells like roses! Good for dry skin in the winter!!!</li>
            <li> Fades stretch marks.  Makes my dry KP skin happy, and helps clear my pores.  Absorbs more quickly than the moisturizing body oil.  Lovely results all over.</li>
            <li> The Palmer&#x27;s Skin Therapy Oil with Vitamin E Rosehip is another great Palmer&#x27;s product.  It goes on smoothly and not oily or greasy.  It absorbs quickly, makes you skin so happy (especially in the dry climate or winter) and smells great.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and am completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice scent.  The bottle / dispenser is also very convenient.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, which I apply to my face after it is cleansed and still moist with opened pores. This oil absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Light, rosy scent. Moisture lasted all day. Not too greasy. A little bit goes a long way. Definately would recommend.</li>
            <li> This works on dry skin very well and help keep my skin balanced, I got this to get rid of the lines on my neck line from sleeping. it worked for me</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, but I can&#x27;t use this oil without painful red bumps popping up everywhere. They need to reformulate.</li>
            <li> I am 8 month pregnant and I been using Palmers Formula since the beginning. My skin is great, soft and zero marks so far.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent of rosehip. I really like the way the oil gets quickly absorbed with out leaving sticky skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare, affordable beauty products that just straight up works! I rarely finish ANY bath/body product &amp; I&#x27;m almost done with my 1st bottle (had is less than 4 months). Feels &amp; smells great. Leaves skin feeling clean, hydrated, &amp; fresh! Hope they never stop making this.</li>
            <li> Advertised like it has Rosehip when bottle says &#x27;ROSEHIP FRAGRANCE&#x27;.  Unless the 7th listed ingredient ROSA CANINA SEED EXTRACT is the Rosehip.  Didn&#x27;t detect any special fragrance.  That said, Palmer does a good job on most of their products.  Using this as a plain skin oil it works.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil since I was pregnant because besides being very good and effective, does not have the smell of coconut original! the smell of coconut is not bearable for a pregnant woman but this is perfect! I&#x27;ll keep you always buying me finish</li>
            <li> Palmers&#x27;s has 2 skin therapy oils. This one, and a cocoa butter one. Somehow I thought this was was for the face, and the other for the body. Wrong. They are both for both. Only I do not care for the rose scent. I DO love how it feels on my skin and how quickly it is absorbed. It eliminated all my little dry spots. It has replaced Aveeno for me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this oil. It works extremely well without a heavy feel and a little goes a long way. I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that will not itch my sensitive skin when I apply it, and I think so far this oil is doing a pretty good job.  Sometimes I would mix it with my other lotion before applying onto my skin, and it works well, too.  Would continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> absorbs fast, simply love it!! It is a great combinations of oils, I have been looking for oils and was about to buy separate bottle , but when I saw this product, I was amazed, so happy they made it!! Use it for face and my postpartum scars.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin like my 60 year old skin too</li>
            <li> Oh, sweet mystery of life, at last I&#x27;ve found you!  My skin is incredibly sensitive and dry and for years I have searched in vain for a moisturizer that does what this oil has done in 2 short days.  I went from having red, dry skin on my face to having skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  I have tried countless moisturizers and this is the ONLY thing that works.  It soaks right in, smells good and is not greasy.  Bottom line: I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for facial use. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and still love it. I started using it because my facial skin started getting dryer last winter and I couldn&#x27;t find a moisturizer that was cutting it on it&#x27;s own.  I use this in combination with a moisturizer and it works great. My skin is soft and supple and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s ripping when I smile anymore. I also love the dewey glow I get after using this and foundation goes on and looks much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting oil on your face might sound scary, but I found that my skin adjusted and generally feels more hydrated when using this on a regular basis.  In the winter, I layer it on after the shower, after I put a toner on, then I put on my usual moisturizer (neutrogena aha daily spf 15 moisturizer).  My skin will look a little oily for a few minutes until this sinks in. Putting make-up on afterwards is a breeze and no dry flakey skin peaking through!  In the summer, I&#x27;ll use this at night a few times a week or on weekends. I find it takes longer for it to sink in and stop looking and feeling greasy when it&#x27;s more humid out, so I tend not to use it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one con I&#x27;ve found so far: f you use eyeshadow after putting oil on your face, use a primer to keep it from smearing. The oil doesn&#x27;t soak into your eyelid skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to compare this to the non-rosehip formula, the rosehip formula feels a little thicker and absorbs into your facial skin a little better then the regular formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is unbeatable when comparing this to other facial oils.  The bottle will probably last me at least a year if not longer since I usually only use it on my face.</li>
            <li> just as good as biooil and way cheaper! drys quicker too!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and although is oil it won&#x27;t leave you the oily sensation</li>
            <li> I use this on my face a couple times a week.  While it initially feels a tad oily, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin super soft.  I&#x27;ve also noticed less blemishes since using.  It only takes a little so I expect this bottle to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark. I would apply it religiously every day.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a heavier oil, disappointed in that, however it has a lovely scent.  I use it after shower as a body oil.  Feels nice and smells good on skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the way way feel on the skin after working out a massage as well.</li>
            <li> This oil is GREAT!  I love all the Palmer&#x27;s products I have used, and this is the first I&#x27;m trying this one.  It has a very nice, mild rosey fragrance.  I use it after showering on my arms and legs and if you use the appropriate amount, it absorbs quickly, leaving skin soft and not oily feeling.  I&#x27;m also noticing my scars/stretch marks are fading gradually and slightly after continued use.</li>
            <li> Heavy rose scent. Love the oil.  Hate the heavy scent</li>
            <li> nice product, surprisingly nice on skin - seems to absorb readily and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> I like this.  Don&#x27;t know what Rose hips are but I like it.</li>
            <li> First tried this product as a sampler in a sachet and was blown away by the feel and scent. Have been looking for it since then but surprisingly, couldn&#x27;t find any in ANY store. Thanks to Amazon!</li>
            <li> when I receive the item,it&#x27;s a little broken.</li>
            <li> Really helps dry skin</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face and body oil!! I&#x27;ve been bying it for years in an itty bitty 2 oz. size and now it&#x27;s available in a larger size with the Rosehips scent.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much.  Oily at first application but once it&#x27;s absorbed my skin feels so soft.  Loves the rosey smell too.  Definitely I prefer this one than the plain one.  The plain one is good for male.</li>
            <li> It has some chemical ingredients, which I don&#x27;t like.  It feels really nice going on nonetheless. The smell is ok. I like rose and it could smell more rosy in my opinion. If they could get rid of the chemicals I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product I received a sample in a magazine and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but here on Amazon.  Product leaves you soft but not greasy I use it on my face and neck every nigh I have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> If you like an aldehydic (powdery) rose fragrance, I guess you&#x27;ll like it.  I tried to return it but amazon said no, go ahead and keep it... so I did.  I use it on my lower body sometimes where I can&#x27;t smell it as much. Offer fragrance free or cocoa butter fragrance PLEASE</li>
            <li> it is more oily than I expected.  you have to rub it in awhiile.</li>
            <li> I got this to apply to my very dry skin, and on my face.  It is light and absorbs fairly quickly.  My husband took over this bottle for his dry arms, and he also likes the way it works.</li>
            <li> I scar easily from bug bites and I also have dry skin.  My arms and legs glow when I put this on.  Even though it can be  used on the face, the scent is overwhelming if applied anywhere near your nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with lotion irritating the skin on my face after a shower. A friend reccomended this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It works really well. No irritation, it&#x27;s very gentle. Nice scent, it&#x27;s not too overpowering. And it absorbs quickly and well.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in a magazine, and purchased more immediately on Amazon.  It makes my skin feel and look great, and a little bit goes a long way.  I&#x27;m really happy with this product - it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> this product smells good and thats about it. after i started using it i got a rash, i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all. i ended up dumping in down the drain,  i guess its my fault for not reading the ingredients before i used it it has canola oil in it.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I use it everywhere on my body.  It makes my skin so silky soft without that greasy feeling.  I use it on my hands, elbows, feet, arms, legs and even my face, it just made my skin silky - no more dryness.  I love it and I&#x27;ll be buying more.  Fantastic Item!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could have liked this, but my sensitive skin did not - it made me extremely itchy and created a rash. I had to stop using it.  I gave the remainder to the women&#x27;s shelter - hopefully someone there can use it.  I have no idea if it works, though, so not much help there.  Just know that if you have sensitive skin (I am a natural blonde with very light and thin skin...), it may irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this stuff!  It has helped her diminish scars and it definitely makes her skin smoother and more supple.  When she shared it with her mother and sisters, it became the most often requested &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; at the holidays ... well, right after money, I suppose.  We keep at least a couple of bottles for back up now.</li>
            <li> Love it, use it with lotion on top.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to get rid of scars on my body that I had from scratching my eczema so hard. It was either this, or the expensive Mederma. So I chose this for  the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after every shower on all my problem areas and and a couple more times throughout the days. Not even 6 months have passed and there is a huge difference already! It leaves me smelling great each time as well. I only suggest being careful how much oil you use. Too much will leave you slippery and in hot weather, oil in general will leave you slippery as well. A little goes a long way, and remember to RUB IT IN and MASSAGE it into your problem areas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have been in and out of different dermatologists, have been prescribed different pills and creams and have spent too much money on other different thick eczema creams. But this works on itches INSTANTLY! If I have an unbearable eczema itch and I rub some of this on the area, within seconds I feel NO discomfort there anymore! What a surprising relief!</li>
            <li> My favorite oil. Not oily or greasy.  Goes on smooth and leaves skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be more rose scented - it is a mixture of rose hip and cocoa butter - so smells a little odd.  Thick oil.  Good for stretch marks.  Doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly into my skin.  Was looking for something lighter.</li>
            <li> Smells great, softens great, good product.</li>
            <li> My mother swears by this for lightening age spots and scars.</li>
